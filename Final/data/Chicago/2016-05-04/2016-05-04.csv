80,2247.0,"Senior Scientist, Process Technology for WRIGLEY",Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company,4.2,10.0,"In my four years there, I had a great experience.  I loved my co workers and my managers.  Wrigely's is a great company with great benefits.Wrigley offered several opportunities to progress your competence in the field you worked in. Attended pack expo to further my knowledge of the industry.  It was well worth it.Everyone worked together and help each out out with issues that may have come up in your daily work flow.it was a very busy day from the moment you walked in the door.never a dull moment...Only now more than a decade after resigning to pursue other endeavors do I fully realize how great of a place the Wm Wrigley Jr Company really was.  I always enjoyed coming to work at their near immaculate, landmark facilities.  Our management continually made improvements which always kept our goals new and challenging.  Wrigley continually reinvested in their employees and the company never faced true economic problems during my 12 years there.  It was a great environment filled with great people. They were coworkers but many are now friends whom maintain regular contact.  In fact there are very few people who worked there for any length of time who are not contact through at least a friend of a friend.  It was always easy to work hard for a place that always provided so much.  Unfortunately Wrigley was sold, but I feel blessed that I had the opportunity to work there.best company I ever worked for!!!!  I have learned so much from this company that I can carry with me when I relocate to my new career and companyI really loved working for this company. It was a fun environment, employee appreciation was a big thing here. Benefits and salaries were outstanding. A lot of perk (lunch outing paid for by the company, free candy and gum). However one bad manager or director from outside can ruin all of that. Wrigley is really good about removing these folks but sometimes it takes too long for them to get rid of the sour apple.goals that can not be achieved. No life work balance. Very negative work environment.Great environment with great employees.  Mars has changed the culture but not in a bad way.On a daily basis I operate and trouble shoot the machinery. I believe that a person can learn something everyday. When I get to work I pull the order sheet and tell the team what we are running for the day and how much, where it is ship to or if it is staying in the factory. The hardest part of the job is repeating instructions over and over to the same person every day. The most enjoyable part is I love a challenge and everyday I am faced with a new challenge.Able to work in different environments in all of the buffalo region. It was part time work but worked great for me raising children. It was a great company to work for. I would still be their today if it wasn't for them down sizing.",,Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-05-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/b794fc0c-5ffd-415e-8e73-b64a13a6d94e?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
