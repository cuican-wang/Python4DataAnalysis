96,2263.0,Geologist,LafargeHolcim,3.9,32.0,"- Work start at 8:00 am and finished around 6:00 pm- Learned lot of things from Holcim (Lanka) LTD, like; team work, people handling, process optimization , business risk analysis and mitigate the risk,safety environment quality,- Good management team- Very supportive co-worker team- Every things is not much harder because of daily I learned new hings.Therefore job is very interesting.- Innovation idea implementation and commissioning..LafargeHolcim is a great company going through a merger. As with any merger, positions were eliminated and changes abound. There is no doubt in my mind that they will get it all lined out within a few years and be stronger then ever. Training, co-workers, and management were all top notch. Even though my position was eliminated, they were fantastic through the entire process.Since I started for a Temp agency with the possibility to be hired on full time I work just a few days shy of 9 months without benefits. I was hoping to hold a full time position with the company but after 9 months they said that my services were no longer needed due to not having enough work at the Port of Georgetown. The local management at LafargeHolcim was excellent but the companies daily operations are ever changing.   I really like the position but didn't like the fact that you could be let go at anytime.everything at my job is good, I can not say a bad thing about my job, I am ready to may a change, just to see what is out there. i have learned many job task and gained alot of work knowlege , I have ran maintance jobs , production an a daily basis, I have eight guys working for me at all times. I fill out evaluations on all my direct reports, quarterly . I have gained knowledge in controlroom to learn the process in and out, I look at power cost in kwpt. I have a great deal of time in quality control.I was on the Holcim side of the merger and we adopted the Lafarge benefits model probably because it shifts cost from the company to the employees.  Will have to apply for my current position and compete against people from Lafarge so there is currently no job security.  Lafarge's financial situation was not very good so when merger happened the outlook for meeting EBITA is bleak so bonus, for Holcim employees, will be reduced if missed altogether. More money lost.",,Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-01-21T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/dcb4eee4-8267-40a1-8007-d53b6a02bd0f?mescoid=1900265001001&jobPosition=32,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
