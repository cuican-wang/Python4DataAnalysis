I would recommend working for this company.Northwestern is great university as a whole. The school/department you work for might shift your views a little. Work/life balance was great. Management at SPS needs a lot of improvement. The most enjoyable part was having a lot of opportunities for advancement.My job and the people I work with are very enjoyable.

Quality of the working environment depends almost entirely upon who is your lab advisor. Beyond the day to day, Northwestern is a huge school that can give you as much HR stuff as you need.A typical day at work would start with a good morning greet from many co-workers, we would come a hr early to have coffee, very nice people no problems from any co-workers, I learned the great culture, met people that have worked that for 25 or more years , they was very helpful showed me all the work. Taught me how to use proper cleaning supplies,proper ways to to use a hand mop, and more. My supervisor was very nice and understand and made sure you knew your job over all i enjoy my time there because i learned new experience.I learned a ton while I was there but since my pay was based off grants it was very insecure. Work can be very satisfying if you end up in a good lab with nice people.Northwestern is an amazing place to work. It fosters a creative environment and freedom of expression. They compensate their employees well and provide good benefits. They give you a lot of latitude so you don't feel stifled. The bonus is that the campus is gorgeous. Apply!Great place to work. Nice co workers. Benefits are great, but pay is lousy. Employees are not paid fairly for their hard work, dedication to the job, or for their contributions. Management needs improving.My former boss was/is my mentor. I learned to find the news and write about it. I developed terrific relationships with the media, faculty and peers in academic medicine.1.

Every day for me is enjoyable I learned a lot and i really mean it.You'd be better off working at Whole Foods than taking the peanuts that Northwestern offers its adjunct faculty. No office, no resources, no possibility of professional advancement.Imagine working along side intelligent creative individuals of the utmost professionalism. That was every day at Northwestern University A&RT. I would donate my left kidney to work there for the rest of my life!NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY allowed their employees to go back to school. A gym membership was allowed to employees, alone with flex time. It was a family oriented work place. You feel close to all of the staff. You are able to purchase at a discount NORTHWETERN UNIVERSITY athletic team tickets for you and your family.Overall work load is high. People are very friendly here. No windows in my office.

The management could have been a little bit better. my co workers were okay to work with on a daily basis. The hardest part of my job was ensuring that the mail got delivered in a timely fashion. The enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the students.I would come to work and start setting up my line. putting the food in the right place. making sure everything was clean and I would server the student.

My most enjoyable time  on the job is serving the people. the looks on there face when they see how good my line was and how good the food look.The quality of postdoctoral positions at Northwestern University completely depends on your advisor.

94,2261.0,Postdoctoral Research Scientist - Vertebrate Paleontology,Field Museum,4.4,17.0,"The company worked well with its staff to make a good working environment. My co-workers assist me anytime I needed them.This was an awesome place to work because I got to work with actual scientific artifacts and digitization equipment. The downfall is there is zero job security.I loved being a steward of the museum. what a great privlidge! A typical day is hanging pictures in an office or locating and fixing a leak in a collections area.Management gave me the freedom to schedule my workdaysmy cohorts were all great!Hadest part of the job is working in a collections environmentmost enjoyable part of the job is all the people I got to deal with day to day.I worked in the Exhibits Department as a maintenance/production Technician.  Each day I worked on several assignments, repairing, maintaining, or cleaning different items or areas in several galleries.  I also helped with staging new temporary exhibits, or de-staging exhibits that are leaving the museum.  I worked with many other skilled co-workers.  I worked on site, or in the woodshop, where I learned many small tool skills, as well as worked with large machine tools.  I used my artistic skills as a painter, in the paint shop.  Very cool to work maintaining the animatronic characters throughout the museum.   Sometimes assignments were very challenging, but this helped me to find creative solutions, and not be afraid of any surprises.  I appreciated working at the Field, as it was an outlet for me to make use all my skills as an artist and woodshop worker, all the time.  The Museum has always been a place of learning and education for all past and future generations, and for me to be a part of this, was very fulfilling.  My only regret is that I left.This was a total educational experience for me.  I learned hands-on about the hospitality industry through catering, equipment, budget analysis and set-up requests.The Museum dedicates itself to teaching people of all ages about science. It is a fun place to work and you gain skills such as teamwork, patience, confidence, and communication. In a usual work day I would arrive early to check in and wait for early campers to be dropped off. I would check in each camper as they arrived and make sure they got to the room they needed to be in. Each week I was assigned to a different classroom as a helper and aid to the campers as they performed science experiments. There would be an outdoor break for lunch that I would supervise and sometimes work handing out snacks. At the end of the day I would make sure each child was picked up by their parent and would wait with the campers whose parents were late. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with all the children and teaching them new things about science. The hardest part was learning a sense of responsibility for so many children at once. Overall it was a wonderful first work experience that taught me many valuable skills I can apply to any jobA typical day working at the Field Museum for me is to work on the museum's main insect collection.  For me this means to identify, sort, and rehouse specimens in preparation for entry into the collection.  I have learned to identify and research the various taxonomic groups that describe insect phylogenies.Scanned items (which need identification),supply register change,assigned breaks and cleared voids.Attended work on time everyday, Liked working with the public,A typical day at work consist of working along side other internsLearned to clean archaic material. Most enjoyable part of the job is the employees.No where else on Earth can you see a 65,000,000 million year old dinosaur right next to a glowing fish or a brand new children's play lab.  This place has something for all people.There are many places to explore, interesting exhibits, fun co- workers. Meeting people from all over the world. The hardest part of the job is Inventory.Observed all exhibits visitors and Premiers, Provider detailed information.In This job people talked more then they worded. they place it all on two or three people. Co Workers talked about and started fights with each other. The Hardest part of this job was getting along with my co workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was Cleaning and staying out of troubleManament was never there to get a review, Coworkers were fun and helpful to customers. wasnt anything hard about the job. My most enjoyable p[art of the job was helping older people and i learned how to be a supervisormoves to slow. other than tht its ok. the people are great. cons have no to be not enough hours. everyday was the same thing. it was liers there just wasnt for meGreat environment if you like interacting with kids and meeting new people from different states and/or countries. Friendly, welcoming and helpful staff. I've always worked with others around me but this job gave me an opportunity to experience on my own So I've learned a great deal of closing out registers on my own, making sure each draw is properly balanced at the end of each day. Hardest part of the job is when traffic is slow. I mostly enjoy interacting with customers, getting to know where they come from, what they are interested in and how I can better assist them.",,Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-09-16T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/4cefa48a-4eb6-479a-8efc-925d7799fd7f?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=30,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
