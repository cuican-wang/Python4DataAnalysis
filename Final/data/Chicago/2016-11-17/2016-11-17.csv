40,2207.0,Senior Automation Data Scientist,Allstate Insurance Company,3.9,2900.0,"See above, work load always very heavy, employees stress levels extremely high. 2 people actually walked out after I was laid off. The hardest part of our day was prioritizing as everything was equally important.Answering phone calls for agents. Using multiple screens and systems  answering agents questions about polices and company procedures. Performance based on calls per minute and quality.I work at a good office. My hours are flexible. I will say the pay is not  the best but I do have a great Boss. He is very fare,open minded and assist all his employees when needed.Insurance isn't for everyone but it's for anyone.It is what you make it. a great way to meet people, help families, and build a career. Tough sales requirements.Every day you will start off where you ended yesterday, because there is so much work that it never stops coming or slows down.  You just jump in and get at it.  That part was great!I learned so much about insurance policies, how they cover you and also how much red tape there is as well.The management is the only part that I really have an issue with.  They do not have a backbone and will not stand up for their employees even though the employee has gone above and beyond all other employees to think outside the box to get work completed for the best outcome for our customers.A complete disregard for work completed and work that was also above the original job duty and description.  Loyalty is everything and it is hard to work for a company that is only loyal to themselves and not the employees on the front line helping to put things back together for our customers in difficult times.Also management would tell you all year long how good you are doing during mid-year or quarter reviews, but at the end of the year would come out of the wood works with the very smallest things so thy can use that against you for a pay increase.  So you would work all year thinking everything is fine and it isn't.  That is cheating and no one grows, because you have no idea what to do at that point.We sold property and casuality insurance with a focus on homeowners products. Life and Health business was referred to an outside agent.good place to grow, great customers, great team, you will need to be licensed in order to sell insurance, flexible schedule. fast pacedMy co-workers are a awesome crew of people to work with. As a team we excel and get the job done. we work together and thrive together.	Managed portfolio of over 100 insurance claims	Ensured compliance with Federal, State and local collection regulation laws at all times	Provided customer service regarding claims issues and account adjustments 	Coordinated daily interaction with clients, staff and other insurance companies  	Scheduled car inspections	Provided Administrative Support to incoming Claims Associates	Processed claims in timely mannerAt Allstate Insurance I worked as a Sales Associate. Throughout the duration of this position, I completed tasks, like providing clients with insurance quotes and quality follow up service. I, also, acted as a professional/personal assistant to the Owners and assisted with other tasks, like scheduling appointment, providing child care, and completing out of the office errands.great place to workawesome benefitsgood environmentfun peoplegood management holidays off time offno dramaloved this placeadvancement opportunitiesA typical day is text book 5 star corporate culture...I learned almost everything I know about Corporate Support at AllstateMy manager knew how to encourage and grow his employees..I was  a temp. so its really hard to rate fairly. I would just say, I would recommend it. The pay is decent. its a typical work schedule. monday - friday.Allstate has great benefits and wages. They provide extensive training and care for their employees.  The management here is friendly and fun. I really recommend Allstate as an employer.Selling insurance for Allstate is a great start but chances for advancement beyond an office management position are slim. The company needs to provide agencies a more clear cut way to identify problems with customer accounts so they can fix them on a local scale.Allstate was the best i have experienced in terms of a company actually caring about their employees. Although they couldn't satisfy everyone, they tried! I give them an applause for their efforts in trying to focus on work and life balance for their employees. Still it is a job or career path, and they have to do some things in the eyes of corporate as a business,which can at times feel a little too scripted and repetitive. Overall if you are looking for a reliable and respectable good paying job and for a company who treats their employees well, then this may be a good fit for some of you out there. Most of all, i will miss the awesome potlucks and free prize giveaways there.I love building business and new relationships.  Fast paced position that is rewarding in recognition and compensation.  I have learned that to manage a team effectively you have to be able to lead from the front.  Time manage is critical for success.  The toughest part of my job is work life balance.  I enjoy helping people.Typical day was taking order for customers. I learned excellent customer service skills and patients when i comes to dealing with difficult customers. Management was amazing I loved working with the owner I felt he was understanding and instructive. Everybody there was easy to work with and great at what they did.Not the best job, Main campus closed down so wouldn't know if Hudson will soon as well, Pretty much management was down your back at all times about stats.Family oriented, helpful, diversity. We have many employees with long term experience and tenure. I look forward to coming to work and assisting the customers as well as my fellow employeesI came in as a temp so my job position of transferring was easy. The worst thing about the job is that it isn't loyal to employees. At any given moment you could lose your job.","10,000+",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-11-17T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/d086b7b3-bfb6-4b88-9c37-b29ccbd5aa19?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
