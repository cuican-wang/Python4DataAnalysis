Processing transactions, cross selling products, maintaining account, etc.During my time there they wanted me to work outside of normal business hours without pay. I enjoyed my co-workers whole-heartedly. The management at the s wacker location was very very terrible. They had favoritism and only the ones the new management liked got promoted even though they didn't deserve it.I have never been where there was such lack of training. You were given a book and looked at it for two hours and then thrown on the phone and expected to know mortgages like a pro. You were not allowed to say ""yes mam or no sir"" to show respect as it was OLD SCHOOL. You were not allowed to give answers that could actually help someone who needed to know what programs were out there that they may qualify for like HARP. Because if they did not qualify the bank could be sued. REALLY. What a crock. You were to answer and talk on the phone no more than three minutes. If you went over that time you were talked to about the fact that someone stayed on hold. You can not always resolve someones problem in three minutes. They treated one girl horribly and then fired her because the supervisor who also got fired decided to tell stories on her and to lie to the VP to save her self from what was really happening. So no this place is not some where to be proud to say you work. Not any longer.Management needs to be able to offer more assistance and the proper training. Not enough people in each department. When other departments need help you are expected to help them and complete your own work, yet there is no help available when you fall behind.Salary is to low for MLO, the underwriters are the best in the business, everyone is helpful and team players. great group of people to work with I enjoy clearing the files to close so I can see my borrowers face it is like someone gave them a million dollars my customers service is key.I worked at MB Financial and enjoyed my time there.

Most co-workers are nice but management promotes a cut-throat environment. Management promotes treating customers horribly instead of correcting the many problems with accounts.Interaction with Senior Management and their direct reports has created relationships with one another.
