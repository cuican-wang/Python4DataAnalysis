Great benefits. A typical day at work is mainly answering calls and helping customers with their accounts, taking payments, verifying charges, opening disputes.It is a senior design. Our goal is to build a security system in order to let the users using their finger print to open the cabinet.And I am responsible for coding the program for hardware like Wi-Fi, camera and physical locker. I connected the hardware with Raspberry PI that is a series of credit card-sized single-board computers by using python library.This is a happy, clean and environment. Ongoing training, open door policy, great benefits, Lean something new each day. I love this job, this company and where I worked.I love working at Synchrony. From management to coworkers to VP of Operations everyone is amazing. I worked in the Phoenix location.Fun, cool and laid back environment as long as you do your work. Callers can be ignoring and a hand full just keep your calm and meet the metrics. Call out policy and days off are ok. Each department get different holidyas off.all ready wrote review. i said it was a great company highly favored by most people who work here very uplifting enviorment really cares about employeesI will take escalated calls and help consumers with their financial issues.  Also, help debt collectors with procedures and training.  It is a great place to work with multi opportunities to move forward.Its a good place to get your foot in the door. they promote within and provide amazing benefits. Depending on the department they can be flexible.  The pay should be higher  is one of the only issues.I was working as a contractor in synchrony financial. I have found this workplace good for the employees and contractors also.A typical day of work will start with meetings. During my tenure i learned a lot from my projects. The hardest part of the job i will say meeting the timelines.Lack of communication, managers are very secretive and misleading. No one knows what is going on, lack of priorities. Overall terrible experience.Synchrony Financial is more than just a call center. It is a place where one can start a career. I love  that everyone all the way up the the CEO was once a call center representative. This company hires within which is amazing. If you are wanting to do more they provide you with the opportunities and encouragement to do so.Synchrony Financial is a great company to work for, it is a friendly environment and great working conditions.  The company is always helping out in the community making it great for volunteer work as well.Good place to work if exempt. However, advancement chances are slim unless you're well connected with the site leader. Good office atmosphere and friendly coworkers are a plus!Work work work work and meet your numbers if not you will be wrote up. It used to have great benefits but since it changed hands they are slowly taking away benefits.Lousy place to work. A lot of code learning in a short amount of time spread over multiple platforms in comparison to embarrassing low pay. Absolutely ridiculous!!! Older people or those with disabilities treated badly!Its been about an year since I started working for Synchrony Financial. I feel myself lucky for getting an opportunity to work in this  company.From the top down everyone loves their job there and it trickles down to the bottom and really makes a difference to work in a place like that.  More companies need to adopt their culture.  Being a part time work at home rep we still feel included in every way.If you can get in with Synchrony, there is plenty of room for advancement. It is a challenging environment, but you don't feel overworked. Great benefits and wonderful culture.Discovery Place is an amazing place to work there's so much to learn and see from animals, to rainforest, and science explosions. This place is so ideal for children who love science.Excellent benefits and rate of pay.Plenty of vacation and personal/sick days.Management excels at communicating with staffExcellent training program and changes are communicated effectively",,Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-11-19T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/avp-credit-innovation-data-scientist-l11-job-chicago-il-us-174578142.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

8,2175.0,Senior Automation Data Scientist,Allstate Insurance,3.9,2900.0,"See above, work load always very heavy, employees stress levels extremely high. 2 people actually walked out after I was laid off. The hardest part of our day was prioritizing as everything was equally important.During my time at allstate I was able to perform in numerous areas such as personal lines adjuster, bodily injury claims, auto theft claims, auto appraiser, auto management and property appraiser. The company trained me in all aspects including creating an outstanding customer experience. Management provided the necessary tools and skill set I needed to perform my daily job. Allstate is extremely customer focused but at the same time, very employee focused. Allstate does a good job ensuring employees are given every opportunity to succeed. Differing opinions are encouraged. New ideas are solicited and open communication is welcomed. I enjoyed my time at allstate.Allstate was the best i have experienced in terms of a company actually caring about their employees. Although they couldn't satisfy everyone, they tried! I give them an applause for their efforts in trying to focus on work and life balance for their employees. Still it is a job or career path, and they have to do some things in the eyes of corporate as a business,which can at times feel a little too scripted and repetitive. Overall if you are looking for a reliable and respectable good paying job and for a company who treats their employees well, then this may be a good fit for some of you out there. Most of all, i will miss the awesome potlucks and free prize giveaways there.Overall, a good place to work. The last couple of years have been fraught with uncertainty. There is a definite push to outsource job functions. For an entry level position good place to start. You receive  pretty training. There are opportunities for advancement if you work hard and use the talent development tools available. The hardest part of this job was having to say goodbye to people that you've worked with for many years due to restructuring and outsourcing. What I learned is that you can accomplish anything you set your mind to if you use tools available such as networking and ensuring your manager knows what you want to achieve.Overall, Allstate is a great company at which to work. They provide a great compensation package. Allstate is a large company, with over 30,000 employees. Any company of that size, of course, has areas of opportunity, but Allstate does not run from them. They are constantly pursuing improvement. I plan to be with Allstate until I retire. They are an extremely ethical company, and they work to always be customer focused. I do feel appreciated at work, and I am consistently pushed and coached to always do the right thing for the customer.Responsible for performing clerical and administrative duties in an office setting. Assisted executive assistants and secretaries by sorting mail, filing, answering phones, greeting clients, This job allowed me to build a rapport with customers. The management and my co-workers were very encouraging and supportive of my ambitions both inside and out of work. I handled correspondence, preparing reports, maintaining office files and inventory. They are also responsible for limited bookkeeping activities, taking messages and preparing outgoing emails.Working for this company expect to be burnt out and overworked. The company only cares about productive and numbers. Only promote if they like you. If you have any college background please......stay far away from this company. The individuals that are in mgmt doesn't have any college education however are responsible for your future. If you want to work for insurance please go to Progressive or AAA...where they actually pay you a decent rate. Oh yeah you will have no personal life once you work here. Your coworkers will throw you under the bus to make themselves look better for mgmt.A typical day of work for me is driving 48 miles to work arriving 2 hours before opening to get a head start on the day.  Focus on meeting company sales goals while training new sales staff as well as holding tenured staff accountable.  Over the years I have learned how to manage multiple books of business as well as interview/hirer new staff, implement onboarding processes, train on policies/procedures for sales.I'm one of 4 individuals that runs the organization.  My title is Director of sales.The hardest part of the job is realizing that I have not further opportunity to grow or attain equity in the company after investing 10 years while helping grow the overall book of business by 45 million. The most enjoyable part of the job has been gaining wisdom of managing several small businesses while increasing my overall sales/management skills.The way this company and their offices operates the workplace is great.  The positions here allow employees to keep work in the office and not take it with us when off the clock.  It is very flexible there as far as requesting days off, days switches, vacations, etc.  The position I work in, though, is very intense--it is not an easy job; however, the compensation is what makes me continue to work as hard I have been, and strive for even better.  The job and company overall is definitely customer service driven and focused.  Having to investigate liability from a car accident, and delivering the not so good news when someone is found responsible for a loss is one of the most challenging part of this job.  Also, if you are not organized and fail to properly time manage, you will have a very hard time succeeding in this position.Thought it was a great place to work my first 6mos....but they want you to work for peanuts compared to the other insurance companies. They push more and more and more work on you and if lucky you'll get a 2-4% raise (maybe). Management changed too much for my liking and all they care about are the numbers not the employees (don't be fooled). You're sold a bunch of wooden nickels at this company, a lot of pipe dreams.... To many meetings and not enough development of employees.....I could go on and on ....only gave two stars because a few of the co workers were greatIt is a very stressful job. I have learned a lot of skills and you are critiqued on every thing you do. I have learned about production type work, developed a keen eye to search out problems. The hardest part of my day is all day, every piece of work that you touch could have the potential of being placed under scrutiny and you get dinged on minute issues. The most enjoyable part of my job was PTO and office recognition times which were far and few between.A typical day is busy handling calls and new files.  I learned all aspects of the auto insurance business.  Management is traditional and conservative.  The co-workers were the best part of the job.  The most difficult part of the job were technical issues.  There were many which delayed and frustrated employees and clients alike.  The benefits are still fairly good but diminishing yearly.I come into work and log in to my computer. First thing I do is check my email and process any service work that may need to be done. After that, I make about 200 calls throughout the day to sell insurance. I manage the staff and help them close policies and process service work for their clients as well. My co workers are great. I trained my current employer and have a great working business relationship with him and the other two guys that I work with. The hardest part of my job is trying to keep the clients at renewal.Allstate is a great place to start your career because of the flexibility of working in a smaller capacity agent. Much more room for you to go at your own pace. Good products but limited lines of business. Management can be fickle depending on the office you're in. Overall it's a good employer with a strong brand.Typical day at work is you go and sit at your desk and take anywhere from 40 - 90 calls a day assisting customers and local agents with information and changes on policies. I learned a lot of information about insurance and how the whole business is ran and how insurance works. I learned what not to do as a leader. I did learn some good leadership skills. Learned about insurance laws, Learned how to provide premium customer service. Learned the psychology behind customer service and people. Most of my co workers are awesome and great people, hard workers and very intelligent. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the stress of people calling in and yelling about premium increases and when people make mistakes. Dealing with all the corporate jargon and the company refusing to change for the better.Not amazing because the management is very low quality. Unfair hourly raises, and unprofessional sources. The most enjoyable part was time spent with coworkers and days that lunch was provided for us. The hardest part of the job was the fact that there were no new leads which carried into no new income for comission.I love building business and new relationships.  Fast paced position that is rewarding in recognition and compensation.  I have learned that to manage a team effectively you have to be able to lead from the front.  Time manage is critical for success.  The toughest part of my job is work life balance.  I enjoy helping people.a typical day at work is taking over 60 calls assisting customers with policy changes and billing questions. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to provide and effortless experience to all customers and hearing them say how much we`re appreciated. the hardest part of the job is not having any work life balance.A typical day was to have all technology functioning to perform a fantastic day of sell. Taking care of customer needs and staff needs all day and troubleshooting when necessary in order to meet expectations. At the en of the day will have end of day reports ready.Management were willing to accommodate much of our needs  and keep us inform of any new innovations or tactics to move forward.  Co-workers were very friendly and willing to cooperate with any given task.I enjoyed taking care of customer and meeting staff expectation.Administered the equitable recovery on 550 and third party administrator claims, including worker’s compensation, auto, general and product liability, integrated disability, claim administration, and risk management services nationwide.Established strategic connection with SRS claim directors and account managers to certify that data integrity remained high while reducing collection time.Communicated with claimant’s counsel to quickly resolve medical liens while preserving a high net recovery.Company experiencing growing pains. More employees need to be accountable. Compensation and benefits are above the norm. I personally traveled every week spending 3-4 nights in hotels. I would have  liked to have more contact and visits with home office.","10,000+",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-12-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/601bc48a-b1ad-43ff-b8a9-489b15eb5a01?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Great camaraderie, had great relationships with superiors as well as peers. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case.Horrible, short-sighted decisions have been made and many good people are now affected due to a massive layoff. During my last year, I saw no long-term plan or vision for future growth. They are in complete panic mode.I feel sorry for former colleagues who are still employed there.-	Organized and assisted in the creation of company spreadsheets. -	Provided assistance for many A/R and invoice processing requests.-	Assisted with procuring sales tax exemption certificates.-	Reviewed and corrected various transactions.-	Fulfilled basic department support tasks including, filing, maintenance of all A/R files/labels, and other department tasks as required and requested.Great for day to day operations, planning and supply chain execution for this $100 million international manufacturing business unit.  They focus on purchasing, category management, inventory control, forecasting, personnel, information technology and international manufacturing processes.Start-up seems to be going well and making right decisions concerning system upgrades (transitions and changes from prior company ownership).  Focus on improving bottom-line and consolidations to achieve that is occurring.People are friendly and good to work with, and environment is pleasant.  The most difficult task was getting additional responsibilities to offset an ever automated job set.I did have opportunities to learn new duties in Treasury, but never was required to complete them due to other supplemental hiring that in my mind was not needed.I did not work for Toshiba MedicalThis is a review of Toshiba International Corporation in Houston Texas.We often received comments that the office had a family feel. We had many long term employees and we all worked well together.During my 31 years in Toshiba was a exciting work every day as well as challenge where we have to use all company resources to solve problems. Also, trainings in different aspect were provided for the company in order to have a excellent team work.receiving parts / shipping / enjoyed meeting all the different delivery drivers/ / learned computer receiving /  enjoyed  coworkers / certain management / just doing my job  the best that I could.Overall, Toshiba is a good company to work with. It is daily routine manufacture operations that the employees need to deal with. The co-workers are friendly. The management is quite employee-friendly.After working in a larger corporate environment, working at Toshiba was difficult due to the minimum amount of resources available. They try to do more with less but it's hard to compete with the big boys that way.Last couple years it seemed you had to worry about layoffs.  Uncomfortable.  Benefits are good.  Pay was good.  Presently going through a huge change.  With the lawsuits, fines and cutbacks.designed electrical and wiring diagrams to customers spec. learned many skills and had a great relationship with many employeesToshiba is a good company to work for in the medical device field.  An industry leader in CT technology XRay MRI and ultrasound.  I would recommend the companyMost jobs are dead end, management is short sighted. Japanese culture corrupt.Most employees are there long time, so they just show up for work to collect a paycheck as it it were a government job, very few care about what they do or their customers.Having worked at Toshiba an excess of twenty-four years, I can still say in all honesty it is the best job I've ever had! I find it great to be on the forefront of technology, working for an OEM manufacturer. A typical day involves a variety projects, so you never get bored. Co-workers may need a bit of nudging to meet a deadline, but then everyone has their own schedule. This perhaps was one of the hardest things to learn, when confronted by a tight deadline.In the end, knowing the material I've helped to produce is being seen and read by millions on the website, and then used to make purchasing decisions---this is very satisfying.Toshiba offers a wide range of semiconductors and storage products, making us a single-source option for a number of solutions and customers. It is fun and nice to work there. You will learn a lot from 9:00 to 6:00. You will have company party every month.visit diarie new client  potencial   commmmitments analisis productstrainning certification in product new, quote monthly,compensacion.An environment for people willing to deal with strong office politics.

Sometimes worked  7 days. I loved it.Manufacturing/Cost Accounting is an environment that takes a certain individual, so be sure that you are comfortable with that environment prior to stepping into the arena.Very flexible work life balanced place to work. Constant change is always going on due to lot's of management movement. Training is not as strong as it was in the past. Lost lots of experienced employees over the past year.This was a job that needed me there every day on time, ready to make the orders that were needed for that day. We made protein bar for building muscles. some of the batches need a cure time for holding until the batch was ready. Management was tuff on making sure product would run normal on the line without any tweaks to the equitment.Management was great. The pay was good. The fellow workers were of a great help. It is kinda fast paced, but after the first hour of your shift it did die down alot.This is a great paying job for the job that you do. The office staff is great at what they do. The environment in the plant is cold as it has to be to keep the food at correct temps. So, dress warm and layer clothing.I have experience in QA, Production leader ship, leading production employees on the line. I work long hours if needed , to get job done. I fill in in defferent departments if needed,due to my experience..I lead the ff1 department in our recycle team.Could be better in some areasCould be worse in some areasGood Pay For This AreaUnionizedBenefits..Medical,Dental and Vision401KConAgra was a very large company with an incredibly diverse product portfolio.  The decision to acquire Ralcorp in order to become the major player in private brand products was ill fated; many of ConAgra's branded products competed with the private brands purchased and created a cannibalization effect.  This decision was what lead ultimately to the breakup of ConAgra and concurrent corporate reorganization,very good pay, most sections of plant are climate controlled. very clean!!Union facility, updated lunchroom, company discounts on conagra productsBurn up in the summer and freeze during the winter! Business operates day by day and management does not use common sense in decisions that affect employees. Management shows no appreciation to employees and has mentality that if you keep employees mad they will work harder! Co-workers are good to work with and job pays well for the area and benefits are average for this size company. Could be a good place to work and I really like and appreciate my job, but when you work for greedy stock holders all employees are just a number. Employees make the company money and should be treated as the greatest asset but Conagra senior management feel they are more important and they know best period!The time that I worked for ConAgra food were a very pleasant and productive work enivorment. The management department were fair to all staff and highly believed in customer rights.Nice bunch of people to work with driving distance was great learned a lot of things there packageing cans to putting ingredients together for different productscompleting daily assignments staying on task and assisting with packaging operators , ordering parts and scheduling repairs around production schedulevery hot work days and very stressful not to trust management management  just like to fire people co workers are ok stress and heat nothing enjoyableTheir were many changes over the 10 yrs, most of it good. Great opportunities to cross training in various areas of the business. Worked with many management levels on a daily basis.I loved working with ConAgra and was proud to be a part of their team. Coworkers made it fun.  I am a casualty of the move to Chicago and dismantling of the companies many brands.The hardest part of the job was waiting for the axe to fall and seeing many families affected by their job loss.the work schedule for slim jims is terrible, have to work 7days before you get any days off.  work most weekends, sucks.bakery side is not much better.  u get a schedule of what you are suppose to run each day.  you come in to work to find they have changed the days schedule.  do this on a regular basis.  it gets really old.  you have 2 maybe 3 different start times. depending on what the schedule says.  come in on one start time to find they have changed the schedule.  frustrating.Family type work atmosphere. Learning opportunities available and advancement. Management and co-workers easy to work with on a daily basis. The people are the most enjoyable part of the job.Overworked.  Good pay.  Liked the employees.  Communication was not stellar.  Boss was good but overworked too.  Generally no one was happy.  Company was bought out, laid off a lot of people and moved the headquarters.It's very hard work.Heavy lifting and working ovens and big heavy pots for mixing.  Co-workers good. Rotating shift not good. Temp. Service so if people not shoe have to work.","10,000+",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-12-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/a29b1458-302d-40bc-bdef-12533736f6a6?mescoid=1300079001001&jobPosition=7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

31,2198.0,Senior Data Scientist (IS Centers Of Excellence),"Tyson Foods, Inc.",3.7,1800.0,"Long hours, but pay is good and I had nothing but respect for my upper management, who weren't afraid to work those same long hours and then some. Some of the green hat managers weren't that good, but they eventually get weeded out. The blue hats were mostly good managers and the plant manager, production manager and 99% of upper management onsite were great people. Advancement is certainly there if you want it. A few employees there were pretty shady people, but in a plant that size that's to be expected. There were a lot of great employees as well.it was an hard job but i like the pay and hours and working on second shift it can help you get to where you want to be i like to meet new people and learn new things at tyson you learn a lot of different jobsGood paying jobFast pacedGood hours Good benefitsGood managementHard workHelpful to workersMany advancements opportunitiesNice managerFunGreat Benefitsthe people are wonderful there the pay is great the managment is good. everybody is hard working and its a clean n friendly environmentI started work there 5 years and supervisors don't listen to employee they make up ways to fire you and you have to be able to deal with gossip and ignore it, the best thing to do to stay along time is don't socialize with the employees but listen to them when it comes to your safetyI enjoyed my time working for Tyson Foods, New London, WI plant. I found that the maintenance department was very clickish and when management of the plant was faced with a difficult personnel challenge, their answer was to eliminate the problem.I enjoyed my time working at Tyson Foods. It's a good productive business. It gives you the chance to learn different things, and I also gives you the chance to be a good productive worker.Tyson Foods was a fun and fast paced place to work. I enjoyed  knowing that my work meant something. There are a lot of different cultures that work at Tyson.  It was fun learning about all of them.  For the most part, the management team was awesome.  But, there are always those few that make things difficult.  The hardest part of the job was being able to stand on your feet for long periods of time.  The first couple of weeks are a little difficult, but once you are able to get past those. It is a breeze.  The best part of the job, was the health insurance.  It was not too expensive. Plus, there are many options available.They hype it up so big as how great it is then once your in they change all the rules. nothing is ran as they say during orientation. they even go as far as to say you own your job that you bid on then even though your doing your job if you make someone else fix their error to continue your job turning out right they have a problem. quantity not quality.Love the people I worke with at my site but hate dealing with management and their tactic on things they know nothing about. Alot of micromanagement!!The job itself was easy but it didn't pay enough. It was dead end job where I would be living pay check to pay check. The job did have a lot of benefits such as good health and dental insurance.Tyson was a fun workplace, and the hours worked for my family. They had holiday meals which were nice for the employees and the work was not very difficult.  The people were fun to work with.Very interesting place you learned a lot I just don't like the long hours you couldn't leave until the jobr or  order was done for that shift. Highway package and shipped chickens to places like Boston Market and K.F.C.A typical day for me consisted of cleaning, climbing, and inspecting.  I learned a lot about handling chemicals, and factory operations.  The managements was very helpful and friendly.  My co-workers worked hard and as team to get the job done. The hardest part of the job was wearing all the equipment and climbing in to weird places. The best part of the job was the feeling of the was the feeling of transforming the building every time we came to clean.learned leader ship skills, how to operator heat presses, blenders, ovens, Fuji film packaging equipment, flatbread sheeter, data recording on sp charts. co-workers are mostly friendly and very productive. management is normally really involved with helping keep production and if members are in need of help. the hardest part is the 7 days a week. most enjoyable was the ability to learn new things and work your way up in the companyPlenty of work to do and to be done and at least 40hrs a week. Some team leaders and supervisors can and will seek to make good workers jobs harder than necessary. you only get about 2 breaks throughout a 8-10 hour work period and only a 20 minute lunch...included within the 2 breaksTyson works with you to find a good job that you can perform well and gives you opportunity to rise in the pay scale quickly. The environment if good for employees and the managment is excellent.Great  people to work with. Management  is cool too the work is easy too.  washing machines off with a pressure hose and chemicals the negative is you work everything night they pay is not bad but it ain't greatgood for job advancement manager's are good and understanding good safety practices,employees generally are helpful ,benefits are good especially for spouse and children.The pay rate is amazing here and seeing that they have their own store for fresh meat to buy is a plus. The people are helpful and don't make you feel stupid when you do something wrong.A good place to work. My job wasn't hard I had very little supervision.  The hardest part of my job was sometime the heat in my work area. I enjoyed not having to work on a production line all day.","10,000+",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-12-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/3e8e2d28-5ecc-42e2-a71d-9aaa63e62f86?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

34,2201.0,Senior Data Scientist,National Opinion Research Center (NORC),2.8,15.0,"Its a good job but it can be very boring at times. You have to complete a lot of things to basically complete your task. You repeat yourself ALOT!! NOT ENOUGH HRS OR ENOUGH PAY FOT WHAT WE GO THROUGH ON THE PHONES.In the trainings they concentrate on telling you what you should not do and punishments if you do.Regional supervisors have a reputation for being mean and most of the team managers micromanage and nickel and dime every single expense, mileage and production time.You can tell that's the way they have been trained.If you complain they just fire you and blacklist you.I love my job but this company is HORRIBLE. They condone workplace harassment and do nothing to rid the place of it. Stuff gets stolen left and right- food, cell phones, personal belongings. Most of the supervisors don't know nothing and buttkiss and blame the ti's always!! They DONT COMMUNICATE AT ALL and everyday there's a problem with something because the lack of communication!! Raises are hilarious and they only promote those who they can take advantage of or if they like you and dont speak up against wrong doings. They outkast you if you have a brain and know your rights. They love to fire pregnant women and threaten your job even if you have written notice from a doctor. The morality and ethical treatment is hilarious and because they have NONE!!!!!! And I'm pretty sure if the contractors that hire them knew how they treat their employees they would DEFINITELY FIND SOMEONE ELSE!!!!!!! The job itself awesome!! Sit down and talk and the phone all day! Easy! I've made a few good friend in thankful for (only reason they got the 3 stars) But this company DEFINITELY NEEDS to reevaluate the way they treat you!!!!!!!! Ex. They recently promoted a perverted man who makes A LOT of women uncomfortable and NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE!!!!!!!! Even with NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS!!!!! And supervisors telling this man to stop...... Lawsuit waiting to happen..... And since they are relocating now they are downsizing yet still hiring!!?????? See???? No one knows nothing and they're not letting anyone know what's going on.... No consideration at all for the employees. People have kids, bills.One of thet largest research firm in the Country.  This company is known for providing the best care for its employees.company requirements-very attractive-require employees to  treat respondents with dignity and respect-something that is certainly lacking in the work force today.The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the respondents-always learned something while in their presence.  The hardest part was when I had to leave many of the respondents  and move on to another assignment.I have no comment about the CEO of the company, considering I don't know him to state an approval or disapproval-I have selected No only because I want to exit this page.I usually come in at 9:00 am speak to several different households through out the country to determine whether they are eligible for the National Immunization Survey.  Its take about 20 to 25 minutes to complete a single interview. I collect important data from respondants so that the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, state and local health bureaus can allocate funding in areas where they are needed. Hardest part of job is building a rapport with a respondant within the first 30 seconds of the call. The management and coworkers at NORC are very nice, polite, and helpful. The most enjoyable part of the day is quitting time.They tell us we are not doing telemarketing, but however you look at it, it is telemarketing.  We are trying to make people conduct a survey against their will and no matter how many times they tell us ""no"" we continue to call them back. I try not to complain because a job is a job, but they are ridiculous.great company pays well! Management is very supportive. Best company I've ever worked forThis is a great atmosphere to work in but very strict policies on attendance and in job decorum.I worked in the TSSO department. It is essentially a big call center to collect information on behalf of government agencies. It is run like a sweat shop. There is an incredible amount of micromanagement. You have to clock to break when you step away from your station even to use the bathroom. You cannot talk to the person next to you. You cannot eat while working. You are expected to work as fast as humanly possible all the time, and statistics are taken to measure your ""production"" There is no job security and HIGH job turnover. About the bottom %10 is fired and replaced monthly. They don't want you to think. They want robots.For me this place thee pits!! I took it as a means to generate some income after being unemployed for some time but after being there for a short time I knew my time there was coming to an end. I worked as a professional telephone interviewer for minimum wage, most people you call don't want to be bothered and others can be nasty and mean. There are production goals so you have to do somewhat well and also reading verbatim is crucial. Attendance is what can get you axed but they have a system where you create your schedule and trade hours, so it is possible to pick up more hours. Some people from management are nice, but the rest seem to be angry about life! Team leads walk the call center floor to watch you which made me feel uncomfortable - you can't read anything besides your own notes and no phones are allowed on the floor-of course people do. You get 6 minutes for every hour worked and there is 4 hour shift requirement. Minimum of 16 hours for each work week is required. Not much time to do anything considering it is on the 14th and 16th floor, and it takes like 3 minutes to get to the lower level in the elevator to get food/drink.Bottom line, if you are a student and need a flexible work schedule, then this is it. If you are looking for second job, this could work.There are other opportunities for you to do other things within the company, most still require for you to be on the phone.The promises in the ads NORC puts out sure knows how to reel you in. The big problem though is that this company falls very short on the delivery. I wouldn't take their ad for face value, if you know what I mean.Don't expect much in the salary department. Their ""competitive pay"" is merely fancy wording for minimum wage. The environment is very controlled indeed, they put all of their energy in the wrong place. It seems as if management goes out of their way to see if you're committing any office crime, such as forgetting to punch time, barely overshooting on breaks or working a little too loudly(whatever that means.)Speaking of management, they are a most conflicting bunch. It seems as though the different levels of management don't communicate with each other as well as they probably should. They do not make their guidelines for call production crystal clear. In fact, it sometimes seems as if their guidelines change on any given day. As a clerk, that makes it pretty difficult to know how to do your job, know when you're on top and when you're falling flat. They do offer the chance to have a 1-on-1 sit down to go over your stats. Unfortunately that turns out to be quite unproductive, as the person you meet with usually has no idea about the role of a production clerk, meaning they can't offer much in the way of advice or answer most questions you might have.As for the actual work itself, in my opinion things can get a little tedious. There is little variety in regard to the kinds of tasks you perform; you're either on the phone, on the computer, or both. On the off-chance  more... that there is another type of task available, you can pretty much forget about being considered for it if they already have you working the phones. Plus, I really didn't see many chances for true advancement during my time there. They only seemed to offer a handful of temporary projects, and once completed, it's right back to square one.On the upside, alot of the other employees there are pretty pleasant, scheduling is quite flexible, and NORC really does have a great, easily accessible location. Just wanted to say that this was not intended as a bashing rant, so I hope it wasn't taken as such. I just wanted to try to paint a very honest picture about what kind of company this is so people would really know what they were walking into if considering employment here.  lessI worked as a field interviewer. My main duties included planning and making trips into the field and/or telephoning respondents from my home office. Initial contact with respondents was with a cold visit or cold phone call; then explaining the study, persuading respondents to participate, and conducting the interview according to protocol. Also had to follow up (either in person or by phone) with respondents who had made appointments to be interviewed, or prompt and persuade resistant respondents to participate.My direct supervisor (field manager) was very easy to work with and very helpful and supportive.Being a field interviewer in not difficult, but one must be very organized and a self-starter, since you are working independently out of your home office. You also must not be shy about making a cold call or visit; and must be articulate enough to explain the study and why a respondent should participate in it.For me, the least enjoyable part of the job--which I didn't have to do too often--was doing occasional in-person visits with another field interviewer. I'd rather work independently than to have to put up with another field interviewer's quirks.Most enjoyable aspects: working out of my home independently, being able to by and large set my own schedule, doing a variety of tasks, and doing in-person interviewing in different areas of the region where I live.For one thing these are temporary jobs not permanent. They dock you for any bathroom time over 6 minutes. I never heard of such a thing the wages are minumum and you are expected to reach a quota this is more like a sweatshop than a job. Run away from this place it not worth it.Like the office setting, not loud and friendly coworkers. I like the ability of working for different government agencies and handling different tasks like data entry and telephone interviewing and clerical tasks.Sat at a computer cold calling individuals to complete the National Immunization Survey on behalf of the CDC.",,Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/541c4074-ce4c-420a-b97a-398435dcc090?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

36,2203.0,Senior Data Scientist,"Kaplan, Inc.",3.7,972.0,"Kaplan as a for-profit university, has the right idea. As an educator they are above reproach. With a little reorganization and rethinking culture, I have no doubt Kaplan will become a top educator.I have been teaching for Kaplan for 3 years and my experience has been gradually getting worse. I have never gotten a raise or even qualified for a review despite having very good experiences with my students who seemed to like me a lot and whose scores improved. It seems to me that the company is not as concerned as it should be with keeping experienced and valuable instructors on board. In addition to the pay issue, management has been less helpful and responsive than they were when I began teaching 3 years ago.  I have also had to spend more time than necessary dealing with IT issues just to access platforms necessary to do my job. Overall, it was a good experience and I enjoyed teaching very much, but I found that the company does not adequately support its instructors and they did not reasonably review me so that I might qualify for a raise.Kaplan had great pay, good benefits, but they worked you to death!  I loved the free education that I received. Loved working with the students.The management left something to be desired, they wanted you to do your job, and anything else that you could do.  I taught 2 classes a day with approximately 24 students in each class, any assignment you gave you had 48 papers to grade!  So not just a 9-5 job!  But I loved it and still hear from my former students. Hours are long, I was usually gone from home about 12-14 hours a day.My job duties consist of redundancy and can be boring at times, however because of my fabulous coworkers, and my manager at times, we provide each other with ""commercial breaks"" by sharing an experience or a joke during different parts of the day. The best part of my job is not being responsible for anything extra when I am out of the office. It seems when you are off or on vacation, work piles up and nobody does anything for you, but with the job duties that I have, productivity is based on when you are present at work.Kaplan University is a great place to work. A typical day involves guiding students in their decisions with attaining a better future through education. I have learned that even though some roadblocks may seem insurmountable, nothing is unattainable with patience and persistence. Management is very supportive of assisting advisors with difficulties they may experience with students. Co-workers are family oriented and supportive. Everyone feels like one big family.The hardest part of my job will be when I leave to go elsewhere. I truly hate to go but I need to keep growing in my professional life and that involves relocating back to North Carolina. The most enjoyable part of the job has been working with the Difference Makers, United Way, and Browared ARC.I enjoy working for Kaplan University.  I am looking to make a career change and leave the sales industry.  The management team is excellent and they do a great job creating a positive culture.  The hardest part of my job is being held accountable to meet goals, but there are some factors to meeting goal that are out of my control. The most enjoyable part of my job is the interaction I have every day with students and prospective students.Kaplan is a place where you have the guidance you need but also the freedom to teach creatively. The senior leadership and staff are amazing to work with. This is a great place to work!Kaplan has been one of my best jobs! Secure, benefits start on the first day of employment, salary was above competitive and allowed for growth after the first 90 days depending on your production.Worked at Kaplan as an admissions advisor for over 2 years. Completed my Masters degree in Health Administration. Volunteered each qaurter with the United Way. Maintained a great work relationship with employers.Its a good company to work with, Its a great work environment and learning opportunity in the academic field. This is a great starting point for anyone who wants to pursue teaching as their full time career in the future. Great quality of students and satisfactory compensation.The company had alot of ups and downs when I was employed there. I survived 2 massive layoffs. Other than that the benefits were average and the company would have lavish Holiday parties as well as shut the company down for half a day for field trips.Good company but of course - no benefits, classes are hit or miss and no growth opportunities.  Worked at the company 10 years and no ability for full time or advancement.The salary and environment at Kaplan Are nice. Because of gainful employment and the business of Online Universities suffering, it's slowly but surely killing the business. Online schooling as a whole is suffering. Kaplan treated me well tho.Everyday you walk in the door is another opportunity to change someone's life. There is always someone not ready for change but you have to be the one who can paint the picture of hope. Everyday you learn something new that either helps you individually grow or helps build your team be more productive.not good with work life balance, they used to be really good about schedule accommodations, then they stopped that and made it impossible to get a good scheduleTwo things that are great about the job: 1) working alongside talented & driven professionals who truly take pride in their work, 2) interacting with the vast diversity of students. Everything else falls short. Teacher salaries are almost comically disproportional to the amount of time and effort put into the work. Success metrics are based purely on student reviews, which are unreliable and often biased by popularity or student temperaments. Double standards and deceptive practices pop up time to time but usually quietly dealt with. Poor to moderate benefits with little chance of career advancement -- most teachers are kept part-time due to ""budget constraints"". Keeping appearance is often more important than substance.Salary wasn't commensurate with the experience the full-time teachers brought to the job or the income Kaplan was bringing in per class taught.It a wonderful place to work.College is expensive — but not if you are employed in higher education. The tuition benefits alone are hard to beat.I was hired as a classroom instructor for Kaplan after having had experience as only a substitute teacher, and I LOVED my starting pay rate. I also really liked that I could spend as much time as needed answering emails from students, and I could log it on my timecard without being interrogated by my manager. In fact, any type of enrichment studying that I wanted to complete towards the tests I taught was always approved for pay. I liked that I could set my own schedule every month by choosing which courses to teach. Unfortunately, bad management and weird advancement standards make this company worthless for me in the long run. Though my faculty manager never actively caused issues for me, she was almost completely absent and unresponsive to any need or question I ever had. She refused to answer her phone under any circumstance, and would often take weeks to reply to my emails. Also, it was impossible for me to advance within the company, because all advancement opportunities are based entirely on student reviews -- specifically in answer to the question, ""How likely would you be to recommend Kaplan to a friend or colleague?"" A teacher's composite ""score"" for this answer from students must be astronomically high before he or she can even help grade essays. I found this not just unfair, but crippling. Overall, Kaplan is a GREAT starting point if you want to continue a career in education. Just be sure you don't stick around too long.I'm not too sure why there are complaints. One, if you don't like working on phones, don't get a job working on phones; it's laughable really. Two, yes, you are required to work hard. I can't understand why that is a negative. Three, there are soooo many positives, that it would take too long to list them here, but, a few include nice break rooms, numerous company/department gatherings and events, excellent benefits, free education through the Gift of Knowledge program, and, believe it or not, there is definitely room for advancement---as long as you push for it. Kaplan is a giant company and it's easy for mediocre people to do mediocre things there for 20 years; don't be that person. My co-workers are the best I've ever worked with. My manager is the best manager I've ever had in my 22+ year career. I think, the most enjoyable part of my job is...it's very challenging. Yes, I work hard, but I love every minute of it. Upper management do their best to disseminate information, but remember, the company is enormous; it has many moving parts. Kaplan is the type of place you could go far if you really want to; but, you could also get caught in a rut. I would definitely recommend Kaplan to other people.Kaplan was a great place to work as far as the people I worked with. I learned so much over the years. I will always be grateful for the opportunity to work there.","10,000+",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/d8a65107-8510-45b6-bdd2-71a3ef07fbad?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

38,2205.0,Lead Data Scientist,GrubHub,3.0,63.0,"Grubhub will use you and won't care. They will have you drive all over the city to restaurants 20-30 mins away and won't pay you for those miles but they make sure that the distance between the restaurant and customer is no more then 3 miles away. Your told to accept all orders and just call dispatch and have them redirect the order to someone that's closer. The problem with this is that Grubhub will still count this as a rejected order. If you don't have any other source of income then I guess you can stick with this mistreatment but if you do, stay far away from Grubhub because you will be out of a car very soon and underpaid for your work.Great company to work for. They will prepare you for your future. They give back to their employees and the staff is wonderful. More pay would be nice.GrubHub may have a great concept, delivery direct to your door from the restaurant of your liking, but they have a horrible overall platform for drivers. First, I was with the company just three days before going to, what they call, ""driver care"" for assistance. The representative on the other end of the phone was rude and malicisously didn't help me when I began questioning her reasons for being so rude. It was just a disaster of a call with no assistance for my situation.Despite that issues, I decided to give the company another chance. What a mistake! They claim to pay a minimum hourly wage if your quota is not met. But, the underlining trick to that is that your acceptance rate has to be high enough to qualify. Well, that's really not possible when you're having to reject calls that are over 30 miles away from your current position. It's a trap! This really is not a company, nor a platform I would encourage anyone to invest themselves in.The night dispatchers try sending you everywhere.... you will have like 1 hour or even 5 mins left to your shift and they will try to send you 45 mins away to another city. like really I have a life I have another job. Plus the gas and wear on your car ! If you want to keep your drivers make sure you treat them right!The CEO of GrubHub is an intolerant bigot who only caters to one political persuasion and looks to silence balanced views in the work-place.This is a very unfriendly place to work. You need to keep your head down and not stick out or else management will treat you poorly. Never express your opinion, or wear your hair in a different way, or draw attention to yourself.The office culture here will destroy your life, and stress you out.This is a grotesquely irresponsible and terrible company. The product is extremely poor and it exploits its employees and contractors.The letter from the CEO has highlighted the company culture that bleeds down from the top.It's a democracy - to threaten those who participated in the freedom of democracy is in essence blackmail and inducing fear-mongering tactics.Horrific company culture from the highest level of management. Sub par business model leads to furious customers. The CEO threatens employees saying they have to agree with his political views. I feared for my job and security.Want a low life job that makes 11.5 an hour? Go to Walmart... you won't waste a lot of gas or destroy you car while you work.  Want to waste a lot of time waiting for Restaurants to get the food ready to deliver and NOT get paid for it? If so keep reading. If you want to waste a pile of gas money driving half way across town to have that glorious oppty to wait and get paid a peanut? Well yeap you should sign up today with Grubhub... App is not reliable and minimums are a farce. Do yourself a favor and kill the curiosity about what it will be like before you waste time and money finding out that you are not your own boss and you make about or less than what you could make at Walmart or In Out burgerDay to day at grubhub is very hectic and fast paced, customers and restaurants contacted us frequently for assistance with issues or support, and I was on the phone for most of my day, operating between several systems to assist them. From there I was promoted to the finance department where I assisted in identifying and preventing fraud committed on the website. In this role I was not on phones but did email customers quite a bit to assist in fraud claims and errors with their purchases. I learned empathy and working efficiently in a fast paced and large environment and how to rely on coworkers to assist in day to day and working together to achieve an office goal and provide quality customer service.  The hardest part of the job was not getting frustrated with difficult customers and learning to walk in their shoes when solving a problem. The most enjoyable part was my co workers and satisfying customers with good service.1- App crashes almost everyday. They ask you delete the existing one and download again. 2- They send you 4-5 miles away from your location. You drive but you don't get paid for gas. They only pay for the gas you used between the restaurant and customer.  In other words (because you don't get paid until you reach the restaurant), you pay your gas expenses out of your pocket. No need to mention about car depreciation :)3- Let's say your shift is between 11 AM to 5 PM, and you don't want to accept a delivery which is created 4:57 that shows on your statement as REJECTED. Your acceptance rate goes bad. When acceptance rate is below %75 they don't contribute for min. guaranteed payment .4- New delivery order may pop up when you are on the way for delivery. You either reject or accept it otherwise you can't inform grubhub that you delivered the existing order. It sucks especially when you drive. It is like texting when you drive.Me gusto mucho este empleo muy facil tienes la oportunidad de escoger tu propio horario tienen buen salario y es un trabajo independiente.They want you to go to other side of town for delivery which you won't be compensated for.  When you refuse for too far away,  they' ll still keep sending you the same place in the future.  This wrecks your priority and acceptance rate.Explain this: Thursday you get two orders, same area, about $8-$10 tip. Friday you get three orders, very far apart, tips $13-$15 and guess what? BOTH MADE $21. You tell me if that's fair or not. Both days are same pay!!! OK, $0.86 difference. Really?Miles I drove probably was 10+ mikes, only considered over all is about 4 miles. They also don't pay you for attempting to deliver an order, picked up food, arrived at destination and customer cancels. No pay, plus you need to get permission to click delivered? Not only I wasn't paid twice for a delivery I already picked up, but I drove far for them and NOTHING. Company doesn't value their drivers, pay sucks on top of that they want you to extend your hours, ask why it's not delivered yet? Umm it's rush hour, traffic!!Company makes billions just like Insta Cart and paying their employees $1,lmao. GH makes around that amount, yet we get scrap money while the office people make money off of us. So, if you work for GH, just take it easy and don't worry about the office and their bs needs and rules. Just respect the customer and enjoy the drive till you leave the company. Don't drive your new car for this job, get a second older car to beat.Grubhub is a wonderful company to work for.  Very diverse, very friendly. Great pay, benefits. Triple pay on holidays. Contests & monthly bonuses is a plus.When I started working with GrubHub it was awesome: lots of hours, flexible, fun. Now GOOD LUCK if you can get a shift. There were probably 40 people in my area, now it's probably double or triple that so shifts are hard to get since they are first come first serve. Also, if you're lucky enough to get a shift or two, one may suddenly disappear leaving you with no work or money. If do work a shift, they will most likely short pay you. Don't get two shifts in one day, you wont get paid for the full hours worked. Oh and if you ever have any problems regarding shifts or pay, tough luck. They tell you to email them and when they finally get back to you a week or two later (if at all), they will just have a copied & pasted response for you. Worst, most unorganized & unprofessional company ever!GRUBHUB IS A COMPLETE rip-off. I work with this company for 6-months. The first month, I was paid $10.00 HR. The following month this company sent out emails to everyone in regards to pay decrease to $9.00 hr. The pay is now $9.00 hour for every state. Delivery radius was no more than 3 mile. I delivered a cheeseburger and a diet coke 26-miles from the restaurant. Grub hub is just taking advantage of the drivers. Grub hub is trying to make all the money on the delivery driver expense. Grub hub will call you to pick up a order over 20-miles away. You will not get paid for the miles going to the restaurant. You only get paid from the restaurant to the customers house that maybe 6 blocks away. GRUBHUB is not a dependable company for work. Recently grubhub had over 20 drivers on the clock for the entire week. Lots of drivers drive full time to pay there bills. Grubhub took everyones hours for the week. Lots of people left or didn't trust this company anymore. Every week they want you to fight for blocks for hours. You are a independent contractor 1099 at the end of the year. I got paid $360 for one week. My Gas was $200 for that week. I only made $160 for the week. Lots of wear and tear on your car. Grub Hub has lots of bad reviews! Don't be a victimFun job to work, you choose your own time and you use your own car. shifts consist of three hours per shifts. Shifts start at 11:00 and the latest you can take is 9. Depending on where your located, your area can be busy or slow. The hardest part of the job has to be just finding where people live in apartments, it's like wheres waldo.First of all, understandably, you do not want me to receive this $9/h for doing nothing so you will ensure I receive a delivery once an hour with no regard for my cars mileage.If I do not accept this delivery that can be twenty five to thirty minutes away, my acceptance rate and priority as an employee goes down. It is VERY hard to see even a penny of that promised $9. I have never seen one. Grubhub; if I'm doing nothing, I expect nothing. I also expect to be able to clock in on any day. And as an independent contractor, I should be able to. If the problem is people clocking out at peak times, perhaps you can keep acceptance rate based on reliability.The $9/h if you do not receive a delivery system throws a wrench in everything. I would rather get deliveries that make sense and are relatively close. Also these deliveries make other deliveries late as it pulls me into another drivers usual area.Great place to work very friendly environment and helpful. awesome schedules laid back work environment. Just an amazing place to work and the pay is awesome way better than most jobs.","501 to 1,000",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/2c3c6e73-3790-45f7-938c-18c01624d89e?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

40,2207.0,Senior Automation Data Scientist,Allstate Insurance Company,3.9,2900.0,"See above, work load always very heavy, employees stress levels extremely high. 2 people actually walked out after I was laid off. The hardest part of our day was prioritizing as everything was equally important.Answering phone calls for agents. Using multiple screens and systems  answering agents questions about polices and company procedures. Performance based on calls per minute and quality.I work at a good office. My hours are flexible. I will say the pay is not  the best but I do have a great Boss. He is very fare,open minded and assist all his employees when needed.Insurance isn't for everyone but it's for anyone.It is what you make it. a great way to meet people, help families, and build a career. Tough sales requirements.Every day you will start off where you ended yesterday, because there is so much work that it never stops coming or slows down.  You just jump in and get at it.  That part was great!I learned so much about insurance policies, how they cover you and also how much red tape there is as well.The management is the only part that I really have an issue with.  They do not have a backbone and will not stand up for their employees even though the employee has gone above and beyond all other employees to think outside the box to get work completed for the best outcome for our customers.A complete disregard for work completed and work that was also above the original job duty and description.  Loyalty is everything and it is hard to work for a company that is only loyal to themselves and not the employees on the front line helping to put things back together for our customers in difficult times.Also management would tell you all year long how good you are doing during mid-year or quarter reviews, but at the end of the year would come out of the wood works with the very smallest things so thy can use that against you for a pay increase.  So you would work all year thinking everything is fine and it isn't.  That is cheating and no one grows, because you have no idea what to do at that point.We sold property and casuality insurance with a focus on homeowners products. Life and Health business was referred to an outside agent.good place to grow, great customers, great team, you will need to be licensed in order to sell insurance, flexible schedule. fast pacedMy co-workers are a awesome crew of people to work with.

Throughout the duration of this position, I completed tasks, like providing clients with insurance quotes and quality follow up service. I, also, acted as a professional/personal assistant to the Owners and assisted with other tasks, like scheduling appointment, providing child care, and completing out of the office errands.great place to workawesome benefitsgood environmentfun peoplegood management holidays off time offno dramaloved this placeadvancement opportunitiesA typical day is text book 5 star corporate culture...I learned almost everything I know about Corporate Support at AllstateMy manager knew how to encourage and grow his employees..I was  a temp. so its really hard to rate fairly. I would just say, I would recommend it. The pay is decent. its a typical work schedule. monday - friday.Allstate has great benefits and wages. They provide extensive training and care for their employees.  The management here is friendly and fun. I really recommend Allstate as an employer.Selling insurance for Allstate is a great start but chances for advancement beyond an office management position are slim. The company needs to provide agencies a more clear cut way to identify problems with customer accounts so they can fix them on a local scale.Allstate was the best i have experienced in terms of a company actually caring about their employees. Although they couldn't satisfy everyone, they tried! I give them an applause for their efforts in trying to focus on work and life balance for their employees. Still it is a job or career path, and they have to do some things in the eyes of corporate as a business,which can at times feel a little too scripted and repetitive. Overall if you are looking for a reliable and respectable good paying job and for a company who treats their employees well, then this may be a good fit for some of you out there. Most of all, i will miss the awesome potlucks and free prize giveaways there.I love building business and new relationships.  Fast paced position that is rewarding in recognition and compensation.  I have learned that to manage a team effectively you have to be able to lead from the front.  Time manage is critical for success.  The toughest part of my job is work life balance.  I enjoy helping people.Typical day was taking order for customers. I learned excellent customer service skills and patients when i comes to dealing with difficult customers. Management was amazing I loved working with the owner I felt he was understanding and instructive. Everybody there was easy to work with and great at what they did.Not the best job, Main campus closed down so wouldn't know if Hudson will soon as well, Pretty much management was down your back at all times about stats.Family oriented, helpful, diversity. We have many employees with long term experience and tenure. I look forward to coming to work and assisting the customers as well as my fellow employeesI came in as a temp so my job position of transferring was easy.

41,2208.0,Senior Data Scientist,Kaplan Test Prep,3.7,972.0,"Kaplan as a for-profit university, has the right idea. As an educator they are above reproach. With a little reorganization and rethinking culture, I have no doubt Kaplan will become a top educator.I have been teaching for Kaplan for 3 years and my experience has been gradually getting worse. I have never gotten a raise or even qualified for a review despite having very good experiences with my students who seemed to like me a lot and whose scores improved. It seems to me that the company is not as concerned as it should be with keeping experienced and valuable instructors on board. In addition to the pay issue, management has been less helpful and responsive than they were when I began teaching 3 years ago.  I have also had to spend more time than necessary dealing with IT issues just to access platforms necessary to do my job. Overall, it was a good experience and I enjoyed teaching very much, but I found that the company does not adequately support its instructors and they did not reasonably review me so that I might qualify for a raise.Kaplan had great pay, good benefits, but they worked you to death!  I loved the free education that I received. Loved working with the students.The management left something to be desired, they wanted you to do your job, and anything else that you could do.  I taught 2 classes a day with approximately 24 students in each class, any assignment you gave you had 48 papers to grade!  So not just a 9-5 job!  But I loved it and still hear from my former students. Hours are long, I was usually gone from home about 12-14 hours a day.I enjoy working for Kaplan University.  I am looking to make a career change and leave the sales industry.  The management team is excellent and they do a great job creating a positive culture.  The hardest part of my job is being held accountable to meet goals, but there are some factors to meeting goal that are out of my control. The most enjoyable part of my job is the interaction I have every day with students and prospective students.Kaplan University is a great place to work. A typical day involves guiding students in their decisions with attaining a better future through education. I have learned that even though some roadblocks may seem insurmountable, nothing is unattainable with patience and persistence. Management is very supportive of assisting advisors with difficulties they may experience with students. Co-workers are family oriented and supportive. Everyone feels like one big family.The hardest part of my job will be when I leave to go elsewhere. I truly hate to go but I need to keep growing in my professional life and that involves relocating back to North Carolina. The most enjoyable part of the job has been working with the Difference Makers, United Way, and Browared ARC.Kaplan has been one of my best jobs! Secure, benefits start on the first day of employment, salary was above competitive and allowed for growth after the first 90 days depending on your production.Lead generation, lead outreach and interviewing prospective students. Could have provided better opportunities for advancement with more qualified management individuals.Good company but of course - no benefits, classes are hit or miss and no growth opportunities.  Worked at the company 10 years and no ability for full time or advancement.I'm not too sure why there are complaints. One, if you don't like working on phones, don't get a job working on phones; it's laughable really. Two, yes, you are required to work hard. I can't understand why that is a negative. Three, there are soooo many positives, that it would take too long to list them here, but, a few include nice break rooms, numerous company/department gatherings and events, excellent benefits, free education through the Gift of Knowledge program, and, believe it or not, there is definitely room for advancement---as long as you push for it. Kaplan is a giant company and it's easy for mediocre people to do mediocre things there for 20 years; don't be that person. My co-workers are the best I've ever worked with. My manager is the best manager I've ever had in my 22+ year career. I think, the most enjoyable part of my job is...it's very challenging. Yes, I work hard, but I love every minute of it. Upper management do their best to disseminate information, but remember, the company is enormous; it has many moving parts. Kaplan is the type of place you could go far if you really want to; but, you could also get caught in a rut. I would definitely recommend Kaplan to other people.I was hired as a classroom instructor for Kaplan after having had experience as only a substitute teacher, and I LOVED my starting pay rate. I also really liked that I could spend as much time as needed answering emails from students, and I could log it on my timecard without being interrogated by my manager. In fact, any type of enrichment studying that I wanted to complete towards the tests I taught was always approved for pay. I liked that I could set my own schedule every month by choosing which courses to teach. Unfortunately, bad management and weird advancement standards make this company worthless for me in the long run. Though my faculty manager never actively caused issues for me, she was almost completely absent and unresponsive to any need or question I ever had. She refused to answer her phone under any circumstance, and would often take weeks to reply to my emails. Also, it was impossible for me to advance within the company, because all advancement opportunities are based entirely on student reviews -- specifically in answer to the question, ""How likely would you be to recommend Kaplan to a friend or colleague?"" A teacher's composite ""score"" for this answer from students must be astronomically high before he or she can even help grade essays. I found this not just unfair, but crippling. Overall, Kaplan is a GREAT starting point if you want to continue a career in education. Just be sure you don't stick around too long.I love this company, there is a culture of support and embracing of change.  I work from home, with a flexible schedule where I can take 2 hours for lunch or to go to a doctor appointment and my manager doesn't even want to know, as long as I've addressed issues and taken care of my day to day responsibilities.I've learned that I am an awesome employee.  Through the care and appreciation of management, I have gained confidence in my skills and I am ready to move on to greater things.I thought the best part of my job was being at home an not being around people in an office, and I truly miss it, it has become a very hard part of my job not seeing my wonderful co-workers in person.My co-workers are the best I've ever worked with.The satisfaction of helping students and knowing at the end of the day I've made a difference.Its a good company to work with, Its a great work environment and learning opportunity in the academic field. This is a great starting point for anyone who wants to pursue teaching as their full time career in the future. Great quality of students and satisfactory compensation.The organization grew too fast and too much for the infrastructure and management to handle resulting in many missed opportunities, high turn-over rate, and fragile job security.My job duties consist of redundancy and can be boring at times, however because of my fabulous coworkers, and my manager at times, we provide each other with ""commercial breaks"" by sharing an experience or a joke during different parts of the day. The best part of my job is not being responsible for anything extra when I am out of the office. It seems when you are off or on vacation, work piles up and nobody does anything for you, but with the job duties that I have, productivity is based on when you are present at work.Admissions at Kaplan University provides little to no job security. Even worse, management plays favorites according to who is liked/disliked by them.Great ManagementBright Office SpaceSolid Team CamaraderieCreative Co-WorkersFostering of New IdeasExcellent Atmosphere with a Fun Work/Life Balancenot good with work life balance, they used to be really good about schedule accommodations, then they stopped that and made it impossible to get a good scheduleTwo things that are great about the job: 1) working alongside talented & driven professionals who truly take pride in their work, 2) interacting with the vast diversity of students. Everything else falls short. Teacher salaries are almost comically disproportional to the amount of time and effort put into the work. Success metrics are based purely on student reviews, which are unreliable and often biased by popularity or student temperaments. Double standards and deceptive practices pop up time to time but usually quietly dealt with. Poor to moderate benefits with little chance of career advancement -- most teachers are kept part-time due to ""budget constraints"". Keeping appearance is often more important than substance.I would like to say that I was able to assist with many roles but only because the management group in place at the time were not well equipped with HR abilities and assistance.  The Associate Directors and Directors were allowing their managers to write and rewrite Job Descriptions as well as make changes to the benefit only of that Director.  When we were required to meet new demands without proper notification or training to do the job, management would not support the employeeKaplan offers employees the opportunity to gain valuable experience within their specialized field. My employment at Kaplan allowed me to gain experience in digital and social media marketing as well as, video content development and editing. Top-level management was knowledgable and well-respected within the organization. I also had the good fortune to work with an outstanding group of individuals that help support our marketing efforts.The most difficult aspect of my job at Kaplan is working through projects that are delayed by multiple layers of approval. This often results is missed opportunities and revenue.The best part of my experience at Kaplan has been the opportunity to work with talented, dedicated individuals and the opportunity to gain new experience and learn, perfect new skills.In a typical day I greet the student, make sure she has breakfast food she can prepare for herself.I learn a lot about different cultures and customs from the students.The management has turned over so much I don't know any of them very well.I have no co-workers.The hardest part of the job is living on display.The most enjoyable part of this job is building the relationship.","10,000+",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-11-16T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/da13b91b-73a2-4db5-9340-181c5e330daf?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

43,2210.0,Data Scientist-(0082529),Conversant,3.8,8.0,"Conversant is full of smart people and smart products. While the digital media space has become cluttered, fragmented suppliers will consolidate, joining Conversant as one of a handful of true premium addressable digital media companies.I learned a lot while working here and am ready to take my skills into the sales industry. I have supported various Account Executives here with all pre-sales support and planning.From it's origins the company was a ""meritocracy"" - it rewards employees that excel at their work.  People that are just looking for a place to sit and get a salary, however, also end up here - though most of them end up leaving (both of their own accord and asked to leave).  Management listens for the most part and compensation is competitive, but perhaps not as much for early careerists.Great company culture. Great/smart associates. Benefits are very competitive with a 5% match on 401k. Room for growth in many of the positions within the business.Fun work Place with supportive management. Excellent co workers, great working hours and vacation time. Plenty of room to learn and move to other departments.Conversant (then known as ValueClick) bought Dotomi a few years ago. Not long after the Dotomi CEO became the ValueClick CEO after the then-current CEO retired. Dotomi and the new CEO were based in Chicago so the new guy decides that everything is better in Chicago so slowly makes Chicago the center of the merged company's universe. More people in Chicago. More promotions in Chicago. Decision making moved to Chicago. Technical leadership now coming out of Chicago. Why? Because Chicago. Maybe working in Chicago it's great but for the rest of us, it blows. We're being ignored and marginalized so all we see is a complete lack of, or incompetent leadership.I love my job at Conversant -- it's very different from my previous research jobs in many good ways.A typical day of work involves lots of free tea and coffee; meetings with friendly, engaging coworkers; planning sessions and discussions with my manager; a few hours of programming; and a lot of creativity and innovation.I've learned a lot about the media/marketing/advertising industry and increased my technical skills in SQL database programming, R programming, predictive modeling, and analysis techniques.The management here is the best I've encountered.  My manager tends to be more of a coach or academic advisor than a boss, and I never feel micromanaged.Similarly, my co-workers seem engaged, energetic, interesting, and fun -- it is a pleasure to come in to work each day to work with these friends.The hardest part of the job are the demands to be better and faster than the competition, which is no easy task in the past paced advertising tech industry.  Sometimes I may have to work overtime to keep up with projects, but because I enjoy my job I don't mind this too much.The most enjoyable part of my job is having the ability to invent and innovate.  I am happy to work on projects because I know my work will be used, not thrown away (in my previous job I worked on several projects that stalled, failed, or were canceled, and this was quite frustrating).",,Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-11-09T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/1c8f7a3e-49c6-4279-848b-e84ad9f49c41?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

48,2215.0,Data Scientist,NCSA Athletic Recruiting,3.6,14.0,"But for many it can be a great place to start. I wouldnt go there from another job though. The pay is low but the job is pleasant and the culture is goodMisleading job. I learned that it is a call center to recruit kids into using tools with little to no direction. Monitored through a microscope with Talk time counter, number of calls, and meetings set. Hardest part of the job was getting 3k cut from my salary in the first month in exchange for the *opportunity* to work 5 extra hours a week for a 45 hour work week.It wasn't mandatory, according to management, but if you didn't work a weekend you would have to meet with your supervisor Monday on why you didn't come in. I learned to really explore and ask current employees feedback on the job. It was a very sugar coated interview that I was blinded in coming out of college. They recruit you with the fun enjoyable laid back lifestyle of talking sports all day but its far from it.Awesome company that has a fantastic culture. Great Co-workers who truly care about helping Student Athletes not only get to College but help them understand the recruitment process.NCSA is a great place to work! At times your day can be repetitive, but its an overall great job to talk sports all day and being around a great culture of coworkers that have the same competitive nature as you. The Managers are always there to help and get you better as well as NCSA's VP'sFun place to work great experience in sales and lead generating. Pursued other opportunities that were more long term.HIgh energy, fast pace and good people. You will enjoy working here if you like working with sports minded people. one of the coolest work environments.8 hour day, sometimes weekends, they stress goals. great people. fun environment to work in, potential to make good money, this was a great stepping stone.Company was just bought out by a larger corporation and has totally changed the direction of the company and the way it's run.A typical day at work was making roughly 60 phone calls to parents of high school student-athletes.  I would find out if they're son or daughter it interested in playing their sport at the collegiate level and if so, needed to find out if they were qualified. I needed to sell them on using our network of college coaches to help their student-athlete to make that jump to the next level.  I improved immensely with speaking on the phone and learned what it takes to make sales calls.  Management was very nice and pushed us to get the job done.  My co-workers were great people to talk to and hang out with.  The hardest part of the job when talking with parents who were very skeptical about the network.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting that parent to agree to use the network and moving them forward.Very competitive culture and opportunity to make a lot of money as a top performerI gained a lot of customer service experience working at NCSA. I was on the phone with clients answering questions all day and that was very good to get experience in. It was a very laid-back atmosphere and the co-workers were great. The most enjoyable part of the job was that you got to talk sports all day.Too focused on sales and not other needed functions to build a career aroundManagement is not focused on growth of employeesVery comfortable environment to work in. Most people are around mid twenties. Very laid back people who all played sports in college. Start the day off by reviewing meeting that were set up the night before, responding to e-mails and voicemails, confirm meetings for the upcoming night. After doing morning duties, start reaching out to families and evaluating student athletes. My co-workers are very easy to get a long with and come from the same background as myself. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping out families and giving student athletes the opportunity to play sports at the collegiate level.",,Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-10-21T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/d5a9cd80-6831-4a0f-add4-577ecb1deadc?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
49,2216.0,Computer Vision Data Scientist,CCC Information Services Inc.,3.7,29.0,"Typical day at CCC was mostly meetings. There never was one day where there wasn't at least one meeting. A lot of conversations with the client mostly were on the phone but some of our customers would require an actual sales person to be on site for any troubleshooting reasons.The work culture and the environment are the best places to grow, and CCC is a fantastic place to work in. The people are very open to new ideas and are willing to grow.this company has seen better days. the current management in products and technology has become highly political. Each senior management person has certain favorites who would get all the promotions, increments and most part of the bonuses. A senior would not listen to a junior. quality and competency of work does not matter until you would do what ever they ask you to do. Developer does business analysis, Business analysts does only testing and documentation and no real business analysis. Development managers in Products development does release management and quick fixes. it is a chaos.The company really seems to put the people first.  The management really wants to help you to work in the field you want to.  Co-workers are always friendly.  The office politics can sometimes seem overbearing but seem less of an issue here then other companies.  Advancement seems to be a more of a groomed approach which sometimes makes it feel like they play favorites but I have learned it's because they actively worked towards it, as I began to experience as I move into my career.With the support of management, I was able to advance my career and was able to personally grow and develop. The most enjoyable part of my job was the relationships I made with my colleagues, customers and vendors. I had worked a long span and saw it go from a successful private company to a dynamic public company.Great training, easy to contact someone if you run into a problem. They are very willing to help you at anytime. The reps are helping use with learning about cars that are now making it to the lots. If we find something different we can ask about the items to make sure we count the items. Management comes out about every 4 months to do evaluations of our work, Do we miss some items. I was missing the two glass tips that open on some BMW's and Mini Coopers. Will not miss them any more.Company is successful despite itself and lacks heart and soul. It is hardly an inclusive culture and priotitization for any sort of employee development has been a challenge for a great number of years.Many great people to work with and the company pays well for its talent. Chicago and California offices are highly modern and help create a pleasing environment.In twenty years of working at half a dozen different companies, I would rank CCC as the least supportive and least enjoyable. There are far better employers to devote your precious time and energy to if you want to grow as a human being and professional, individual contributor.I spent a great deal of time interviewing with CCC for a management position in the Northeast, despite some unusual qualifications for the position, and compensation that was minimally acceptable.They had recently hired someone who had not worked out, and it seemed they wanted to be very careful (maybe interview for a few more rounds for CYA reasons).After not asking during the interview, the interviewer expressed his concerns about my persistance as I was leaving, and althought that was helpful to know, it was nothing close to the truth. He should have asked.  I thought he already found the person he wanted to hire, but the ad ran a few more times in a few more places, so evidently that wasn't the case.To CCC and all the other ""serial interviewer"" companies out there- please don't waste our time for your political or tax break needs. Some say they can't find exactly the right person, which in this economy (and this type of position), is ludicrous.CCC has gone down hill over the years as far as employee treatment, they have taken the corporate approach to their employees where you are treated like a number more than a person. They are a small company but have their head in the corporate clouds as far treatment, the work/life balance is nonexistent and getting time off is a battle unless you know 6-10 months in advance what days you need off. Phone reps are put at a impossible adherence standard of 98%, that equals 8 minutes off the phone a day for working other projects they assign as well as bathroom breaks (industry standard is 90-95% or 45-23 minutes a day, source:Google) I have personally witnessed long term 10 year + employees fired a day before Christmas for minor under performing on stats, how heartless is a company to do that to someone who has planned their life around the company and to do it right before Xmas, at least have the decency to wait until the holiday passes for such a minor infraction but like i said its turned to such a corporate mentality that they will trim the fat anywhere needed anytime to make the books with little to no regard for employee well being.As far as the good aspects of the job, the pay was decent to slightly above normal, the benefits where priced realistically compared similar jobs. Location is downtown. (be prepaired to pay for your own parking $60-90 a month) Off the phone employees are treated slightly better.while this job pays well and provides good milage, I lack the hours needed to make this my main career. there are only 7 managers throughout the entire country making advancement very difficultCompany is successful, not because of the products but because of the monopoly they hold with the insurance industry (which eventually will change as they cannot even support their current base appropriately). Their technology runs on technology a decade old. Innovation here does not occur and it's hardly a culture where someone can grow in or evolve in.In the past 15 years of working at several companies as either a consultant or employee, I would rank CCC, along with it's executive team in IT the least innovative, least enjoyable, and least performing out of any company I have ever worked for.If you are offered a job or interview and are ALREADY at a good company or somewhere that you can be for a couple more months/years, do not leave your current place as that would just be a bad move. It would be a career mistake and career sabotage to put yourself into a career at CCCIS.Company has gone through layoffs many times and continues to utilize layoffs and budget cuts to make topline growth requirements. Which means that license purchases, are not accounted for , innovation and purchases are limited, and come close to failure monthly with violating customer SLA's and also potential data/DR risk. Management and recruiters will lie to you to get you in. Once you start you will hear about all the red flags (from your own managers/coworkers as they too hate the company they work for and past leadership/employees who fled this company because of it's inefficiency, unethical behavior, inability to be innovative, etc. I would only recommend this company if you REALLY  more... need a job temporarily and you need to find something better and this is your only choice.  lessThey have good people here and they are working hard to make improvements. The hours are long and demands for your time reach into all hours day or night and weekends. There are lot of production issues and issues in other non-prod environments. However, they are working towards making improvements and have gotten better then where they were before.Good learning and worked on hadoop  ecosystems like pig, hive,sqoop,cassandra,design,coding,unit testing and oozie workflow scripts,shell scriptsEnjoyed the time that I worked at CCC learned a lot of new things. The people are very friendly.  I meet a lot of great people.Worked my way up in this fast paced and exciting time for companies rapid expansion. The environment was vibrant and a fair place to work.they are always looking for the cheaper employee and have no loyalty towards there employees. Middle management and most directors do not listen the the people they should  and just do what they want anyway.Don't waste your time with this company. Management has no clue. Communication does not exist. New employees are not welcomed and left to figure it out on their own.Allowed to advance into all areas of IT. Supportive management and grat environment to work in.Managed the day to day Human Resources needs of the business. This included recruiting, management development, and employee relations.Always re-structuring but great benefits and challenging workWorking here was wonderful, the management in Sioux falls was amazing.","1,001 to 5,000",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-10-19T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/47aab124-347b-4e04-bc91-419a50ff0904?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=19,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

All these actions were informative to me. Management was friendly and professional.The same with co-workers.The job culture was professional.The typical work day for an employee is 10-11 hours. If you put in your 8 hours and then leave, you're a ""lazy"" employee. It's a high-stress environment every day. Managers are very good at committing to unreasonable goals and tasks - especially because all they have to do is commit and not actually follow through with them. There is no work-life balance - no matter what they try to tell you when they hire you on. They do invest a lot of time and money to train employees and teach them all they need to know. To me, this doesn't compensate for all of the other negatives of this company.Many opportunities in a wide range of fields.  Good work life balance.  Job security is average to low.  Most of the people are good to work with. Mangement focus can be a little bit short term. Compensation is good. Vacation policy is good.This reviewer worked as a temp and due to a labor depute was not retained. I was however offered a position later that due to health issues at the time i was not able to take. Management seemed very open to work with me when I had a family emergency arise even though I was just a temp.

Great family based company that takes care of their employees.Was a pleasure working at this company.This is a large company but individuals have high visibility and ownership. Work life balance is pretty good but can depend on the manager. It's important to be able to be able to sell your opinion because every organization is very metric driven and they do not always line up with each other.

It was a great job to start my professional career and I enjoyed being a part of an audit team and learning about the ins and outs of different businesses. The hours were very long during busy season which included 10 hour weekdays and weekend hours from the months of December to April, but I learned a great deal in just the first year.

The environment was a little too cut-throat for me and I did not see myself working there long-term.I would recommend anyone I know to work for KPMG. It's a wonderful work environment, especially for people just out of college.While there are plenty of opportunities to advance within the company, it should be noted that it can be difficult to actually advance due to the size of the company. I.E. an individual would have to stick out for them to be really noticed.Good to place to refine skills, diverse set of clients, dedicated colleagues. Little direction sometimes from leadership if not on project.Excellent work place to begin your accountant career. Management very professional and co-workers as well. The most enjoyable working is the exposure and knowledge you can encounter and the diversity of industries you work with.If you have an appetite to learn, this is the onea place that can feed it! The info, direction and level of learning is controlled by you, and you can either curb yourself to one area, or broaden your horizons on any area of interest to you...KPMG was a wonderful place to start my career because the firm offered a lot of training for Audit and Forensic. Also, KPMG had wonderful senior associates, managers, etc. who wanted me to succeed and helped me to succeed along the way.The culture in KPMG is like that of a family. Everyone works hard and tries to help build each other up. Their intern training program is very comprehensive. In addition to performing associate-level work, I was also assigned special tax research and presentation skills to supplement my professional education. My only problem is the lack of work life balance. Outside of work, I found that I didn't have the energy to do anything other than lounge around the house.Overall job culture is demeaning, demoralizing, and discriminates against individuals over 30 years of age unless entering the firm as a manager or higher.I really enjoyed externing at KPMG.  The accounting team I worked with were wonderful and gave great insight for my future career in accountancyGood accommodating culture. All depends on your relationship with Managing Directors and partners. Gentler of the big four.KPMG is one of the big four international accounting firms and staffs around 175,000 people.  I had a great working experience at KPMG.  I have nothing but all great things to say.  Everybody was nice, helpful, friendly, professional, and understanding.  I won't mind working for KPMG again.it was really big company. work there was pretty boring, and people were leaving all the time. the work life balance here was not so good. we worked over time all the time without the right pay.New management brought in.  Entire office went down hill.  Moral was very low.  No team spirit, no fun, no respect.  Felt like I was in the military under a drill sergeants command.Working for KPMG was a great experience. Long hours are a given and the work is interesting. KPMG has a great summer internship program.KPMG is like most audit firms: client focused with some busy deadline periods. I like the culture and the people that this company attracts are what makes it pleasant to work here.KPMG Nigeria was an amazing company to intern with over the summer, the organizational culture of the company is well structured and makes one feel at home right away. I interned for three months, and I wish I could have interned for a longer amount of time, but I had to get back to school. My co-workers were very friendly and treated me with the same respect that they would treat full-time employees. The way the offices were structured allowed for the smooth interaction between supervisors and subordinates. They had an open door policy which allowed easy accessibility to all individuals throughout the company. They also advocated to avoid saying ""sir/madam"" and just refer to people by their first name. This was a huge problem for me, cause everyone was older. But I eventually got used to it. KPMG Nigeria is a very flexible, yet time filing, occupying company. I'm glad I had the privilege to  intern with them.Great firm, training is excellent. Clients are the best in their industry groups. Teams work well together and the skills learned o the job are the best part about the day.I serve as assistant to multiple members of the firm's senior management.  I have the ability to manage multiple priorities, highly organized and provide exceptional customer service.As a KPMG consultant, there is not ""typical"" day at work. You can be heavily involved with clients one day and just work from home on another day. It varies depending on your work style. From KPMG, I learned how to communicate effectively with clients. KPMG management is very hierarchical - started with associate to senior associate to manager to partner. The hierarchy varies depending on your department. My coworkers were wonderful. They were friendly and respectful, very easy to work with. Co workers above me were very eager to help push me to the next level. Hardest part of the job was getting to the next level. To get there, you must prove yourself to internal team members such as director and partners. To do so, you must work under a very challenging environment which requires a lot of traveling and face time with clients and coworkers. If you have a family, you will have very little time seeing them... Most enjoyable part of the job (if you are young and do not have a family) is the travel. You get to see may different places and many different people around the world. I also enjoyed the opportunities and education my company offered me.It is a high performance culture company.  Employees and Partners are of high integrity and professionalism. It is a great Audit, Tax and Advisory firm.",,Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-10-16T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/74a85e66-a423-4a53-887c-089cdb74586a?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=21,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
52,2219.0,Principal Data Scientist,HERE,3.8,60.0,"Fast-paced work environment.  Constant change to keep up with changing technologies.  Sometimes the change was challenging and sometimes the change was exhilarating.Worked with some highly intelligent folks.  The culture was very professional and rules were consistent.   HERE affords the priceless opportunity to work with people from around the world and to travel.Working in Chicago downtown area, it is a good experience. Friendly management team, it is casual place to work in. The company is promising, too.A good company to work for but keep your technical skills up.  Great benefits.  Nice gym.  The newer employees are satisfied but the one that have been here at least 8 years or more have seen a big change in management and communication.A cutting edge mapping company with goals of providing customers with the best map features possible. A company struggling with trying to provide detailed map features quicker and cheaper than how things were done previouslyThere has been a lot of changes over the years and none really for the best, not too sure why I keep hanging around. There have been rounds of layoffs. Management says they want to improve the work place...tic tic ticThere is no growth, company will not help you expand your knowledge. You'll remain at the same position the day you got hired 10 years later, no matter how hard you work. Your pay will also not increase. If you're fresh out of college and need a job ASAP this is it, but don't get sucked in too much. Benefits are good (insurance, 401K) corporate headquarters has more to offer like a gym and I think free food. If you're in a field office, you're lucky to get water and coffee delivered....they like to not pay the bill. Can work from home but that might come to an end. Pretty much can take PTO whenever you want.Fast paced environment.  New vision, strong leadership.  There are great things in the future for this company.  Be ready for an exciting ride.This company is among something really BIG in regards to autonomous driving and location cloud.The co-workers are really nice and the office is a nice place to work (great location in the city).The company is large enough to take on different projects or opportunities across different organizationsManagement is involved in too many of decisions which make the company very slow for a technology company.  Also, many of the support teams do not work together as a team to accomplish the goal (or deal).  There is a lot of red-tape that you need to be able to get through to get anything done.The Culture needs to change vastly for this company to be very successful in the future.we were inbound reps, handling 20-50 calls a day placing orders for customers. Sometimes we would handle customer complaints,  trouble shooting and returns. mangers are down to earth and always there for help. small place so everyone knows everyone and always friendly, nothing to hard but your standard customer complaints. good hours and great potlucks.Company could be great, but has been in constant change for 6-8 years.  Culture went from family like to a business case study.  It will have success, but at the expense of being a great place to work.Had opportunity to see a industry evolve from TDM through 4G/LTE. had opportunity to see and learn about many technologies. Not so great of a place as the bubble burst but I survived till I retiredFine place if you just want to put in your work and collect your pay check. Never know what direction the company is headed in. Few advancement opportunities. Management always working behind closed doors.I worked on our feature recognition team to develop machine learning technology by verifying and correcting what the software attempts to categorize road signs.We would have a daily scrum to discuss what we had been working on and what we would be working on for the day which was great to keep everyone on the same page.Recently a new tool was developed for the deep learning software and it has been fun to communicate feedback to our Chicago office to make the tool more efficient and user friendly.At times it can be a little tedious to be reviewing thousands of road signs detection every day and it does not feel like challenging or full filling work.Great place to work, nice people and benefits. However sometimes reluctant to embrace change and innovation for internal process.Great use of latest technology; Above average standardization; Environment is excellent; Management is terrible; Advancement is terrible; Benefits are sub par.Great place to work, learned a lot over my tenure, got great opportunities. Everyone is super helpful and approachable. It's a global business so requires travel in business positions.This job allowed me to use my Geography degree, travel all over the world, and develop my love for sharing knowledge and for public speaking.  I have a passion for training and communicating.  I learned to appreciate expanding my horizons with new technology, tools and programs.  I enjoyed meeting people and seeing places all over the world.Had my position not been eliminated, I would likely not have ever made a change.  I am searching for a new experience that will utilize my experience as well as continue to challenge me to learn and grow.Nokia Inc. is a one-of-a-kind company. It has went through a transformation period and is now entering into a new era. I love the Scandinavian way of working. It's such a privilege to work for Nokia!!Professional work environment.

53,2220.0,Data Scientist,Caterpillar,3.9,2000.0,"Every day was different never knew where i was going or what i would be doing all on the road repairs(gas,electric and diesel) respondsible for keeping van stocked up and customer satifactionI was an agency employee not an actual Caterpillar employee, however, there is good a Job Work/Life Balance structured atmosphere, there is room for advancement with the right skills, Management is good, they treat you with respect. The job culture is very diverse, and is extremely pleasant to work in. I was there four years as an agency worker and was just recently laid off, however I would still recommend this employer to everyone, times are tuff all over.  I may not be called back but Caterpillar is still a nice place to work.  the hardest part of the job is adapting quickly to rapid changes, challenging but not impossible. I enjoyed being able to crosstrain in a completely different field and fill in for others while they were on vacation.I have learned and done many tasks as part of Caterpillar INC. I have designed closed loop models for system integration/software testing. I have designed multiple software and hardware features used on Large Mining Trucks. I created the backbone structure for the first automated Python Script testing environment for Caterpillar Large Mining Trucks. I have enjoyed learning and developing especially working with leadership to increase my abilities as a leader to hopefully move into a management or leadership role. I have managed small teams across multiple tasks. Overall I have enjoyed my co-workers, model work, Python scripting, and the great work/life balance that this job has provided.Lots of favoritism, things being pushed under the table, logistics management is the worst that I have seen thus far, no advancement, the plant is divided with separate benefits, bonuses and insurance, they write you up with no solid evidence of anything that was done wrong, they nit pick and harass you because they would rather you walk out then go through a firing process, not to mention the management to employee relations, the list can go on and on... I gave 3 stars because if I were with another department I may some what like it there.When the economy is doing well especially in the resource and mining industries it is a great company to be a part of. But these industries are cyclical which can make job security shaky.Coming from a support role, the most enjoyable part of my job is solving problems.Management tries to enable you for success.My key takeaway has been that you are in charge of how far you move through your career.  You have to be vocal about what you want to do and seek those experiences.Joliet location was very hostile in the beginning, but the environment improved greatly under new upper management. Company overall provides excellent compensation, educational opportunities, support for obtaining professional certifications, opportunities for career advancement, and a general culture of teamwork.I had a great career for 20 years, but Caterpillar is not the same company I hired into.  Like any large corporation, it has had its ups and downs.  Cat provided excellent opportunities for me and my family -- allowed us to move around and provided excellent pay and benefits.  However, the last 10 years have been a real challenge with low job security and significant political turmoil.I was third generation for this company.  It is not like it used to be.  There is no incentive to continue to work for this corporation other than that in the area is pays more.  The culture is terrible. They do not care for their employees and constantly ask to do more with less and no compensation for it.  Middle management ethics is majority of their divisions are questionable.I have found that if you put in the OT, learn the culture of Cat, you can learn a vast amount of knowledge that will grow with you and your career.Pros: Caterpillar is a great company to develop and grow in your careers,offers challenges and inspires to be the best engineers in your domain . The team is diverse and supports inclusive operation. The management preaches/ supports developing quality products and supports next generation initiatives to lead the industry with disruptive innovation in its products and offers good employee benefits and compensation.Cons: Nature of business is cyclic and some aggressive restructuring efforts are implemented as the business demandsNot really an ok place to work. i would not recommend this place to work. Not a transparent facility. Favoritism is heavily practiced by management. If you were on night shift like i was...then it was almost as if you were forgotten. every aspect of your repairs made on your shift, even though correct and solid, was second guessed by day shift and redone. Management in Maintenance was atrocious, led by an inexperienced manager that second guessed his supervisors and heavily practiced favoritism between a few employees giving them preference of hours with working overtime instead of being fair and spreading it across the department. Advancement was a joke and not there. No training plan or evidence of company providing any type of training.Company operates three shifts Monday thru Thursday. Company uses Six Sigma Methodologies. Some of the Pros are gain sharing, affordable insurance and vacation & sick time. Co-workers are like family. Management has an open door policy. The hardest job would be shell prep/paint line because it's messy and hot work. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing your working for a company that you can be proud to say you work for. To sum it up this is the best job I ever had with great benefits, teaming atmosphere, and opportunity to grow.Caterpillar is a great, industry-leading company to work for to gain experience. Their Leadership and Technical Development (LTDP) program is an outstanding three-year rotational program designed to provide broad experience within a specific functional area. Offered great leadership opportunities and project experience. However, there are many layers of management, a lot of rules and regulations that hinder continuous improvement and creative thinking. An old culture and way of doing things limits creativity in the organization. Very political organization forces one to get to know the right people in the organization in order to advance in certain areas. Company currently downsizing making it difficult to stay positive and secure.when you think of caterpillar you think of a strong company however the distribution center i belong to lacks great leadership management does not follow up with supervisors and its commonly known on the warehouse floor that once you become a supervisor you can slack off because it is whats visible. Lack of advancement in the company unless your willing to relocate to the midwest. overall if you have the work ethic to come in and do your job you should be fine but in every warehouse you will have childish issues you will run into.Caterpillar is a good place to work but the pay and chances for advancement are limited. There are resources available to those that the Management chooses to offer it to. Though not so much as those who request it to better improve their abilities.The workforce is diverse. Which is both a blessing and a curse as not all have the drive to excel.and at times the lack of urgency can be disheartening.The hardest and most enjoyable part of the job is meeting the deadlines in an efficient and safe manner.I have been with the company for almost 18 years so it is a good place to work obviously.  Great people, great opportunities for training and advancement.  I have learned many different aspects of the business from Purchasing, Logistics, Quality, and Engineering.  I have been worked many different 6 sigma projects.  The management team I have had in my career has very much been involved in my career and helped me along the way to make the right decisions.As with many of the larger corporations this one can occasionally be overburdened with unnecessary / duplicate information. Too much emphasis on the individual responsibilities of the other team members and not enough individual accountability. The people are exceptional at the local level and in general upper management is responsive to their needs.I enjoyed my time with Caterpillar.  I worked day shift.  I learned to be come a better listener and how to be more organized.  I have taken lean manufacturing classes.  The management is great.  They are willing to listen and help a person reach their full potential. I like my co-workers.  I get along with them and a lot of them have become like family to me.  The hardest part of the job is sometimes is the stress but I don't let it get to me.  When I get to stressed out I go home and read or cook.  That helps me relax.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people. I have mad a lot of great friends at work and will miss them dearly.Great benefits. But after being there 3 years with no opportunity to move up. I would of been at a stand still so leaving was a good option for me So now I can move forward and build a career. I worked well with everyone. The job was very fast at times . Had to always be on my toes. About detail and make sure before I had sent a part for a engine it was not damaged ,and make sure it was right. I worked 12hr shifts standing all day.CAT is a good starting job or those who have no work experience. But not long term, the turn over rate is high and right now cat is ""restructuring"" which means weeding out a lot of people in order to save money. So, if you don't mind working in a fast paced environment with little to no commutation from management and a uncertain future with only one positive factor being pay and benefits and dealing with a lot of egos, then CAT is for you.Education and training provided is best around in availability.Parts are heavy, so this needs consideration depending on your job.Assembly co-workers say the pay is low in comparison to the task.Management co-workers say the pay is pretty good.I most enjoyed solving the problems involved in the manufacturing processes. I was able to succeed in reducing defects where everyone else struggled, so there must still be room for improvement here. The discerning problem solver would find much job security here as engineering changes happen so often.","10,000+",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-09-24T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/8c37584e-94e5-4862-95c2-5f86be628194?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=23,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

If you knew all of your project knowledge and answers to frequently asked questions then that equals to a typical day at work.NORC overall was a nice experience because I had never been a locator before. I did not like the environment, for some reason everyone shared colds there.hard working environment with room to advance within the company. they had very flexible hours and plenty of overtime for employees. staff was committed to helping new hires learn everything there is to know about becoming a telephone interviewerinbound outbound call center part time hours convinenient location in downtown area very flexible work schedule fast pace enviorment,thiers opportunity for growth and developmentHired through an temp agency, we were paid more than some of the workers that came straight through the company.

The job assignment is ending for now.Management is bias and constant treats for high production.There's no room to grow or even a transfer to challenge other openings.No sick or vacation benefitsField and Regional Managers projects an attitude of superiority that turns off other employees.Employee morale low - ending on a high turn overI came in and sat at my desk. placed several phone calls to various different people to whom would share information about their child's immunization records to help with the CDC's statistics and studyA typical day working involves me signing into my computer, putting on my headsets, answer calls and also make them. I learned that the company don't care to much for employees . My co-workers are amazing. The hardest part of the job was trying to save break minutes. The most enjoyable part was that I could pick how many hours I wanted to work in a day.No words can describe my typical work day or my experiences at National Opinion Research Center (not for profit). I would like to remain mutual, knowing that I performed my job well.Great place to work just wish we had more hours basically all you do is convince people to participate in different studiesThis particular job I accepted just for the need of money, although I am grateful for the tools I have accumulated here as a telephone interviewer.At this job my duties was to call respondents on various social science studies. I learned about different studies and the management was excellent here. The hardest part was getting the respondents to participate in the study. The most enjoyable part of this job was talking to different respondents.NORC is a supportive environment that has a new department just for employee innovation!  The company is full of lots of smart folks who work very hard to win the next big contract.I believe that the hardest part of this job was the long waits in between calls. I ve learned that if you set goals, no matter what you do ,you will meet them. the most enjoyable part of this job was that i can go on break at anytime i want.I love working at this productive, fast paced place of business.  The people work at a team there. A typical day is getting out current events and making sure the floors are running smoothly.Just don't work here if you aren't a fan of being auto-dialed for something because this place specializes in it. They conduct CDC surveys pertaining to childhood immunizations but the average person isn't looking forward to being on the phone for 20 or more minutes to do an immunization survey, so look elsewhere for employment. They also still pay minimum wage.this is definitely the company to pursue for employment! what a great company to be employed by. this was a great experience for me, I gained so much insight on the company and the city of Chicago. employers were always available to talk to at anytime about anything.Employees conduct high qaulity interviews about the national immunization survey on behalf of the cdc. Our work hours are extremly flexible with a 85 percent attendance requirement for each month. Although supervisors and peer helpers are always present , majority of the work is done alone .working here was ok but the hours were awful but it is ideal for a student because you pretty much set your own schedule. if you didn't get the hours when they were first posted then you miss out",,Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-08-29T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/afed222a-c64a-4ef9-84d8-1e7b8f0f2862?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=26,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

58,2225.0,Data Scientist,Federal Reserve Bank,4.2,317.0,"Everyday was chaotic with no such thing as nothing to do, or not enough work for the day. Learned what it means to be professional and how to work in a professional environment. Co-workers where very helpful and would always try even if they didnt have the answersThe Federal Reserve Bank was an enjoyable job to have, incoming calls to sign up for direct deposit was simple. The longest call would be about  minutes roughly, the caller would either give bank account information or sign up for a prepaid card for their benefits to deposit on. Management was reliable and always there to help, there was not a hard part of the job necessarily however there were some people upset that they had to have their check deposited instead of receiving by mail. The most enjoyable part of the job was that you would sit by someone new every day and would get a chance to get to know all people around you.My role is unique in the sense of offerings that are provided to employees through our onsite clinic each day to participating and running projects.  As a nurse manager, I run the onsite clinic and update the providers schedules at multiple locations, manage and supervise direct reports, update departmental policies and procedures as well as administer disability leave management cases for Short-Term Disability, FMLA, LTD and if needed, ADA.Hard to obtain perm job as a consultant.  Management does not understand true value of Project and Program Management beyond IT.I enjoyed working at the Federal Reserve Bank. Great benefits for the employees and promotion within is a priority.The Federal is very diversity oriented.While working at the Federal Reserve I was a Law Enforcement Officer. As a Law Enforcement Officer my duty was to Deter, Detect, and Defend bank employees and property. I worked closely with other officers and reported back to management on daily activities. While working on the entrance posts I developed strong customer service skills, continuously serving employees and guests of the bank.I started my career at the Federal Reserve which developed my discipline to the control of the process...Every action or step was detailed and reviewed at each critical point to ensure all information was 100% correct and concise.  They was no room for errors...The staff was couched and developed to be as successful as they wanted to achieve.Extremely professional environment...All the management was top selected from various colleges from around the country.I very much enjoyed working here. Of course, the security was strict, but I had a great time with my co-workers. There were, of course, many crazy days where the calls were non-stop, but it made the days go by quicker. The management were friendly and courteous - promoted from within.good job, happy to work - great benefits nice people, long day but job offers every other Friday off.organization fair to employees with benefits and compensation.Scoping and driving process improvement, organizational change and functional strategy initiatives across the Corporate Group Organization. Key responsibilities include creation, promotion and execution of an integrated vision/plan for the delivery of relevant information and analytic solutions to business stakeholders, establishing project control monitoring capabilities to highlight key areas of concern and emerging risks associated with the organization's technology portfolio; providing consultative services in shaping business and technology strategies, road maps and implementation plans.I worked in shipping & receiving. Had a lot of interaction with drivers.hard work ,but fun ,some time. We received monies and payed out also. The management team was always there to help with any problems we incurred. the day usually went fast because we were busy.good environment,cafiteria,gym. the benefits were also goodI felt working for the FRBNY was a great experience and I believe having this company on my resume helps with career advancement.Due to the nature of the business, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta was highly regulated. There were many regulations to follow. However, the regulations did not interfere with quality work performance. The most enjoyable part of this job was the interaction with Employee Relations activities. It allowed for creativity and  planning on upcoming events.Great first job, great pay and great management.I worked with entry level programmers like myself.I learned a great deal.The training was wonderful and I made wonderful contacts.The most enjoyable part of the job was the day to day interactions and collaborations with fellow employees. The environment was very productive and energizing.Agile methodology with Sprints. Great company but really busy with integration of new technologies and implementing cloud based infrastructure. Great teamThe culture was not for me. In order to get a proposal or project completed, there had to be numerous sign offs and work had to be flawless. The concentration was on perfection instead of completing quality work in a timely fashion. Some of the projects I was assigned were originally started over 10 years ago, progress stopped 10 years ago, and nobody finished them. I picked up the pieces and completed them...from something that started 10 YEARS AGO and they didn't need to be completed. This is really an up and coming organization.Created use cases/requirements documents, supervised group of BA's to insure tasks where completed on time and on budget.  Lead Production support tasks to insure completion and resolution of enhancements and defects.Management was good to work with and provided support for all employees and contractors.Co-workers were a pleasure to work with.  I enjoyed our development staff and enjoyed working along side our business partners in Parkersburg VA.  The hardest part of the job was not working too many hours.  I tend to enjoy learning the application and often times became a workaholic.The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the team.  I really had an incredible team of development and Quality Assurance.Normally you would go on to find out what your workload was like each day.To work hard and own up to your mistakes.Management tried to work along with each employee to solve daily problems.Everyone tried to work to solve all problems.Resolving accounts at the end of the day.The support you received really made the job worth while.The job ended at the Federal reserve, with the merger of the larger banks.Nothing worth identifying for this employer at this time. This employer has nothing worth identifying at this time or in the future.I would bring up the system and being to monitor files sent by other financial institutions. Once we had all of them we would process them and send them out either electronically or physically to each institution by a strict timeline.I learned everything that I could about the banking industry so that I could advance.Management was great in that they always tried to keep us moving in an upwardly fashion.My co-workers became my extended family after 21 years of working with them.The hardest part was making sure that all files sent were accurate and timely.The most enjoyable part was the friends I had made.","1,001 to 5,000",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-07-27T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/6b67a1e0-7736-4d58-92bb-604eff0f9385?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=28,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

60,2227.0,Data Scientist,Dupage Medical Group,3.0,80.0,"Management was subpar at most. I was walked on a lot for being a new person. Too many social conflicts between co-workers. Patients were wonderful. I did learn a ton while working here after my first year out of MA school.My co-workers are amazing and if it wasn't for loving them I'd quit (its rare to find people you genuinely enjoy working with and consider friends). The pay is such garbage and if you go into even 0.15 hours of overtime (which equates to maybe like $8) you will basically get fired. The raises are a joke and the benefits aren't that great.Wish I could give 0 stars.Dupage medical group bought out the employer I was working for. When they bought us out the company went down the toilet in just weeks. If you want to feel like you don't matter and stressed all the time this is the place for you! This company only cares about making money! So short staffed be prepared to work yourself to death you will be doing work of 4-5 people and when people quit they are not replaced! Management is the biggest joke the managers don't even know how to schedule a appt and they just dump on the employees even tho they are rn they will never join in to help there job is to laugh play on there phones and eat all day! Biggest joke of a company!Horrible place to work, the management within MPAS is awful all they do is hire their friends from a company that went under and they cannot find jobs so MPAS gets them.  They know nothing about the jobs just how to criticize how we have been doing it and being successful  So, that being said MPAS now is going under, bad reviews super amount of turnover and the sad thing about the whole thing is the upper management just doesn't care as long as the seats are filled and money is still coming in.  How about how our new clients feel, oh that is if they even new all the wrong that goes on within the walls of MPAS.the company is okay to work for for a time. there are almost no opportunities for advancement in either position or pay. the working environment was clean and secure as long as you don't rock the boat.I was on the phone for 8 to 9 hours with an hour lunch. Took over 100 calls a day, scheduling, cancelling appointments for all of DMG doctors.I learned how to schedule appointments on the Epic system. The co workers were nice when we were able to see one another, we were in our own cubicles. I did not eel that I had any opportunity for growth with this company.I loved speaking to patients but missed the face to face interaction.Dupage Medical Group is definitely not what they make it seem. It's really repetitive and the training is kind of stupid. I don't want to sit and watch another person take calls when you could be taking the time to actually show me how to navigate the system. Also one of the supervisors in the customer service department is racist! STAY AWAY. you've been warned!The company CEO needs to pay more attention to its employees and patients rather than the revenue its generating. There is no room for growth and the mid level senior leadership is not good at communication.Was a very fun place to work at but it lacks leadership. Management is not easy to talk to.  Days were always good there but sometimes it felt like we were not allowed to be ourselves.Management is the worst I have ever experienced.  Manager of PACU has a hard time trying to help with patients when needed and has no filter with employee's privacy.  Manager of facility has no tact when dealing with the nurses but is sweet and accommodating to the physicians.  They except the employees to live, breath and die for this ASC.  The pay is low, hours unreasonable, and benefits are poor.  The coworkers are very clique', some you have a difficult time knowing if they are friend or foe (but not all). Stay away!.The patient were all very nice and a pleasure to work with. The employee with the other doctors that the office was shared with were very nice to work around. The nurse in the offiice I worked in was nice at first and then was completly differnet after about a month.Very stressful and emotional. Very overwhelmed with trying to adhere to all the policies. The doctor's schedule was nearly impossible to navigate. Only certain patients on certain days and only certain times are available for certain issues. Patients were expected to wait for a very long time to be seen for certain issues. If nothing was available then you had to call the nurse to get permission to slot a patient in an open spot that didn't pertain to their issue. Too complicated. Especially for the patients and that made it very difficult to calm them down. If you made one mistake you were let go. Training was difficult. It consisted of shadowing an employee for 5 weeks. Then you got a whole notebook explaining what doctor works where and when and what times and days they were available. Patient's availability did not matter at all. 9 doctors, 7 locations and 2 hospitals. And still the appointments could take over a month to get in. It was very sad. I cried almost every day.This was a horrible place to work for; you are paid very low and never acknowledged for the hard work  you do. Employees are given very low raises yet cuts are never made to the salaries of those in the C suite. No women have high positions and productivity standards are unrealistic. The motto is ""we care for  you"" but they do not care for their employees. All they want to do is get bigger and bigger and the phone systems are horrible because they are too big. I was told I would be on hold for a minute trying to get a referral after 35 minutes I hung up.This is the worst company I have every been employeed by.  The pay is very low, and the medical benefits are terrible.   Very high deductible and we can only go to DMG doctors.  Ridiculous productivity expectations.   I literally run all day from patient to patient with not a moment to even stop and use the bathroom!  Quality of patient care suffers terribly due to greed for money and constantly overscheduling patients.  If I were a patient I would not return becsuse they are not given fair time and attention due to DMGs policy of overscheduling.   This greatly lowers qulity of patient care.  So many employees feel used and abused.  Suggestion to improve employee and patient satisfaction,   don't treat employees like machines.  Very greedy organization.   They care more abut money than patients or employees.  Very high rate of turnoverYou will have no life because you work 7am to 7pm.No breaks, one 30 minute lunch.Running to the bathroom between checking in patients.When someone quits, they are not replaced, you are expected to do the work of the people that quit,Very, very, unrealistic expectations.I've learned many new skills within the podiatric specialty area. I very much enjoy my position within the department and I have had the pleasure of working with very professional, and friendly, medical assistants and Podiatrists. I have never worked with a better group of people. At this current time, management of musculoskeletal operations is undergoing many changes which presents communication and organizational issues within the department. I believe that aside from my day to day contact with my fellow co-workers, I find the most enjoyable part of my position is engaging with the patients and administering quality patient care.I totally enjoyed working for the Doctor's here. All of them were down to earth, intelligent, funny, social and compassionate. They are trully the only people I miss working for. The staff was ok. Depending on the day it could go smooth or dramatic for you. The staff was moody. The Doctor's were always professional and never yelled or embarrassed the staff. The pay could had been better. The benefits were good. Management was good and fair. Management appreciated hard work and so did the Doctor's. If you were not sure on how to do something the Doctor's would assist and never embarrass you in front of a patient or co-worker. It was awesome.I enjoy working at this company- benefits are OK would love for the organization to consider employees for job advancements.Great co-workers and Doctor's. Practice manager (Asthma and Allergy) is unprofessional, spreading rumors, and with no management skills. Manager is unable to do any task without the Nurse Supervisor looking over her shoulder showing her how to do it. The Doctor's are getting ripped off - paying 2 salaries for the work of one person. No flexibility with scheduling or changes. Huge turnover of the staff. Annual pay increases of less than 3% with POSITIVE reviews.DuPage Medical is an awful place to work. The company has grown  too quickly for upper level management to handle, which has compromised the quality of care given. Patients would complain often about this. Expect to be worked to the bone for a 17 cent raise and do not expect to move up within the company. DuPage Medical Group: We Don't Care for You, Just for Your Money.Dealing with sick people all day. Great co-workers. working every minute. Very nice place to work. Long days. Need to stay focused.",,Chicago,Downers Grove,IL,2016-12-03T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/915deba4-62c1-4edb-b14d-8a27de3fabd5?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=30,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
61,2228.0,Data Scientist,The NPD Group,3.0,20.0,"I have worked at NPD for less than a year. I am working in a part of the company that would be considered low skilled and less demanding when compared to other positions within the company. Right now I am very happy. In my position the environment is low stress and I am able to come in every day, get my work done, and go home. Currently my goal is to gain more computer skills in order to apply for a better position within the company. The only negative for me is I don't completely know how the company operates and what its goals are, I don't know what other people within the company do, I am not required to, but I wish they offered some more training and explanations of the company's many functions.You are expected to deliver the result no matter what. But do not expect to get any support. No one really cares about you.They can terminate you any time and in any way .High turn over rate at this company. Not worth it if you want to have career at this company.Its a great place to start your career. If you are a senior level employee then persue other options. As a senior developer i have not had any advancement of my knowledge or position. Manangers are junior and the staff is more knowledgeable.This was my first job and I was excited to start. From my interview experience, this place looked promising and a great start to a career. I was wrong. What they had me do was absolutely nothing at all similar to the job ad. I struggled. There was no training whatsoever, and the supervisor expected me to already know everything right away. Because I had no training, I created a vicious cycle where I would get projects wrong and my boss would get frustrated until I ended up feeling very inept. In essence, training is not in NPD's dictionary. They expect you to know everything right away---they threw all these acronyms at me as if I knew what they were already. On my first day, they threw a very complex project on my lap without any explanation on what it actually is, including what its acronym of a name stood for. Because of disorganized restructuring that seems to be ongoing, the work they had me do was not at all what I was trained to do, so naturally I was not good at it, which annoyed my supervisor. It made me think of a quote from the movie Office Space:  ""...it's not that I'm lazy, it's that I just don't care"" (also, I hope you like the cubicle farm, because that's what you'll get---in their headquarters, there are almost no windows whatsoever, so it's a bunch of cubicles and tiny offices that are lit by halogen lights, which is pretty depressing). There's really no incentive unless you are in dire need of a superficial ""you did it"" corporate banner on your cubicle. There's no room for growth, and many young people see this as just a gig until they find something better.  more... That is probably why there are few younger people in the office. More importantly, at least to the people around me, there's no work-life balance. People work on weekends, on their time off; they come into work earlier to work and stay late. This is all because of mismanagement an a generally inept method of work. Things keep messing up and the employees have to cover the slack of the higher-ups. There is a high turnover, which is unsurprising, as no one looks truly happy. As others mentioned, there is no room for innovation. They stick to outdated procedures that aren't that great. I should mention, however, that these experiences may differ from department to department, so I can't speak for all. Finally, I will also say that the benefits are not too shabby.  lessNice place to work, I did overnight for a period of time but overall it was a very quiet and relaxed place to start building my professional path.Autonomous work place with a good work/life balance.  It is all about the numbers and not so much about career growth and advancement.  Decent amount of red tape and politics, but manageable.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with clients and helping make an impact on their business.Its been many years since I stopped working there, but I can't imagine things have changed I was only with the company for 2 years and a few months and in that time there were multiple layoffs followed by mass hirings.  It is quite nerve racking not knowing when the next round will come or if you'll be included.  When I was hired, there were 6 other new employees in my department.  By the time I left, 3 of those 6 were already let go.  All the loss of staff means you are constantly being moved around doing things you were not originally hired for.  In my case, I was forced into a role I was completely unsuitable for (and uninterested in) thus leading to my leaving the company.   A typical workday consisted of meetings - hope you like to be in small rooms because there are small conference rooms all over the place and it seems like you just go from one room to another - better bring your power for your laptop (there were multiple instances of 4 people sharing power just to make it through the end of the meeting. I was hired through a recruiter - she described the place as a collegiate atmosphere.  This should've been my first warning.  They are constantly trying to make up for the lack of morale by forcing everyone every so often in team building exercises.  Basically there are 2 ways of looking at this - those who look at it as a great way to miss a day of work or those who look at it as a day wasted because now there is double the amount of work waiting when you come in the next day.  You're better off skipping any job postings for this placeGreat place to start a career. As you advance, you will learn less and less because the place is not motivated to change. Eventually, you will no longer have skills to compete in the marketplace and will be mired in internal politics.Great company.  Recently a lot of room for advancement due to growing company.  Good culture and great work life balance, but likely lower compensation than similar positions in other companies.NPD is a great company to work for. The hours are reasonable and workload manageable. If you enjoy analyzing data and telling stories, it is a fun company to be a part of. As with any data supplier, incomes are below that of a typical marketing position, but based on interactions with marketing departments across the industry, it is a relatively low stress field.Checking Calendars Preparing for meetingsMailProcessing ContractsUpdating ContactsFollowing-up on events for my managersBooking TravelManagement very understanding and a wonderful personCo-workers were amazing and helpful I enjoyed the flexibility and culture of the companyHardest part was the commutePeople work as a team. Great communication among all peopleNice atrium for relaxing or casual meeting.A great place to start your career. Great work environment with lots of hands on work, and great leaders to provide insight.NPD is going through a corporate transformation.  It's an exciting time to be part of the evolution and help drive change.Company has a hard time keeping up with current market. New senior management not clear about objectives and expectations. Company pulled in many directions without focusing on a clear path.I've worked there for over 18 years and now they are moving my department to Ireland.Place sucks dont do it,spend your time consulting or workingfor a large corporation. You will do all the work while othersgo play baseball and go shopping, your reward is to be part ofregular massive layoffs after your projects are done.Dont do it.I thought this was my dream job, but after working with your co workers and managers, you start to realize who is there for you and not too many people were, especially from my department. I won't recommed this job to anyone.管理层十分人性化，待遇福利非常好. 但是不同的部门会有不同的情形。在我的部门，工作量相对轻松，但是不够具有挑战性。",,Chicago,Rosemont,IL,2016-11-10T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/642f150a-1f01-42ef-b37b-f0f5714cee53?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

63,2230.0,Jr. Data Scientist,Zurich Insurance,3.7,319.0,"I had to play ""catch-up"" for a new branch of Zurich North America:  Environmental Insurance.  The team I had been assigned to (via Spherion) had relocated from Atlanta to establish the Boston branch.  I used my skills from previous assignments to reconcile their database of applicants for insurance.Its an alright place to work. Benefits are good and pay is ok. If you have any insurance experience it will be pretty boring. Days are mundane and not very stimulating. Management is helpful but you shouldnt need them much except on unusual claims. Advancement is possible but you have to wait a year to apply and have manager approval. Easiest job ive had and i cant wait to move to a different position or change companies. Apply to be an underwriter or adjuster first if you can, otherwise youll be stuck for a year when you're qualified for a better position. A lot of people have been there for a while which is cool for them but it's just a place im passing through.I was excited about working at Zurich however quickly I became concerned about job retention. The person who had been in my new position for 4 years prior to my hiring had not performed well. High dollar claims had come in for years which was certainly due, at least in part, due to this person's low job performance. Sure enough, after only 2 years with the company, the claims were so high that I lost my job as part of the 8,000 massive layoff in 3/2016. In addition, it was problematic to me that long term managers who were neglectful of watching the bottom line were all retained while those of us who were high level performers were all let go.Don't fall into the trap at Zurich. It was once a profitable company but they have years and years to go before they can re-establish their once respectable reputation.The position and culture is fantastic until you realize that not all employees are created equal.  I witnessed multiple employees fired for no reason, even with superb performance.  No questions asked.  Terrible for security and advancement, you begin to worry about your position almost daily regardless of how well you perform.  Work environment is hostile and management is corrupt with power, doing what they please without any over-site from the executive team, and when any ""issues"" come to light the management is protected.Large insurance company, several offices around the US, global presence therefore has the pros of a large company and follows work life balance as industry norm.I enjoyed my time with Zurich.  It was a wonderful company to work for and I truly enjoyed working with all the people on the job.  I worked very hard supporting two attorneys handling Workers' Compensation matters.  Zurich truly cared about its employees.  The company provided good benefits and did all they could to make sure the employees were happy.  I truly enjoyed going into work every day because the people I worked with became like family.The salary is lacking and the health benefits are terrible and there is not a lot of room for advancement unless you want to move out of state. Over all I enjoyed my experience and learned a lot about the insurance industry.I worked with a highly qualified and diverse group of co-workers. The management of the company was highly qualified and had a significant work ethic. The company was highly thought of in the insurance industry worldwide. It was employee focussed and had significant benefits. A number of employees worked there for their full careers.Met and worked with a lot of hard working, talented, and smart people.  Above average salary, but if you are not in your seat, you are not working.  Management does not have the trust of the employees.  Managers say one thing and do another.  No trust, no guidance, and a very ""take care of yourself"" mentality when it comes to upper management.  They do not have the best interest of their employees in mind.  Great people to work with, not so much to work for.  Go thru layoffs every 3 to 4 years, so beware!A nice place to work. Typical day is research and administration; Presenting reports to other departments. Departments that work together on a daily basis do not have common goals, which can be problematic.Good company, culture, friendly environment, decent work-life balance, good benefits, competitive pay, knowledgeable leaders, values diversity, positioning for profitable growthHandle all casualty claims start to finish. Take in new claims review Coverage in detail to make sure no issues. If Issues attempt to resolve or issue reservation of rights or denial if needed.  If coverage is resolved then go into investigations speak with Insured and all parties on insured side who have knowledge of the claim get full description.  Call claimant and any witnesses.  If claimant is representatives call them. review any unusual issues with management or refer to SIU. I work independently.  I evaluate and resolve cases to conclusion with in authority limits and keep the insured informed of the claim. I assist co-workers and mentor younger ones in how to approach certain aspects. I handle all types of litigation.  I have good rapport with my Defense counsel and Plaintiff counsel. The most enjoyable part of my job when I resolve aged pending cases or I am able to obtain a Defense verdict on cases we agree to take through to trial/Due to the current management of expenses, yet initiative for profitable growth, we have seen out resources become a bit stretched, although we are doing the best we can with the current environment. The push for reduction of expenses is not a trait specific to my company or even my industry, in 2016 we have seen a push for expense reduction like no other.Corporate environment with global consideration for less fortunate and environment.  Upper management excellent but goals change from year to year causing confusion and redundancy.My job skills weren't being used for the experience I have. I was hired with the promise that Zurich would be taking on new clients in large industries such as Paper Mills, Oil and Gas industries and Co Gin plants. Never happened. great co workers willing to help one another out.The company itself is very stable, offers many potential opportunities, and generous compensation. Senior management in my region was very supportive of career development. However, team managers, who you deal with on a much regular basis, absolutely leave much to be desired - problems with lack of interest, excessive case loads, ignoring submitted closings, and internally promoted managers not recognizing that they are now a member of management and acting accordingly versus acting like they were still a front line employee.Also, despite senior managements support of career development, actually being able to branch out into other areas of the company are limited by preferential treatment and arbitrary hiring policies (ie: not being able to switch roles within a year of receiving a title bump).End of the day, it's another job in claims, nothing more.I really enjoyed working for Zurich.  I was treated with respect and always in a timely manor with professionalism.  I really enjoyed working with Dawn Kondratowicz.  She is an awesome insurance adjuster.  She was very helpful and a pleasure to work for.Typical day was doing search for new claims, contacting insured, documenting file and preparing file for next course of action.  Manager was awesome, my team was awesome and I am grateful to Zurich for this training me and promoting me while the business was here in Maryland.Lots of phone calls, ongoing diary and settlement resolution. Best part of job was co-workers. Hardest part of the job was having to review every file with a manager. It was difficult to move up in the company. Looking to move into a higher level position with more exposure was difficultMy company was purchased by Zurich (Farmers Insurance division) so I was not directly hired into it. Overall they managed the call center as any corporation does.Zurich is a very professional and diverse organization. I greatly enjoyed working with various insured's and handling claims fortheir properties. I was recognized many times for my professionalism and abilities and resolving claims.","10,000+",Chicago,Schaumburg,IL,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/6828dc57-06e4-4e89-8bd1-c1188199a870?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Learned effective time management and sales targeting. Management was mediocre and fleeting.  Co-workers for the most part were top notch.  Hardest part of my job was trying to make my territory comparable to the south and east coast.Nice place to work, Friendly people . more work ,good environment to work. and this is the one of the company that i love to work withI like working at Astellas,  The people and management are friendly.  It a relaxed and flexible work environment,  I like how they support all ethnicity and lifestyles.Very nice work environment. A very good work/life balance. Management is done well well. Good Company culture. A very good team.We all know that painful feeling waking up in the morning to get ready for a job that we don't like.  Going to work each morning for Astellas was not that way for me.  This is a wonderful company that provides exceptional compensation and benefits for their employees.  This company truly cares about their employees lives and well being.  The flexibility and vacation time provided is nothing less of exceptional.  I greatly enjoy working for this company.  Astellas has set the bar very high.Good place to start your working life out of college. The pay isnt the best but its solid for a good resume builder. Get in and get out. The staff and people who are in management are great.I learned much about the sales and marketing aspects of product promotion, as well as the technical aspects of the product.  The sales team that I worked with was exceptional.  I enjoyed getting out in the professional community and networking with others in my profession.Solid work place environment. Good opportunity. Supportive colleagues and well intention-ed management. Since my stay with Astellas was short, I had little to complain about.OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was bought by Astellas, so I worked mostly for OSI.  My co-workers were wonderful; very supportive, eager to teach and learn from each other, always striving to improve. In my time there, we had several directors, most of whom were knowledgeable, helpful and approachable. Being in cancer research, management made a real effort to show us how our work was impacting patients by holding talks given by Medical Affairs, Clinical and Marketing. We had great educational benefits; they reimbursed for classes you took related to your career path.Excellent company with great products. Top in industry for benefits and work life balance. Great teammates in all areas of the business. Ability to run your territory as you see fit to move the business.I was hired as Transplant rep and worked here for a year, the company was great , the pay and benefits were excellent. I left the company  as my position was not a good fit for me on a day to day basis based on calling on only 4 accountsI enjoyed my job doing various tasks.  My favoriate was Manageing Translations.  The customers were interestion to work with, I learned daily.I loved the job I was doing and looked forward to going to work. Enjoyed working with management, employees and suppliers.Astellas is a Japanese company. All employees try to be honest and work hard to release new medicines in the world to save as many people who need to be cured. Astellas has been trying to have diversities and they have now.I've worked in other corporate positions but none of them were the right fit for me and balancing all of the things I'm involved in outside of the office. Not only does Astellas offer great benefits, the flex scheduling and work location is essential for work-life balance for my entire team. The professional development opportunities are abundant and make me very excited about my future at Astellas and proud about the change my work does to further our mission and our ability to improve the lives of patients around the world.Great company who had some excellent products.  Worked with others and didn't have to be micro managed.  We had a steroid free product that dermatologsits wanted.Good products and good field sales leadership. Smart people who know what they're doing in the field. In the home office, there are many excellent people who have strong technical sales. There's an over reliance on consultants who bring in fresh ideas and milk millions of dollars off the bottom line. The best technicians rise to the top, as long as they're likable people. This results in poor leadership in the home office. But, nobody really cares about home office leadership because technicians are replaceable and the field sales folks continue to bring in the dollars.Run don't walk.  Hands down the worst management and pharma company in the industry.  Nightmare to work for and no I'm not being bitter or unfair.  It is very unhealthy work situation.It is a great company to work for. I enjoyed my time there. I had a great mentor to shepherd me through the organization. Management was very supportive and co-workers were willing to help when necessary.Astellas Pharma is a fast paced growing company, that offers an  atmosphere that promotes teamwork, and empowers employees to  thrive in their career.I was the maintenance manager for a two/three shift operation.  I would arrive at work before the third shift was over in order to talk with the maintenance techs to find out what had happened during their shift and know current equipment status.  I would then review the Work Order System to assign new work orders and verify status of urgent work orders.  Daily activity was determined by priorities, downed equipment repair was number one priority, then projects and then necessary meetings for production scheduling and other needs.  Since this was a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility we work under clean room conditions.  The nature of maintenance required the maintenance techs to use extra care and caution when performing normal procedures to the equipment.  In addition to maintaining the production and support equipment our team also performed the majority of calibrations for the site, this averaged to about 650 calibrations per month, we never missed making schedule. Upper management was very open to discussion but still demanding schedules were maintained.  Projects were scheduled during site shut downs unless it was a equipment modification that required immediate attention.My management team was primarily consisted of operations managers, I was the only maintenance manager.  We worked well together covering production and project work making equipment and resource schedules that made everyone's schedule as much as possible.The hardest part of the job was keeping the right combination of maintenance tech skill sets distributed to each shift during high work rate  more... schedules without hiring additional techs or working excessive overtime.  We went from a five day two shift production schedule to a twenty-four seven day schedule for approximately six months, this was a challenging time for everyone.I enjoyed seeing the monthly schedules completed early or at least on schedule especially when we had trying situations to overcome in addition to our normal work load.  I also enjoyed seeing a project come to completion weather it was outside contractors or our maintenance techs or a combination of both.  I also enjoyed observing maintenance techs learning new skills and growing their proficiency in all areas of their work assignments.  less",,Chicago,Northbrook,IL,2016-11-15T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/6627d15d-a588-4946-b55f-eb8e06b57a12?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=34,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

The work/life balance is good.  The benefits and good, but have been slipping over the last few years.  Following the merger with Actavis, the company has been overly focused on mergers and acquisitions and less concerned about research and growing existing product lines.Allergan is a nice company to work for that offers many opportunities with great benefits.  The Orange County campus has amazing talent. Work hours are flexible for most positions.As far as warehouses are concerned, this was a laid back place to work but we also took our jobs very seriously. Management was great and co-workers worked hard.I worked there for over 5 years before the location shut down due to lack of work, combined with other reasons. I really did enjoy the responsibility that the job required.A typical day at work with Allergan varied. I held lunches most days with doctors and staff of the clinic. I learned to be patient and how to make someone's day better. The hardest part of the job was that sometimes the doctors would be extremely busy and not have time to visit with me and go over the products I was representing. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and building strong relationships.Good place to work. Positive and friendly atmosphere. Can play basketball at lunch or go to the company cafeteria.

Managers lay all the blame on supervision, but they are spread too thin.  Management is not present amongst the work force.  Constantly being told how broke the plant is, yet management has no problem feeding theselves lunch with company money.  If you do a good job you are given more work.  If you don't do a good job you are ignored and allowed to sit around.  Advancement is based on the good ole boy network, not ability or qualifications.  Good workers are leaving rapidly, while the bad workers are still hanging around.Also, expect that managers will share your personal information with others.  There is no such thing as confidentiality.  Retirement plan for hourly workers is basically non existent.I loved this job. Production/machine operation was not only exciting, but attention to detail was the most important thing. 11/10 would work there againA typical day includes daily store operations, mixing paint for DIY customers and contractors. Assist in determining staffing needs, recruit store employees accordingly with proper approval and establish work schedule as appreciate. You have to remain knowledgeable on products offered and discuss available optionsIt's very sales driven! You have to make sales calls and accomplish sales goals.Fun and challenging work place. Great customers, good pace and great experiences in management. I would recommend this as a place for anyone who wants both a physical and mental challenge daily.I clock in at 7:30 and from there I look on the ""deliver"" bored to separate the paper work to see what goes first to last. After that I start to load the truck up starting what goes last to first that makes it easier for me when I unload the truck. Then I start my day driving and doing my delivers.great place to work and varied day.  You can really make a solid career with this company.  You will always have great benefits and great pay.  It is a good place.This company was an awesome place to work. Although very quiet and not a lot of people, I really enjoyed the environment. I was in my third trimester when hired for this position. They saw my potential and my work ethic instead of just my baby bump. They saved my life and I am forever grateful!Excellent work place and wonderful staff. One does not feel out of place and help is right there if needed. Friendly environement and safety is their main concern.In a typical day at Sherwin Williams Company your day was mostly filled with supplying customers with thee best service possible, going above and beyond. Also as assistant manager making sure the staff and orders were being done properly. The hardest part of the position was managing time between office work and assisting employees to make sure things are running smoothly. The best part of the job is when you receive a ""Thank you"" from a customer, also when you successfully teach a employee the proper way to do things.This is a good job if you don't mind getting your hands dirty and a little heavy lifting. My main concern is that it's difficult to advance into management without either a college degree or entering their management trainee program.My boss was very submissive and would allow certain workers to perform jobs poorly with no consequences. However, the environment created on the job site was fun and energetic.It can be slow on some days. My co-workers are pretty cool even the manager. the hardest part is lifting all the heavy things. Most enjoyable part is being able to just chill. Training is a bit fast. Only way to learn is to either teach yourself and repetition.I actually loved working at this particular place in tupelo. I love the people I worked with and the enviroment. They made me fun very comfortable at peace.Lots of accountability across the board for: meetings, reports, assisting other departments vendor handling lead follow-ups, customer issues related to all leads, system glitches that require extensive follow up with vendors, product knowledge, and a host of other responsibilities.Cannot move up to management because I have to be full time first, but will not offer me full time. I am the hardest worker in this specific store, very committed but being a single mother, i cannot stay here.Worked for Sherwin Williams for a year and wasn't advanced for my pay. Was told on many occasions it was coming but my manager's never put time in to fill out the appraisal properly.should have been full time raise,3rd key raise, then appraisal. Had to open and close a store and take bank deposit even though I wasn't 3rd key but just a full time. I worked hard for Sherwin Williams and basically just got put to the back of the burner. Stayed at 9.50$ the whole year. Was told by my manager and others  I will get a raise of 10.80 which is the same pay a part time 3rd key makes. That is withholding my dollar raise because I was full time. Other than that and the occasional cranky contractor it was smooth..I was a sales associate.  We sold paint to indivuals/companies.. Liked the staff..Management was very understanding and respectful.This is a really good company to work for. There is a lot of room for growth if you are interested in retail management positions. The employees are all really great people and making working there a lot of fun.I had the pleasure of sustaining various levels of management. Mentoring employees during their training periods was satisfying knowing my effective communication skills assisted in the growth towards their career goals.Carrying out logistics is an important phase in bringing together events in a timely matter. Fellow employees were able to have detailed information at hand, therefore, being well prepared.Effectively overseeing the office work flow required making sound judgments and key financial decisions. I had valuable relationships with employees, clients, vendors and visitors.","10,000+",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-11-21T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/cedc9ff6-bbb6-4402-a9d9-4c166c3a0680?mescoid=1900259001001&jobPosition=5,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I would recommend working for this company.Northwestern is great university as a whole. The school/department you work for might shift your views a little. Work/life balance was great. Management at SPS needs a lot of improvement. The most enjoyable part was having a lot of opportunities for advancement.My job and the people I work with are very enjoyable.

Quality of the working environment depends almost entirely upon who is your lab advisor. Beyond the day to day, Northwestern is a huge school that can give you as much HR stuff as you need.A typical day at work would start with a good morning greet from many co-workers, we would come a hr early to have coffee, very nice people no problems from any co-workers, I learned the great culture, met people that have worked that for 25 or more years , they was very helpful showed me all the work. Taught me how to use proper cleaning supplies,proper ways to to use a hand mop, and more. My supervisor was very nice and understand and made sure you knew your job over all i enjoy my time there because i learned new experience.I learned a ton while I was there but since my pay was based off grants it was very insecure. Work can be very satisfying if you end up in a good lab with nice people.Northwestern is an amazing place to work. It fosters a creative environment and freedom of expression. They compensate their employees well and provide good benefits. They give you a lot of latitude so you don't feel stifled. The bonus is that the campus is gorgeous. Apply!Great place to work. Nice co workers. Benefits are great, but pay is lousy. Employees are not paid fairly for their hard work, dedication to the job, or for their contributions.

Worked independently or as part of a team without supervision. It was a pleasure going to work.Travel is exciting at first but the pay is so low you cant live or enjoy layovers if you are new. Company is top heavy-Too many over paid managers who need to justify their existence and the Senior Flight Attendants run the Union that creates rules to serve only them because they are rightfully angry their pension was taken in the bankruptcy after they agreed to a pay cut to save the company on the condition they would keep their pension. the company was supposed to return the pension money when they made any profit but the top heavy management would vote themselves raises keeping the money for themselves. The new hires have taken the brunt of this in pay, scheduling, and union protection.I love working for United. My boss is very approachable and my entire team is devoted to our performance not only as developing individuals, but as a holistic team on behalf of the entire company. We all help each other out when we have questions about new tools/processes, and enjoy celebrating and milestones with food and happy hours. The most challenging part of the job is leaving at the end of each day. My position requires me to take very time-sensitive actions, which frequently necessitates me to stay late to address new/unexpected requests.It's a good JOB (mind how I didn't say career) to have if you'd like to be more involved with the aviation industry. I was able to work with good people and see some pretty incredible things. The compensation, however, is almost sub-livable at the start, and the job requires relocation unless you're lucky enough to be based out of your home city. Do more research before applyingGet to work @7:45am, morning meeting on objectives & goals, first call @9am, last call is usually@ 5:30pm unless your on duty then u could get a call as late as 10pm, i learned alot about residential split system diagnosis and repairs, the hardest part was being in 150 degree attics for hours, the most enjoyable part was my coWorkers & the camaraderie that you build. If your 18-21 and don't have any true responsibilities this is perfect for you. But if u have a family depending on your income look elsewhere bc if the AHS (American Home Sheild) calls dry up, be prepared to sit at home not making a dime all day..Highly stressful hostile environment on a very consistent basis.Management is nowhere to be found when needed. Extremely unorganized. A typical day at work includes angry passengers screaming at you for following procedures and little to no support from management. Very low paying. Free flight benefits, but you cant afford to take time off to go anywhere! perfect for someone young with NO bills.Come in on time or early.Never pass an employee with out saying hello.Knowing everyone by first name.Check out the status of the operation, and go where the operation need me the most.Enjoy working with and supporting the employees with there personal problems or company difficulties.The biggest asset to any company is the employees, if they enjoy coming to work and are happy with their jobs, the customer will be happy with their service.A great company to work for with very good health benefits.  Safety minded when working around aircraft and around the airport environment.  Team work is encouraged to minimize in a changing weather and physical surroundings.  Nice to meet people from all walks of life and can be challenging at times to make sure flights are on time.  Must be able to work when service is needed 24/7 and safety not at risk. Must meet physical requirements, example equipment break down or short on staffing.The airline has struggled since the merger, there remains dissension within the ranks and upward mobility is stymied at present. There continues to be significant changes in the company and future job leveling happening.Always exciting days. lots of people to serve and please. I loved interacting with our guests and making sure they felt welcome' I learned a lot about world cultures and customs. immediate adaptability to those cultures is important to maintain good customer service standards.The hardest part was trying to maintain an objective mind, due to the terrorist threat, but still giving excellent customer service.United is a great place to work with friendly and interactive co workers across departments.  The flight benefits are a great reward for the hard work, but make the job worth it.  Management can be a challenge depending on the department, but for the most part it is a company of hard workers who are dedicated to delivering excellent customer service.Balance and multi-tasking is a daily must to run the operation of a major airline company. There are constant and continuous change and it requires quick thinking and adaptability skills to make key decisions.I love working at ORD, it's fast paced and I enjoy working with a lot of the passengers. But management and some of the veterans are extremely rude to not only us their co-workers but the passengers as well, and not very helpful to new agents like myself. Also the things you sit in a class for three and a half weeks to learn basically go right out the window once you are placed on the floor because everyone has a different way of doing things. So if you think your going to ask for help and it's done the way you were trained....forget about it. You end up being more confused than when you started out. Not to mention there is no job flexibility especially during you 90 day probation period. See there's a point system and I started with 4 points and they go like a snap of the finger. I got sick and had to go to the ER and got a point, I was told that it was an unexcused absence even with doctors orders to stay home that day. My daughter had surgery and had to go back to see her surgeon and I was told that that was an unexcused absence. So if you want to keep your job come to work half dead and pray your kids or close family doesn't get ill because your job to them comes first and everything else second.a job that is fast paced and always evolving with the culture around it with many opportunities to move around.

The work is challenging and interesting.material handler, blender, forklift operator,inventory, shipping and receivingMy daily work experience was always very busy and productive. The day always began with a review of the previous shift in QC. This involved a review of the testing of all production of all batches produced and retesting of all out of spec material. This was done internally in my department. This was typically followed by a meeting with production to discuss their production schedule and what will be needed from the qc department. After this meeting, I checked Al of the in use reagents to insure an adequate supply for the up coming production schedule. This was followed by re-calibration of our instruments to insure proper working order. The day began and during the day, I was directly involved with the testing of all incoming raw materials and any optional work that needed to be done for QC management. Management was always very supportive and the individuals I interfaced with from production, other QC technicians and the R &D staff was exceptional, a true team effort. The hardest part of the position was the analysis of out of specification material. You needed to confirm the results and then quarantine the material.

Wrigely's is a great company with great benefits.Wrigley offered several opportunities to progress your competence in the field you worked in. Attended pack expo to further my knowledge of the industry.  It was well worth it.Everyone worked together and help each out out with issues that may have come up in your daily work flow.it was a very busy day from the moment you walked in the door.never a dull moment...Only now more than a decade after resigning to pursue other endeavors do I fully realize how great of a place the Wm Wrigley Jr Company really was.  I always enjoyed coming to work at their near immaculate, landmark facilities.  Our management continually made improvements which always kept our goals new and challenging.  Wrigley continually reinvested in their employees and the company never faced true economic problems during my 12 years there.  It was a great environment filled with great people. They were coworkers but many are now friends whom maintain regular contact.  In fact there are very few people who worked there for any length of time who are not contact through at least a friend of a friend.  It was always easy to work hard for a place that always provided so much.  Unfortunately Wrigley was sold, but I feel blessed that I had the opportunity to work there.best company I ever worked for!!!!  I have learned so much from this company that I can carry with me when I relocate to my new career and companyI really loved working for this company. It was a fun environment, employee appreciation was a big thing here. Benefits and salaries were outstanding. A lot of perk (lunch outing paid for by the company, free candy and gum). However one bad manager or director from outside can ruin all of that. Wrigley is really good about removing these folks but sometimes it takes too long for them to get rid of the sour apple.goals that can not be achieved. No life work balance. Very negative work environment.Great environment with great employees.  Mars has changed the culture but not in a bad way.On a daily basis I operate and trouble shoot the machinery. I believe that a person can learn something everyday. When I get to work I pull the order sheet and tell the team what we are running for the day and how much, where it is ship to or if it is staying in the factory. The hardest part of the job is repeating instructions over and over to the same person every day. The most enjoyable part is I love a challenge and everyday I am faced with a new challenge.Able to work in different environments in all of the buffalo region. It was part time work but worked great for me raising children. It was a great company to work for.

81,2248.0,Sr Scientist III Abbott Molecular R&D,Abbott,4.2,1300.0,"My work at Abbott Labs was very much a typical ""corporate America"" experience. Though it was very predictable and gratifying, I missed the opportunity to have more creative outlets.I performed line maintenance support for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance on Bag fabricators, Fill/seal rotary fillers, Bag overwrap machines, Continuous Sterilizer and Packaging equipment. I completed plc program changes for installation on weekends, I completed all necessary paperwork. this included Cad drawings, ECR's, Printouts of electrical drawings, backups of the plc programs. I worked with production management, engineering, and maintenance personnel. The most enjoyable part of my job was the satisfaction that I earned the respect of all the people that I worked withThe project brought together multiple departments to work on resolving an issue created with a system implementation.  Working with these people helped everyone learn about other departmentsHard working people in need of some management change. Style of management in need for a better strategy to succeed. Too many foreigners trying to fit in a complex culture. Talent and expertise overshadowed by outspokenness.Good pay and benefits.  Too many meetings. Good management.  Flexible with life issues. Co-workers were good. Team environment was good. Time off was good.A great company to work for. Being able to go home everyday knowing you are helping a company that save lives is one of the best feelings in the world.the working environment is good with knowledgeable staff and good management. Sometimes employees are asked to do very difficult tasks in an unreasonable amount of time. and there are some employees that are very cliqueish management will get rid of you if they feel you're damaging their percentages so attention to detail is key.The Rocky Mount site, under Abbott Labs, was a great place to work.  Employees were dedicated to providing quality products to meet customer needs.The company itself is good but the management working in our country is very much biased and the compensation given to the employees is well beyond the expected.Great work place and opportunities foe employee skills enhancements. leader in Pharma companies. Work environment is great and flexibility at work place and courteous colleagues.Provided a comfortable work environmentVery productive peers and managementModerate facilitiesOn site work out facilityOn site cafeteriaEnjoyed my time working thereAbbott is a company that inspires people to excel and learn new and improved techniques in daily job performances. Training and procedures is a must for all.I loved tis job. the only issue was the shifts. They were short on people so a lot of workers were working 12 hour shifts multiple days out the week.I enjoyed working for this company. Overall it's generally a good place to work. liked the people that I worked with they liked being there. The number one reason people stay is because of the benefits for the pension plan and insurance.It is a positive environment to work and prosper in. Communication is very vital at Abbott and they do it well. They are very good about working with your personal schedule and lifeIt was really nice working therepeople there are very friendlyI learned a lot while working thereCo-Workers are pretty freindlyI enjoy each and every moment Management is very goodThere was no typical day at workI really enjoyed my time at Abbott Laboratories, which was the catalyst for expanding my engineering ""toolbox"" and learning different aspects of the business.I love my job and I love how Abbott balances family and work life. The management is amazing and makes sure that if you want to learn and grow in your career then opportunities are given.The people are very helpful and knowledgeable.   I would love to work with Abbott again. The facility has a full gym to work out and the cafeteria is open at night.Terrible to move from temp to hired. Worked as a temp for almost a year and there were no opportunities to get hired in. They were cutting jobs when I went elsewhere.I learned to processed and inspect various stents. I was certified with different machinery and tooling. I enjoyed working with people who speak different languages.

85,2252.0,Assistant Materials Scientist-3D Visualization,Argonne National Laboratory,4.2,81.0,"Engaging, diverse and multicultural University like environment.The APS Beamline hosts users from all around the world and is the brightest X-ray source in the world. Every day continues to be an education.Argonne hires a lot of foreign  employees, so the best part about this job would be learning about all the different cutlers that are present here.I did my summer intern at Argonne. Its a great place to work. Huge number of cool projects are happening on daily basis. Lots of learn. Higher management is very helpful.Weekly meeting to discuss progress on various projects.  Learned what other professional were working on and the progress and problems they en-counted.  .Group participation in addressing problems en-counted by the other groups.  Worked mostly alone with little supervision.  however, assistance was always available.  The hardest part of the job was leaving at the end of a day.  The most enjoyable was returning to the job the next dayFortunate to learn a lot at a young age during an internship. Made you feel very welcome and always allowed you to seek new opportunities. Also a great location for those who like the city of Chicago.At ANL, I enjoy my co-workers and most of the researchers I help support as an HP tech. There are good benefits, job secuirty at least for me is great (Unionized), and my direct supervisor is wonderful. My largest issues stem from my group management. There is an overall feeling from many of the techs that our opinions are not heard and our feelings dismissed. While this might not be entirely the case this seems to be a common feeling among both the good workers and the bad workers. This could stem from lack of communication from our upper management about how our issues are actually addressed instead of just being told no. There is also a lack of training and continuing education at the tech level. While many don't care about having this there are a few of us that do and would like to be given that opportunity. Others issues stem from the way techs are treated by researchers we support on a day to day basis. Many of us end up being buffers between the researcher and our supervisors. This is emotionally exhausting. Many attempt to do things behind their area HP's back and are upset when a tech goes to their boss to ensure that whatever the researcher is wanting to do is safe, covered by appropriate work control docs and RWPs. Many have no care or no understanding of contamination control and argue with techs if they are told they are doing something unsafely. While we don't have Ph.Ds we are experts in our right in our field. Over the last 2 years many researchers have gotten better, but I still find there is a general lack of respect for safety personnel in general. As an hourly  more... worker, work life balance is hard especially since alternative schedules were taken away from us by upper management. Argonne as a whole (not just looking at my little world) seems to be an excellent place to work. Every group has their issues. I have no opinion of upper upper laboratory management.  lessWorking at the lab is unique. The culture is so relaxed, because the focus here is about the science and results. It's not a strict environment at all. So, self-motivation and initiative will get you far here.The coworkers are down to earth and friendly. They are proud of the work they do. That's what it's like working here: doing great work and taking pride in it.Argonne is located in Lemont, which is a far southwest suburb of Chicago. This is probably my largest gripe with this employment: the commute is difficult.This place has great people. Good salary, nice location, great compensation, in Chicago area, lots of food and entertainment not far awayWhile attending Purdue University I worked as an intern and assigned to the Decision and Information Science Division. I designed power supplies for special instruments used in collecting data for energy conservation. This was very exciting because projects were experimental and on the leading edge.A typical day at work is very busy. There is no room to grow nor any employment opportunities after the internship. You mostly work alone with very little supervision. You do learn about what scientific breakthroughs Argonne has discovered and are currently working on. You also meet different people on a daily basics.The potential for personal and professional growth is highly dependent on who you work for. Most PIs are only interested in advanced their personal career and are likely to treat you as a technician, not a young scientific mind. However, there are a few gems that are wonderful people and scientists. I would highly recommend looking at what happened with the careers of the previous postdocs before working for someone at ANL.As a radiation safety trainer and an HP technician, I interacted with hundreds of people from around the country and around the world.  Management is caring and focused on Argonne's objectives while also aware that those employed here have lives outside of work.I've found Argonne to be extremely helpful in furthering my professional development.  The pay and benefits are much better than academic postdoc positions and you're surrounded by world-class researchers and equipment.  The downside is that getting hired to a permanent position here is extremely difficult.The editors offered useful advice concerning effective writing. My writing skill improved substantially from their advice. The project teams worked closely together to deliver results.I only worked there as an intern so I don't have much to say. I enjoyed the culture I worked in, and the people I worked with. The engineers I was working with were highly motivated and exceptionally intelligent, making the internship very productive for my development.I worked with a team to support the lab with rigging and transporting of scientific equipment.• Installed specialized lab equipment requiring advanced skills for hoisting/ transport within facilities and onsite• Worked on lift plans for critical lifts with an emphasis on safety• Proficient in safe working loads and standards for all rigging including chains, chokers, slings, spreader beams, and other associated hardwareI would get tickets for troubles from the Service desk and work with a crew of Desktop support admins. All of the crew were extremely talented and all would help you at any given moment. The company was a National Laboratory so every year there was a possibility that the government would be shut down. Management was good as to not micromanage and allowed you to work unabated, as long as within Service Agreement parameters.Excellent place to work. Excellent environment. Excellent People. Many good thing to learn. Excellent Challenges.I highly recommend this place to work.ANL is a great place to work to advance your career with hands on training.  It is also good to take advantage of the opportunity to further your education.I love working at Argonne National Laboratories.  The people are nice and they really care about making sure that you understand what you are doing.  If you are on staff you have great benefits, but as a contractor you have no benefits except what you get from your staffing agency (almost nothing).It was not an exciting place to work. It was monotonous work.  Had good compensation.  There was not much supervision.  A lot of shift changes that made it hard to balance work/home.","10,000+",Chicago,Lemont,IL,2016-10-20T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/93dc4e14-00e5-4c6b-b454-08c9ba9970b0?mescoid=1900260001001&jobPosition=21,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The position I  hold has little to do with my legal education.Currently I am managing the event space for Microsoft. Over the years, I have helped Microsoft and CBRE combine the event management position and successfully managed close to a 1000 events last year, ranging from 10 people to a 1000 people. While I do like what I do, I'm hoping to find something that will put my Legal Education into practice.CBRE is a great place to work, given the right opportunities.  I was exposed to a wide variety of situations, providing me a platform on which to grow & learn.My co-workers were very serious about their responsibilities and focused on providing accurate, timely information and reports. I learned a lot about new software and new supporting excel reports that provided excellent documentation. Every day was busy from beginning to end. The team that I was a part of was understaffed for all of the responsibility placed on it. There was too much required of every member in the amount of time that was available. The team management was too focused on the time allotted for each function to take into account when the out of the ordinary requests came in or when there were issues within everyday functions. There was no flexibility and ""your fault"" or ""your problem"" were common responses to requests for assistance.It is hard to get motivate to come to work everyday for this company. In the department I work in we haven't been properly staffed for more than two years. Managers and Supervisor will listen to you and disregard any of your ideas to make it a better work environment. Many will tell you it's even hostile.The benefits are absolutely horrible. You must meet a deductible before the insurance will pay for anything. You only come to work here if this is your last hope of finding work.Great work place with tons of upside potential, that allows any employee to proceed.In the years at CBRE , I have been mentored and learned tremendous amounts of knowledge.Typical work day always starts with a safety meeting, from there we get our daily tasks and are able to speak to management with any concerns we may have. This is a company that is wanting you to further your career and climb the ladder. Hardest part of the job is being able to complete the tasks assigned to you that day on time with all the restrictions on certain accounts.I learned a lot in this company it was with diversity of team and fun some times happy hours big fun. and well experienced  and organized  team.Good opportunities to improve a somewhat outdated system. Very good schedule : M-F dayshift. Limited opportunities for advancement.Maintain major speadsheet for sourcing of National Bank. Worked directly with VPN in establishing the necessary information  need for contracts established. Set up and managed  file room.Databasing and market research mostly. Really enjoyed the people I worked with fortunately. Would love the opportunity to join them full-time. Overall great experience.Have always loved working for CBRE. Great hours, Great Benefits, Great people to work with. They also provide continued education via online courses.I loved the people I worked with.  This was a good location for me and offered a lot of diversity with job responsibilities.Property Management Company that I worked was processing work orders from The Hartford Financial Services. Clients would call or submit a work order for their location for temperature issues, plumbing, elevators not working. Light bulbs need to be replaced.  Any property issues I would process the work order and contact the Landlord / Tenant of that location. I would also follow up with the client to make sure that the request was completed to their satisfaction. Management was easy to work with. They had your back on any decision that you made.Co-workers were also helpful we worked as a team. Communication was the key to make the workplace pleasant.The health care plans cost a lot. The. Yearly cost before plan paid any thing was almost 6000. He'd weekends off and not on call.Loved my position but unfortunately JP Morgan Chase was downsizing and my position was eliminated leaving only two engineers for all of Eastern WA. I was offered other positions within CBRE if i moved to another state which i did not want to do.In a typical day of work you never know what you are going to be working on, either you can spend your whole shift behind a computer or 30 minutes turning a screwdriver.  When there's actual work we all think safety first. Manager are good and well trained some other are just ok. Co workers are great cant complain. cant say there is one other than sitting around for long periods.A typical day at CBRE is wonderful. My coworkers invited me as family the moment I started working there. The feeling was amazing knowing that someone really cared on how I felt. I've learned that every voice matters working in the building here at CBRE. Management encourages their team to strive to keep a continuous smile on our faces. The most enjoyable part here at CBRE is that you interact with different people and that they show their appreciation by awarding snacks and great compliments on a daily basis.CBRE, Inc. is a great place to work for. Ever-changing and updating, this company is filled with good leadership and gives back to the community.Overall, very flexible with work/life balance. Getting parts/materials make doing your job difficult at times. Coworkers work well with one another.Great place to work, management felt a bit out of touch at crucial times. Great people to work with room to grow. There are many tools that are available for successCBRE is a OK company. Culture is fluid depending on your account. Lots of potential to move around and up.

The organization strives to provide excellent patient care and to be at the FOREFRONT OF MEDICINE.  Everyone is kind and a pleasure to work with.The University of Chicago is an environment that is constantly changing.. The workload is fast and may change within a moments notice. There is always something that need immediate attention.This is what I like about Working for the University of Chicago.  My focus is manly customer service and my customers are the President of the school, faculty, staff and students. However the downfall of the position that I hold as Facility Coordinator is that I can only hire students to work in the department and they don't usually have any work experience so they lack the skill set needed.A typical day at The University of Chicago starts off with a very peaceful and pleasant environment that allowed me to flow right into the work day. I learned from my colleagues in  the Metabolism program to pay close attention to details and to always go over any unclear instructions. I was very pleased with the relationship my co-workers and I established and that was we always worked in our solution as team players. The most challenging part of my job was working with heads of departments and programs but being the level headed and diplomatic individual I am this only grew my people skills. The most enjoyable part of my job was all of my staff that I worked for did not limit me and allowed me to manage and coordinate the committee with out hesitation trusting my work ethic and judgment.The University is very large and decentralized. Thus, many employees transfer between departments. The University focuses first on faculty, then on students. Often, general staff don't receive a lot of attention.Nice company to work for. Very please to be a part of the growth of the company. I would recommend working for this company.Loved working here, only temporary though. Very hard to become employed here. Usually employee were post grad of U of C.They try to accommodate what they could for their employees, including shuttles for the parking areas. The work environment was professional, and they did what they can to ensure HIPAA standards were maintained.I clean the washrooms in the hospital and make sure that soap and tissue is stocked and available for the patients. I vacuum, wash windows in the lobby and also make sure it is presentable. My co-workers are the best we help each other any way we can the true meaning of team work makes the dream work. The hardest part of the job is keeping it clean with all the traffic in and out of the facility. The enjoyable part of the job is the nice people I meet on a daily basis while doing my job.This University is filled with the most brilliant minds and driven people I have ever met. I am incredibly impressed with everyone I meet and work with.I did my graduate work at the University of Chicago. The programs there are very competitive and prepared me well for my future career as a research scientist.

I observed multiple different lab procedures and then performed them myself. Overall, I learned a lot from this experience and it was quite enjoyable.The University of Chicago is great place to work. They understand the importance of work to life balance, and my annual salary matched the cost of living in the area. There are many opportunities for advancement.Getting right to work, completing my daily tasks and working a  team player. Making sure my work is completed and correct, before leaving for the day.The University is a beautiful campus with great academic minds, good services, and wonderful amenities.  I would highly recommend working here if you have the chance.We are a self-sufficient clinical area. We strive on patient satisfaction/engagement and have an open door policy. The hardest part of my job is prioritizing exams that need to be done. the most enjoyable part of my job is participating in building the moral with my teammates and Leaders.Hard working and fun,get along with co-workers and management. Very knowledgeable of what needs to get done and room for growth.Beautiful campus, including the Gothic architecture, tulips in the spring, and green space. . + Rigorous academics taught by excellent faculty, some of whom are Nobel Prize winners. The university is with no doubt an outstanding educational  & professional work institution. If you want to come to this ""brainy"" university just to study and do nothing else, I'd highly encourage you to do so. The university is great, the professors are great, and the administration is also great as well  the employers.Processes in place to achieve goals. Some ethical issues with leadership may have been addressed by now. Dependable and knowledgeable staff. Tendency to seek professional guidance in the form of consultants when necessary. Showing dedication towards positive change.I really enjoyed working here, the work culture and the technologies they were using were really interesting.I got good scope to learn here and also implement what I have already learned.Most of their applications were on .NET.","10,000+",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/c0325d92-0998-4f25-aadc-e46244f8ece1?mescoid=1900247001001&jobPosition=23,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Each day was fun and wanted to come to work.Professional and exciting work environment! Recommend this company for all career levels. This company does not disappoint.good overall atmosphere friendly work environment allot of good people and great leadership. Its a little hard adjusting at first but once you work here for a while is all good.Exposure to world renowned projects, but career growth and compensation is very slow for the bottom level. Company wants top talent but does not want to pay for it.  Promotional raises are the equivalent of a standard annual review raise.Razor thin business margins, no strategic vision and investment in future direction of company.  Business limited to a handful of clients.Enjoyable work place and co-workers. Hardest part of the job was when projects are slow. I am used to working multiple jobs at once.Enjoyed working with my co-workers, and worked well as a team.Hardest part is when the job comes to a close. The days went by quickly. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing it completed.Since this position was a contract the company was required to comply with evaluations of their client. MWH was cooperative with client when a personality conflict arose between client employees and MWH employee. Not at all helpful to work towards resolution of issue.Boys club with not a lot of room to move around. Company only cares about bottom line and people who directly work with clients.Company would re-organize every couple of years. Management did not share a clear view of the future.  Not very innovative.I had a great work experience at MWH where I used my knowledge as an Engineer and applied it to Projects. Great team efforts and it was enjoyable experience...Overall a good company. There is a lack of management at times and the older folks don't give the new folks to rise. You need to know the right people to move up.One of the most influential and meaningful job experiences of my life. My colleagues were competent professionals, always seeking to complete projects to their fullest capabilities.Interesting company with good employees and international diversity.In the document service department at MWH, it was a fast paced work environment that I enjoyed working in. I enjoyed the day to day interaction with the clients. What I learned most from MWH was that not only providing quality work was important, but having and displaying excellent customer service skills are a must and the backbone to a successful company.I got an opportunity to learn quite a bit about Compliance.  I also got experience Recruiting Engineers which was very interesting.A typical day at MWH for me was walking around the entire building asking my co-workers if they need any help weather it be scanning, copying, or filing. I learned to be more open to responsibility and meeting new people. The people I worked with were fantastic! I could ask questions without the fear of looking silly. Everyone could be fun when they wanted to be but they are also very dedicated to their job. The hardest part of the job was trying to juggle all the tasks I was given in one day, but throughout the day I could get it done. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able not only to talk with my co-workers but being able to connect with them. Also being able to have a regular conversation not always being about work, but sports, news and media, at appropriate times, of course.Strong safety culture. A typical day was composed of interaction with the subcontractors, safety walks and reports, toolbox talks, various other safety related paperwork.Great Company but after I fulfilled my contract I returned home for required surgery.Worked your solid 8, sometimes had to work more than 40hrs a week, great people, but always layoff people once a year after reorg. Some engineers are overworked, meaning that they charge their 40hrs to a project then have to work on business pursuits after.Best company to work for wages. people etc.The Management is excellent, the pay and benefits are in range","5,001 to 10,000",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-10-29T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/10bf1dda-6e31-4bb7-b8dd-668866479741?mescoid=1700187001001&jobPosition=25,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

My co-workers assist me anytime I needed them.This was an awesome place to work because I got to work with actual scientific artifacts and digitization equipment. The downfall is there is zero job security.I loved being a steward of the museum. what a great privlidge! A typical day is hanging pictures in an office or locating and fixing a leak in a collections area.Management gave me the freedom to schedule my workdaysmy cohorts were all great!Hadest part of the job is working in a collections environmentmost enjoyable part of the job is all the people I got to deal with day to day.I worked in the Exhibits Department as a maintenance/production Technician.  Each day I worked on several assignments, repairing, maintaining, or cleaning different items or areas in several galleries.  I also helped with staging new temporary exhibits, or de-staging exhibits that are leaving the museum.  I worked with many other skilled co-workers.  I worked on site, or in the woodshop, where I learned many small tool skills, as well as worked with large machine tools.  I used my artistic skills as a painter, in the paint shop.  Very cool to work maintaining the animatronic characters throughout the museum.   Sometimes assignments were very challenging, but this helped me to find creative solutions, and not be afraid of any surprises.  I appreciated working at the Field, as it was an outlet for me to make use all my skills as an artist and woodshop worker, all the time.  The Museum has always been a place of learning and education for all past and future generations, and for me to be a part of this, was very fulfilling.  My only regret is that I left.This was a total educational experience for me.  I learned hands-on about the hospitality industry through catering, equipment, budget analysis and set-up requests.The Museum dedicates itself to teaching people of all ages about science. It is a fun place to work and you gain skills such as teamwork, patience, confidence, and communication. In a usual work day I would arrive early to check in and wait for early campers to be dropped off. I would check in each camper as they arrived and make sure they got to the room they needed to be in. Each week I was assigned to a different classroom as a helper and aid to the campers as they performed science experiments. There would be an outdoor break for lunch that I would supervise and sometimes work handing out snacks. At the end of the day I would make sure each child was picked up by their parent and would wait with the campers whose parents were late. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with all the children and teaching them new things about science. The hardest part was learning a sense of responsibility for so many children at once. Overall it was a wonderful first work experience that taught me many valuable skills I can apply to any jobA typical day working at the Field Museum for me is to work on the museum's main insect collection.  For me this means to identify, sort, and rehouse specimens in preparation for entry into the collection.  I have learned to identify and research the various taxonomic groups that describe insect phylogenies.Scanned items (which need identification),supply register change,assigned breaks and cleared voids.Attended work on time everyday, Liked working with the public,A typical day at work consist of working along side other internsLearned to clean archaic material. Most enjoyable part of the job is the employees.No where else on Earth can you see a 65,000,000 million year old dinosaur right next to a glowing fish or a brand new children's play lab.  This place has something for all people.There are many places to explore, interesting exhibits, fun co- workers. Meeting people from all over the world. The hardest part of the job is Inventory.Observed all exhibits visitors and Premiers, Provider detailed information.In This job people talked more then they worded. they place it all on two or three people. Co Workers talked about and started fights with each other. The Hardest part of this job was getting along with my co workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was Cleaning and staying out of troubleManament was never there to get a review, Coworkers were fun and helpful to customers. wasnt anything hard about the job. My most enjoyable p[art of the job was helping older people and i learned how to be a supervisormoves to slow. other than tht its ok. the people are great. cons have no to be not enough hours. everyday was the same thing. it was liers there just wasnt for meGreat environment if you like interacting with kids and meeting new people from different states and/or countries. Friendly, welcoming and helpful staff. I've always worked with others around me but this job gave me an opportunity to experience on my own So I've learned a great deal of closing out registers on my own, making sure each draw is properly balanced at the end of each day. Hardest part of the job is when traffic is slow.

I loved the company I worked for and enjoyed my time there and my co-workers.Position was temp contract for reviewing medical insurance data base.  Potentially good company although management was in process of realignment in department worked.From my very first day at Open Systems I received no training what so ever. Management was nice and wanted to see me succeed but they did very little to provide me with any extra tools to do so. You must get there early and leave late, and every day is busier than the last. If you do something that is good you must keep moving because everyone but you will have forgotten about it by the next day. The co-workers were very pleasant but they are very busy as well which makes them less inclined to help you as needed with no formal training. I learned to work hard, be independent, find answers for myself, and always show determination.This company saw the evolution of business where technology was concerned and provided an innovative option for record-keeping. For companies in the Bahamas that opted to have files electronically converted, Open Systems is able to facilitate the transition. In the business world, companies are always evolving technologically thus making a small company like Open Systems viable and successful.The new people who trained with me and the other teams were very nice and so helpful. My experienced teammates were just the opposite. I miss the bigger paycheck, but not the attitude.Great people, great vision, great environment.  This company is employee-focused and has a passion to make a positive difference in everything they do.Got more hands on experience dealing with Cisco and other network equipment that I didn't before.

As with any merger, positions were eliminated and changes abound. There is no doubt in my mind that they will get it all lined out within a few years and be stronger then ever. Training, co-workers, and management were all top notch. Even though my position was eliminated, they were fantastic through the entire process.Since I started for a Temp agency with the possibility to be hired on full time I work just a few days shy of 9 months without benefits. I was hoping to hold a full time position with the company but after 9 months they said that my services were no longer needed due to not having enough work at the Port of Georgetown. The local management at LafargeHolcim was excellent but the companies daily operations are ever changing.   I really like the position but didn't like the fact that you could be let go at anytime.everything at my job is good, I can not say a bad thing about my job, I am ready to may a change, just to see what is out there. i have learned many job task and gained alot of work knowlege , I have ran maintance jobs , production an a daily basis, I have eight guys working for me at all times. I fill out evaluations on all my direct reports, quarterly . I have gained knowledge in controlroom to learn the process in and out, I look at power cost in kwpt. I have a great deal of time in quality control.I was on the Holcim side of the merger and we adopted the Lafarge benefits model probably because it shifts cost from the company to the employees.

For the time that I for MB Mortgage, I found the company culture to be fantastic. The employees were very helpful, friendly, and it felt like you were all family. My supervisors were great and they made sure that I was trained well and made me feel like I was part of there team. If I ever get another chance to work for MB Mortgage, I would jump on that opportunity as fast as I can.Nice people to work with.  Treats their employees well with lots of perks.

They take care of their people, you can have a career growth with this company.Great place to work, awesome benefits.  Family friendly environment to work in.  Wonderful people to work with.  Process to be hired in takes a long time, probably the biggest negative about the job, but after thats done youre all set.The hardest part of the job is meeting the minimum production standards based on the area I live and work in together with the climate conditions which slow the real estate business community.Maintained incoming calls.• Provided exceptional customer service.• Knowledgeable of all products and services including but not limited to ACH transfers,Savings bonds, Checking and Savings Accounts.• Consulted customers with problem solving solutions.• Assessed needs of clients and suggest /promote alternative products and services.• Confirm sales.• Answered all inquiriesnice place to work if your starting out in the bank. They do not advance you though. if you are looking to grow and advance, this is not the place for you.Overall, a typical day for me was bringing in new business as a personal banker.  Processing transactions, cross selling products, maintaining account, etc.During my time there they wanted me to work outside of normal business hours without pay. I enjoyed my co-workers whole-heartedly. The management at the s wacker location was very very terrible. They had favoritism and only the ones the new management liked got promoted even though they didn't deserve it.I have never been where there was such lack of training. You were given a book and looked at it for two hours and then thrown on the phone and expected to know mortgages like a pro. You were not allowed to say ""yes mam or no sir"" to show respect as it was OLD SCHOOL. You were not allowed to give answers that could actually help someone who needed to know what programs were out there that they may qualify for like HARP. Because if they did not qualify the bank could be sued. REALLY. What a crock. You were to answer and talk on the phone no more than three minutes. If you went over that time you were talked to about the fact that someone stayed on hold. You can not always resolve someones problem in three minutes. They treated one girl horribly and then fired her because the supervisor who also got fired decided to tell stories on her and to lie to the VP to save her self from what was really happening. So no this place is not some where to be proud to say you work. Not any longer.Management needs to be able to offer more assistance and the proper training. Not enough people in each department. When other departments need help you are expected to help them and complete your own work, yet there is no help available when you fall behind.Salary is to low for MLO, the underwriters are the best in the business, everyone is helpful and team players. great group of people to work with I enjoy clearing the files to close so I can see my borrowers face it is like someone gave them a million dollars my customers service is key.I worked at MB Financial and enjoyed my time there. It wasn't the best job I ever had and it wasn't the worst. You asked for 20 words minimum and I had that, so I don't know why it's making me type more, but here I am typing more.People only get ahead by schmoozing the upper management, not by the work they do. Most co-workers are nice but management promotes a cut-throat environment. Management promotes treating customers horribly instead of correcting the many problems with accounts.Interaction with Senior Management and their direct reports has created relationships with one another.  Ability to work on difference projects outside of the scope of the EVP I report to has made a tremendous impact in meeting and learning how to work with different level of individuals.Great place to work, I loved my manager, unfortunately the pay was a lot less than I needed to have a household.. would go back",,Chicago,Rosemont,IL,2016-10-30T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/9e71e994-3666-4ed5-ab4b-18b0e03e15ed?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=33,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
98,2265.0,Bat Biologist,SWCA Environmental Consultants,3.3,12.0,"As a seasonal archaeologist, the project goals were clear and additional information regarding the project area were available upon asking.  Overall, the Tucson office had a great morale and work ethic .This company seems to have a high turnover, maybe more so in the Phoenix corporate office.  In every office there are people that should be fired and people who are worth retaining.  Trouble is, the fickle management doesn't seem to know the difference.  Good employees seem to be dismissed way too often; even when it doesn't seem to make sense. Just don't count on job security.Horrible place to work, no leadership, no advancement , no team work.  Seasonal work. No set processes or procedures.  Benefits are mediocre. Employees at a certain level are not held accountable.SWCA was a lousy company to work for.  Project Directors regularly threw underlings under the proverbial bus in order to cover their own ineptitudes.  Good archaeologists & biologists were regularly replaced & overshadowed by less skilled, but more ambitious & cutthroat coworkers.  SWCA also regularly overcharged clients, purposely did shoddy fieldwork, & arbitrarily changed pay.  Out of the several Cultural Resource Management firms I have worked for, as well as other places of employment in other fields, SWCA was easily the most unethical, devious, & all around negative work environment.This job is really fun and the work load is just enough were you don't feel overwhelmed. Although the work is project based, so some times it gets really slow. For example I had a couple weeks where I only worked 5-8 hrs. The Management is awesome.The best part about SWCA is that they have the technical expertise that provides the client a high quality environmental review in accordance with all regulatory requirements followed. The team works long hard hours.  The pay is lower on the scale, but the offset is in other benefits such as health insurance, investment options, and profit sharing. The name sake of the firm is very much involved in projects in most, if not all offices. SWCA is a large firm, but with a small firm feel.a typical day at SWCA start at seven o'clock the morning, driving to project area. This could be and energy location currently producing or a proposed energy location. we've been conduct the biological survey required for the client. The hardest part of his job was having to identify plants by their scientific names. The best part of his job was identifying plants by their scientific names.You can learn a lot if you are willing, a lot of very talented people at this office in Houston.  The management is fair and understanding.Its all right It just does not provide enough hours needed to make a living. If you get hired on part time its more interment so its when ever they need you. Which makes it hard to find a second job and be far to both employers.This company only used me certain times when projects came up in the area in which I went to school. The projects were usually very short and only required start up work on my end.I get to work and review what the day will bring. Checking mail and review my things to do list.

102,2269.0,Scientist I,Steris Corporation,3.6,54.0,"This company is growing and 99% of the time they are fair and a great company to work for. Co-workers are great, management is good, and work/life is excellent.I have worked here 10 years and have seen a lot of change take place. Management continues to try to communicate with labor and improve the environment and make jobs easier. They want us to work as a team. There are nay-sayers, but everyone chooses their attitude. They want to develop their employees. The hardest part of the job is to communicate effectively to everyone. The most enjoyable part is the opportunity to learn and grow. It does stink that they just sold a large amount of their product line. Not sure of my future here.A typical day at work was always busy.  I learned new skills such as advancing my Word and Excel knowledge, making travel arrangements, and scheduling clients for training classes.  The hardest part of the job was the manager of the department could be difficult to work with, but not horrible.I had a great 17 years at STERIS, and enjoyed a lot of success.  STERIS has  a good culture and great people.  FDA issues prompted re-organization and cut backs.A great place to learn the technicalities of medical equipment planning.  Long days spent in front of a computer.  Not strong in creative projects.  More technical than creative.  Awesome benefits and job security.Management doesn't listen to any concerns raised by subordinates, and design decisions are chosen based on job title not the the merit of the design.  There is no hope of promotion here since management hires old friends from their previous company into leadership roles.  These promotions are not always merited or accepted amongst other employees in the department.  The displays of favoritism lower moral in the department.There is no project planning and all projects are severely behind schedule and have inadequate resources allocated. Employees do not feel empowered to perform their jobs, there is a high level of apathy, and unhappiness among the employees; all of these things contribute to the high turnover rate at Steris.I worked with a group of four with Steris Corporation for my capstone senior design project. The management at Steris Corporation was very communicative and helpful, and it appeared that they treated their employees well.I started with this company just after it began.  Now they are all over the world. I was employee #23. Now there are thousands of associates.I learned so much at this business, and am grateful I was part of the original team.  I was allowed to be involved with decisions for acquiring equipment, in installing new computer systems.  My main job was accounts payable; reconciling two computer systems daily, checks, and as we grew I had two people working under me.There was no hard part, as the CFO was my direct contact for 3 years and still had direction after a manager became my superior.I loved this company, and I would not have left except to join my husband who moved to Nevada.A typical day would include making 6,000 biological and chemical indicators every day. I was trained in other departments shortly after starting because of my easy ability to learn. I would have to move 1,000+ pounds of pallets. I also had to be exceptionally sterile. I was in charge of making, checking, packing, and documenting all aspects of the product. My management was great, and though some of my coworkers were not team players, I still enjoyed my time with them and had very little discourse. The hardest part of the job was getting into the swing of the fast pace, and the most enjoyable part was being paid to work out!Overall, great experience. Slow decision-making at times but for all the right reasons. Would like to experience work in divisions other than strictly manufacturing however.Steris is a great company to work for. very knowledgeable team.My typical day usually consisted of checking my que to see if there were any new service calls and if there were I would then call those customers and schedule a service repair time. if there were no new service calls then I would call customer to schedule preventative maintenance(PM). Then I would follow up customer that had recent repairs done and check on the status of their repair also ask them if they had any questions about their bill.STERIS is a productive and casual place to work. I interned there and learned many valuable skills that will help me during my career path.management has no clue what is really going on at work. only worried about paper and fake numbers.over good people and just poor management.Safety is the number one priority overall. Traveling for the job is a natural part of everyday life as a National Specialist. A typical day would consist of arriving at the facility prior to surgery to be there as added support during surgery. after cases concluded for the day, I would begin troubleshooting of the system or systems in order to narrow down the root cause or causes of the problems. in the 6 years I have been there, I have positioned myself to try and learn as much about the company as a whole, not just isolate myself to one individual department. The most difficult part of the week, is trying to be in three or sometimes four states at the same time. My schedule is typically booked a month to two months in advanced. The most enjoyable part of the job was the hands on education and the employees I get to work with overall.The best part of the job was the laid back atmosphere, but the hardest part was being a temp. Sometimes when there was so many new temps passing through it made it hard to work, because so many people were getting hired and fired. Everyone tries to be better than everyone else and nobody just concentrated on the work that needed to be done. Some of the Team Leaders were really helpful but some just didn't care about the quality, it was just how many parts were made. I learned to keep to myself until the work I've done is completed. Every day was different but always the same in a sense.Assisted up to 6 sales representatives in 7 states to educate their clients in the correct, safe use of the company products.Spoke at several workshops and conferences on subjects related to infection control issues as well as contagious diseases and their growing resistance to antibiotics.A typical day at work requires long hours. The hardest part of the job is adapting to wearing a full-face breathing mask.At STERIS Corporation, I was initially hired to create digital illustrations for their new HAMO endoscope line. These illustrations would depict on how to put the scopes together through wallcharts, Illustrated instructions and also being able to cross check the part on the part assessment sheets. My contract was extended to assist with the technical and instructional literature for a tutorial program for a medical reprocessing machine, Human Machine Interface (HMI®) Simulation. After the project was completed, my contract was extended further to create the package designs, labels, and instructions for two separate biological indicators. While working on these projects, I also helped in the creation of a logo design for the same medical device washer that I assisted with earlier that year.No growth opportunities.  Stagnant work place.  Executive mgmt rules by fear to get projects completed which are never on time nor on target.  Management does not practice what they preach.Productive work culture. Everyone is very friendly and works together to achieve company goals.This company offered so many great things to it's employees which I feel boosted the moral.  There was a gym onsite with no membership fees.   There  were various kitchenettes around the building which offered free coffee/tea.  Great,great company.",,Chicago,Libertyville,IL,2016-12-03T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/5f5dea9e-d1b6-443b-802f-1d50716f7091?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=3,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

As a control room operator I was able to see the company from various sides and was happy with the time I spent working there.Enjoyed working at STEC, had an awesome working environment, great co-workers, and an easy going learning environment. Loved being pretty autonomous and having a laid back work schedule. Never once was asked to do anything I had never done or wasn't willing to do myself. Had a great mentorship program and enjoyed being paired up with the two most senior Techs on site. Pay and benefits were great. The promotion system was very easy and straightforward, potential for growth within the company was exceptional. Overall an awesome experience and one I will hold all my future employers in comparision to.The plant I worked at could have been a great place to work.  The culture is not conducive to a functional work place.  There are a handful of employees that carry the majority of the load on a consistent basis.  Those who do not perform also complain to management consistently and to eachother.  Mangement has done very little to rectify this situation and as a result many of the talented employees have moved on.There is no training and many times others are too busy to help you learn. The work load varies, sometimes you have far too much to do others you are desperate for work. Management doesn't care about their employees, you are defiantly disposable. You'll also be asked to do some work during your holidays and vacations, I've seen some work full days while on vacation. The work can be interesting and many of the people are nice.Great new modern office with great location. Very smart and talented people. Decent benefits. Management cares about their employees.A typical day of work includes opening mail, sending back packages, running errands around Chicago, researching activities for the family.My direct manager is ""too busy"" to train me and as a result I feel neglected and not a part of the team.The hardest part of my job is constantly looking for specific projects to work on from my direct manager. I like to keep busy and use my time effectively, but it is hard when I have to ask for things to do every day.The most enjoyable part of my job is the work/life balance and the consistent pay checks.Great place to work in Operations of a Wind Farm.

There are lot of opportunities to switch teams as per your aspiration.I was an Intern at TransUnion and only worked their for 10 weeks.  My experience was very good and I enjoyed everyone I worked with and company was very good and professional.I'm not a good person to ask as my job is being phased out.  We had a great team that is not appreciated by the current executives.TransUnion was originally formed in 1968 as a holding company for the railroad leasing organization, Union Tank Car Company. The following year, it acquired the Credit Bureau of Cook County, which possessed and maintained 3.6 million card files.[2] In 1981, a Chicago-based holding company The Marmon Group acquired TransUnion for approximately $688 million.[4][5] Almost thirty years later, in 2010,Loved my hours from 5:00 am to 1:30pm.

Enjoyed working and being with everyone at the company.Regardless of an associates position you can be assured their day is busy.  Whether your analyzing data, preparing customer decks/presentations, following up on opps, prospecting, pipeline management.  TU support teams are busy assisting new clients through the on-boarding process as well as supporting existing customers.  TU believes in celebrating associates success through out the year.  Eligible associates have the opportunity to travel internationally for a year end celebration.TU is an advocate for giving back to the community.  TU is a great company to work.lack of management involvement with their subordinates. Expectations were unclear which resulted in a stressful relationship.People who work at TU, particularly in Chicago, tend to stay at TU forever- 10, 20, even 30 years. Rather than creating a team of people who are great at their roles, this has bred a corporate culture of complacency and mediocrity. There is little urgency in the work that people do and few incentives to be great at it. People work their 40 hour weeks and go home, regardless of pressing issues, crushing backlogs, and client commitments.Great place to work with amazing teammates and challenging work!A company that focuses on being an information company for good!The international marketing team was intelligent and wonderful to work with. Extreme attention to detail and excellent interpersonal skills are a must-have to flourish and enjoy this job and the environment.In TransUnion I learn Custumer Services, Public Relations, Logistics, And Financial activities.My co-workers were so nicer and very intelligent.The hardest thing was to learn how to speak in from of a lot of people because I was very shy. Working for TransUnion was very interesting and productiveA professional but casual environment. Management have always been helpful rather than simply demanding. Friendly relations with co-workers. Variety of technologies to work with.Good location, next to Union Station.  Nice office environment.  Good people.  Management is mixed.  Need to stay on top of technology and contribute.his was a never ending job, you always had something to do because we had millions of customers to service. It was a very good job that gave you many experiences. The job was always offering new things to help make your job easierwell run institution with many opportunities for staff advancements, great deal of perks to utilize as well, caring coworkersCompany is ever trying to play catchup to the competition. Their products are not cutting edge any longer and now lack stability. The lack of focus on quality products and a push for sales versus satisfaction within the management team has been narrow-minded and will most likely come back to haunt them in the near future. The expectations of employees is unrealistic and management tends to not stand employees when they know their products and vision are the issues.  The company is very competitive with pay and the  benefits are outstandingCulture could improve and it starts with senior management. a typical day consist of showing up between 7 and 9 and sitting at a desk for majority of the shift responding to emails and conducting meetings or conference calls. All of this work can keep you very busy because each account manager has hundreds of accounts with different issues rising each dayNo two days are identical while working at Transunion. While your overall responsibilities will remain the same, the initial situation/issue as well as the path you take to find the solution will always be unique. This makes for an interesting work day.If you are looking for room for advancement, this is not the company. Senior management would be better off with robots. It is a do as I say and not as I do environment. There is a high turnover from management down. This is not a fun environment to work in. The truly sad part is the pay is very good but not worth the back biting.TransUnion is a large privately held company, it is a fast paced environment. Multiplatform integrated systems ensure a complex environment. A typical day would include:Planning, or Post Mortem(Lessons Learned) meetings as well as conference calls with rotating quarterbacking.Data retrieval for reporting then Report distribution based on data needs.Ticketing systems for upcoming code updates as well as current system problems requiring attention.Interfacing other business units for upcoming work in the pipeline.Analysis of systems and promote best practices for more efficient processing.Enjoyed many of my co-workersHardest part of the job, Repeating oneself.

Disadvantages: Teaching & learning environment is very challenging (e.g. class size); No job security (You don't know when you will be laid off, in Nov., February, April, or even in August)Overall I'm still have a job just don't know for how long research,research, and more research. Educator is ine if the greatest career a person can have in my opinion but you have to have a passion for it.Each one teach one.CPS seems to favor their own.  While many of us were at our desks working, there were those who would walk in at whatever time they wanted and once they turned on their computer walked off to get breakfast.  I saw this a lot with the CEOs office.  They felt that if you got up to walk to the bathroom you didn't have enough to do.  CPS has a lot of great office workers, but they get a bad rap for being employee of CPS.  CPS GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER!!!Working with CPS is one of my great work experience I value till this day. I have been working on and off with CPS since I was a Junior in High School. I love the fast paced environment and the multi cultured people I have worked and dealt with.Transporting kids and off bus safely . Assures child is never left unsupervised on a bus.Ensures the safely and well-being of children being transported to and from school. Assure that the bus driver is not distracted from the safe operation of the vehicle.Chicago Public Schools has great benefits. CPS provides helpful materials to the students in order for them to learn to their full potential. I admire CPS No Tolerance Policy. I felt really safe working for CPS.Good feeling of giving backGreat salariesGood benefitsNetworking opportunitiesGood work/life balanceJob security in most positionsEach morning I begin to focus on the lesson plan that I prepared for  my students. I learned how to become more patience, perseverance and emphatic toward my students to enhance their academic skills. Some of my colleagues have been very supportive toward me to help promote students to the next level. My job can become very challenging because of certain students' behavior problems within the the class environment. Most of the students' parents are a great support system that usually bring the behavior problems to a halt. I love to teach and counseled students. Additionally, I enjoyed administration work while I was a Counselor. I was tremendous asset within my career environment.Working here at John Hancock College Prep is a blessing. We are currently in transition going from a neighborhood school to a selective enrollment school. The most enjoyable part of this job is seeing students succeed. Managment has be great, if one has any questions or concerns, they are always willing to listene. Co-workers are fantastic, alway willing to help one another. Throughout my career here at John Hancock College prep, I have learned that students feel diffrent everyday, this is the hardest part of the job as I have to adjust to the students.In my opinion, the teaching experience was great. Everyday there was a different expectation. The students, although challenging at times, brought the best out of me. I learned that both adults and students learn and grow during the school year. I also learned that everyone does not grow in the same directions. Management was not great. I feel that my co-workers were good at what they did and they put forth a grand effort. The hardest part of the job, however, is dealing with the management and administration. CPS enforces rules and gives deadlines and tests that are not conducive to the growth of the young people. It is almost impossible to get kids ready for the wave of standardized tests and teach them what they need to learn to pass to the next grade. CPS does a poor job of catering to the kids' needs. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be when you see the success of many students and understand that your input helped them be successful.good benefits and easy hours love the holiday breaks and pay working with the kids makes you happy and smiling,love iti will recommend this job to every oneWorking as a Special Education Classroom assisatant is very stressful. Working with a diverse group of learners is the best part of the job. I would say the hardest aspect is working along side teachers and other coworkers who honestly don't care about their position. Ive heard so many statements that teachers have made regarding students that was totally inapportate. I would also like to add that most schools aren't to fixable with conquering issues regarding workers safety and violently aggressive children.Working for Chicago Public Schools was the best part of my career. I had the pleasure of working with some of the most powerful administrators. My coworkers were always very supportive and we always looked out for one another. The children that I worked with were always very humble, while their may be some uncooperative students I still enjoyed every minute. The hardest part was just the uncertainty of holding on to your job.The Postsecondary Liaison responsible for implementing targeted strategies that prepare all Chicago Public School students for post-secondary opportunities. Must possess the ability to build capacity of your school Postsecondary Leadership Team. Additionally, provide professional development, tools and resources to assist school faculty and staff in creating a college and career going culture and driving strong postsecondary outcomes.It's by no means an easy process. The work that educators do is not something that any individual could fathom. Layer and layers of paperwork, protocol that many times doesn't make sense and initiatives that don't last for more than 3 years is frustrating especially when research states it takes 5 years to see change. You get to a point where just being grateful that you have a job isn't enough because the your health and emotional well being suffer and it is definitely a thankless job.I come in and check the Building Automotive System to see how the school is heating/cooling. I walk the building to make sure it is comfortable through out. The school is close to 300,000 square feet. On a daily bases we test the pool for PH. When needed we vacuum, add chemicals to the feeders. Any repairs that need to be done we do. Like plumbing (rodding out a clogged line, changing a p-trap), electrical (changing lights, changing ballast, outlets) & painting.The faculty is very nice. They are friendly and they appreciate the work we do for them. My co-workers are good people. They try very hard and they do their job to the best of their ability.The hardest part is working on the roof in freezing weather.I enjoyed helping the disabled children. I learned how to effectively assist special needs kids. How to handle wheel chairs and walkers. Management was not organized.  No room for advancement.A typical day may go smoothly until a person in leadership pulls you to the side to discuss things that do not benefit the children or the betterment of the school system. I learned that although I worked in  a school that everyone was not concerned about children actually learning. Sometimes it's just politics. I was not under very good management. My co-workers were influential and supportive. The hardest part of the job was knowing that some people in charge really don't care about children. The most enjoyable part about the job was the appreciation I received from parents.I love working with children. •	Confer with parents and staff to discuss educational activities, policies, and student behavioral or learning problems. Enforce discipline and attendance rules.  •	Observe teaching methods and examine learning materials to evaluate and standardize curricula.  •	Collaborate with teachers to develop and maintain curriculum standards. •	Daily classroom aide, assist teachers, provides one on one or small group support to students. •	Provides additional support where help is needed throughout Vanderpoel. •	Cheer and Pompon coach.This is a good place to get a good start on your resume, or to beef it up.  This is not a career type of place.  You have to get what you can out of it and move on - revolving door.  The benefits are ok. This was a very fast paced environment, no nonsense atmosphere.  Not much development or growth.  Lots of hard work for last minute rushed projects. This is a who you know atmosphere for higher level positions. I learned how to stay on my toes, be a professional, to be proactive, to anticipate next steps and solve problems. I learned the importance of trust and confidence as well as being very detailed and keeping impeccable records. CPS is a huge company, easy to get lost in the shuffle. Company seems to cater more to people with children.","10,000+",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-10-05T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/f899f0b8-140c-4f88-930a-92c96f9dcf18?mescoid=1900287001001&jobPosition=15,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

131,2298.0,Project Manager/Senior Environmental Scientist,Stantec,3.6,237.0,"management-oriented approach.does not have supervisors in place to catapult into future. engineering staff lacks maturityGreat company to work for as far as compensation, long hours of outside work. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with changing schedules. I enjoyed working outside with team members to complete tasks safely and efficiently.Fast paced consulting firm that continues to grown through acquisitions. Places a lot of value on employee billable hours.  Great place to work on multiple projects and gain some valuable technical skills.Needs improvement on employee retention and organic growth.If you are a perfect person who makes no mistakes, you like working extra hours without extra pay or even recognition for it, and especially if you like constant ridicule and pre-meditated judgement, then this is the work environment for you. Don't get me wrong, most people in my experience at Stantec were friendly and professional. Unfortunately, this could not be said for most of the managers. I HIGHLY discourage anyone without direct experience to the client to avoid this job at all costs. It was extremely difficult to go in to work everyday when you felt like an outcast, and any mistake you made was put under a microscope and scrutinized. The work is challenging and diligence to details is extremely important. Because of that, re-work is unavoidable. I would expect when re-work happens, a solid, cohesive team would come together, receive structured feedback, and learn from the mistakes to avoid them in the future. Sadly, this was not the case. Unorganized is an understatement of what I witnessed. The company doesn't seem to want to build up its employees from the inside and they aren't willing to pay for the experienced individuals, so they are caught in a self-inflicting lose-lose situation. What I learned is that the same way there are good quality engineers and poor engineers, there are also companies with good work environments and companies with poor ones. These environments are highly influenced by their leaders, or lack thereof.Searched for easements for pipeline project and uploaded documents into database. Worked 6 months due to company lost bid on job and had no work.Stantec is a great company to work for.  They are organized and very professional.  The compensation and benefits are what makes this work environment the best.  Happily paid employees make for a happy work environment.  This company really takes care of their employees.I great place to stay busy but not much room for advancement. Good people to work with, good opportunities for some very fun projects. Stay on upper managements good side.Keeping community in mind is their motto yet they could care less about their employees.  Not impressed with management and all the extra bull with the company.  They waste lots of time and money.  They bought our smaller company last year and after a few months starting letting people go, first starting with admin, accounting, then laying off CAD people, engineers and scientists. Not impressed with this large Canadian company.I worked at Stantec while pursuing my degree, I had a great experience there and worked with a diverse group of individuals. Would recommend this company to anyone looking to gain experience. Positive working environment and flexible schedules made my experience an exceptional one.Large projects underwater by millions and it takes ""management"" by surprise. Woefully behind the times with low skilled workers at the helm. Projects listed on website are ten years old executed by acquisitions where the leadership has bailed to successful companies.No repeat business and lawsuits filed by companies they have screwed. Earnings destroyed by execution problems and the stock nosediving.They toy with you if they will hire you or not, the management is unclear and rude. The  language barrier is ridiculous and you get blamed for everything. There is no set training they just throw people in blind and expect them to know everything. DO NOT WORK IN THE WYOMISSING BRANCH!!!! THE MANAGEMENT THERE IS THE WORST!!!!I'd say it's a typical office job.  Most of the time employees work independently, which I liked.  The only thing that struck me (and may not be so strange to you) is that the people are very smart and social, so quiet people like me might look a bit of a funny duck, nevertheless, such a person will be respected there as long as he/she is an honest worker.It's a professional place to work; however definitely not friendly.The work load is ok, but no respect for management as they belittle their employees all the time behind their back.It was a good Joe we had fun and work heard.. Nice pay .good hours to work.benefit s to.the people where friendly. Nice. Just a good feeling work place..The people I work with are all really nice and knowledgeable. My work with them is remote but someone is always available to ask for help if I need it. I have a lot of responsibilities and I know my managers trust me.The day by day is  dynamic and you can learn every day because of the team experience. my co-workers are good friends. the hardest part of the job is the summer in the road... too hot. the most enjoyable part is everything else.There are great opportunities for collaborative efforts within the US and Canada. The downturn in oil & gas is trying, but this is standard across the board within the industry.Like any consulting company your future is really up to you.  You either need to have clients or be a resource to people with clients.  As long as  you are pushing to advance your career Stantec will be behind you and support you. This is not a lifetime appointment where you can sit on your laurels hoping for the best unless you are willing to get what you get.Stantec has a wealth of industry people and the workplace is enjoyable. There are people with all levels of experience. A typical day starts at 8:00 and finishes between 4 and 5. Monthly luncheons provide the office with a forum for a safe discussion and update to the ever evolving industry.I truly enjoy my day-day work task.I am able to choose how best to complete my work.This is a socially and environmentally responsible organization.Stantec is a great company to work for. They have a vision for the company, and are very friendly and flexible. They offer competitive benefits. Most importantly to me, they have the resources to compete on world class projects.","10,000+",Chicago,Lombard,IL,2016-06-21T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/3e44fc99-04aa-494b-8f90-cf8d42f88af2?mescoid=1300093001001&jobPosition=32,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Limited career growth in Marketing and Sales.As an intern I was able to participate in multiple audits for various companies. I gained hands on experience in the auditing field. The people there are great to work for.PwC is a great company. It provides great benefits and career opportunity to any staff level. It's great to be part of one of the most prestigious public accounting firm in the world.In the financial services market, there is constant pressure to meet short deadlines with an intense amount of work. Among other groups, there is a flexible work environment.Overall a great place to work! It was as an early place in my career, it was definitely a learning experience. Overall, I would recommend this location to anyone who is looking for a great job experience!- Work on requests with time limits - Laid back environment - Workload varies - Lots of benefits - Great experience- make friends with everyone - Managers are good people -Overtime pay - Must stay overtime if work at hand is due and not completedGood work environment, challenging but satisfying, not much work/life balance but they are working on it. I great place to start working and understanding the corporate world.PwC allows you to learn and grow. Great projects are mixed with miserable ones. A lot of really good people work in the company with excellent experience and expertise, but some are far from being perfect.There was no work/life balance and employees were expected to give up their weekends for about 9 months out of the year. Management was very appoachable however and had an open door policyGreat opportunity for recent graduates. Exposure to a lot responsibilities and different types of jobs. Team work required, long busy seasons.Working at Pwc as a contractor at the moment, I'm lucky to be surrounded by a team of professionals with great attitude and personality. we provide help to the employees on daily basis on their laptops mostly but we also make sure everything else is working perfectly, things like printers, video conference equipments, phones, TVs and more..Co-workers are extremely smart and talented. They help you to grow your personal brand and establish your unique value to the firm through diverse experiences.Great people, great work mostly, and excellent support. Need to remember that it is a business driven by revenues. Long-term, one needs to align what they do with how the firm makes money.I was part of a small close-knit group of consultants with good access to my management. I truly enjoyed the minimum 2-week mandatory learning opportunities.I landed on the wrong team that over hired in anticipation for some big wins that unfortunately did not come.  The culture and people that work here are great however; you really need to find a great project/teamPwC provides a good opportunity to expand your understanding of auditing and accounting principles. PwC has very high expectations of its employees. Employees are expected to learn on their feet and to keep up with long hours and high stress deadlines.I loved this job. I worked there for about 8 years. Management team was great. All the tellers were great. I have no problems with this bank. It was the best working experience of my life.Great company, depends on your group, obviously a global company with similar opportunities.  Beautiful office and locations, great benefitsCareer is propelled forward through combination hours over standard and networking in addition to performance. Although the work alone won't guarantee you the promotion, management is always willing to speak with you and help you be as well rounded as you would like. It's a great place to start your career.This office is a great opportunity for recent college graduates seeking experience to build their marketability.  There is little opportunity for advancement for individuals with years of financial industry experience. This is not the core practice which causes limitations in growth.Good training program and a lot of projects to learn and growGood work environment and locationHours is long Coworkers are awesome","10,000+",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/9dd178a3-b6d7-4827-9cdf-7602b79c8ff6?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

163,2330.0,Medical Science Liaison,Endo Pharmaceuticals,3.5,63.0,"I had a pleasure to work with one of the finest company where each and every employee are very friendly and cooperative . I enjoyed working and the team was very helpfull from the outset.I would like to go back again if I get a chance to work with the same client again and again.I worked here as a contractor for 8 months.  The Management that I worked with were very nice and respectful.  Work/life balance is important to this company.  The company encourages employees to ""give back"" to the community and even schedules one day off a year for the employees to participate.Great job should just pay more attention to what is going on with employee.  Moral boosts numbers which manufacturing does which makes the company more money and produce more efficiently without mistakes. Still a good company.Good company to work for. Products have a place in the market, and you are given the resources needed to succeed. The management seems to have a good grasp on the steps needed to keep the company on a good trajectory.About a 2. The morale is low and not much support from HR and senior mgrs. Not had a raise in 3 yrs.Been lied to by Managers, HR and Supervisors. Not a good training system for Operations or new Supervisors.Expected to work much more hours than promised. There's a swinging door when it comes to the job turn around and Im on my 4th Plant Mgr in 3 yrs.I worked at Qualitest for 2 years. Started off a decent place but then went all corporate. They treat their employees horrible. Basically its like thanks for making us over a billion dollars this year with that being said here's your 17 cent raise on top of the horrible wage we pay you now. Job security is decent but trust me if they dont like you they'll make you want to quit. No advancement opportunities. You stay in the position and wage you were hired in at. like I sad its a stepping stone job. Most enjoyable part of the job is the occasional hour lunches. Hardest part of the job is having to deal with gossip, drama, favoritism, harassment (with no help from supervisors) and discrimination.Great place to work, gained a lot of valuable knowledge about the Pharma industry.Work was never boring, had a lot of versatility and challenging aspects to job function.Management was very helpful and supportive to my ideas, and helping me advance in my position(s).Co-workers were great, we worked together as a team on all projects.The most enjoyable part of the job was customer satisfaction.I enjoyed the job and people. Great work experience. The pay was a little low. Management doesn't do a great job of informing the direction of the job market.Mapped out my territory according to call plan, called on physicians and staff, in offices and hospitals, recorded information in computer, provided lunch and learns, teamed up with teammates for conventions and meetings, worked with district manager to discuss prospects and how to get increase in market share.I learned a lot about how to get past the gate keepers, how to engage the physicians in a conversation, how to add value to their business, and how to work a convention or event.The hardest part was when my territory was changed and I missed meeting with my regulars.The most enjoyable part was when physicians and staff told me they had success with my product-especially when it was recently launched.Identify and determine the customer base of Urologists throughout a defined geographic territory which includes Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York Convey the clinical benefits, ensure order placement and fulfillment, aid in billing/reimbursement of Valstar and participate in the intravesical administration of Valstar to patients with BCG Refractory CIS  Track the historical and present buying trends of Valstar and Fortesta among my established customer base of Urologists which has enabled me to maintain existing business while targeting and generating new sales Establish and monitor the purchasing channels for Valstar between numerous Urology Practices, Besse Medical, Smith Medical Partners and Specialty Pharmacies Every day at Endo was a different day filled with new challenges and learning experiences.  We were constantly learning existing Legacy and making new recommendations for process improvements.  Once a process was mastered and demonstrated to have successful results, I would train my team in order to provide them with the empowerment to move forward with this new process.  We would find ways to improve the process via reporting, excel vlookups and building structure across the organization. The most enjoyable part of the day was knowing that I made a difference in my team, their challenges and the company.Easy work, great managers, great co workers, you would love to work here. everyone helps each other out. From top to bottom it's a great place to workYou will probably be laid off months after you are hired. Confused management and dull drugs to represent. Do not even consider working hereIts always fun to work for Endo. The product mix enables you to have a welcoming atmosphere from the staff and HCP. Endo has that family type of atmosphere and it still gives value to its employees and  treats them as individuals.Great place to work, if you have a nice team.Learned a lot of new stuff FIORI is new technology which is in market for less time.The hardest part of the job is there is less communication between the team members, don't know what they are working on so messed up doing same work twice.Of all the pharmaceutical companies I worked for, this one was the best.  It offered a ton of vacation (4 weeks to start) and the products were legitimately there to help people (pain management).  A lot of great people made the aches and pains of the job bearable. The company provides great compensation and benefits. They go out of there way to provide the best environment to succeed in your territory. I've been with the company for 5 years and feel very secure in my position with many opportunities for advancement, and continual education paid by the company.There has been many changes and downsizing to the company. As of now the company is working with a skeletal crew. Many jobs are not getting done because only one person is in it and they are overwhelmed. Not only has there been major downsizing but the turnover rate is high as well. Unstability.Requires a lot out of its workers but it is a good paying job with outstanding benefits.I am a current healthtronics employee with over 7 years of service. This company called EndoPharmacueticals acquired Healthtronics some time ago and is starting to make life difficult for the Healthtronics employees. Healthtronics used to be a fun place to work because we would always have great functions (Summer and Christmas parties) that kept the employees morale high. Now that we are a part of Endo, it is not fun anymore. Endo tried to make sure that we did not have a Christmas party all in 2012 by shrinking the budget of the people who were responsible to plan events like this but we managed to have the party.Several months ago, Endo created a shared services division in which all of accounts payable from not only our company but a few others that were acquisitioned by Endo. Lets just say the employees in shared services are not happy because they are not being treated well (keep this in mind when applying for any A/P position).Just recently found out that we many not be getting yearly raises this year because the company ""did not do so well"". Hmmmm, that it funny for them to say that when Endo is building a muti-million dollar buidling to repace an old one they used to have. If the company was not doing so well then why build a another building?I just thought I would give a warning to anyone considering applying here. Even If I do not know who you are, I do care enough to say find a company that will treat you well and respect your hard work.Endo Pharma is a good company. The compensation and benefit packages are good.","1,001 to 5,000",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-11-06T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/56704ac1-fb18-4b61-8681-d47f58f734f9?mescoid=1900254001001&jobPosition=29,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

182,2349.0,Food Scientist - R&D Product Development,Heinz,3.8,1900.0,"Worked from home office so I was able to maintain a flexible schedule. Job was challenging and moved at a good pace.Large product line enabled you to learn the various categories.Kraft foods, San Leandro CA 94578                                                          9/15-4/16MACHINE OPERATOR •	plan and assign work tasks in Oder to meet production goals efficiently•	Answer phone and create notifications in the system•	Utilized scanner, copier, telephone , and printer to perform tasks•	Able to perform other clerical duties as needed•	Positive attitude and excellent interpersonal skills•	Lab work getting sample color of the coffee and moister for it to mash our targetThis company only cares about numbers and production. The warehouse employees  are constantly forced to work 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, face sudden and unexplainable schedule changes, NO notice about days off (if any), safely is ignored, worker fatigue is rampant, and inexperienced people are operating equipment in a unsafe manner. Let's see how all office and management do the work for a couple of months, and see how their family/marriage life is. With one day off, they wouldn't last, or change.Worked there for 16 years. I've seen a lot of changes through the years.  You are able to be promoted  with in the company if you are a hard worker, and lead by example.  The changes that are taking place now is for the good of job security for long term. I personally know change is hard, but to compete with other Food manufacturing plants you have to try different programs to cut cost and save money in order to stay competitive in the food manufacturing world.Good job to make money (a lot of hours) but no flexibility on personal time. The work force is pretty much all everyday hard working people just trying to make a living. The worst part of the company is that the HR Dept. runs the plant. they have no consideration for talent and are constantly threatening people with their job. The management are good people that seem to have their hands tied from making improvements due to corporate policies that don't work. The Union is basically none existent when it comes to representation.I miss Heinz in Pocatello.....nine years of a daily battle to meet and exceed expectations.  But in the long run seeing them go has been  extremely  hard on my family.  In other words  if you're  lucky to work  for them appreciate  what they give back. Hard work is rewarding... I felt with them.  I have had to work two jobs just to match what they payed me in Pocatello  Idaho....Company management, not plant management, is too concerned with saving every dollar.  Company shut down 7 plants and relocated production lines with very poor planning.  Money is being cut in the wrong places.  I'm all for saving money and reallocating tasks, however it cannot affect the safety and quality of very profitable products.  Management needs to take a step back and look at the picture as a whole and put the right people in place to get the job done right the first time.Fast paced and multi faceted. Hands on experience - learn as you go - no support from management. Most co-workers great - very supportive and respectful.The hardest part of the job after new management took over is being micromanaged. I've always been a self-starter, who takes ownership of my work but when constantly questioned, it starts to wear on you. I most enjoyed feeling like I was a contributing team member. It was challenging at times but, overall a good experience.I start off by seeing how things are running and complete starting my paper for tracability.. I've learned the importance of team work and working together with other to achieve a common goal. leadership was import in completing difficult task.Getting people that were lazy to work with the team was the most difficult task, but it was achieve. seeing how production numbers at the end of the day.Within my first 5 months of working, the plant manager, production manager, quality manager, a production supervisor, a quality supervisor, and a finance supervisor all left the plant. The production supervisor and quality supervisor positions were not up for replacement. There's no sense of team work. 3G has insane cost cutting methodology that takes away from any experience and is not rewarding at all.My day begins with a shift meeting then I go to my line and check my labels and do my quality suites and maintence the machine if needed. Then I prepare my line to begin running. Since working my job I've learn to be patient and never rush because you may make a mistake. I learned to work safe and keep my machine clean at all time so that it functions better. Management lets you know that you are doing a good job and my co-workers always willing to help out if needed. the hardest part of my job is doing changeovers where you change the parts out for different bottle size. the most enjoyable part of my job is coming to work everday and just smiling knowing that I love my job and interacting with my co-workers.This company pays well but that's where the pros stop. Management is a joke and a lot are straight out of college with no knowledge of the processes but still think they know it all. High turnover and no regard for family life, nearly impossible to schedule family events without the fear of schedule changes.like every normal job you punch in and put on your apron and go to your destination line ...if your first time there working you'll be train to all lines in order to find out were your abilities are need the most....when ever your having a problem with whatever it is they are always there to help you out..as for your fellow peers is like feeling home always there to help you out...the only part that the floor are concrete and your standing more than 9 hours and your feet tent to hurt so have some good shoes or boots...the good think about is that you can sometimes get some product on holiday to take to your familyI enjoyed my employment with Kraft. It was my first job in the warehouse industry and I maximized my potential while employed, from trainee to management within a years time.Kraft was very good to work for and many had 30+ years experience.  Opportunities abound and it was a great company to grow with.  I learned to organize a large group of people at off-site locations to interact with other departments.  I worked with a great team who have remained friends.  I was treated with respect in an office of mostly males and was shown all the appropriate thanks for a job well done.Everyday before you start work you have a meet on what your team did on the day before. Also have to warm up. One a year they doing something for there employees and their families.  You could always go to your team leader if you have a problem with anything or you just don't understand.Kraft was a fast paced , never boring place of employment.  I started out on an entry level position and advance to operator position within a satisfactory time period. The management was excellent at my time of hiring, and my co-workers were team players and willing to help in any way. The hardest part of the job was getting product out on a scheduled time when we had maintenance issues or machine failure, but we had a good maintenance crew that worked hard to ensure we kept on schedule.  The most enjoyable part of the job was taking pride in the work one accomplished at the end of the day.Kraft was my second home. I had the pleasure of working with some of the best managers from the beginning of my career with Kraft to the very end. Kraft gives their employees many opportunities in the work field. Including training, seminars, hands-on, etc.The typical job at Heinz was moving around, taking care of the product, and fixing boxes. I learned a lot of new things making sure there was enough product in the boxes, were do they keep the product, how the be able to handle fast machinery, what kind off chemicals are used to clean and disinfect the machines. Management were really nice. I enjoyed being around my coworkers they were really friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was how to fix the fast machinery but I was willing to learn. The most enjoyable part the job being at work.the sad story behind Kraft, many people don't know Kraft started about 100 years ago in Allentown. Sadly it became the worst managed facility, the waste was beyond belief, while people in charge ( plant manager, HR manager and the like ) made one stupid decision after another , allowed bigotry and nepotism in running the place, while pretending to put on a good front.The maintenance supervisor was a wonderful guy, but had a weak personality so he was overworked, the lead technician, had no idea whatsoever about leadership.I could see the inefficiencies from day one, I wasn't surprised about  the decision from those who acquired the company to close the plant.Since the KraftHeinz merger, the cutbacks began and all the maintenance supervisors were the first to go,  Then people off the floor were promoted to Lead positions and was still expected to perform there duties as a floor mechanic.  All this for just a $1.00 more an hour while production Leads were given $4.05 an hour more.  This is at the Granite City plant where this job opening is located.  If you like working with young inexperienced mechanics and like to be stabbed in the back at every turn then this job is for you.  I worked there for almost 8 years and it was a great place to work once upon a time.  But now management condones an adversarial (stab you in the back and smile in your face) atmosphere and is always looking for any reason to write a mechanic up.","10,000+",Chicago,Glenview,IL,2016-11-10T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/f706a922-cb97-4ab3-863c-340b7b10adb0?mescoid=1900238001001&jobPosition=13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Good benefits and some opportunities for advancement.One would definitely dream to be a part of this company and I am glad I was one. Fun place, flexible for employees, environment to learn a lotCAP is dedicated to improving the professional growth and development of pathologist. Offers excellent education and benefits to its staff. CAP standards promote quality work and a cohesive work environment.CAP is NOT a very nice place to work. Managers lie. Offer zero support on issues. If your new. The old employees will do everything they can to make your life a miserable. So take this advice. If you like back stabbing this is the company for youConsiderable work independence and focus on customer satisfaction.  CAP is undergoing significant change related to culture, information technology and response to the marketplace.A premier medical association with a dedicated staff focused on supporting its physician membership, patient safety, and the worldwide laboratory community.  To accomplish this mission the organization makes the necessary investments in technology and personnel.The CAP offers a number of different schedule options. Most of the co-workers are friendly. However, there is very little room for growth and advancement as a young adult.I have been employed with the College of American Pathologists for 12 years now. Overall it is fast past, productive, and comfortable place to work. The company is family oriented and offers flexibility to aid in work-life balance. Most of the employees are friendly however there are number who come off as bullies. The culture has changed and the company has become top heavy with management. In some areas of the company there is no room for growth.This company took care of it's employees by paying them very well and offering great benefits.Awesome place to work. Just like a home away from home. Management worked closely with you to make sure you were comfortable with new programs. Easy going and productive work environment. Collaborative team efforts.I have never worked in a more depressing, dysfunctional office, with so little communication, training, support, and teamwork in my 35 years in the workforce. Management doesn’t give you any info to do your job, or tell you where to get it, then blames you for not knowing. They’ll throw you under the bus so they look good. No matter which way you go, they micromanage you, then tell you it's wrong, you can't win. I've never worked anywhere past 12noon on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, except this place. We don't have some Federal holidays off, like Martin Luther King Day - ridiculous, especially in DC! When a support person is doing a great job, they get fired, because the Office Admin. feels threatened.The College is devoted to enhancing the professional development of its members and promoting excellence in patient care. A truly wonderful group of co-workers, who exemplify the CAPs values.",,Chicago,Northfield,IL,2016-07-26T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/f42beccb-0bd3-45f2-a91b-e206905b8f52?mescoid=1500153001001&jobPosition=20,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

191,2358.0,Product Development Scientist - Poultry,Kraft Foods Group,4.1,27.0,"A typical day at work would be reviewing customer orders, checking inventory or when product would be produced, verified transportation had been planned, confirmed to customer.  Had many friends over the past 40 years working there.  The most enjoyable part of the job was having my own office, could have the radio on, and still do my job without any pressure from management.  The hardest part of the job was leaving because I took an early retirement package and now looking for another job.I worked for Kraft Foods Group for almost 25 years, I started in dispatch and worked hard to become the manager of this very fine group of people.Being Kraft is a Corporate environment there are a lot of management decisions that a person may not agree with, but they provided a nice environment for us to work in and were very generous with their compensation and benefits.  The Work Life balance was also something you don't find all that often but it worked out to be a huge benefit.Consistently challenged with new category management opportunities.  Excellent leadership support, organizational culture, and advancement opportunities.I now fully appreciate the culture of innovation at Kraft. The ever present current of ""expecting the best"" in everyone's work provided a strong foundation for teamwork and creating success. Management always brought waves of information on new ideas/resources to help us develop innovative plans to meet business goals. It was a great place to nurture a career.Kraft foods was a challenging work environment.  I gained a lot of experience with customers and SAP erp systems.  Our management team was hands off and allowed the employees to manage their customers and issues.  We worked in teams and there was a lot of cooperation with coworkers.  The hardes part of the job was the long hours that were required to meet the demands with the lower head count demanded by the company.  I will miss the people I worked with.  We were able to get along outside of work as well as in work.The current culture at Kraft is that they want to bring in new talent and get rid of people who have been there awhile.  So it's good if you are new to Kraft but be wary that you don't stay too long.  Management is so-so.  It depends largely on your immediate boss - some are good and some are really bad.Overall, Kraft Foods group has been a great company to work for and has offered many opportunities for advancement.  With the current Heinz merger, I wish them luck obtaining growth and sustaining brandstypical corporate environment.  Employees are very nice and professional.  Overall work is interesting and is a good learning experience.  But with the 3G takeover and merger with Heinz, the environment is poor and the company does not treat you well.A great place to work with lots of opportunities for growth and upwards mobility, as well as opportunities for cross-functional moves.Worked in Office environment with 250 plus employees.  Great atmosphere.  Job concentrated on Mailroom/Warehouse, and office needs of site employees.Kraft is a great place to learn classic, consumer marketing.  I was groomed by a some of the best managers to be a blue chip marketer and learned key general management skillsGood leadership and good products.  Kraft spends a lot on quality and assurance for quality products.  The leaders tend to allow people to develop and grow and don't necessarily do a lot of micro managing.Kraft Foods work atmosphere was great and our team was a tight nit family. We shared best practices and assisted team members during critical annual planning periods.Excellent company.  Diverse experiences within Supply Chain. Change management, SAP, Lean, Collaborative, Customer Engagement and Focus, Financially driven.The company is open and inclusive to ideas from its employees and encourages collaboration acorss different teams.People are very friendly.A typical day involved packaging cheese, or operating a fill room. I learned a lot while working at Kraft. I learned how to operate a fill-room and I was one of the only temps to have learned one. Operation required a lot of attentiveness, attention to detail, and responsibility. Management was very strict but never seemed to have any idea what was going on for the next week. The schedule was never up on time, they where always adding people to work days and then taking them off. They never let anyone know when they had added them for a specific day. They would schedule people to stay after but would always have enough people to cover the shift so you'd end up standing around trying to keep busy with nothing to do. My co-workers made my experience at Kraft worthwhile. I loved the people I worked with and created a lot of great friendships through work. The hardest part of my job was training to learn the fill-room because all of the responsibility, dedication and hard work required to do the job. The most enjoyable experience I had was operating the fill-room. This was because I had put so much time and effort into learning the job, that the satisfaction I got from finally operating made me feel achieved and like I'd accomplished something worthwhile.-Moving towards IL6S culture and investing a lot in the employees including the floor representation.Free hand.  Self motivated post.  Many instances to shine and work on my own and with my team.  Managed the office, efficiently.  Training on a continuum.  Duties were easily grasped and conducted.   Positive feedback from team and manager.  Bolstering and orienting from Chicago headquarters.  A climate of support and continued learning.  Exponential growth potential.Great general management training, iconic brands, a lot of responsibility early onIts a great place to work.  Culture is important.
