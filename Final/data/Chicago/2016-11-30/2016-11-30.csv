12,2179.0,Senior CT Systems Scientist,Toshiba Medical Research Institute USA,4.0,657.0,"Continuous workflow solving technical related issues within the retail point of sale environment.Establishing and maintaining prosperous relationships with end-users and customers.I worked for Toshiba International, not Toshiba Medical.With that said, It used to be a great place to work. Great camaraderie, had great relationships with superiors as well as peers. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case.Horrible, short-sighted decisions have been made and many good people are now affected due to a massive layoff. During my last year, I saw no long-term plan or vision for future growth. They are in complete panic mode.I feel sorry for former colleagues who are still employed there.-	Organized and assisted in the creation of company spreadsheets. -	Provided assistance for many A/R and invoice processing requests.-	Assisted with procuring sales tax exemption certificates.-	Reviewed and corrected various transactions.-	Fulfilled basic department support tasks including, filing, maintenance of all A/R files/labels, and other department tasks as required and requested.Great for day to day operations, planning and supply chain execution for this $100 million international manufacturing business unit.  They focus on purchasing, category management, inventory control, forecasting, personnel, information technology and international manufacturing processes.Start-up seems to be going well and making right decisions concerning system upgrades (transitions and changes from prior company ownership).  Focus on improving bottom-line and consolidations to achieve that is occurring.People are friendly and good to work with, and environment is pleasant.  The most difficult task was getting additional responsibilities to offset an ever automated job set.I did have opportunities to learn new duties in Treasury, but never was required to complete them due to other supplemental hiring that in my mind was not needed.I did not work for Toshiba MedicalThis is a review of Toshiba International Corporation in Houston Texas.We often received comments that the office had a family feel. We had many long term employees and we all worked well together.During my 31 years in Toshiba was a exciting work every day as well as challenge where we have to use all company resources to solve problems. Also, trainings in different aspect were provided for the company in order to have a excellent team work.receiving parts / shipping / enjoyed meeting all the different delivery drivers/ / learned computer receiving /  enjoyed  coworkers / certain management / just doing my job  the best that I could.Overall, Toshiba is a good company to work with. It is daily routine manufacture operations that the employees need to deal with. The co-workers are friendly. The management is quite employee-friendly.After working in a larger corporate environment, working at Toshiba was difficult due to the minimum amount of resources available. They try to do more with less but it's hard to compete with the big boys that way.Last couple years it seemed you had to worry about layoffs.  Uncomfortable.  Benefits are good.  Pay was good.  Presently going through a huge change.  With the lawsuits, fines and cutbacks.designed electrical and wiring diagrams to customers spec. learned many skills and had a great relationship with many employeesToshiba is a good company to work for in the medical device field.  An industry leader in CT technology XRay MRI and ultrasound.  I would recommend the companyMost jobs are dead end, management is short sighted. Japanese culture corrupt.Most employees are there long time, so they just show up for work to collect a paycheck as it it were a government job, very few care about what they do or their customers.Having worked at Toshiba an excess of twenty-four years, I can still say in all honesty it is the best job I've ever had! I find it great to be on the forefront of technology, working for an OEM manufacturer. A typical day involves a variety projects, so you never get bored. Co-workers may need a bit of nudging to meet a deadline, but then everyone has their own schedule. This perhaps was one of the hardest things to learn, when confronted by a tight deadline.In the end, knowing the material I've helped to produce is being seen and read by millions on the website, and then used to make purchasing decisions---this is very satisfying.Toshiba offers a wide range of semiconductors and storage products, making us a single-source option for a number of solutions and customers. It is fun and nice to work there. You will learn a lot from 9:00 to 6:00. You will have company party every month.visit diarie new client  potencial   commmmitments analisis productstrainning certification in product new, quote monthly,compensacion.An environment for people willing to deal with strong office politics.
