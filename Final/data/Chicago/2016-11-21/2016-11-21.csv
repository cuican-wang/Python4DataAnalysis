70,2237.0,Plant Chemist-(16000GT7),Sherwin-Williams Company,4.0,1300.0,"Long hours with short staffed stores. Great benefits and job security.Typical day as a a part was simple. Unloaded truck, took orders, assisted customers, mixed and sold paint. Good work environment, and if you wish to stay with the company, career opportunities are present.This used to be a good place to work, but over the last few years it has declined rapidly.  Management does not care about employees, too much overtime,  we can never do enough, constantly told how bad we are performing.  Managers lay all the blame on supervision, but they are spread too thin.  Management is not present amongst the work force.  Constantly being told how broke the plant is, yet management has no problem feeding theselves lunch with company money.  If you do a good job you are given more work.  If you don't do a good job you are ignored and allowed to sit around.  Advancement is based on the good ole boy network, not ability or qualifications.  Good workers are leaving rapidly, while the bad workers are still hanging around.Also, expect that managers will share your personal information with others.  There is no such thing as confidentiality.  Retirement plan for hourly workers is basically non existent.I loved this job. Production/machine operation was not only exciting, but attention to detail was the most important thing. 11/10 would work there againA typical day includes daily store operations, mixing paint for DIY customers and contractors. Assist in determining staffing needs, recruit store employees accordingly with proper approval and establish work schedule as appreciate. You have to remain knowledgeable on products offered and discuss available optionsIt's very sales driven! You have to make sales calls and accomplish sales goals.Fun and challenging work place. Great customers, good pace and great experiences in management. I would recommend this as a place for anyone who wants both a physical and mental challenge daily.I clock in at 7:30 and from there I look on the ""deliver"" bored to separate the paper work to see what goes first to last. After that I start to load the truck up starting what goes last to first that makes it easier for me when I unload the truck. Then I start my day driving and doing my delivers.great place to work and varied day.  You can really make a solid career with this company.  You will always have great benefits and great pay.  It is a good place.This company was an awesome place to work. Although very quiet and not a lot of people, I really enjoyed the environment. I was in my third trimester when hired for this position. They saw my potential and my work ethic instead of just my baby bump. They saved my life and I am forever grateful!Excellent work place and wonderful staff. One does not feel out of place and help is right there if needed. Friendly environement and safety is their main concern.In a typical day at Sherwin Williams Company your day was mostly filled with supplying customers with thee best service possible, going above and beyond. Also as assistant manager making sure the staff and orders were being done properly. The hardest part of the position was managing time between office work and assisting employees to make sure things are running smoothly. The best part of the job is when you receive a ""Thank you"" from a customer, also when you successfully teach a employee the proper way to do things.This is a good job if you don't mind getting your hands dirty and a little heavy lifting. My main concern is that it's difficult to advance into management without either a college degree or entering their management trainee program.My boss was very submissive and would allow certain workers to perform jobs poorly with no consequences. However, the environment created on the job site was fun and energetic.It can be slow on some days. My co-workers are pretty cool even the manager. the hardest part is lifting all the heavy things. Most enjoyable part is being able to just chill. Training is a bit fast. Only way to learn is to either teach yourself and repetition.I actually loved working at this particular place in tupelo. I love the people I worked with and the enviroment. They made me fun very comfortable at peace.Lots of accountability across the board for: meetings, reports, assisting other departments vendor handling lead follow-ups, customer issues related to all leads, system glitches that require extensive follow up with vendors, product knowledge, and a host of other responsibilities.Cannot move up to management because I have to be full time first, but will not offer me full time. I am the hardest worker in this specific store, very committed but being a single mother, i cannot stay here.Worked for Sherwin Williams for a year and wasn't advanced for my pay. Was told on many occasions it was coming but my manager's never put time in to fill out the appraisal properly.should have been full time raise,3rd key raise, then appraisal. Had to open and close a store and take bank deposit even though I wasn't 3rd key but just a full time. I worked hard for Sherwin Williams and basically just got put to the back of the burner. Stayed at 9.50$ the whole year. Was told by my manager and others  I will get a raise of 10.80 which is the same pay a part time 3rd key makes. That is withholding my dollar raise because I was full time. Other than that and the occasional cranky contractor it was smooth..I was a sales associate.  We sold paint to indivuals/companies.. Liked the staff..Management was very understanding and respectful.This is a really good company to work for. There is a lot of room for growth if you are interested in retail management positions. The employees are all really great people and making working there a lot of fun.I had the pleasure of sustaining various levels of management. Mentoring employees during their training periods was satisfying knowing my effective communication skills assisted in the growth towards their career goals.Carrying out logistics is an important phase in bringing together events in a timely matter. Fellow employees were able to have detailed information at hand, therefore, being well prepared.Effectively overseeing the office work flow required making sound judgments and key financial decisions. I had valuable relationships with employees, clients, vendors and visitors.","10,000+",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-11-21T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/cedc9ff6-bbb6-4402-a9d9-4c166c3a0680?mescoid=1900259001001&jobPosition=5,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
