Great benefits. A typical day at work is mainly answering calls and helping customers with their accounts, taking payments, verifying charges, opening disputes.It is a senior design. Our goal is to build a security system in order to let the users using their finger print to open the cabinet.And I am responsible for coding the program for hardware like Wi-Fi, camera and physical locker. I connected the hardware with Raspberry PI that is a series of credit card-sized single-board computers by using python library.This is a happy, clean and environment. Ongoing training, open door policy, great benefits, Lean something new each day. I love this job, this company and where I worked.I love working at Synchrony. From management to coworkers to VP of Operations everyone is amazing. I worked in the Phoenix location.Fun, cool and laid back environment as long as you do your work.

Each department get different holidyas off.all ready wrote review. i said it was a great company highly favored by most people who work here very uplifting enviorment really cares about employeesI will take escalated calls and help consumers with their financial issues.  Also, help debt collectors with procedures and training.  It is a great place to work with multi opportunities to move forward.Its a good place to get your foot in the door. they promote within and provide amazing benefits. Depending on the department they can be flexible.  The pay should be higher  is one of the only issues.I was working as a contractor in synchrony financial. I have found this workplace good for the employees and contractors also.A typical day of work will start with meetings. During my tenure i learned a lot from my projects. The hardest part of the job i will say meeting the timelines.Lack of communication, managers are very secretive and misleading. No one knows what is going on, lack of priorities. Overall terrible experience.Synchrony Financial is more than just a call center. It is a place where one can start a career. I love  that everyone all the way up the the CEO was once a call center representative. This company hires within which is amazing. If you are wanting to do more they provide you with the opportunities and encouragement to do so.Synchrony Financial is a great company to work for, it is a friendly environment and great working conditions.  The company is always helping out in the community making it great for volunteer work as well.Good place to work if exempt. However, advancement chances are slim unless you're well connected with the site leader. Good office atmosphere and friendly coworkers are a plus!Work work work work and meet your numbers if not you will be wrote up. It used to have great benefits but since it changed hands they are slowly taking away benefits.Lousy place to work. A lot of code learning in a short amount of time spread over multiple platforms in comparison to embarrassing low pay. Absolutely ridiculous!!! Older people or those with disabilities treated badly!Its been about an year since I started working for Synchrony Financial. I feel myself lucky for getting an opportunity to work in this  company.From the top down everyone loves their job there and it trickles down to the bottom and really makes a difference to work in a place like that.  More companies need to adopt their culture.  Being a part time work at home rep we still feel included in every way.If you can get in with Synchrony, there is plenty of room for advancement. It is a challenging environment, but you don't feel overworked. Great benefits and wonderful culture.Discovery Place is an amazing place to work there's so much to learn and see from animals, to rainforest, and science explosions. This place is so ideal for children who love science.Excellent benefits and rate of pay.Plenty of vacation and personal/sick days.Management excels at communicating with staffExcellent training program and changes are communicated effectively",,Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-11-19T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/avp-credit-innovation-data-scientist-l11-job-chicago-il-us-174578142.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
