Phone calls, on occasion. Laid back atmosphere, everyone is helpful, including management! People have your back here. Days fly by because there is a lot of work to complete, but you are valued as more than just a number, so it's worth it :)Staff is willing to let young engineers grow and make some mistakes while learning on the job. Very good maintenance and production staff with experience to help offset early bumps in the road.Excellent company to work for however with 16 locations across the US, we tend to run ""management-light.""  There are times when we as Plant Managers and Engineers get pulled away from in-house issues to aid sister facilities.Management is horrible. There is no progression for anyone going into maintenance. Management refuses to give you any raises no many how times you ask, until you decide to leave. Then they pay you nearly only half of what they pay operations. Different pay scales throughout the plant. Favoritism is definitely showed.Great place to work, great people. and overall is a healthy environment. Balchem is a place where they offer many advancement opportunities as well as great benefits.Balchem is a great place to work.  Friendly people, and competent leadership.  The company is definitely going places.  The work is challenging and interesting.material handler, blender, forklift operator,inventory, shipping and receivingMy daily work experience was always very busy and productive. The day always began with a review of the previous shift in QC. This involved a review of the testing of all production of all batches produced and retesting of all out of spec material. This was done internally in my department. This was typically followed by a meeting with production to discuss their production schedule and what will be needed from the qc department. After this meeting, I checked Al of the in use reagents to insure an adequate supply for the up coming production schedule. This was followed by re-calibration of our instruments to insure proper working order. The day began and during the day, I was directly involved with the testing of all incoming raw materials and any optional work that needed to be done for QC management. Management was always very supportive and the individuals I interfaced with from production, other QC technicians and the R &D staff was exceptional, a true team effort. The hardest part of the position was the analysis of out of specification material. You needed to confirm the results and then quarantine the material. The best part of life in our QC department, was the atmosphere, interaction with fellow employees and management.",201 to 500,Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-07-08T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/b54be81b-0efd-4379-b78c-d2c0734ab9d7?mescoid=4100691001001&jobPosition=13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
