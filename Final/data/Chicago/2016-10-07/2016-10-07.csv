52,2219.0,Principal Data Scientist,HERE,3.8,60.0,"Fast-paced work environment.  Constant change to keep up with changing technologies.  Sometimes the change was challenging and sometimes the change was exhilarating.Worked with some highly intelligent folks.  The culture was very professional and rules were consistent.   HERE affords the priceless opportunity to work with people from around the world and to travel.Working in Chicago downtown area, it is a good experience. Friendly management team, it is casual place to work in. The company is promising, too.A good company to work for but keep your technical skills up.  Great benefits.  Nice gym.  The newer employees are satisfied but the one that have been here at least 8 years or more have seen a big change in management and communication.A cutting edge mapping company with goals of providing customers with the best map features possible. A company struggling with trying to provide detailed map features quicker and cheaper than how things were done previouslyThere has been a lot of changes over the years and none really for the best, not too sure why I keep hanging around. There have been rounds of layoffs. Management says they want to improve the work place...tic tic ticThere is no growth, company will not help you expand your knowledge. You'll remain at the same position the day you got hired 10 years later, no matter how hard you work. Your pay will also not increase. If you're fresh out of college and need a job ASAP this is it, but don't get sucked in too much. Benefits are good (insurance, 401K) corporate headquarters has more to offer like a gym and I think free food. If you're in a field office, you're lucky to get water and coffee delivered....they like to not pay the bill. Can work from home but that might come to an end. Pretty much can take PTO whenever you want.Fast paced environment.  New vision, strong leadership.  There are great things in the future for this company.  Be ready for an exciting ride.This company is among something really BIG in regards to autonomous driving and location cloud.The co-workers are really nice and the office is a nice place to work (great location in the city).The company is large enough to take on different projects or opportunities across different organizationsManagement is involved in too many of decisions which make the company very slow for a technology company.  Also, many of the support teams do not work together as a team to accomplish the goal (or deal).  There is a lot of red-tape that you need to be able to get through to get anything done.The Culture needs to change vastly for this company to be very successful in the future.we were inbound reps, handling 20-50 calls a day placing orders for customers. Sometimes we would handle customer complaints,  trouble shooting and returns. mangers are down to earth and always there for help. small place so everyone knows everyone and always friendly, nothing to hard but your standard customer complaints. good hours and great potlucks.Company could be great, but has been in constant change for 6-8 years.  Culture went from family like to a business case study.  It will have success, but at the expense of being a great place to work.Had opportunity to see a industry evolve from TDM through 4G/LTE. had opportunity to see and learn about many technologies. Not so great of a place as the bubble burst but I survived till I retiredFine place if you just want to put in your work and collect your pay check. Never know what direction the company is headed in. Few advancement opportunities. Management always working behind closed doors.I worked on our feature recognition team to develop machine learning technology by verifying and correcting what the software attempts to categorize road signs.We would have a daily scrum to discuss what we had been working on and what we would be working on for the day which was great to keep everyone on the same page.Recently a new tool was developed for the deep learning software and it has been fun to communicate feedback to our Chicago office to make the tool more efficient and user friendly.At times it can be a little tedious to be reviewing thousands of road signs detection every day and it does not feel like challenging or full filling work.Great place to work, nice people and benefits. However sometimes reluctant to embrace change and innovation for internal process.Great use of latest technology; Above average standardization; Environment is excellent; Management is terrible; Advancement is terrible; Benefits are sub par.Great place to work, learned a lot over my tenure, got great opportunities. Everyone is super helpful and approachable. It's a global business so requires travel in business positions.This job allowed me to use my Geography degree, travel all over the world, and develop my love for sharing knowledge and for public speaking.  I have a passion for training and communicating.  I learned to appreciate expanding my horizons with new technology, tools and programs.  I enjoyed meeting people and seeing places all over the world.Had my position not been eliminated, I would likely not have ever made a change.  I am searching for a new experience that will utilize my experience as well as continue to challenge me to learn and grow.Nokia Inc. is a one-of-a-kind company. It has went through a transformation period and is now entering into a new era. I love the Scandinavian way of working. It's such a privilege to work for Nokia!!Professional work environment. Great coworkers easy to get along with.Very top-heavy, and lots of internal reorganizations. Individual employee development seems to be of little importance to the management.Ever changing environment with highly profession team members located globally.",,Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-10-07T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/d128c95d-54a7-4a8e-aaef-59646e6b86d9?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=22,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
