36,2203.0,Senior Data Scientist,"Kaplan, Inc.",3.7,972.0,"Kaplan as a for-profit university, has the right idea. As an educator they are above reproach. With a little reorganization and rethinking culture, I have no doubt Kaplan will become a top educator.I have been teaching for Kaplan for 3 years and my experience has been gradually getting worse. I have never gotten a raise or even qualified for a review despite having very good experiences with my students who seemed to like me a lot and whose scores improved. It seems to me that the company is not as concerned as it should be with keeping experienced and valuable instructors on board. In addition to the pay issue, management has been less helpful and responsive than they were when I began teaching 3 years ago.  I have also had to spend more time than necessary dealing with IT issues just to access platforms necessary to do my job. Overall, it was a good experience and I enjoyed teaching very much, but I found that the company does not adequately support its instructors and they did not reasonably review me so that I might qualify for a raise.Kaplan had great pay, good benefits, but they worked you to death!  I loved the free education that I received. Loved working with the students.The management left something to be desired, they wanted you to do your job, and anything else that you could do.  I taught 2 classes a day with approximately 24 students in each class, any assignment you gave you had 48 papers to grade!  So not just a 9-5 job!  But I loved it and still hear from my former students. Hours are long, I was usually gone from home about 12-14 hours a day.My job duties consist of redundancy and can be boring at times, however because of my fabulous coworkers, and my manager at times, we provide each other with ""commercial breaks"" by sharing an experience or a joke during different parts of the day. The best part of my job is not being responsible for anything extra when I am out of the office. It seems when you are off or on vacation, work piles up and nobody does anything for you, but with the job duties that I have, productivity is based on when you are present at work.Kaplan University is a great place to work. A typical day involves guiding students in their decisions with attaining a better future through education. I have learned that even though some roadblocks may seem insurmountable, nothing is unattainable with patience and persistence. Management is very supportive of assisting advisors with difficulties they may experience with students. Co-workers are family oriented and supportive. Everyone feels like one big family.The hardest part of my job will be when I leave to go elsewhere. I truly hate to go but I need to keep growing in my professional life and that involves relocating back to North Carolina. The most enjoyable part of the job has been working with the Difference Makers, United Way, and Browared ARC.I enjoy working for Kaplan University.  I am looking to make a career change and leave the sales industry.  The management team is excellent and they do a great job creating a positive culture.  The hardest part of my job is being held accountable to meet goals, but there are some factors to meeting goal that are out of my control. The most enjoyable part of my job is the interaction I have every day with students and prospective students.Kaplan is a place where you have the guidance you need but also the freedom to teach creatively. The senior leadership and staff are amazing to work with. This is a great place to work!Kaplan has been one of my best jobs! Secure, benefits start on the first day of employment, salary was above competitive and allowed for growth after the first 90 days depending on your production.Worked at Kaplan as an admissions advisor for over 2 years. Completed my Masters degree in Health Administration. Volunteered each qaurter with the United Way. Maintained a great work relationship with employers.Its a good company to work with, Its a great work environment and learning opportunity in the academic field. This is a great starting point for anyone who wants to pursue teaching as their full time career in the future. Great quality of students and satisfactory compensation.The company had alot of ups and downs when I was employed there. I survived 2 massive layoffs. Other than that the benefits were average and the company would have lavish Holiday parties as well as shut the company down for half a day for field trips.Good company but of course - no benefits, classes are hit or miss and no growth opportunities.  Worked at the company 10 years and no ability for full time or advancement.The salary and environment at Kaplan Are nice. Because of gainful employment and the business of Online Universities suffering, it's slowly but surely killing the business. Online schooling as a whole is suffering. Kaplan treated me well tho.Everyday you walk in the door is another opportunity to change someone's life. There is always someone not ready for change but you have to be the one who can paint the picture of hope. Everyday you learn something new that either helps you individually grow or helps build your team be more productive.not good with work life balance, they used to be really good about schedule accommodations, then they stopped that and made it impossible to get a good scheduleTwo things that are great about the job: 1) working alongside talented & driven professionals who truly take pride in their work, 2) interacting with the vast diversity of students. Everything else falls short. Teacher salaries are almost comically disproportional to the amount of time and effort put into the work. Success metrics are based purely on student reviews, which are unreliable and often biased by popularity or student temperaments. Double standards and deceptive practices pop up time to time but usually quietly dealt with. Poor to moderate benefits with little chance of career advancement -- most teachers are kept part-time due to ""budget constraints"". Keeping appearance is often more important than substance.Salary wasn't commensurate with the experience the full-time teachers brought to the job or the income Kaplan was bringing in per class taught.It a wonderful place to work.College is expensive — but not if you are employed in higher education. The tuition benefits alone are hard to beat.I was hired as a classroom instructor for Kaplan after having had experience as only a substitute teacher, and I LOVED my starting pay rate. I also really liked that I could spend as much time as needed answering emails from students, and I could log it on my timecard without being interrogated by my manager. In fact, any type of enrichment studying that I wanted to complete towards the tests I taught was always approved for pay. I liked that I could set my own schedule every month by choosing which courses to teach. Unfortunately, bad management and weird advancement standards make this company worthless for me in the long run. Though my faculty manager never actively caused issues for me, she was almost completely absent and unresponsive to any need or question I ever had. She refused to answer her phone under any circumstance, and would often take weeks to reply to my emails. Also, it was impossible for me to advance within the company, because all advancement opportunities are based entirely on student reviews -- specifically in answer to the question, ""How likely would you be to recommend Kaplan to a friend or colleague?"" A teacher's composite ""score"" for this answer from students must be astronomically high before he or she can even help grade essays. I found this not just unfair, but crippling. Overall, Kaplan is a GREAT starting point if you want to continue a career in education. Just be sure you don't stick around too long.I'm not too sure why there are complaints. One, if you don't like working on phones, don't get a job working on phones; it's laughable really. Two, yes, you are required to work hard. I can't understand why that is a negative. Three, there are soooo many positives, that it would take too long to list them here, but, a few include nice break rooms, numerous company/department gatherings and events, excellent benefits, free education through the Gift of Knowledge program, and, believe it or not, there is definitely room for advancement---as long as you push for it. Kaplan is a giant company and it's easy for mediocre people to do mediocre things there for 20 years; don't be that person. My co-workers are the best I've ever worked with. My manager is the best manager I've ever had in my 22+ year career. I think, the most enjoyable part of my job is...it's very challenging. Yes, I work hard, but I love every minute of it. Upper management do their best to disseminate information, but remember, the company is enormous; it has many moving parts. Kaplan is the type of place you could go far if you really want to; but, you could also get caught in a rut. I would definitely recommend Kaplan to other people.Kaplan was a great place to work as far as the people I worked with. I learned so much over the years. I will always be grateful for the opportunity to work there.","10,000+",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/d8a65107-8510-45b6-bdd2-71a3ef07fbad?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

38,2205.0,Lead Data Scientist,GrubHub,3.0,63.0,"Grubhub will use you and won't care. They will have you drive all over the city to restaurants 20-30 mins away and won't pay you for those miles but they make sure that the distance between the restaurant and customer is no more then 3 miles away. Your told to accept all orders and just call dispatch and have them redirect the order to someone that's closer. The problem with this is that Grubhub will still count this as a rejected order. If you don't have any other source of income then I guess you can stick with this mistreatment but if you do, stay far away from Grubhub because you will be out of a car very soon and underpaid for your work.Great company to work for. They will prepare you for your future. They give back to their employees and the staff is wonderful. More pay would be nice.GrubHub may have a great concept, delivery direct to your door from the restaurant of your liking, but they have a horrible overall platform for drivers. First, I was with the company just three days before going to, what they call, ""driver care"" for assistance. The representative on the other end of the phone was rude and malicisously didn't help me when I began questioning her reasons for being so rude. It was just a disaster of a call with no assistance for my situation.Despite that issues, I decided to give the company another chance. What a mistake! They claim to pay a minimum hourly wage if your quota is not met. But, the underlining trick to that is that your acceptance rate has to be high enough to qualify. Well, that's really not possible when you're having to reject calls that are over 30 miles away from your current position. It's a trap! This really is not a company, nor a platform I would encourage anyone to invest themselves in.The night dispatchers try sending you everywhere.... you will have like 1 hour or even 5 mins left to your shift and they will try to send you 45 mins away to another city. like really I have a life I have another job. Plus the gas and wear on your car ! If you want to keep your drivers make sure you treat them right!The CEO of GrubHub is an intolerant bigot who only caters to one political persuasion and looks to silence balanced views in the work-place.This is a very unfriendly place to work. You need to keep your head down and not stick out or else management will treat you poorly. Never express your opinion, or wear your hair in a different way, or draw attention to yourself.The office culture here will destroy your life, and stress you out.This is a grotesquely irresponsible and terrible company. The product is extremely poor and it exploits its employees and contractors.The letter from the CEO has highlighted the company culture that bleeds down from the top.It's a democracy - to threaten those who participated in the freedom of democracy is in essence blackmail and inducing fear-mongering tactics.Horrific company culture from the highest level of management. Sub par business model leads to furious customers. The CEO threatens employees saying they have to agree with his political views. I feared for my job and security.Want a low life job that makes 11.5 an hour? Go to Walmart... you won't waste a lot of gas or destroy you car while you work.  Want to waste a lot of time waiting for Restaurants to get the food ready to deliver and NOT get paid for it? If so keep reading. If you want to waste a pile of gas money driving half way across town to have that glorious oppty to wait and get paid a peanut? Well yeap you should sign up today with Grubhub... App is not reliable and minimums are a farce. Do yourself a favor and kill the curiosity about what it will be like before you waste time and money finding out that you are not your own boss and you make about or less than what you could make at Walmart or In Out burgerDay to day at grubhub is very hectic and fast paced, customers and restaurants contacted us frequently for assistance with issues or support, and I was on the phone for most of my day, operating between several systems to assist them. From there I was promoted to the finance department where I assisted in identifying and preventing fraud committed on the website. In this role I was not on phones but did email customers quite a bit to assist in fraud claims and errors with their purchases. I learned empathy and working efficiently in a fast paced and large environment and how to rely on coworkers to assist in day to day and working together to achieve an office goal and provide quality customer service.  The hardest part of the job was not getting frustrated with difficult customers and learning to walk in their shoes when solving a problem. The most enjoyable part was my co workers and satisfying customers with good service.1- App crashes almost everyday. They ask you delete the existing one and download again. 2- They send you 4-5 miles away from your location. You drive but you don't get paid for gas. They only pay for the gas you used between the restaurant and customer.  In other words (because you don't get paid until you reach the restaurant), you pay your gas expenses out of your pocket. No need to mention about car depreciation :)3- Let's say your shift is between 11 AM to 5 PM, and you don't want to accept a delivery which is created 4:57 that shows on your statement as REJECTED. Your acceptance rate goes bad. When acceptance rate is below %75 they don't contribute for min. guaranteed payment .4- New delivery order may pop up when you are on the way for delivery. You either reject or accept it otherwise you can't inform grubhub that you delivered the existing order. It sucks especially when you drive. It is like texting when you drive.Me gusto mucho este empleo muy facil tienes la oportunidad de escoger tu propio horario tienen buen salario y es un trabajo independiente.They want you to go to other side of town for delivery which you won't be compensated for.  When you refuse for too far away,  they' ll still keep sending you the same place in the future.  This wrecks your priority and acceptance rate.Explain this: Thursday you get two orders, same area, about $8-$10 tip. Friday you get three orders, very far apart, tips $13-$15 and guess what? BOTH MADE $21. You tell me if that's fair or not. Both days are same pay!!! OK, $0.86 difference. Really?Miles I drove probably was 10+ mikes, only considered over all is about 4 miles. They also don't pay you for attempting to deliver an order, picked up food, arrived at destination and customer cancels. No pay, plus you need to get permission to click delivered? Not only I wasn't paid twice for a delivery I already picked up, but I drove far for them and NOTHING. Company doesn't value their drivers, pay sucks on top of that they want you to extend your hours, ask why it's not delivered yet? Umm it's rush hour, traffic!!Company makes billions just like Insta Cart and paying their employees $1,lmao. GH makes around that amount, yet we get scrap money while the office people make money off of us. So, if you work for GH, just take it easy and don't worry about the office and their bs needs and rules. Just respect the customer and enjoy the drive till you leave the company. Don't drive your new car for this job, get a second older car to beat.Grubhub is a wonderful company to work for.  Very diverse, very friendly. Great pay, benefits. Triple pay on holidays. Contests & monthly bonuses is a plus.When I started working with GrubHub it was awesome: lots of hours, flexible, fun. Now GOOD LUCK if you can get a shift. There were probably 40 people in my area, now it's probably double or triple that so shifts are hard to get since they are first come first serve. Also, if you're lucky enough to get a shift or two, one may suddenly disappear leaving you with no work or money. If do work a shift, they will most likely short pay you. Don't get two shifts in one day, you wont get paid for the full hours worked. Oh and if you ever have any problems regarding shifts or pay, tough luck. They tell you to email them and when they finally get back to you a week or two later (if at all), they will just have a copied & pasted response for you. Worst, most unorganized & unprofessional company ever!GRUBHUB IS A COMPLETE rip-off. I work with this company for 6-months. The first month, I was paid $10.00 HR. The following month this company sent out emails to everyone in regards to pay decrease to $9.00 hr. The pay is now $9.00 hour for every state. Delivery radius was no more than 3 mile. I delivered a cheeseburger and a diet coke 26-miles from the restaurant. Grub hub is just taking advantage of the drivers. Grub hub is trying to make all the money on the delivery driver expense. Grub hub will call you to pick up a order over 20-miles away. You will not get paid for the miles going to the restaurant. You only get paid from the restaurant to the customers house that maybe 6 blocks away. GRUBHUB is not a dependable company for work. Recently grubhub had over 20 drivers on the clock for the entire week. Lots of drivers drive full time to pay there bills. Grubhub took everyones hours for the week. Lots of people left or didn't trust this company anymore. Every week they want you to fight for blocks for hours. You are a independent contractor 1099 at the end of the year. I got paid $360 for one week. My Gas was $200 for that week. I only made $160 for the week. Lots of wear and tear on your car. Grub Hub has lots of bad reviews! Don't be a victimFun job to work, you choose your own time and you use your own car. shifts consist of three hours per shifts. Shifts start at 11:00 and the latest you can take is 9. Depending on where your located, your area can be busy or slow. The hardest part of the job has to be just finding where people live in apartments, it's like wheres waldo.First of all, understandably, you do not want me to receive this $9/h for doing nothing so you will ensure I receive a delivery once an hour with no regard for my cars mileage.If I do not accept this delivery that can be twenty five to thirty minutes away, my acceptance rate and priority as an employee goes down. It is VERY hard to see even a penny of that promised $9. I have never seen one. Grubhub; if I'm doing nothing, I expect nothing. I also expect to be able to clock in on any day. And as an independent contractor, I should be able to. If the problem is people clocking out at peak times, perhaps you can keep acceptance rate based on reliability.The $9/h if you do not receive a delivery system throws a wrench in everything. I would rather get deliveries that make sense and are relatively close. Also these deliveries make other deliveries late as it pulls me into another drivers usual area.Great place to work very friendly environment and helpful. awesome schedules laid back work environment. Just an amazing place to work and the pay is awesome way better than most jobs.","501 to 1,000",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/2c3c6e73-3790-45f7-938c-18c01624d89e?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
63,2230.0,Jr. Data Scientist,Zurich Insurance,3.7,319.0,"I had to play ""catch-up"" for a new branch of Zurich North America:  Environmental Insurance.  The team I had been assigned to (via Spherion) had relocated from Atlanta to establish the Boston branch.  I used my skills from previous assignments to reconcile their database of applicants for insurance.Its an alright place to work. Benefits are good and pay is ok. If you have any insurance experience it will be pretty boring. Days are mundane and not very stimulating. Management is helpful but you shouldnt need them much except on unusual claims. Advancement is possible but you have to wait a year to apply and have manager approval. Easiest job ive had and i cant wait to move to a different position or change companies. Apply to be an underwriter or adjuster first if you can, otherwise youll be stuck for a year when you're qualified for a better position. A lot of people have been there for a while which is cool for them but it's just a place im passing through.I was excited about working at Zurich however quickly I became concerned about job retention. The person who had been in my new position for 4 years prior to my hiring had not performed well. High dollar claims had come in for years which was certainly due, at least in part, due to this person's low job performance. Sure enough, after only 2 years with the company, the claims were so high that I lost my job as part of the 8,000 massive layoff in 3/2016. In addition, it was problematic to me that long term managers who were neglectful of watching the bottom line were all retained while those of us who were high level performers were all let go.Don't fall into the trap at Zurich. It was once a profitable company but they have years and years to go before they can re-establish their once respectable reputation.The position and culture is fantastic until you realize that not all employees are created equal.  I witnessed multiple employees fired for no reason, even with superb performance.  No questions asked.  Terrible for security and advancement, you begin to worry about your position almost daily regardless of how well you perform.  Work environment is hostile and management is corrupt with power, doing what they please without any over-site from the executive team, and when any ""issues"" come to light the management is protected.Large insurance company, several offices around the US, global presence therefore has the pros of a large company and follows work life balance as industry norm.I enjoyed my time with Zurich.  It was a wonderful company to work for and I truly enjoyed working with all the people on the job.  I worked very hard supporting two attorneys handling Workers' Compensation matters.  Zurich truly cared about its employees.  The company provided good benefits and did all they could to make sure the employees were happy.  I truly enjoyed going into work every day because the people I worked with became like family.The salary is lacking and the health benefits are terrible and there is not a lot of room for advancement unless you want to move out of state. Over all I enjoyed my experience and learned a lot about the insurance industry.I worked with a highly qualified and diverse group of co-workers. The management of the company was highly qualified and had a significant work ethic. The company was highly thought of in the insurance industry worldwide. It was employee focussed and had significant benefits. A number of employees worked there for their full careers.Met and worked with a lot of hard working, talented, and smart people.  Above average salary, but if you are not in your seat, you are not working.  Management does not have the trust of the employees.  Managers say one thing and do another.  No trust, no guidance, and a very ""take care of yourself"" mentality when it comes to upper management.  They do not have the best interest of their employees in mind.  Great people to work with, not so much to work for.  Go thru layoffs every 3 to 4 years, so beware!A nice place to work. Typical day is research and administration; Presenting reports to other departments. Departments that work together on a daily basis do not have common goals, which can be problematic.Good company, culture, friendly environment, decent work-life balance, good benefits, competitive pay, knowledgeable leaders, values diversity, positioning for profitable growthHandle all casualty claims start to finish. Take in new claims review Coverage in detail to make sure no issues. If Issues attempt to resolve or issue reservation of rights or denial if needed.  If coverage is resolved then go into investigations speak with Insured and all parties on insured side who have knowledge of the claim get full description.  Call claimant and any witnesses.  If claimant is representatives call them. review any unusual issues with management or refer to SIU. I work independently.  I evaluate and resolve cases to conclusion with in authority limits and keep the insured informed of the claim. I assist co-workers and mentor younger ones in how to approach certain aspects. I handle all types of litigation.  I have good rapport with my Defense counsel and Plaintiff counsel. The most enjoyable part of my job when I resolve aged pending cases or I am able to obtain a Defense verdict on cases we agree to take through to trial/Due to the current management of expenses, yet initiative for profitable growth, we have seen out resources become a bit stretched, although we are doing the best we can with the current environment. The push for reduction of expenses is not a trait specific to my company or even my industry, in 2016 we have seen a push for expense reduction like no other.Corporate environment with global consideration for less fortunate and environment.  Upper management excellent but goals change from year to year causing confusion and redundancy.My job skills weren't being used for the experience I have. I was hired with the promise that Zurich would be taking on new clients in large industries such as Paper Mills, Oil and Gas industries and Co Gin plants. Never happened. great co workers willing to help one another out.The company itself is very stable, offers many potential opportunities, and generous compensation. Senior management in my region was very supportive of career development. However, team managers, who you deal with on a much regular basis, absolutely leave much to be desired - problems with lack of interest, excessive case loads, ignoring submitted closings, and internally promoted managers not recognizing that they are now a member of management and acting accordingly versus acting like they were still a front line employee.Also, despite senior managements support of career development, actually being able to branch out into other areas of the company are limited by preferential treatment and arbitrary hiring policies (ie: not being able to switch roles within a year of receiving a title bump).End of the day, it's another job in claims, nothing more.I really enjoyed working for Zurich.  I was treated with respect and always in a timely manor with professionalism.  I really enjoyed working with Dawn Kondratowicz.  She is an awesome insurance adjuster.  She was very helpful and a pleasure to work for.Typical day was doing search for new claims, contacting insured, documenting file and preparing file for next course of action.  Manager was awesome, my team was awesome and I am grateful to Zurich for this training me and promoting me while the business was here in Maryland.Lots of phone calls, ongoing diary and settlement resolution. Best part of job was co-workers. Hardest part of the job was having to review every file with a manager. It was difficult to move up in the company. Looking to move into a higher level position with more exposure was difficultMy company was purchased by Zurich (Farmers Insurance division) so I was not directly hired into it. Overall they managed the call center as any corporation does.Zurich is a very professional and diverse organization. I greatly enjoyed working with various insured's and handling claims fortheir properties. I was recognized many times for my professionalism and abilities and resolving claims.","10,000+",Chicago,Schaumburg,IL,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/6828dc57-06e4-4e89-8bd1-c1188199a870?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

There is always something that need immediate attention.This is what I like about Working for the University of Chicago.  My focus is manly customer service and my customers are the President of the school, faculty, staff and students. However the downfall of the position that I hold as Facility Coordinator is that I can only hire students to work in the department and they don't usually have any work experience so they lack the skill set needed.A typical day at The University of Chicago starts off with a very peaceful and pleasant environment that allowed me to flow right into the work day. I learned from my colleagues in  the Metabolism program to pay close attention to details and to always go over any unclear instructions. I was very pleased with the relationship my co-workers and I established and that was we always worked in our solution as team players. The most challenging part of my job was working with heads of departments and programs but being the level headed and diplomatic individual I am this only grew my people skills. The most enjoyable part of my job was all of my staff that I worked for did not limit me and allowed me to manage and coordinate the committee with out hesitation trusting my work ethic and judgment.The University is very large and decentralized. Thus, many employees transfer between departments. The University focuses first on faculty, then on students. Often, general staff don't receive a lot of attention.Nice company to work for. Very please to be a part of the growth of the company. I would recommend working for this company.Loved working here, only temporary though. Very hard to become employed here.

It's great to be part of one of the most prestigious public accounting firm in the world.In the financial services market, there is constant pressure to meet short deadlines with an intense amount of work. Among other groups, there is a flexible work environment.Overall a great place to work! It was as an early place in my career, it was definitely a learning experience.

I great place to start working and understanding the corporate world.PwC allows you to learn and grow. Great projects are mixed with miserable ones. A lot of really good people work in the company with excellent experience and expertise, but some are far from being perfect.There was no work/life balance and employees were expected to give up their weekends for about 9 months out of the year. Management was very appoachable however and had an open door policyGreat opportunity for recent graduates. Exposure to a lot responsibilities and different types of jobs. Team work required, long busy seasons.Working at Pwc as a contractor at the moment, I'm lucky to be surrounded by a team of professionals with great attitude and personality. we provide help to the employees on daily basis on their laptops mostly but we also make sure everything else is working perfectly, things like printers, video conference equipments, phones, TVs and more..Co-workers are extremely smart and talented. They help you to grow your personal brand and establish your unique value to the firm through diverse experiences.Great people, great work mostly, and excellent support. Need to remember that it is a business driven by revenues. Long-term, one needs to align what they do with how the firm makes money.I was part of a small close-knit group of consultants with good access to my management. I truly enjoyed the minimum 2-week mandatory learning opportunities.I landed on the wrong team that over hired in anticipation for some big wins that unfortunately did not come.  The culture and people that work here are great however; you really need to find a great project/teamPwC provides a good opportunity to expand your understanding of auditing and accounting principles. PwC has very high expectations of its employees. Employees are expected to learn on their feet and to keep up with long hours and high stress deadlines.I loved this job. I worked there for about 8 years. Management team was great. All the tellers were great. I have no problems with this bank. It was the best working experience of my life.Great company, depends on your group, obviously a global company with similar opportunities.  Beautiful office and locations, great benefitsCareer is propelled forward through combination hours over standard and networking in addition to performance. Although the work alone won't guarantee you the promotion, management is always willing to speak with you and help you be as well rounded as you would like. It's a great place to start your career.This office is a great opportunity for recent college graduates seeking experience to build their marketability.
