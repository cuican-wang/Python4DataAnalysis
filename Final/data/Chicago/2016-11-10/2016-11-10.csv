61,2228.0,Data Scientist,The NPD Group,3.0,20.0,"I have worked at NPD for less than a year. I am working in a part of the company that would be considered low skilled and less demanding when compared to other positions within the company. Right now I am very happy. In my position the environment is low stress and I am able to come in every day, get my work done, and go home. Currently my goal is to gain more computer skills in order to apply for a better position within the company. The only negative for me is I don't completely know how the company operates and what its goals are, I don't know what other people within the company do, I am not required to, but I wish they offered some more training and explanations of the company's many functions.You are expected to deliver the result no matter what. But do not expect to get any support. No one really cares about you.They can terminate you any time and in any way .High turn over rate at this company. Not worth it if you want to have career at this company.Its a great place to start your career. If you are a senior level employee then persue other options. As a senior developer i have not had any advancement of my knowledge or position. Manangers are junior and the staff is more knowledgeable.This was my first job and I was excited to start. From my interview experience, this place looked promising and a great start to a career. I was wrong. What they had me do was absolutely nothing at all similar to the job ad. I struggled. There was no training whatsoever, and the supervisor expected me to already know everything right away. Because I had no training, I created a vicious cycle where I would get projects wrong and my boss would get frustrated until I ended up feeling very inept. In essence, training is not in NPD's dictionary. They expect you to know everything right away---they threw all these acronyms at me as if I knew what they were already. On my first day, they threw a very complex project on my lap without any explanation on what it actually is, including what its acronym of a name stood for. Because of disorganized restructuring that seems to be ongoing, the work they had me do was not at all what I was trained to do, so naturally I was not good at it, which annoyed my supervisor. It made me think of a quote from the movie Office Space:  ""...it's not that I'm lazy, it's that I just don't care"" (also, I hope you like the cubicle farm, because that's what you'll get---in their headquarters, there are almost no windows whatsoever, so it's a bunch of cubicles and tiny offices that are lit by halogen lights, which is pretty depressing). There's really no incentive unless you are in dire need of a superficial ""you did it"" corporate banner on your cubicle. There's no room for growth, and many young people see this as just a gig until they find something better.  more... That is probably why there are few younger people in the office. More importantly, at least to the people around me, there's no work-life balance. People work on weekends, on their time off; they come into work earlier to work and stay late. This is all because of mismanagement an a generally inept method of work. Things keep messing up and the employees have to cover the slack of the higher-ups. There is a high turnover, which is unsurprising, as no one looks truly happy. As others mentioned, there is no room for innovation. They stick to outdated procedures that aren't that great. I should mention, however, that these experiences may differ from department to department, so I can't speak for all. Finally, I will also say that the benefits are not too shabby.  lessNice place to work, I did overnight for a period of time but overall it was a very quiet and relaxed place to start building my professional path.Autonomous work place with a good work/life balance.  It is all about the numbers and not so much about career growth and advancement.  Decent amount of red tape and politics, but manageable.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with clients and helping make an impact on their business.Its been many years since I stopped working there, but I can't imagine things have changed I was only with the company for 2 years and a few months and in that time there were multiple layoffs followed by mass hirings.  It is quite nerve racking not knowing when the next round will come or if you'll be included.  When I was hired, there were 6 other new employees in my department.  By the time I left, 3 of those 6 were already let go.  All the loss of staff means you are constantly being moved around doing things you were not originally hired for.  In my case, I was forced into a role I was completely unsuitable for (and uninterested in) thus leading to my leaving the company.   A typical workday consisted of meetings - hope you like to be in small rooms because there are small conference rooms all over the place and it seems like you just go from one room to another - better bring your power for your laptop (there were multiple instances of 4 people sharing power just to make it through the end of the meeting. I was hired through a recruiter - she described the place as a collegiate atmosphere.  This should've been my first warning.  They are constantly trying to make up for the lack of morale by forcing everyone every so often in team building exercises.  Basically there are 2 ways of looking at this - those who look at it as a great way to miss a day of work or those who look at it as a day wasted because now there is double the amount of work waiting when you come in the next day.  You're better off skipping any job postings for this placeGreat place to start a career. As you advance, you will learn less and less because the place is not motivated to change. Eventually, you will no longer have skills to compete in the marketplace and will be mired in internal politics.Great company.  Recently a lot of room for advancement due to growing company.  Good culture and great work life balance, but likely lower compensation than similar positions in other companies.NPD is a great company to work for. The hours are reasonable and workload manageable. If you enjoy analyzing data and telling stories, it is a fun company to be a part of. As with any data supplier, incomes are below that of a typical marketing position, but based on interactions with marketing departments across the industry, it is a relatively low stress field.Checking Calendars Preparing for meetingsMailProcessing ContractsUpdating ContactsFollowing-up on events for my managersBooking TravelManagement very understanding and a wonderful personCo-workers were amazing and helpful I enjoyed the flexibility and culture of the companyHardest part was the commutePeople work as a team. Great communication among all peopleNice atrium for relaxing or casual meeting.A great place to start your career. Great work environment with lots of hands on work, and great leaders to provide insight.NPD is going through a corporate transformation.  It's an exciting time to be part of the evolution and help drive change.Company has a hard time keeping up with current market. New senior management not clear about objectives and expectations. Company pulled in many directions without focusing on a clear path.I've worked there for over 18 years and now they are moving my department to Ireland.Place sucks dont do it,spend your time consulting or workingfor a large corporation. You will do all the work while othersgo play baseball and go shopping, your reward is to be part ofregular massive layoffs after your projects are done.Dont do it.I thought this was my dream job, but after working with your co workers and managers, you start to realize who is there for you and not too many people were, especially from my department. I won't recommed this job to anyone.管理层十分人性化，待遇福利非常好. 但是不同的部门会有不同的情形。在我的部门，工作量相对轻松，但是不够具有挑战性。",,Chicago,Rosemont,IL,2016-11-10T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/642f150a-1f01-42ef-b37b-f0f5714cee53?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The warehouse employees  are constantly forced to work 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, face sudden and unexplainable schedule changes, NO notice about days off (if any), safely is ignored, worker fatigue is rampant, and inexperienced people are operating equipment in a unsafe manner. Let's see how all office and management do the work for a couple of months, and see how their family/marriage life is. With one day off, they wouldn't last, or change.Worked there for 16 years. I've seen a lot of changes through the years.  You are able to be promoted  with in the company if you are a hard worker, and lead by example.  The changes that are taking place now is for the good of job security for long term. I personally know change is hard, but to compete with other Food manufacturing plants you have to try different programs to cut cost and save money in order to stay competitive in the food manufacturing world.Good job to make money (a lot of hours) but no flexibility on personal time. The work force is pretty much all everyday hard working people just trying to make a living. The worst part of the company is that the HR Dept. runs the plant. they have no consideration for talent and are constantly threatening people with their job. The management are good people that seem to have their hands tied from making improvements due to corporate policies that don't work. The Union is basically none existent when it comes to representation.I miss Heinz in Pocatello.....nine years of a daily battle to meet and exceed expectations.  But in the long run seeing them go has been  extremely  hard on my family.  In other words  if you're  lucky to work  for them appreciate  what they give back. Hard work is rewarding... I felt with them.  I have had to work two jobs just to match what they payed me in Pocatello  Idaho....Company management, not plant management, is too concerned with saving every dollar.  Company shut down 7 plants and relocated production lines with very poor planning.  Money is being cut in the wrong places.  I'm all for saving money and reallocating tasks, however it cannot affect the safety and quality of very profitable products.  Management needs to take a step back and look at the picture as a whole and put the right people in place to get the job done right the first time.Fast paced and multi faceted. Hands on experience - learn as you go - no support from management. Most co-workers great - very supportive and respectful.The hardest part of the job after new management took over is being micromanaged. I've always been a self-starter, who takes ownership of my work but when constantly questioned, it starts to wear on you. I most enjoyed feeling like I was a contributing team member. It was challenging at times but, overall a good experience.I start off by seeing how things are running and complete starting my paper for tracability.. I've learned the importance of team work and working together with other to achieve a common goal. leadership was import in completing difficult task.Getting people that were lazy to work with the team was the most difficult task, but it was achieve. seeing how production numbers at the end of the day.Within my first 5 months of working, the plant manager, production manager, quality manager, a production supervisor, a quality supervisor, and a finance supervisor all left the plant. The production supervisor and quality supervisor positions were not up for replacement. There's no sense of team work. 3G has insane cost cutting methodology that takes away from any experience and is not rewarding at all.My day begins with a shift meeting then I go to my line and check my labels and do my quality suites and maintence the machine if needed. Then I prepare my line to begin running. Since working my job I've learn to be patient and never rush because you may make a mistake. I learned to work safe and keep my machine clean at all time so that it functions better. Management lets you know that you are doing a good job and my co-workers always willing to help out if needed. the hardest part of my job is doing changeovers where you change the parts out for different bottle size. the most enjoyable part of my job is coming to work everday and just smiling knowing that I love my job and interacting with my co-workers.This company pays well but that's where the pros stop. Management is a joke and a lot are straight out of college with no knowledge of the processes but still think they know it all. High turnover and no regard for family life, nearly impossible to schedule family events without the fear of schedule changes.like every normal job you punch in and put on your apron and go to your destination line ...if your first time there working you'll be train to all lines in order to find out were your abilities are need the most....when ever your having a problem with whatever it is they are always there to help you out..as for your fellow peers is like feeling home always there to help you out...the only part that the floor are concrete and your standing more than 9 hours and your feet tent to hurt so have some good shoes or boots...the good think about is that you can sometimes get some product on holiday to take to your familyI enjoyed my employment with Kraft. It was my first job in the warehouse industry and I maximized my potential while employed, from trainee to management within a years time.Kraft was very good to work for and many had 30+ years experience.  Opportunities abound and it was a great company to grow with.  I learned to organize a large group of people at off-site locations to interact with other departments.  I worked with a great team who have remained friends.  I was treated with respect in an office of mostly males and was shown all the appropriate thanks for a job well done.Everyday before you start work you have a meet on what your team did on the day before. Also have to warm up. One a year they doing something for there employees and their families.  You could always go to your team leader if you have a problem with anything or you just don't understand.Kraft was a fast paced , never boring place of employment.  I started out on an entry level position and advance to operator position within a satisfactory time period. The management was excellent at my time of hiring, and my co-workers were team players and willing to help in any way. The hardest part of the job was getting product out on a scheduled time when we had maintenance issues or machine failure, but we had a good maintenance crew that worked hard to ensure we kept on schedule.  The most enjoyable part of the job was taking pride in the work one accomplished at the end of the day.Kraft was my second home. I had the pleasure of working with some of the best managers from the beginning of my career with Kraft to the very end. Kraft gives their employees many opportunities in the work field. Including training, seminars, hands-on, etc.The typical job at Heinz was moving around, taking care of the product, and fixing boxes. I learned a lot of new things making sure there was enough product in the boxes, were do they keep the product, how the be able to handle fast machinery, what kind off chemicals are used to clean and disinfect the machines. Management were really nice. I enjoyed being around my coworkers they were really friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was how to fix the fast machinery but I was willing to learn. The most enjoyable part the job being at work.the sad story behind Kraft, many people don't know Kraft started about 100 years ago in Allentown. Sadly it became the worst managed facility, the waste was beyond belief, while people in charge ( plant manager, HR manager and the like ) made one stupid decision after another , allowed bigotry and nepotism in running the place, while pretending to put on a good front.The maintenance supervisor was a wonderful guy, but had a weak personality so he was overworked, the lead technician, had no idea whatsoever about leadership.I could see the inefficiencies from day one, I wasn't surprised about  the decision from those who acquired the company to close the plant.Since the KraftHeinz merger, the cutbacks began and all the maintenance supervisors were the first to go,  Then people off the floor were promoted to Lead positions and was still expected to perform there duties as a floor mechanic.  All this for just a $1.00 more an hour while production Leads were given $4.05 an hour more.  This is at the Granite City plant where this job opening is located.  If you like working with young inexperienced mechanics and like to be stabbed in the back at every turn then this job is for you.  I worked there for almost 8 years and it was a great place to work once upon a time.  But now management condones an adversarial (stab you in the back and smile in your face) atmosphere and is always looking for any reason to write a mechanic up.","10,000+",Chicago,Glenview,IL,2016-11-10T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/f706a922-cb97-4ab3-863c-340b7b10adb0?mescoid=1900238001001&jobPosition=13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
