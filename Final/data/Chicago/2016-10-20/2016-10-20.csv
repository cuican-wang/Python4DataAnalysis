85,2252.0,Assistant Materials Scientist-3D Visualization,Argonne National Laboratory,4.2,81.0,"Engaging, diverse and multicultural University like environment.The APS Beamline hosts users from all around the world and is the brightest X-ray source in the world. Every day continues to be an education.Argonne hires a lot of foreign  employees, so the best part about this job would be learning about all the different cutlers that are present here.I did my summer intern at Argonne. Its a great place to work. Huge number of cool projects are happening on daily basis. Lots of learn. Higher management is very helpful.Weekly meeting to discuss progress on various projects.  Learned what other professional were working on and the progress and problems they en-counted.  .Group participation in addressing problems en-counted by the other groups.  Worked mostly alone with little supervision.  however, assistance was always available.  The hardest part of the job was leaving at the end of a day.  The most enjoyable was returning to the job the next dayFortunate to learn a lot at a young age during an internship. Made you feel very welcome and always allowed you to seek new opportunities. Also a great location for those who like the city of Chicago.At ANL, I enjoy my co-workers and most of the researchers I help support as an HP tech. There are good benefits, job secuirty at least for me is great (Unionized), and my direct supervisor is wonderful. My largest issues stem from my group management. There is an overall feeling from many of the techs that our opinions are not heard and our feelings dismissed. While this might not be entirely the case this seems to be a common feeling among both the good workers and the bad workers. This could stem from lack of communication from our upper management about how our issues are actually addressed instead of just being told no. There is also a lack of training and continuing education at the tech level. While many don't care about having this there are a few of us that do and would like to be given that opportunity. Others issues stem from the way techs are treated by researchers we support on a day to day basis. Many of us end up being buffers between the researcher and our supervisors. This is emotionally exhausting. Many attempt to do things behind their area HP's back and are upset when a tech goes to their boss to ensure that whatever the researcher is wanting to do is safe, covered by appropriate work control docs and RWPs. Many have no care or no understanding of contamination control and argue with techs if they are told they are doing something unsafely. While we don't have Ph.Ds we are experts in our right in our field. Over the last 2 years many researchers have gotten better, but I still find there is a general lack of respect for safety personnel in general. As an hourly  more... worker, work life balance is hard especially since alternative schedules were taken away from us by upper management. Argonne as a whole (not just looking at my little world) seems to be an excellent place to work. Every group has their issues. I have no opinion of upper upper laboratory management.  lessWorking at the lab is unique. The culture is so relaxed, because the focus here is about the science and results. It's not a strict environment at all. So, self-motivation and initiative will get you far here.The coworkers are down to earth and friendly. They are proud of the work they do. That's what it's like working here: doing great work and taking pride in it.Argonne is located in Lemont, which is a far southwest suburb of Chicago. This is probably my largest gripe with this employment: the commute is difficult.This place has great people. Good salary, nice location, great compensation, in Chicago area, lots of food and entertainment not far awayWhile attending Purdue University I worked as an intern and assigned to the Decision and Information Science Division. I designed power supplies for special instruments used in collecting data for energy conservation. This was very exciting because projects were experimental and on the leading edge.A typical day at work is very busy. There is no room to grow nor any employment opportunities after the internship. You mostly work alone with very little supervision. You do learn about what scientific breakthroughs Argonne has discovered and are currently working on. You also meet different people on a daily basics.The potential for personal and professional growth is highly dependent on who you work for. Most PIs are only interested in advanced their personal career and are likely to treat you as a technician, not a young scientific mind. However, there are a few gems that are wonderful people and scientists. I would highly recommend looking at what happened with the careers of the previous postdocs before working for someone at ANL.As a radiation safety trainer and an HP technician, I interacted with hundreds of people from around the country and around the world.  Management is caring and focused on Argonne's objectives while also aware that those employed here have lives outside of work.I've found Argonne to be extremely helpful in furthering my professional development.  The pay and benefits are much better than academic postdoc positions and you're surrounded by world-class researchers and equipment.  The downside is that getting hired to a permanent position here is extremely difficult.The editors offered useful advice concerning effective writing. My writing skill improved substantially from their advice. The project teams worked closely together to deliver results.I only worked there as an intern so I don't have much to say. I enjoyed the culture I worked in, and the people I worked with. The engineers I was working with were highly motivated and exceptionally intelligent, making the internship very productive for my development.I worked with a team to support the lab with rigging and transporting of scientific equipment.• Installed specialized lab equipment requiring advanced skills for hoisting/ transport within facilities and onsite• Worked on lift plans for critical lifts with an emphasis on safety• Proficient in safe working loads and standards for all rigging including chains, chokers, slings, spreader beams, and other associated hardwareI would get tickets for troubles from the Service desk and work with a crew of Desktop support admins. All of the crew were extremely talented and all would help you at any given moment. The company was a National Laboratory so every year there was a possibility that the government would be shut down. Management was good as to not micromanage and allowed you to work unabated, as long as within Service Agreement parameters.Excellent place to work. Excellent environment. Excellent People. Many good thing to learn. Excellent Challenges.I highly recommend this place to work.ANL is a great place to work to advance your career with hands on training.  It is also good to take advantage of the opportunity to further your education.I love working at Argonne National Laboratories.  The people are nice and they really care about making sure that you understand what you are doing.  If you are on staff you have great benefits, but as a contractor you have no benefits except what you get from your staffing agency (almost nothing).It was not an exciting place to work. It was monotonous work.  Had good compensation.  There was not much supervision.  A lot of shift changes that made it hard to balance work/home.","10,000+",Chicago,Lemont,IL,2016-10-20T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/93dc4e14-00e5-4c6b-b454-08c9ba9970b0?mescoid=1900260001001&jobPosition=21,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
