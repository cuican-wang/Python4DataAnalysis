131,2298.0,Project Manager/Senior Environmental Scientist,Stantec,3.6,237.0,"management-oriented approach.does not have supervisors in place to catapult into future. engineering staff lacks maturityGreat company to work for as far as compensation, long hours of outside work. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with changing schedules. I enjoyed working outside with team members to complete tasks safely and efficiently.Fast paced consulting firm that continues to grown through acquisitions. Places a lot of value on employee billable hours.  Great place to work on multiple projects and gain some valuable technical skills.Needs improvement on employee retention and organic growth.If you are a perfect person who makes no mistakes, you like working extra hours without extra pay or even recognition for it, and especially if you like constant ridicule and pre-meditated judgement, then this is the work environment for you. Don't get me wrong, most people in my experience at Stantec were friendly and professional. Unfortunately, this could not be said for most of the managers. I HIGHLY discourage anyone without direct experience to the client to avoid this job at all costs. It was extremely difficult to go in to work everyday when you felt like an outcast, and any mistake you made was put under a microscope and scrutinized. The work is challenging and diligence to details is extremely important. Because of that, re-work is unavoidable. I would expect when re-work happens, a solid, cohesive team would come together, receive structured feedback, and learn from the mistakes to avoid them in the future. Sadly, this was not the case. Unorganized is an understatement of what I witnessed. The company doesn't seem to want to build up its employees from the inside and they aren't willing to pay for the experienced individuals, so they are caught in a self-inflicting lose-lose situation. What I learned is that the same way there are good quality engineers and poor engineers, there are also companies with good work environments and companies with poor ones. These environments are highly influenced by their leaders, or lack thereof.Searched for easements for pipeline project and uploaded documents into database. Worked 6 months due to company lost bid on job and had no work.Stantec is a great company to work for.  They are organized and very professional.  The compensation and benefits are what makes this work environment the best.  Happily paid employees make for a happy work environment.  This company really takes care of their employees.I great place to stay busy but not much room for advancement. Good people to work with, good opportunities for some very fun projects. Stay on upper managements good side.Keeping community in mind is their motto yet they could care less about their employees.  Not impressed with management and all the extra bull with the company.  They waste lots of time and money.  They bought our smaller company last year and after a few months starting letting people go, first starting with admin, accounting, then laying off CAD people, engineers and scientists. Not impressed with this large Canadian company.I worked at Stantec while pursuing my degree, I had a great experience there and worked with a diverse group of individuals. Would recommend this company to anyone looking to gain experience. Positive working environment and flexible schedules made my experience an exceptional one.Large projects underwater by millions and it takes ""management"" by surprise. Woefully behind the times with low skilled workers at the helm. Projects listed on website are ten years old executed by acquisitions where the leadership has bailed to successful companies.No repeat business and lawsuits filed by companies they have screwed. Earnings destroyed by execution problems and the stock nosediving.They toy with you if they will hire you or not, the management is unclear and rude. The  language barrier is ridiculous and you get blamed for everything. There is no set training they just throw people in blind and expect them to know everything. DO NOT WORK IN THE WYOMISSING BRANCH!!!! THE MANAGEMENT THERE IS THE WORST!!!!I'd say it's a typical office job.  Most of the time employees work independently, which I liked.  The only thing that struck me (and may not be so strange to you) is that the people are very smart and social, so quiet people like me might look a bit of a funny duck, nevertheless, such a person will be respected there as long as he/she is an honest worker.It's a professional place to work; however definitely not friendly.The work load is ok, but no respect for management as they belittle their employees all the time behind their back.It was a good Joe we had fun and work heard.. Nice pay .good hours to work.benefit s to.the people where friendly. Nice. Just a good feeling work place..The people I work with are all really nice and knowledgeable. My work with them is remote but someone is always available to ask for help if I need it. I have a lot of responsibilities and I know my managers trust me.The day by day is  dynamic and you can learn every day because of the team experience. my co-workers are good friends. the hardest part of the job is the summer in the road... too hot. the most enjoyable part is everything else.There are great opportunities for collaborative efforts within the US and Canada. The downturn in oil & gas is trying, but this is standard across the board within the industry.Like any consulting company your future is really up to you.  You either need to have clients or be a resource to people with clients.  As long as  you are pushing to advance your career Stantec will be behind you and support you. This is not a lifetime appointment where you can sit on your laurels hoping for the best unless you are willing to get what you get.Stantec has a wealth of industry people and the workplace is enjoyable. There are people with all levels of experience. A typical day starts at 8:00 and finishes between 4 and 5. Monthly luncheons provide the office with a forum for a safe discussion and update to the ever evolving industry.I truly enjoy my day-day work task.I am able to choose how best to complete my work.This is a socially and environmentally responsible organization.Stantec is a great company to work for. They have a vision for the company, and are very friendly and flexible. They offer competitive benefits. Most importantly to me, they have the resources to compete on world class projects.","10,000+",Chicago,Lombard,IL,2016-06-21T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/3e44fc99-04aa-494b-8f90-cf8d42f88af2?mescoid=1300093001001&jobPosition=32,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
