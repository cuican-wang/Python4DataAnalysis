49,2216.0,Computer Vision Data Scientist,CCC Information Services Inc.,3.7,29.0,"Typical day at CCC was mostly meetings. There never was one day where there wasn't at least one meeting. A lot of conversations with the client mostly were on the phone but some of our customers would require an actual sales person to be on site for any troubleshooting reasons.The work culture and the environment are the best places to grow, and CCC is a fantastic place to work in. The people are very open to new ideas and are willing to grow.this company has seen better days. the current management in products and technology has become highly political. Each senior management person has certain favorites who would get all the promotions, increments and most part of the bonuses. A senior would not listen to a junior. quality and competency of work does not matter until you would do what ever they ask you to do. Developer does business analysis, Business analysts does only testing and documentation and no real business analysis. Development managers in Products development does release management and quick fixes. it is a chaos.The company really seems to put the people first.  The management really wants to help you to work in the field you want to.  Co-workers are always friendly.  The office politics can sometimes seem overbearing but seem less of an issue here then other companies.  Advancement seems to be a more of a groomed approach which sometimes makes it feel like they play favorites but I have learned it's because they actively worked towards it, as I began to experience as I move into my career.With the support of management, I was able to advance my career and was able to personally grow and develop. The most enjoyable part of my job was the relationships I made with my colleagues, customers and vendors. I had worked a long span and saw it go from a successful private company to a dynamic public company.Great training, easy to contact someone if you run into a problem. They are very willing to help you at anytime. The reps are helping use with learning about cars that are now making it to the lots. If we find something different we can ask about the items to make sure we count the items. Management comes out about every 4 months to do evaluations of our work, Do we miss some items. I was missing the two glass tips that open on some BMW's and Mini Coopers. Will not miss them any more.Company is successful despite itself and lacks heart and soul. It is hardly an inclusive culture and priotitization for any sort of employee development has been a challenge for a great number of years.Many great people to work with and the company pays well for its talent. Chicago and California offices are highly modern and help create a pleasing environment.In twenty years of working at half a dozen different companies, I would rank CCC as the least supportive and least enjoyable. There are far better employers to devote your precious time and energy to if you want to grow as a human being and professional, individual contributor.I spent a great deal of time interviewing with CCC for a management position in the Northeast, despite some unusual qualifications for the position, and compensation that was minimally acceptable.They had recently hired someone who had not worked out, and it seemed they wanted to be very careful (maybe interview for a few more rounds for CYA reasons).After not asking during the interview, the interviewer expressed his concerns about my persistance as I was leaving, and althought that was helpful to know, it was nothing close to the truth. He should have asked.  I thought he already found the person he wanted to hire, but the ad ran a few more times in a few more places, so evidently that wasn't the case.To CCC and all the other ""serial interviewer"" companies out there- please don't waste our time for your political or tax break needs. Some say they can't find exactly the right person, which in this economy (and this type of position), is ludicrous.CCC has gone down hill over the years as far as employee treatment, they have taken the corporate approach to their employees where you are treated like a number more than a person. They are a small company but have their head in the corporate clouds as far treatment, the work/life balance is nonexistent and getting time off is a battle unless you know 6-10 months in advance what days you need off. Phone reps are put at a impossible adherence standard of 98%, that equals 8 minutes off the phone a day for working other projects they assign as well as bathroom breaks (industry standard is 90-95% or 45-23 minutes a day, source:Google) I have personally witnessed long term 10 year + employees fired a day before Christmas for minor under performing on stats, how heartless is a company to do that to someone who has planned their life around the company and to do it right before Xmas, at least have the decency to wait until the holiday passes for such a minor infraction but like i said its turned to such a corporate mentality that they will trim the fat anywhere needed anytime to make the books with little to no regard for employee well being.As far as the good aspects of the job, the pay was decent to slightly above normal, the benefits where priced realistically compared similar jobs. Location is downtown. (be prepaired to pay for your own parking $60-90 a month) Off the phone employees are treated slightly better.while this job pays well and provides good milage, I lack the hours needed to make this my main career. there are only 7 managers throughout the entire country making advancement very difficultCompany is successful, not because of the products but because of the monopoly they hold with the insurance industry (which eventually will change as they cannot even support their current base appropriately). Their technology runs on technology a decade old. Innovation here does not occur and it's hardly a culture where someone can grow in or evolve in.In the past 15 years of working at several companies as either a consultant or employee, I would rank CCC, along with it's executive team in IT the least innovative, least enjoyable, and least performing out of any company I have ever worked for.If you are offered a job or interview and are ALREADY at a good company or somewhere that you can be for a couple more months/years, do not leave your current place as that would just be a bad move. It would be a career mistake and career sabotage to put yourself into a career at CCCIS.Company has gone through layoffs many times and continues to utilize layoffs and budget cuts to make topline growth requirements. Which means that license purchases, are not accounted for , innovation and purchases are limited, and come close to failure monthly with violating customer SLA's and also potential data/DR risk. Management and recruiters will lie to you to get you in. Once you start you will hear about all the red flags (from your own managers/coworkers as they too hate the company they work for and past leadership/employees who fled this company because of it's inefficiency, unethical behavior, inability to be innovative, etc. I would only recommend this company if you REALLY  more... need a job temporarily and you need to find something better and this is your only choice.  lessThey have good people here and they are working hard to make improvements. The hours are long and demands for your time reach into all hours day or night and weekends. There are lot of production issues and issues in other non-prod environments. However, they are working towards making improvements and have gotten better then where they were before.Good learning and worked on hadoop  ecosystems like pig, hive,sqoop,cassandra,design,coding,unit testing and oozie workflow scripts,shell scriptsEnjoyed the time that I worked at CCC learned a lot of new things. The people are very friendly.  I meet a lot of great people.Worked my way up in this fast paced and exciting time for companies rapid expansion. The environment was vibrant and a fair place to work.they are always looking for the cheaper employee and have no loyalty towards there employees. Middle management and most directors do not listen the the people they should  and just do what they want anyway.Don't waste your time with this company. Management has no clue. Communication does not exist. New employees are not welcomed and left to figure it out on their own.Allowed to advance into all areas of IT. Supportive management and grat environment to work in.Managed the day to day Human Resources needs of the business. This included recruiting, management development, and employee relations.Always re-structuring but great benefits and challenging workWorking here was wonderful, the management in Sioux falls was amazing.","1,001 to 5,000",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-10-19T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/47aab124-347b-4e04-bc91-419a50ff0904?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=19,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
