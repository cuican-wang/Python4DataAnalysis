163,2330.0,Medical Science Liaison,Endo Pharmaceuticals,3.5,63.0,"I had a pleasure to work with one of the finest company where each and every employee are very friendly and cooperative . I enjoyed working and the team was very helpfull from the outset.I would like to go back again if I get a chance to work with the same client again and again.I worked here as a contractor for 8 months.  The Management that I worked with were very nice and respectful.  Work/life balance is important to this company.  The company encourages employees to ""give back"" to the community and even schedules one day off a year for the employees to participate.Great job should just pay more attention to what is going on with employee.  Moral boosts numbers which manufacturing does which makes the company more money and produce more efficiently without mistakes. Still a good company.Good company to work for. Products have a place in the market, and you are given the resources needed to succeed. The management seems to have a good grasp on the steps needed to keep the company on a good trajectory.About a 2. The morale is low and not much support from HR and senior mgrs. Not had a raise in 3 yrs.Been lied to by Managers, HR and Supervisors. Not a good training system for Operations or new Supervisors.Expected to work much more hours than promised. There's a swinging door when it comes to the job turn around and Im on my 4th Plant Mgr in 3 yrs.I worked at Qualitest for 2 years. Started off a decent place but then went all corporate. They treat their employees horrible. Basically its like thanks for making us over a billion dollars this year with that being said here's your 17 cent raise on top of the horrible wage we pay you now. Job security is decent but trust me if they dont like you they'll make you want to quit. No advancement opportunities. You stay in the position and wage you were hired in at. like I sad its a stepping stone job. Most enjoyable part of the job is the occasional hour lunches. Hardest part of the job is having to deal with gossip, drama, favoritism, harassment (with no help from supervisors) and discrimination.Great place to work, gained a lot of valuable knowledge about the Pharma industry.Work was never boring, had a lot of versatility and challenging aspects to job function.Management was very helpful and supportive to my ideas, and helping me advance in my position(s).Co-workers were great, we worked together as a team on all projects.The most enjoyable part of the job was customer satisfaction.I enjoyed the job and people. Great work experience. The pay was a little low. Management doesn't do a great job of informing the direction of the job market.Mapped out my territory according to call plan, called on physicians and staff, in offices and hospitals, recorded information in computer, provided lunch and learns, teamed up with teammates for conventions and meetings, worked with district manager to discuss prospects and how to get increase in market share.I learned a lot about how to get past the gate keepers, how to engage the physicians in a conversation, how to add value to their business, and how to work a convention or event.The hardest part was when my territory was changed and I missed meeting with my regulars.The most enjoyable part was when physicians and staff told me they had success with my product-especially when it was recently launched.Identify and determine the customer base of Urologists throughout a defined geographic territory which includes Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York Convey the clinical benefits, ensure order placement and fulfillment, aid in billing/reimbursement of Valstar and participate in the intravesical administration of Valstar to patients with BCG Refractory CIS  Track the historical and present buying trends of Valstar and Fortesta among my established customer base of Urologists which has enabled me to maintain existing business while targeting and generating new sales Establish and monitor the purchasing channels for Valstar between numerous Urology Practices, Besse Medical, Smith Medical Partners and Specialty Pharmacies Every day at Endo was a different day filled with new challenges and learning experiences.  We were constantly learning existing Legacy and making new recommendations for process improvements.  Once a process was mastered and demonstrated to have successful results, I would train my team in order to provide them with the empowerment to move forward with this new process.  We would find ways to improve the process via reporting, excel vlookups and building structure across the organization. The most enjoyable part of the day was knowing that I made a difference in my team, their challenges and the company.Easy work, great managers, great co workers, you would love to work here. everyone helps each other out. From top to bottom it's a great place to workYou will probably be laid off months after you are hired. Confused management and dull drugs to represent. Do not even consider working hereIts always fun to work for Endo. The product mix enables you to have a welcoming atmosphere from the staff and HCP. Endo has that family type of atmosphere and it still gives value to its employees and  treats them as individuals.Great place to work, if you have a nice team.Learned a lot of new stuff FIORI is new technology which is in market for less time.The hardest part of the job is there is less communication between the team members, don't know what they are working on so messed up doing same work twice.Of all the pharmaceutical companies I worked for, this one was the best.  It offered a ton of vacation (4 weeks to start) and the products were legitimately there to help people (pain management).  A lot of great people made the aches and pains of the job bearable. The company provides great compensation and benefits. They go out of there way to provide the best environment to succeed in your territory. I've been with the company for 5 years and feel very secure in my position with many opportunities for advancement, and continual education paid by the company.There has been many changes and downsizing to the company. As of now the company is working with a skeletal crew. Many jobs are not getting done because only one person is in it and they are overwhelmed. Not only has there been major downsizing but the turnover rate is high as well. Unstability.Requires a lot out of its workers but it is a good paying job with outstanding benefits.I am a current healthtronics employee with over 7 years of service. This company called EndoPharmacueticals acquired Healthtronics some time ago and is starting to make life difficult for the Healthtronics employees. Healthtronics used to be a fun place to work because we would always have great functions (Summer and Christmas parties) that kept the employees morale high. Now that we are a part of Endo, it is not fun anymore. Endo tried to make sure that we did not have a Christmas party all in 2012 by shrinking the budget of the people who were responsible to plan events like this but we managed to have the party.Several months ago, Endo created a shared services division in which all of accounts payable from not only our company but a few others that were acquisitioned by Endo. Lets just say the employees in shared services are not happy because they are not being treated well (keep this in mind when applying for any A/P position).Just recently found out that we many not be getting yearly raises this year because the company ""did not do so well"". Hmmmm, that it funny for them to say that when Endo is building a muti-million dollar buidling to repace an old one they used to have. If the company was not doing so well then why build a another building?I just thought I would give a warning to anyone considering applying here. Even If I do not know who you are, I do care enough to say find a company that will treat you well and respect your hard work.Endo Pharma is a good company. The compensation and benefit packages are good.","1,001 to 5,000",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-11-06T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/56704ac1-fb18-4b61-8681-d47f58f734f9?mescoid=1900254001001&jobPosition=29,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
