48,2215.0,Data Scientist,NCSA Athletic Recruiting,3.6,14.0,"But for many it can be a great place to start. I wouldnt go there from another job though. The pay is low but the job is pleasant and the culture is goodMisleading job. I learned that it is a call center to recruit kids into using tools with little to no direction. Monitored through a microscope with Talk time counter, number of calls, and meetings set. Hardest part of the job was getting 3k cut from my salary in the first month in exchange for the *opportunity* to work 5 extra hours a week for a 45 hour work week.It wasn't mandatory, according to management, but if you didn't work a weekend you would have to meet with your supervisor Monday on why you didn't come in. I learned to really explore and ask current employees feedback on the job. It was a very sugar coated interview that I was blinded in coming out of college. They recruit you with the fun enjoyable laid back lifestyle of talking sports all day but its far from it.Awesome company that has a fantastic culture. Great Co-workers who truly care about helping Student Athletes not only get to College but help them understand the recruitment process.NCSA is a great place to work! At times your day can be repetitive, but its an overall great job to talk sports all day and being around a great culture of coworkers that have the same competitive nature as you. The Managers are always there to help and get you better as well as NCSA's VP'sFun place to work great experience in sales and lead generating. Pursued other opportunities that were more long term.HIgh energy, fast pace and good people. You will enjoy working here if you like working with sports minded people. one of the coolest work environments.8 hour day, sometimes weekends, they stress goals. great people. fun environment to work in, potential to make good money, this was a great stepping stone.Company was just bought out by a larger corporation and has totally changed the direction of the company and the way it's run.A typical day at work was making roughly 60 phone calls to parents of high school student-athletes.  I would find out if they're son or daughter it interested in playing their sport at the collegiate level and if so, needed to find out if they were qualified. I needed to sell them on using our network of college coaches to help their student-athlete to make that jump to the next level.  I improved immensely with speaking on the phone and learned what it takes to make sales calls.  Management was very nice and pushed us to get the job done.  My co-workers were great people to talk to and hang out with.  The hardest part of the job when talking with parents who were very skeptical about the network.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting that parent to agree to use the network and moving them forward.Very competitive culture and opportunity to make a lot of money as a top performerI gained a lot of customer service experience working at NCSA. I was on the phone with clients answering questions all day and that was very good to get experience in. It was a very laid-back atmosphere and the co-workers were great. The most enjoyable part of the job was that you got to talk sports all day.Too focused on sales and not other needed functions to build a career aroundManagement is not focused on growth of employeesVery comfortable environment to work in. Most people are around mid twenties. Very laid back people who all played sports in college. Start the day off by reviewing meeting that were set up the night before, responding to e-mails and voicemails, confirm meetings for the upcoming night. After doing morning duties, start reaching out to families and evaluating student athletes. My co-workers are very easy to get a long with and come from the same background as myself. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping out families and giving student athletes the opportunity to play sports at the collegiate level.",,Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-10-21T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/d5a9cd80-6831-4a0f-add4-577ecb1deadc?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
