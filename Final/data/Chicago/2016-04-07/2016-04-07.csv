191,2358.0,Product Development Scientist - Poultry,Kraft Foods Group,4.1,27.0,"A typical day at work would be reviewing customer orders, checking inventory or when product would be produced, verified transportation had been planned, confirmed to customer.  Had many friends over the past 40 years working there.  The most enjoyable part of the job was having my own office, could have the radio on, and still do my job without any pressure from management.  The hardest part of the job was leaving because I took an early retirement package and now looking for another job.I worked for Kraft Foods Group for almost 25 years, I started in dispatch and worked hard to become the manager of this very fine group of people.Being Kraft is a Corporate environment there are a lot of management decisions that a person may not agree with, but they provided a nice environment for us to work in and were very generous with their compensation and benefits.  The Work Life balance was also something you don't find all that often but it worked out to be a huge benefit.Consistently challenged with new category management opportunities.  Excellent leadership support, organizational culture, and advancement opportunities.I now fully appreciate the culture of innovation at Kraft. The ever present current of ""expecting the best"" in everyone's work provided a strong foundation for teamwork and creating success. Management always brought waves of information on new ideas/resources to help us develop innovative plans to meet business goals. It was a great place to nurture a career.Kraft foods was a challenging work environment.  I gained a lot of experience with customers and SAP erp systems.  Our management team was hands off and allowed the employees to manage their customers and issues.  We worked in teams and there was a lot of cooperation with coworkers.  The hardes part of the job was the long hours that were required to meet the demands with the lower head count demanded by the company.  I will miss the people I worked with.  We were able to get along outside of work as well as in work.The current culture at Kraft is that they want to bring in new talent and get rid of people who have been there awhile.  So it's good if you are new to Kraft but be wary that you don't stay too long.  Management is so-so.  It depends largely on your immediate boss - some are good and some are really bad.Overall, Kraft Foods group has been a great company to work for and has offered many opportunities for advancement.  With the current Heinz merger, I wish them luck obtaining growth and sustaining brandstypical corporate environment.  Employees are very nice and professional.  Overall work is interesting and is a good learning experience.  But with the 3G takeover and merger with Heinz, the environment is poor and the company does not treat you well.A great place to work with lots of opportunities for growth and upwards mobility, as well as opportunities for cross-functional moves.Worked in Office environment with 250 plus employees.  Great atmosphere.  Job concentrated on Mailroom/Warehouse, and office needs of site employees.Kraft is a great place to learn classic, consumer marketing.  I was groomed by a some of the best managers to be a blue chip marketer and learned key general management skillsGood leadership and good products.  Kraft spends a lot on quality and assurance for quality products.  The leaders tend to allow people to develop and grow and don't necessarily do a lot of micro managing.Kraft Foods work atmosphere was great and our team was a tight nit family. We shared best practices and assisted team members during critical annual planning periods.Excellent company.  Diverse experiences within Supply Chain. Change management, SAP, Lean, Collaborative, Customer Engagement and Focus, Financially driven.The company is open and inclusive to ideas from its employees and encourages collaboration acorss different teams.People are very friendly.A typical day involved packaging cheese, or operating a fill room. I learned a lot while working at Kraft. I learned how to operate a fill-room and I was one of the only temps to have learned one. Operation required a lot of attentiveness, attention to detail, and responsibility. Management was very strict but never seemed to have any idea what was going on for the next week. The schedule was never up on time, they where always adding people to work days and then taking them off. They never let anyone know when they had added them for a specific day. They would schedule people to stay after but would always have enough people to cover the shift so you'd end up standing around trying to keep busy with nothing to do. My co-workers made my experience at Kraft worthwhile. I loved the people I worked with and created a lot of great friendships through work. The hardest part of my job was training to learn the fill-room because all of the responsibility, dedication and hard work required to do the job. The most enjoyable experience I had was operating the fill-room. This was because I had put so much time and effort into learning the job, that the satisfaction I got from finally operating made me feel achieved and like I'd accomplished something worthwhile.-Moving towards IL6S culture and investing a lot in the employees including the floor representation.Free hand.  Self motivated post.  Many instances to shine and work on my own and with my team.  Managed the office, efficiently.  Training on a continuum.  Duties were easily grasped and conducted.   Positive feedback from team and manager.  Bolstering and orienting from Chicago headquarters.  A climate of support and continued learning.  Exponential growth potential.Great general management training, iconic brands, a lot of responsibility early onIts a great place to work.  Culture is important. People are nice.process several purchase order  taking calls from vendor who has not received payment. the co workers are great to work with.",,Chicago,Glenview,IL,2016-04-07T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/065887f3-84e1-4a06-b6ad-555caa28218d?mescoid=1300092001001&jobPosition=22,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
