43,2210.0,Data Scientist-(0082529),Conversant,3.8,8.0,"Conversant is full of smart people and smart products. While the digital media space has become cluttered, fragmented suppliers will consolidate, joining Conversant as one of a handful of true premium addressable digital media companies.I learned a lot while working here and am ready to take my skills into the sales industry. I have supported various Account Executives here with all pre-sales support and planning.From it's origins the company was a ""meritocracy"" - it rewards employees that excel at their work.  People that are just looking for a place to sit and get a salary, however, also end up here - though most of them end up leaving (both of their own accord and asked to leave).  Management listens for the most part and compensation is competitive, but perhaps not as much for early careerists.Great company culture. Great/smart associates. Benefits are very competitive with a 5% match on 401k. Room for growth in many of the positions within the business.Fun work Place with supportive management. Excellent co workers, great working hours and vacation time. Plenty of room to learn and move to other departments.Conversant (then known as ValueClick) bought Dotomi a few years ago. Not long after the Dotomi CEO became the ValueClick CEO after the then-current CEO retired. Dotomi and the new CEO were based in Chicago so the new guy decides that everything is better in Chicago so slowly makes Chicago the center of the merged company's universe. More people in Chicago. More promotions in Chicago. Decision making moved to Chicago. Technical leadership now coming out of Chicago. Why? Because Chicago. Maybe working in Chicago it's great but for the rest of us, it blows. We're being ignored and marginalized so all we see is a complete lack of, or incompetent leadership.I love my job at Conversant -- it's very different from my previous research jobs in many good ways.A typical day of work involves lots of free tea and coffee; meetings with friendly, engaging coworkers; planning sessions and discussions with my manager; a few hours of programming; and a lot of creativity and innovation.I've learned a lot about the media/marketing/advertising industry and increased my technical skills in SQL database programming, R programming, predictive modeling, and analysis techniques.The management here is the best I've encountered.  My manager tends to be more of a coach or academic advisor than a boss, and I never feel micromanaged.Similarly, my co-workers seem engaged, energetic, interesting, and fun -- it is a pleasure to come in to work each day to work with these friends.The hardest part of the job are the demands to be better and faster than the competition, which is no easy task in the past paced advertising tech industry.  Sometimes I may have to work overtime to keep up with projects, but because I enjoy my job I don't mind this too much.The most enjoyable part of my job is having the ability to invent and innovate.  I am happy to work on projects because I know my work will be used, not thrown away (in my previous job I worked on several projects that stalled, failed, or were canceled, and this was quite frustrating).",,Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-11-09T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/1c8f7a3e-49c6-4279-848b-e84ad9f49c41?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

As a control room operator I was able to see the company from various sides and was happy with the time I spent working there.Enjoyed working at STEC, had an awesome working environment, great co-workers, and an easy going learning environment. Loved being pretty autonomous and having a laid back work schedule. Never once was asked to do anything I had never done or wasn't willing to do myself. Had a great mentorship program and enjoyed being paired up with the two most senior Techs on site. Pay and benefits were great. The promotion system was very easy and straightforward, potential for growth within the company was exceptional. Overall an awesome experience and one I will hold all my future employers in comparision to.The plant I worked at could have been a great place to work.  The culture is not conducive to a functional work place.  There are a handful of employees that carry the majority of the load on a consistent basis.  Those who do not perform also complain to management consistently and to eachother.  Mangement has done very little to rectify this situation and as a result many of the talented employees have moved on.There is no training and many times others are too busy to help you learn. The work load varies, sometimes you have far too much to do others you are desperate for work. Management doesn't care about their employees, you are defiantly disposable. You'll also be asked to do some work during your holidays and vacations, I've seen some work full days while on vacation. The work can be interesting and many of the people are nice.Great new modern office with great location. Very smart and talented people. Decent benefits. Management cares about their employees.A typical day of work includes opening mail, sending back packages, running errands around Chicago, researching activities for the family.My direct manager is ""too busy"" to train me and as a result I feel neglected and not a part of the team.The hardest part of my job is constantly looking for specific projects to work on from my direct manager. I like to keep busy and use my time effectively, but it is hard when I have to ask for things to do every day.The most enjoyable part of my job is the work/life balance and the consistent pay checks.Great place to work in Operations of a Wind Farm.
