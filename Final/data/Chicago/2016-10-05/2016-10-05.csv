114,2281.0,Social Science Specialist (Elementary),Chicago Public Schools,3.9,684.0,"All my co-workers were really nice and help, I was able to set in a fixed schedule so i could come early and leave at a reasonable time and still attend college.Advantages & Disadvantages of working in Chicago public schools:Advantages: Salary and benefits are competitive; diverse student populations make teaching challenging but rewarding;  A lot of training, project, volunteer opportunities to keep your profession grow. Disadvantages: Teaching & learning environment is very challenging (e.g. class size); No job security (You don't know when you will be laid off, in Nov., February, April, or even in August)Overall I'm still have a job just don't know for how long research,research, and more research. Educator is ine if the greatest career a person can have in my opinion but you have to have a passion for it.Each one teach one.CPS seems to favor their own.  While many of us were at our desks working, there were those who would walk in at whatever time they wanted and once they turned on their computer walked off to get breakfast.  I saw this a lot with the CEOs office.  They felt that if you got up to walk to the bathroom you didn't have enough to do.  CPS has a lot of great office workers, but they get a bad rap for being employee of CPS.  CPS GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER!!!Working with CPS is one of my great work experience I value till this day. I have been working on and off with CPS since I was a Junior in High School. I love the fast paced environment and the multi cultured people I have worked and dealt with.Transporting kids and off bus safely . Assures child is never left unsupervised on a bus.Ensures the safely and well-being of children being transported to and from school. Assure that the bus driver is not distracted from the safe operation of the vehicle.Chicago Public Schools has great benefits. CPS provides helpful materials to the students in order for them to learn to their full potential. I admire CPS No Tolerance Policy. I felt really safe working for CPS.Good feeling of giving backGreat salariesGood benefitsNetworking opportunitiesGood work/life balanceJob security in most positionsEach morning I begin to focus on the lesson plan that I prepared for  my students. I learned how to become more patience, perseverance and emphatic toward my students to enhance their academic skills. Some of my colleagues have been very supportive toward me to help promote students to the next level. My job can become very challenging because of certain students' behavior problems within the the class environment. Most of the students' parents are a great support system that usually bring the behavior problems to a halt. I love to teach and counseled students. Additionally, I enjoyed administration work while I was a Counselor. I was tremendous asset within my career environment.Working here at John Hancock College Prep is a blessing. We are currently in transition going from a neighborhood school to a selective enrollment school. The most enjoyable part of this job is seeing students succeed. Managment has be great, if one has any questions or concerns, they are always willing to listene. Co-workers are fantastic, alway willing to help one another. Throughout my career here at John Hancock College prep, I have learned that students feel diffrent everyday, this is the hardest part of the job as I have to adjust to the students.In my opinion, the teaching experience was great. Everyday there was a different expectation. The students, although challenging at times, brought the best out of me. I learned that both adults and students learn and grow during the school year. I also learned that everyone does not grow in the same directions. Management was not great. I feel that my co-workers were good at what they did and they put forth a grand effort. The hardest part of the job, however, is dealing with the management and administration. CPS enforces rules and gives deadlines and tests that are not conducive to the growth of the young people. It is almost impossible to get kids ready for the wave of standardized tests and teach them what they need to learn to pass to the next grade. CPS does a poor job of catering to the kids' needs. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be when you see the success of many students and understand that your input helped them be successful.good benefits and easy hours love the holiday breaks and pay working with the kids makes you happy and smiling,love iti will recommend this job to every oneWorking as a Special Education Classroom assisatant is very stressful. Working with a diverse group of learners is the best part of the job. I would say the hardest aspect is working along side teachers and other coworkers who honestly don't care about their position. Ive heard so many statements that teachers have made regarding students that was totally inapportate. I would also like to add that most schools aren't to fixable with conquering issues regarding workers safety and violently aggressive children.Working for Chicago Public Schools was the best part of my career. I had the pleasure of working with some of the most powerful administrators. My coworkers were always very supportive and we always looked out for one another. The children that I worked with were always very humble, while their may be some uncooperative students I still enjoyed every minute. The hardest part was just the uncertainty of holding on to your job.The Postsecondary Liaison responsible for implementing targeted strategies that prepare all Chicago Public School students for post-secondary opportunities. Must possess the ability to build capacity of your school Postsecondary Leadership Team. Additionally, provide professional development, tools and resources to assist school faculty and staff in creating a college and career going culture and driving strong postsecondary outcomes.It's by no means an easy process. The work that educators do is not something that any individual could fathom. Layer and layers of paperwork, protocol that many times doesn't make sense and initiatives that don't last for more than 3 years is frustrating especially when research states it takes 5 years to see change. You get to a point where just being grateful that you have a job isn't enough because the your health and emotional well being suffer and it is definitely a thankless job.I come in and check the Building Automotive System to see how the school is heating/cooling. I walk the building to make sure it is comfortable through out. The school is close to 300,000 square feet. On a daily bases we test the pool for PH. When needed we vacuum, add chemicals to the feeders. Any repairs that need to be done we do. Like plumbing (rodding out a clogged line, changing a p-trap), electrical (changing lights, changing ballast, outlets) & painting.The faculty is very nice. They are friendly and they appreciate the work we do for them. My co-workers are good people. They try very hard and they do their job to the best of their ability.The hardest part is working on the roof in freezing weather.I enjoyed helping the disabled children. I learned how to effectively assist special needs kids. How to handle wheel chairs and walkers. Management was not organized.  No room for advancement.A typical day may go smoothly until a person in leadership pulls you to the side to discuss things that do not benefit the children or the betterment of the school system. I learned that although I worked in  a school that everyone was not concerned about children actually learning. Sometimes it's just politics. I was not under very good management. My co-workers were influential and supportive. The hardest part of the job was knowing that some people in charge really don't care about children. The most enjoyable part about the job was the appreciation I received from parents.I love working with children. •	Confer with parents and staff to discuss educational activities, policies, and student behavioral or learning problems. Enforce discipline and attendance rules.  •	Observe teaching methods and examine learning materials to evaluate and standardize curricula.  •	Collaborate with teachers to develop and maintain curriculum standards. •	Daily classroom aide, assist teachers, provides one on one or small group support to students. •	Provides additional support where help is needed throughout Vanderpoel. •	Cheer and Pompon coach.This is a good place to get a good start on your resume, or to beef it up.  This is not a career type of place.  You have to get what you can out of it and move on - revolving door.  The benefits are ok. This was a very fast paced environment, no nonsense atmosphere.  Not much development or growth.  Lots of hard work for last minute rushed projects. This is a who you know atmosphere for higher level positions. I learned how to stay on my toes, be a professional, to be proactive, to anticipate next steps and solve problems. I learned the importance of trust and confidence as well as being very detailed and keeping impeccable records. CPS is a huge company, easy to get lost in the shuffle. Company seems to cater more to people with children.","10,000+",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-10-05T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/f899f0b8-140c-4f88-930a-92c96f9dcf18?mescoid=1900287001001&jobPosition=15,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
