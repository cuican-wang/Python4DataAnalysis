56,2223.0,Senior Data Scientist,NORC,3.4,53.0,"This was a great place, very easy. If you knew all of your project knowledge and answers to frequently asked questions then that equals to a typical day at work.NORC overall was a nice experience because I had never been a locator before. I did not like the environment, for some reason everyone shared colds there.hard working environment with room to advance within the company. they had very flexible hours and plenty of overtime for employees. staff was committed to helping new hires learn everything there is to know about becoming a telephone interviewerinbound outbound call center part time hours convinenient location in downtown area very flexible work schedule fast pace enviorment,thiers opportunity for growth and developmentHired through an temp agency, we were paid more than some of the workers that came straight through the company. Easy work.basic customer service job call center environment equal opportunity job consisted of sitting for several hours you got to choose your own schedule very flexible scheduling systemA great company to work for and you work independently with your cases, but you have a lot support with Field Manager and Tech Support.  The job assignment is ending for now.Management is bias and constant treats for high production.There's no room to grow or even a transfer to challenge other openings.No sick or vacation benefitsField and Regional Managers projects an attitude of superiority that turns off other employees.Employee morale low - ending on a high turn overI came in and sat at my desk. placed several phone calls to various different people to whom would share information about their child's immunization records to help with the CDC's statistics and studyA typical day working involves me signing into my computer, putting on my headsets, answer calls and also make them. I learned that the company don't care to much for employees . My co-workers are amazing. The hardest part of the job was trying to save break minutes. The most enjoyable part was that I could pick how many hours I wanted to work in a day.No words can describe my typical work day or my experiences at National Opinion Research Center (not for profit). I would like to remain mutual, knowing that I performed my job well.Great place to work just wish we had more hours basically all you do is convince people to participate in different studiesThis particular job I accepted just for the need of money, although I am grateful for the tools I have accumulated here as a telephone interviewer.At this job my duties was to call respondents on various social science studies. I learned about different studies and the management was excellent here. The hardest part was getting the respondents to participate in the study. The most enjoyable part of this job was talking to different respondents.NORC is a supportive environment that has a new department just for employee innovation!  The company is full of lots of smart folks who work very hard to win the next big contract.I believe that the hardest part of this job was the long waits in between calls. I ve learned that if you set goals, no matter what you do ,you will meet them. the most enjoyable part of this job was that i can go on break at anytime i want.I love working at this productive, fast paced place of business.  The people work at a team there. A typical day is getting out current events and making sure the floors are running smoothly.Just don't work here if you aren't a fan of being auto-dialed for something because this place specializes in it. They conduct CDC surveys pertaining to childhood immunizations but the average person isn't looking forward to being on the phone for 20 or more minutes to do an immunization survey, so look elsewhere for employment. They also still pay minimum wage.this is definitely the company to pursue for employment! what a great company to be employed by. this was a great experience for me, I gained so much insight on the company and the city of Chicago. employers were always available to talk to at anytime about anything.Employees conduct high qaulity interviews about the national immunization survey on behalf of the cdc. Our work hours are extremly flexible with a 85 percent attendance requirement for each month. Although supervisors and peer helpers are always present , majority of the work is done alone .working here was ok but the hours were awful but it is ideal for a student because you pretty much set your own schedule. if you didn't get the hours when they were first posted then you miss out",,Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-08-29T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/afed222a-c64a-4ef9-84d8-1e7b8f0f2862?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=26,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
