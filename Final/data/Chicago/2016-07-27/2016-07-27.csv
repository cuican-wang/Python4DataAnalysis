58,2225.0,Data Scientist,Federal Reserve Bank,4.2,317.0,"Everyday was chaotic with no such thing as nothing to do, or not enough work for the day. Learned what it means to be professional and how to work in a professional environment. Co-workers where very helpful and would always try even if they didnt have the answersThe Federal Reserve Bank was an enjoyable job to have, incoming calls to sign up for direct deposit was simple. The longest call would be about  minutes roughly, the caller would either give bank account information or sign up for a prepaid card for their benefits to deposit on. Management was reliable and always there to help, there was not a hard part of the job necessarily however there were some people upset that they had to have their check deposited instead of receiving by mail. The most enjoyable part of the job was that you would sit by someone new every day and would get a chance to get to know all people around you.My role is unique in the sense of offerings that are provided to employees through our onsite clinic each day to participating and running projects.  As a nurse manager, I run the onsite clinic and update the providers schedules at multiple locations, manage and supervise direct reports, update departmental policies and procedures as well as administer disability leave management cases for Short-Term Disability, FMLA, LTD and if needed, ADA.Hard to obtain perm job as a consultant.  Management does not understand true value of Project and Program Management beyond IT.I enjoyed working at the Federal Reserve Bank. Great benefits for the employees and promotion within is a priority.The Federal is very diversity oriented.While working at the Federal Reserve I was a Law Enforcement Officer. As a Law Enforcement Officer my duty was to Deter, Detect, and Defend bank employees and property. I worked closely with other officers and reported back to management on daily activities. While working on the entrance posts I developed strong customer service skills, continuously serving employees and guests of the bank.I started my career at the Federal Reserve which developed my discipline to the control of the process...Every action or step was detailed and reviewed at each critical point to ensure all information was 100% correct and concise.  They was no room for errors...The staff was couched and developed to be as successful as they wanted to achieve.Extremely professional environment...All the management was top selected from various colleges from around the country.I very much enjoyed working here. Of course, the security was strict, but I had a great time with my co-workers. There were, of course, many crazy days where the calls were non-stop, but it made the days go by quicker. The management were friendly and courteous - promoted from within.good job, happy to work - great benefits nice people, long day but job offers every other Friday off.organization fair to employees with benefits and compensation.Scoping and driving process improvement, organizational change and functional strategy initiatives across the Corporate Group Organization.

The management team was always there to help with any problems we incurred. the day usually went fast because we were busy.good environment,cafiteria,gym. the benefits were also goodI felt working for the FRBNY was a great experience and I believe having this company on my resume helps with career advancement.Due to the nature of the business, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta was highly regulated. There were many regulations to follow. However, the regulations did not interfere with quality work performance. The most enjoyable part of this job was the interaction with Employee Relations activities. It allowed for creativity and  planning on upcoming events.Great first job, great pay and great management.I worked with entry level programmers like myself.I learned a great deal.The training was wonderful and I made wonderful contacts.The most enjoyable part of the job was the day to day interactions and collaborations with fellow employees. The environment was very productive and energizing.Agile methodology with Sprints. Great company but really busy with integration of new technologies and implementing cloud based infrastructure. Great teamThe culture was not for me. In order to get a proposal or project completed, there had to be numerous sign offs and work had to be flawless. The concentration was on perfection instead of completing quality work in a timely fashion. Some of the projects I was assigned were originally started over 10 years ago, progress stopped 10 years ago, and nobody finished them. I picked up the pieces and completed them...from something that started 10 YEARS AGO and they didn't need to be completed. This is really an up and coming organization.Created use cases/requirements documents, supervised group of BA's to insure tasks where completed on time and on budget.  Lead Production support tasks to insure completion and resolution of enhancements and defects.Management was good to work with and provided support for all employees and contractors.Co-workers were a pleasure to work with.  I enjoyed our development staff and enjoyed working along side our business partners in Parkersburg VA.  The hardest part of the job was not working too many hours.  I tend to enjoy learning the application and often times became a workaholic.The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the team.  I really had an incredible team of development and Quality Assurance.Normally you would go on to find out what your workload was like each day.To work hard and own up to your mistakes.Management tried to work along with each employee to solve daily problems.Everyone tried to work to solve all problems.Resolving accounts at the end of the day.The support you received really made the job worth while.The job ended at the Federal reserve, with the merger of the larger banks.Nothing worth identifying for this employer at this time. This employer has nothing worth identifying at this time or in the future.I would bring up the system and being to monitor files sent by other financial institutions. Once we had all of them we would process them and send them out either electronically or physically to each institution by a strict timeline.I learned everything that I could about the banking industry so that I could advance.Management was great in that they always tried to keep us moving in an upwardly fashion.My co-workers became my extended family after 21 years of working with them.The hardest part was making sure that all files sent were accurate and timely.The most enjoyable part was the friends I had made.","1,001 to 5,000",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-07-27T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/6b67a1e0-7736-4d58-92bb-604eff0f9385?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=28,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
