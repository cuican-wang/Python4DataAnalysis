55,2222.0,Data Scientist,VHA Inc,3.9,13.0,"The company has a relaxed atmosphere and culture. The company ensured that as an employee the workplace was enjoyable. The managers were willing to help you when necessary and so did my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was balancing all that needed to be done in the workday. The most enjoyable part of the job was the work environment and when I needed help everyone was willing to help.Wonderful Company! Unfortunately I was layed off.  They cared about their employees and paid for training.   The benefits were good.  The people I worked with were fun and motivated.My typical work day consist of helping Veterans or their families with orders or tracking of medication or helping them make appointments , what I've learned from my job here is you get out  what you put in , the way you treat others is how you would like to be treated kindness goes a long way, my co workers are supportive, the hardest part of my job is when I  get a call that someone has just passed away, the enjoyable part is listening to the older Vets storiesThe Marine Corp Shaped my future and was able to change my life for the better. Because of the Marine Corp I have been afforded opportunities I never thought I Would have.High termination rate (Sales especially), If they ""think"" you were gossiping- you are terminated, ethnocentrism, CULTURE = management mind games, paranoia, very unhealthy environment. Psychological hazing in their Boot Camp. Be aware.A typical is visiting store owners,manager and or sales reps.  With the owners we will discuss the state of their business IE: month over month numbers 2nd month replenishment. How they can grow their business or work together to solve any issues they may have.With the Manager we talk about employees, how to help them increase sales how to train and even set up training events for the store. With the sales team we role paly sales scenarios we talk about how to engage with the customers and work on increasing their individual sales.My management team is great they are supportive and are always available when needed.I've learned is how to listen and answer questions and how to get my stores to see outcomes with out giving them the solutions.The hardest part of the job is leaving the company.  the most enjoyable part if the job is working with the stores and knowing that if I have a question or an issue that I have an outstanding team beside me.place that you look forward to going to work,Culture is well balanced of professional and hardworking fun environment.This company was extremely beneficial to me, and I hope I was for them. Truly an honor, and I recommend it to others looking to truly make an impact on others.Some companies are not interested in you and some are.  VHA is one of those that are, they want you to be the best at what you do and want to be sure you are their for your dealers.  I agree with this except for if one does not understand the process 100% by a certain time he or she is not a right fit.  I do not agree with that part, they may BE a right fit, it just they may need a bit more time to get to that point.  VHA a has a great atmosphere about it and my management team was outstanding. I have learned much since being with VHA.I was on the road visiting retail wireless stores and meeting with dealers. There was not much of a work life balance as I was constantly on the roadA good place to grow in experience. There was a lot benefits and opportunities to move up. They could work on HR though.Excellent company to work with, great to their employees.  I felt that working with them over this past time has been a great learning experience.A typical day at work is swamped from the beginning of the day until the end. Management has preference for certain employees, not treated equally. Majority of coworkers are fun, outgoing, helpful and supportive.The hardest part of the job was the micromanagement; constantly under a microscope and being told what to do even during our lunch and breaks. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the employees, the training provided by the company and camaraderie.",,Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-09-15T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/feb4c420-db51-488f-b1b7-8b04d5dc59c2?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I loved the company I worked for and enjoyed my time there and my co-workers.Position was temp contract for reviewing medical insurance data base.  Potentially good company although management was in process of realignment in department worked.From my very first day at Open Systems I received no training what so ever. Management was nice and wanted to see me succeed but they did very little to provide me with any extra tools to do so. You must get there early and leave late, and every day is busier than the last. If you do something that is good you must keep moving because everyone but you will have forgotten about it by the next day. The co-workers were very pleasant but they are very busy as well which makes them less inclined to help you as needed with no formal training. I learned to work hard, be independent, find answers for myself, and always show determination.This company saw the evolution of business where technology was concerned and provided an innovative option for record-keeping. For companies in the Bahamas that opted to have files electronically converted, Open Systems is able to facilitate the transition. In the business world, companies are always evolving technologically thus making a small company like Open Systems viable and successful.The new people who trained with me and the other teams were very nice and so helpful. My experienced teammates were just the opposite. I miss the bigger paycheck, but not the attitude.Great people, great vision, great environment.  This company is employee-focused and has a passion to make a positive difference in everything they do.Got more hands on experience dealing with Cisco and other network equipment that I didn't before. Increased responsibility handling more end users as a site contact.A typical day involved scanning filing and being part of a team. Occasional book keeping for accountants. Data entry knowledge is a must.Although I only spoke with staff by phone they were very helpful and courteous! Open Systems is a staffing center. There is not a review for the company.Open Systems is a contract placement firm.  I have found them very professional, competent, and fair-minded.  They work hard to keep you working.My reporting manager was someone who loved to share market info and teach you the right techniques.
