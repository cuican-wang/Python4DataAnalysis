An average workday consisted of confirming orders with vendors and following up, either via telephone or email, on the delinquent orders.They were never available and did not offer follow ups on jobs. They delayed my pay over the Labor Day weekend and didn't even offer an apology. I was late paying bills due to their glitch in their system. They treat you as if you can be replaced for nothing. I complained (for good reason) a couple of times, next thing I know, I am without a job. No explanation, no nothing, Then they took $44 out of my last check for administration fees. Still didn't get an answer about that. I don't want to be a temp for the rest of my life. I want a long term position and work my way up and have job securityThey are working hard on building their infrastructure for capability and growth Its a good time to be in the organization if you are a driven individual looking to grow your career.

112,2279.0,Senior Analytics Developer,Transunion,3.8,83.0,"Work and fun is balanced. Higher management sometimes not much considerate. Nice office space and location. There are lot of opportunities to switch teams as per your aspiration.I was an Intern at TransUnion and only worked their for 10 weeks.  My experience was very good and I enjoyed everyone I worked with and company was very good and professional.I'm not a good person to ask as my job is being phased out.  We had a great team that is not appreciated by the current executives.TransUnion was originally formed in 1968 as a holding company for the railroad leasing organization, Union Tank Car Company. The following year, it acquired the Credit Bureau of Cook County, which possessed and maintained 3.6 million card files.[2] In 1981, a Chicago-based holding company The Marmon Group acquired TransUnion for approximately $688 million.[4][5] Almost thirty years later, in 2010,Loved my hours from 5:00 am to 1:30pm. Able to assist different queues.  Learing how to operate different systems. Liked that I was able to work well with my supervisors. Having monthly team meetings about new enhancement to system and being recongnized on a job well done.  Enjoyed working and being with everyone at the company.Regardless of an associates position you can be assured their day is busy.  Whether your analyzing data, preparing customer decks/presentations, following up on opps, prospecting, pipeline management.  TU support teams are busy assisting new clients through the on-boarding process as well as supporting existing customers.  TU believes in celebrating associates success through out the year.  Eligible associates have the opportunity to travel internationally for a year end celebration.TU is an advocate for giving back to the community.  TU is a great company to work.lack of management involvement with their subordinates. Expectations were unclear which resulted in a stressful relationship.People who work at TU, particularly in Chicago, tend to stay at TU forever- 10, 20, even 30 years. Rather than creating a team of people who are great at their roles, this has bred a corporate culture of complacency and mediocrity. There is little urgency in the work that people do and few incentives to be great at it. People work their 40 hour weeks and go home, regardless of pressing issues, crushing backlogs, and client commitments.Great place to work with amazing teammates and challenging work!A company that focuses on being an information company for good!The international marketing team was intelligent and wonderful to work with. Extreme attention to detail and excellent interpersonal skills are a must-have to flourish and enjoy this job and the environment.In TransUnion I learn Custumer Services, Public Relations, Logistics, And Financial activities.My co-workers were so nicer and very intelligent.The hardest thing was to learn how to speak in from of a lot of people because I was very shy. Working for TransUnion was very interesting and productiveA professional but casual environment. Management have always been helpful rather than simply demanding. Friendly relations with co-workers. Variety of technologies to work with.Good location, next to Union Station.  Nice office environment.  Good people.  Management is mixed.  Need to stay on top of technology and contribute.his was a never ending job, you always had something to do because we had millions of customers to service. It was a very good job that gave you many experiences. The job was always offering new things to help make your job easierwell run institution with many opportunities for staff advancements, great deal of perks to utilize as well, caring coworkersCompany is ever trying to play catchup to the competition. Their products are not cutting edge any longer and now lack stability. The lack of focus on quality products and a push for sales versus satisfaction within the management team has been narrow-minded and will most likely come back to haunt them in the near future. The expectations of employees is unrealistic and management tends to not stand employees when they know their products and vision are the issues.  The company is very competitive with pay and the  benefits are outstandingCulture could improve and it starts with senior management. a typical day consist of showing up between 7 and 9 and sitting at a desk for majority of the shift responding to emails and conducting meetings or conference calls. All of this work can keep you very busy because each account manager has hundreds of accounts with different issues rising each dayNo two days are identical while working at Transunion. While your overall responsibilities will remain the same, the initial situation/issue as well as the path you take to find the solution will always be unique. This makes for an interesting work day.If you are looking for room for advancement, this is not the company. Senior management would be better off with robots. It is a do as I say and not as I do environment. There is a high turnover from management down. This is not a fun environment to work in. The truly sad part is the pay is very good but not worth the back biting.TransUnion is a large privately held company, it is a fast paced environment. Multiplatform integrated systems ensure a complex environment. A typical day would include:Planning, or Post Mortem(Lessons Learned) meetings as well as conference calls with rotating quarterbacking.Data retrieval for reporting then Report distribution based on data needs.Ticketing systems for upcoming code updates as well as current system problems requiring attention.Interfacing other business units for upcoming work in the pipeline.Analysis of systems and promote best practices for more efficient processing.Enjoyed many of my co-workersHardest part of the job, Repeating oneself. Emails you work hard on that aren't read you have to state again and again.Most enjoyable part, Learning as Steven Covey would put it ""Sharpening the Saw"".Fundamentally, for a company to ultimately succeed, the work environment needs to encourage new ideas and input. Transunion / TLO's  corporate culture discouraged individual thought and contributions.",,Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-10-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/f1b474fd-7683-42bd-b027-e5862bd408cb?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=13,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
