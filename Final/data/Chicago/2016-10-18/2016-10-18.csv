50,2217.0,Lead Data Scientist,GE Transportation,4.0,115.0,"The main project of this contract position was to upgrade the main fuel pump and after-burner system of the J85 Turbo Engine.Typical day was re-design and testing different prototypes. Some calculations verified strength and stress of the new parts still could meet the specifications or meet higher specifications.I learned from applying, installing the actual systems, making changes and advancing the system. All these actions were informative to me. Management was friendly and professional.The same with co-workers.The job culture was professional.The typical work day for an employee is 10-11 hours. If you put in your 8 hours and then leave, you're a ""lazy"" employee. It's a high-stress environment every day. Managers are very good at committing to unreasonable goals and tasks - especially because all they have to do is commit and not actually follow through with them. There is no work-life balance - no matter what they try to tell you when they hire you on. They do invest a lot of time and money to train employees and teach them all they need to know. To me, this doesn't compensate for all of the other negatives of this company.Many opportunities in a wide range of fields.  Good work life balance.  Job security is average to low.  Most of the people are good to work with. Mangement focus can be a little bit short term. Compensation is good. Vacation policy is good.This reviewer worked as a temp and due to a labor depute was not retained. I was however offered a position later that due to health issues at the time i was not able to take. Management seemed very open to work with me when I had a family emergency arise even though I was just a temp. I loved the work and the guys i worked with were more than willing to help with training of new skills or fine tuning of existing skills, even offering to skip breaks just to help out. If a position becomes available again i would be more than happy to go back.Review our daily work schedule and began the work that has to be done. I work 10 hours shifts and over time if need. I follow all the safety sheets for what ever project we are working on at the time. The most enjoyable time of the day is when we get new contracts for Train parts.I enjoyed my job for most of my career. Maintenance on the machines could be a lot better. Management personnel being hired regardless of experience in a manufacturing environment.the staff was great to work with, the employees were very helpful in teachingI learned a lot about locomotivesmanager was wonderful, very knowledgeablemost enjoyable was the people I worked withi gave my job everything i had, and I was still laid off. Not much else to say. this company only cares about its CEOs and forgets about the employees that made it what it is todayFlexible Work hoursGood Work cultureFriendly environmentNew Challenges everydayEngaging environmentToo many meetings thoughvery poor management, harassment that the H.R. dept could not do anything about for 10 years after numerous complaints.challenging function to be a part of but you will learn a lot. managers set a fast pace and expect stretch goals to be met on timeGe has a reputation for the past 100 years building the best locomotives in the world.  The company offers good pay and benefitsGE Transportation holds value in diversity, teamwork, efficiency, timeliness, and productivity. As this is my first career opportunity, I have proven to fit well within GE's standards.was a growing business so l didn't really expect the best. things weren't moving in most of the time. was just there to built skills and resumeNice people to work with, safe work areas, job was not too hard, was a good job to have overall, proper equipment was supplied to get job doneGood work life balance. Great family based company that takes care of their employees.Was a pleasure working at this company.This is a large company but individuals have high visibility and ownership. Work life balance is pretty good but can depend on the manager. It's important to be able to be able to sell your opinion because every organization is very metric driven and they do not always line up with each other. There is a lot of potential for moving around the company and work in various teams. If yo do well at your job you will be rewarded and move up through the ranks.Productive and fun place to work. Not much of learning opportunities.Work life balance is good. Management is supportive.I only had a shadowing experience here, so I am unsure of the payroll or the benefits that the job requires. But the employees here were extremely friendly and helpful. I liked seeing different people, and interacting with new faces.Your standard large company, where employees are just numbers and are thrown out like the trash at a moments notice. Only to be called back later to repeat the process again.nothing to say much about my current company because i am looking for a change to design and implement something new to make some wonders.","10,000+",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-10-18T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/a53fd00c-45b6-44e5-b24e-f4d6c2551831?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=20,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
