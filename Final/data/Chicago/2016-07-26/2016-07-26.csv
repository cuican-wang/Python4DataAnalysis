189,2356.0,Biostatistician,College of American Pathologists,3.5,17.0,"I have been working at College of American Pathologists for about four years, and I really don't have any commends about this Place..........!Good place to work, I have been promoted 3 times over the last 9 years.  Each job I have been able to use my current skills and they have sent me to some training to get more skills.Working for the CAP was an amazing and educational experience.  In the year of my contract working with the college, I learned so many different aspects of marketing, including event coordination.  Definitely a wonderful place to work.Horrible directors and management for IS. Too many managers. All talks - but no work is done. Too many leaders in IT... Ignorant about any technical knowledge so they preferred to get job done by consulting companies.Leadership don't trust employees so no place for growth or learning... Too many road blocks to get something done.Do not waste your career!Fulfilling roles in medical association supporting pathologists and clinical laboratories. Dedicated effective staff.  Good benefits and some opportunities for advancement.One would definitely dream to be a part of this company and I am glad I was one. Fun place, flexible for employees, environment to learn a lotCAP is dedicated to improving the professional growth and development of pathologist. Offers excellent education and benefits to its staff. CAP standards promote quality work and a cohesive work environment.CAP is NOT a very nice place to work. Managers lie. Offer zero support on issues. If your new. The old employees will do everything they can to make your life a miserable. So take this advice. If you like back stabbing this is the company for youConsiderable work independence and focus on customer satisfaction.  CAP is undergoing significant change related to culture, information technology and response to the marketplace.A premier medical association with a dedicated staff focused on supporting its physician membership, patient safety, and the worldwide laboratory community.  To accomplish this mission the organization makes the necessary investments in technology and personnel.The CAP offers a number of different schedule options. Most of the co-workers are friendly. However, there is very little room for growth and advancement as a young adult.I have been employed with the College of American Pathologists for 12 years now. Overall it is fast past, productive, and comfortable place to work. The company is family oriented and offers flexibility to aid in work-life balance. Most of the employees are friendly however there are number who come off as bullies. The culture has changed and the company has become top heavy with management. In some areas of the company there is no room for growth.This company took care of it's employees by paying them very well and offering great benefits.Awesome place to work. Just like a home away from home. Management worked closely with you to make sure you were comfortable with new programs. Easy going and productive work environment. Collaborative team efforts.I have never worked in a more depressing, dysfunctional office, with so little communication, training, support, and teamwork in my 35 years in the workforce. Management doesn’t give you any info to do your job, or tell you where to get it, then blames you for not knowing. They’ll throw you under the bus so they look good. No matter which way you go, they micromanage you, then tell you it's wrong, you can't win. I've never worked anywhere past 12noon on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, except this place. We don't have some Federal holidays off, like Martin Luther King Day - ridiculous, especially in DC! When a support person is doing a great job, they get fired, because the Office Admin. feels threatened.The College is devoted to enhancing the professional development of its members and promoting excellence in patient care. A truly wonderful group of co-workers, who exemplify the CAPs values.",,Chicago,Northfield,IL,2016-07-26T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/f42beccb-0bd3-45f2-a91b-e206905b8f52?mescoid=1500153001001&jobPosition=20,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
