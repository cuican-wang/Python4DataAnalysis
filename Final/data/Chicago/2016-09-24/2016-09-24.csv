53,2220.0,Data Scientist,Caterpillar,3.9,2000.0,"Every day was different never knew where i was going or what i would be doing all on the road repairs(gas,electric and diesel) respondsible for keeping van stocked up and customer satifactionI was an agency employee not an actual Caterpillar employee, however, there is good a Job Work/Life Balance structured atmosphere, there is room for advancement with the right skills, Management is good, they treat you with respect. The job culture is very diverse, and is extremely pleasant to work in. I was there four years as an agency worker and was just recently laid off, however I would still recommend this employer to everyone, times are tuff all over.  I may not be called back but Caterpillar is still a nice place to work.  the hardest part of the job is adapting quickly to rapid changes, challenging but not impossible. I enjoyed being able to crosstrain in a completely different field and fill in for others while they were on vacation.I have learned and done many tasks as part of Caterpillar INC. I have designed closed loop models for system integration/software testing. I have designed multiple software and hardware features used on Large Mining Trucks. I created the backbone structure for the first automated Python Script testing environment for Caterpillar Large Mining Trucks. I have enjoyed learning and developing especially working with leadership to increase my abilities as a leader to hopefully move into a management or leadership role. I have managed small teams across multiple tasks. Overall I have enjoyed my co-workers, model work, Python scripting, and the great work/life balance that this job has provided.Lots of favoritism, things being pushed under the table, logistics management is the worst that I have seen thus far, no advancement, the plant is divided with separate benefits, bonuses and insurance, they write you up with no solid evidence of anything that was done wrong, they nit pick and harass you because they would rather you walk out then go through a firing process, not to mention the management to employee relations, the list can go on and on... I gave 3 stars because if I were with another department I may some what like it there.When the economy is doing well especially in the resource and mining industries it is a great company to be a part of. But these industries are cyclical which can make job security shaky.Coming from a support role, the most enjoyable part of my job is solving problems.Management tries to enable you for success.My key takeaway has been that you are in charge of how far you move through your career.  You have to be vocal about what you want to do and seek those experiences.Joliet location was very hostile in the beginning, but the environment improved greatly under new upper management. Company overall provides excellent compensation, educational opportunities, support for obtaining professional certifications, opportunities for career advancement, and a general culture of teamwork.I had a great career for 20 years, but Caterpillar is not the same company I hired into.  Like any large corporation, it has had its ups and downs.  Cat provided excellent opportunities for me and my family -- allowed us to move around and provided excellent pay and benefits.  However, the last 10 years have been a real challenge with low job security and significant political turmoil.I was third generation for this company.  It is not like it used to be.  There is no incentive to continue to work for this corporation other than that in the area is pays more.  The culture is terrible. They do not care for their employees and constantly ask to do more with less and no compensation for it.  Middle management ethics is majority of their divisions are questionable.I have found that if you put in the OT, learn the culture of Cat, you can learn a vast amount of knowledge that will grow with you and your career.Pros: Caterpillar is a great company to develop and grow in your careers,offers challenges and inspires to be the best engineers in your domain . The team is diverse and supports inclusive operation. The management preaches/ supports developing quality products and supports next generation initiatives to lead the industry with disruptive innovation in its products and offers good employee benefits and compensation.Cons: Nature of business is cyclic and some aggressive restructuring efforts are implemented as the business demandsNot really an ok place to work. i would not recommend this place to work. Not a transparent facility. Favoritism is heavily practiced by management. If you were on night shift like i was...then it was almost as if you were forgotten. every aspect of your repairs made on your shift, even though correct and solid, was second guessed by day shift and redone. Management in Maintenance was atrocious, led by an inexperienced manager that second guessed his supervisors and heavily practiced favoritism between a few employees giving them preference of hours with working overtime instead of being fair and spreading it across the department. Advancement was a joke and not there. No training plan or evidence of company providing any type of training.Company operates three shifts Monday thru Thursday. Company uses Six Sigma Methodologies. Some of the Pros are gain sharing, affordable insurance and vacation & sick time. Co-workers are like family. Management has an open door policy. The hardest job would be shell prep/paint line because it's messy and hot work. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing your working for a company that you can be proud to say you work for. To sum it up this is the best job I ever had with great benefits, teaming atmosphere, and opportunity to grow.Caterpillar is a great, industry-leading company to work for to gain experience. Their Leadership and Technical Development (LTDP) program is an outstanding three-year rotational program designed to provide broad experience within a specific functional area. Offered great leadership opportunities and project experience. However, there are many layers of management, a lot of rules and regulations that hinder continuous improvement and creative thinking. An old culture and way of doing things limits creativity in the organization. Very political organization forces one to get to know the right people in the organization in order to advance in certain areas. Company currently downsizing making it difficult to stay positive and secure.when you think of caterpillar you think of a strong company however the distribution center i belong to lacks great leadership management does not follow up with supervisors and its commonly known on the warehouse floor that once you become a supervisor you can slack off because it is whats visible. Lack of advancement in the company unless your willing to relocate to the midwest. overall if you have the work ethic to come in and do your job you should be fine but in every warehouse you will have childish issues you will run into.Caterpillar is a good place to work but the pay and chances for advancement are limited. There are resources available to those that the Management chooses to offer it to. Though not so much as those who request it to better improve their abilities.The workforce is diverse. Which is both a blessing and a curse as not all have the drive to excel.and at times the lack of urgency can be disheartening.The hardest and most enjoyable part of the job is meeting the deadlines in an efficient and safe manner.I have been with the company for almost 18 years so it is a good place to work obviously.  Great people, great opportunities for training and advancement.  I have learned many different aspects of the business from Purchasing, Logistics, Quality, and Engineering.  I have been worked many different 6 sigma projects.  The management team I have had in my career has very much been involved in my career and helped me along the way to make the right decisions.As with many of the larger corporations this one can occasionally be overburdened with unnecessary / duplicate information. Too much emphasis on the individual responsibilities of the other team members and not enough individual accountability. The people are exceptional at the local level and in general upper management is responsive to their needs.I enjoyed my time with Caterpillar.  I worked day shift.  I learned to be come a better listener and how to be more organized.  I have taken lean manufacturing classes.  The management is great.  They are willing to listen and help a person reach their full potential. I like my co-workers.  I get along with them and a lot of them have become like family to me.  The hardest part of the job is sometimes is the stress but I don't let it get to me.  When I get to stressed out I go home and read or cook.  That helps me relax.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people. I have mad a lot of great friends at work and will miss them dearly.Great benefits. But after being there 3 years with no opportunity to move up. I would of been at a stand still so leaving was a good option for me So now I can move forward and build a career. I worked well with everyone. The job was very fast at times . Had to always be on my toes. About detail and make sure before I had sent a part for a engine it was not damaged ,and make sure it was right. I worked 12hr shifts standing all day.CAT is a good starting job or those who have no work experience. But not long term, the turn over rate is high and right now cat is ""restructuring"" which means weeding out a lot of people in order to save money. So, if you don't mind working in a fast paced environment with little to no commutation from management and a uncertain future with only one positive factor being pay and benefits and dealing with a lot of egos, then CAT is for you.Education and training provided is best around in availability.Parts are heavy, so this needs consideration depending on your job.Assembly co-workers say the pay is low in comparison to the task.Management co-workers say the pay is pretty good.I most enjoyed solving the problems involved in the manufacturing processes. I was able to succeed in reducing defects where everyone else struggled, so there must still be room for improvement here. The discerning problem solver would find much job security here as engineering changes happen so often.","10,000+",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-09-24T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/8c37584e-94e5-4862-95c2-5f86be628194?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=23,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
