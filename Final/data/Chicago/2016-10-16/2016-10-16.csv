51,2218.0,Data Scientist,KPMG,4.0,1800.0,"This is a great place to work. Has a great work/life balance. Social club plans many activities for all interests. They include all employees at different functions. You truly feel you are part of a team.KPMG was my first job out of college. It was a great job to start my professional career and I enjoyed being a part of an audit team and learning about the ins and outs of different businesses. The hours were very long during busy season which included 10 hour weekdays and weekend hours from the months of December to April, but I learned a great deal in just the first year. I also started with a large group of college graduates which made for fun office events and parties.  The environment was a little too cut-throat for me and I did not see myself working there long-term.I would recommend anyone I know to work for KPMG. It's a wonderful work environment, especially for people just out of college.While there are plenty of opportunities to advance within the company, it should be noted that it can be difficult to actually advance due to the size of the company. I.E. an individual would have to stick out for them to be really noticed.Good to place to refine skills, diverse set of clients, dedicated colleagues. Little direction sometimes from leadership if not on project.Excellent work place to begin your accountant career. Management very professional and co-workers as well. The most enjoyable working is the exposure and knowledge you can encounter and the diversity of industries you work with.If you have an appetite to learn, this is the onea place that can feed it! The info, direction and level of learning is controlled by you, and you can either curb yourself to one area, or broaden your horizons on any area of interest to you...KPMG was a wonderful place to start my career because the firm offered a lot of training for Audit and Forensic. Also, KPMG had wonderful senior associates, managers, etc. who wanted me to succeed and helped me to succeed along the way.The culture in KPMG is like that of a family. Everyone works hard and tries to help build each other up. Their intern training program is very comprehensive. In addition to performing associate-level work, I was also assigned special tax research and presentation skills to supplement my professional education. My only problem is the lack of work life balance. Outside of work, I found that I didn't have the energy to do anything other than lounge around the house.Overall job culture is demeaning, demoralizing, and discriminates against individuals over 30 years of age unless entering the firm as a manager or higher.I really enjoyed externing at KPMG.  The accounting team I worked with were wonderful and gave great insight for my future career in accountancyGood accommodating culture. All depends on your relationship with Managing Directors and partners. Gentler of the big four.KPMG is one of the big four international accounting firms and staffs around 175,000 people.  I had a great working experience at KPMG.  I have nothing but all great things to say.  Everybody was nice, helpful, friendly, professional, and understanding.  I won't mind working for KPMG again.it was really big company. work there was pretty boring, and people were leaving all the time. the work life balance here was not so good. we worked over time all the time without the right pay.New management brought in.  Entire office went down hill.  Moral was very low.  No team spirit, no fun, no respect.  Felt like I was in the military under a drill sergeants command.Working for KPMG was a great experience. Long hours are a given and the work is interesting. KPMG has a great summer internship program.KPMG is like most audit firms: client focused with some busy deadline periods. I like the culture and the people that this company attracts are what makes it pleasant to work here.KPMG Nigeria was an amazing company to intern with over the summer, the organizational culture of the company is well structured and makes one feel at home right away. I interned for three months, and I wish I could have interned for a longer amount of time, but I had to get back to school. My co-workers were very friendly and treated me with the same respect that they would treat full-time employees. The way the offices were structured allowed for the smooth interaction between supervisors and subordinates. They had an open door policy which allowed easy accessibility to all individuals throughout the company. They also advocated to avoid saying ""sir/madam"" and just refer to people by their first name. This was a huge problem for me, cause everyone was older. But I eventually got used to it. KPMG Nigeria is a very flexible, yet time filing, occupying company. I'm glad I had the privilege to  intern with them.Great firm, training is excellent. Clients are the best in their industry groups. Teams work well together and the skills learned o the job are the best part about the day.I serve as assistant to multiple members of the firm's senior management.  I have the ability to manage multiple priorities, highly organized and provide exceptional customer service.As a KPMG consultant, there is not ""typical"" day at work. You can be heavily involved with clients one day and just work from home on another day. It varies depending on your work style. From KPMG, I learned how to communicate effectively with clients. KPMG management is very hierarchical - started with associate to senior associate to manager to partner. The hierarchy varies depending on your department. My coworkers were wonderful. They were friendly and respectful, very easy to work with. Co workers above me were very eager to help push me to the next level. Hardest part of the job was getting to the next level. To get there, you must prove yourself to internal team members such as director and partners. To do so, you must work under a very challenging environment which requires a lot of traveling and face time with clients and coworkers. If you have a family, you will have very little time seeing them... Most enjoyable part of the job (if you are young and do not have a family) is the travel. You get to see may different places and many different people around the world. I also enjoyed the opportunities and education my company offered me.It is a high performance culture company.  Employees and Partners are of high integrity and professionalism. It is a great Audit, Tax and Advisory firm.",,Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-10-16T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/74a85e66-a423-4a53-887c-089cdb74586a?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=21,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
