60,2227.0,Data Scientist,Dupage Medical Group,3.0,80.0,"Management was subpar at most. I was walked on a lot for being a new person. Too many social conflicts between co-workers. Patients were wonderful. I did learn a ton while working here after my first year out of MA school.My co-workers are amazing and if it wasn't for loving them I'd quit (its rare to find people you genuinely enjoy working with and consider friends). The pay is such garbage and if you go into even 0.15 hours of overtime (which equates to maybe like $8) you will basically get fired. The raises are a joke and the benefits aren't that great.Wish I could give 0 stars.Dupage medical group bought out the employer I was working for. When they bought us out the company went down the toilet in just weeks. If you want to feel like you don't matter and stressed all the time this is the place for you! This company only cares about making money! So short staffed be prepared to work yourself to death you will be doing work of 4-5 people and when people quit they are not replaced! Management is the biggest joke the managers don't even know how to schedule a appt and they just dump on the employees even tho they are rn they will never join in to help there job is to laugh play on there phones and eat all day! Biggest joke of a company!Horrible place to work, the management within MPAS is awful all they do is hire their friends from a company that went under and they cannot find jobs so MPAS gets them.  They know nothing about the jobs just how to criticize how we have been doing it and being successful  So, that being said MPAS now is going under, bad reviews super amount of turnover and the sad thing about the whole thing is the upper management just doesn't care as long as the seats are filled and money is still coming in.  How about how our new clients feel, oh that is if they even new all the wrong that goes on within the walls of MPAS.the company is okay to work for for a time. there are almost no opportunities for advancement in either position or pay. the working environment was clean and secure as long as you don't rock the boat.I was on the phone for 8 to 9 hours with an hour lunch. Took over 100 calls a day, scheduling, cancelling appointments for all of DMG doctors.I learned how to schedule appointments on the Epic system. The co workers were nice when we were able to see one another, we were in our own cubicles. I did not eel that I had any opportunity for growth with this company.I loved speaking to patients but missed the face to face interaction.Dupage Medical Group is definitely not what they make it seem. It's really repetitive and the training is kind of stupid. I don't want to sit and watch another person take calls when you could be taking the time to actually show me how to navigate the system. Also one of the supervisors in the customer service department is racist! STAY AWAY. you've been warned!The company CEO needs to pay more attention to its employees and patients rather than the revenue its generating. There is no room for growth and the mid level senior leadership is not good at communication.Was a very fun place to work at but it lacks leadership. Management is not easy to talk to.  Days were always good there but sometimes it felt like we were not allowed to be ourselves.Management is the worst I have ever experienced.  Manager of PACU has a hard time trying to help with patients when needed and has no filter with employee's privacy.  Manager of facility has no tact when dealing with the nurses but is sweet and accommodating to the physicians.  They except the employees to live, breath and die for this ASC.  The pay is low, hours unreasonable, and benefits are poor.  The coworkers are very clique', some you have a difficult time knowing if they are friend or foe (but not all). Stay away!.The patient were all very nice and a pleasure to work with. The employee with the other doctors that the office was shared with were very nice to work around. The nurse in the offiice I worked in was nice at first and then was completly differnet after about a month.Very stressful and emotional. Very overwhelmed with trying to adhere to all the policies. The doctor's schedule was nearly impossible to navigate. Only certain patients on certain days and only certain times are available for certain issues. Patients were expected to wait for a very long time to be seen for certain issues. If nothing was available then you had to call the nurse to get permission to slot a patient in an open spot that didn't pertain to their issue. Too complicated. Especially for the patients and that made it very difficult to calm them down. If you made one mistake you were let go. Training was difficult. It consisted of shadowing an employee for 5 weeks. Then you got a whole notebook explaining what doctor works where and when and what times and days they were available. Patient's availability did not matter at all. 9 doctors, 7 locations and 2 hospitals. And still the appointments could take over a month to get in. It was very sad. I cried almost every day.This was a horrible place to work for; you are paid very low and never acknowledged for the hard work  you do. Employees are given very low raises yet cuts are never made to the salaries of those in the C suite. No women have high positions and productivity standards are unrealistic. The motto is ""we care for  you"" but they do not care for their employees. All they want to do is get bigger and bigger and the phone systems are horrible because they are too big. I was told I would be on hold for a minute trying to get a referral after 35 minutes I hung up.This is the worst company I have every been employeed by.  The pay is very low, and the medical benefits are terrible.   Very high deductible and we can only go to DMG doctors.  Ridiculous productivity expectations.   I literally run all day from patient to patient with not a moment to even stop and use the bathroom!  Quality of patient care suffers terribly due to greed for money and constantly overscheduling patients.  If I were a patient I would not return becsuse they are not given fair time and attention due to DMGs policy of overscheduling.   This greatly lowers qulity of patient care.  So many employees feel used and abused.  Suggestion to improve employee and patient satisfaction,   don't treat employees like machines.  Very greedy organization.   They care more abut money than patients or employees.  Very high rate of turnoverYou will have no life because you work 7am to 7pm.No breaks, one 30 minute lunch.Running to the bathroom between checking in patients.When someone quits, they are not replaced, you are expected to do the work of the people that quit,Very, very, unrealistic expectations.I've learned many new skills within the podiatric specialty area. I very much enjoy my position within the department and I have had the pleasure of working with very professional, and friendly, medical assistants and Podiatrists. I have never worked with a better group of people. At this current time, management of musculoskeletal operations is undergoing many changes which presents communication and organizational issues within the department. I believe that aside from my day to day contact with my fellow co-workers, I find the most enjoyable part of my position is engaging with the patients and administering quality patient care.I totally enjoyed working for the Doctor's here. All of them were down to earth, intelligent, funny, social and compassionate. They are trully the only people I miss working for. The staff was ok. Depending on the day it could go smooth or dramatic for you. The staff was moody. The Doctor's were always professional and never yelled or embarrassed the staff. The pay could had been better. The benefits were good. Management was good and fair. Management appreciated hard work and so did the Doctor's. If you were not sure on how to do something the Doctor's would assist and never embarrass you in front of a patient or co-worker. It was awesome.I enjoy working at this company- benefits are OK would love for the organization to consider employees for job advancements.Great co-workers and Doctor's. Practice manager (Asthma and Allergy) is unprofessional, spreading rumors, and with no management skills. Manager is unable to do any task without the Nurse Supervisor looking over her shoulder showing her how to do it. The Doctor's are getting ripped off - paying 2 salaries for the work of one person. No flexibility with scheduling or changes. Huge turnover of the staff. Annual pay increases of less than 3% with POSITIVE reviews.DuPage Medical is an awful place to work. The company has grown  too quickly for upper level management to handle, which has compromised the quality of care given. Patients would complain often about this. Expect to be worked to the bone for a 17 cent raise and do not expect to move up within the company. DuPage Medical Group: We Don't Care for You, Just for Your Money.Dealing with sick people all day. Great co-workers. working every minute. Very nice place to work. Long days. Need to stay focused.",,Chicago,Downers Grove,IL,2016-12-03T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/915deba4-62c1-4edb-b14d-8a27de3fabd5?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=30,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

102,2269.0,Scientist I,Steris Corporation,3.6,54.0,"This company is growing and 99% of the time they are fair and a great company to work for. Co-workers are great, management is good, and work/life is excellent.I have worked here 10 years and have seen a lot of change take place. Management continues to try to communicate with labor and improve the environment and make jobs easier. They want us to work as a team. There are nay-sayers, but everyone chooses their attitude. They want to develop their employees. The hardest part of the job is to communicate effectively to everyone. The most enjoyable part is the opportunity to learn and grow. It does stink that they just sold a large amount of their product line. Not sure of my future here.A typical day at work was always busy.  I learned new skills such as advancing my Word and Excel knowledge, making travel arrangements, and scheduling clients for training classes.  The hardest part of the job was the manager of the department could be difficult to work with, but not horrible.I had a great 17 years at STERIS, and enjoyed a lot of success.  STERIS has  a good culture and great people.  FDA issues prompted re-organization and cut backs.A great place to learn the technicalities of medical equipment planning.  Long days spent in front of a computer.  Not strong in creative projects.  More technical than creative.  Awesome benefits and job security.Management doesn't listen to any concerns raised by subordinates, and design decisions are chosen based on job title not the the merit of the design.  There is no hope of promotion here since management hires old friends from their previous company into leadership roles.  These promotions are not always merited or accepted amongst other employees in the department.  The displays of favoritism lower moral in the department.There is no project planning and all projects are severely behind schedule and have inadequate resources allocated. Employees do not feel empowered to perform their jobs, there is a high level of apathy, and unhappiness among the employees; all of these things contribute to the high turnover rate at Steris.I worked with a group of four with Steris Corporation for my capstone senior design project. The management at Steris Corporation was very communicative and helpful, and it appeared that they treated their employees well.I started with this company just after it began.  Now they are all over the world. I was employee #23. Now there are thousands of associates.I learned so much at this business, and am grateful I was part of the original team.  I was allowed to be involved with decisions for acquiring equipment, in installing new computer systems.  My main job was accounts payable; reconciling two computer systems daily, checks, and as we grew I had two people working under me.There was no hard part, as the CFO was my direct contact for 3 years and still had direction after a manager became my superior.I loved this company, and I would not have left except to join my husband who moved to Nevada.A typical day would include making 6,000 biological and chemical indicators every day. I was trained in other departments shortly after starting because of my easy ability to learn. I would have to move 1,000+ pounds of pallets. I also had to be exceptionally sterile. I was in charge of making, checking, packing, and documenting all aspects of the product. My management was great, and though some of my coworkers were not team players, I still enjoyed my time with them and had very little discourse. The hardest part of the job was getting into the swing of the fast pace, and the most enjoyable part was being paid to work out!Overall, great experience. Slow decision-making at times but for all the right reasons. Would like to experience work in divisions other than strictly manufacturing however.Steris is a great company to work for. very knowledgeable team.My typical day usually consisted of checking my que to see if there were any new service calls and if there were I would then call those customers and schedule a service repair time. if there were no new service calls then I would call customer to schedule preventative maintenance(PM). Then I would follow up customer that had recent repairs done and check on the status of their repair also ask them if they had any questions about their bill.STERIS is a productive and casual place to work. I interned there and learned many valuable skills that will help me during my career path.management has no clue what is really going on at work. only worried about paper and fake numbers.over good people and just poor management.Safety is the number one priority overall. Traveling for the job is a natural part of everyday life as a National Specialist. A typical day would consist of arriving at the facility prior to surgery to be there as added support during surgery. after cases concluded for the day, I would begin troubleshooting of the system or systems in order to narrow down the root cause or causes of the problems. in the 6 years I have been there, I have positioned myself to try and learn as much about the company as a whole, not just isolate myself to one individual department. The most difficult part of the week, is trying to be in three or sometimes four states at the same time. My schedule is typically booked a month to two months in advanced. The most enjoyable part of the job was the hands on education and the employees I get to work with overall.The best part of the job was the laid back atmosphere, but the hardest part was being a temp. Sometimes when there was so many new temps passing through it made it hard to work, because so many people were getting hired and fired. Everyone tries to be better than everyone else and nobody just concentrated on the work that needed to be done. Some of the Team Leaders were really helpful but some just didn't care about the quality, it was just how many parts were made. I learned to keep to myself until the work I've done is completed. Every day was different but always the same in a sense.Assisted up to 6 sales representatives in 7 states to educate their clients in the correct, safe use of the company products.Spoke at several workshops and conferences on subjects related to infection control issues as well as contagious diseases and their growing resistance to antibiotics.A typical day at work requires long hours. The hardest part of the job is adapting to wearing a full-face breathing mask.At STERIS Corporation, I was initially hired to create digital illustrations for their new HAMO endoscope line. These illustrations would depict on how to put the scopes together through wallcharts, Illustrated instructions and also being able to cross check the part on the part assessment sheets. My contract was extended to assist with the technical and instructional literature for a tutorial program for a medical reprocessing machine, Human Machine Interface (HMI®) Simulation. After the project was completed, my contract was extended further to create the package designs, labels, and instructions for two separate biological indicators. While working on these projects, I also helped in the creation of a logo design for the same medical device washer that I assisted with earlier that year.No growth opportunities.  Stagnant work place.  Executive mgmt rules by fear to get projects completed which are never on time nor on target.  Management does not practice what they preach.Productive work culture. Everyone is very friendly and works together to achieve company goals.This company offered so many great things to it's employees which I feel boosted the moral.  There was a gym onsite with no membership fees.   There  were various kitchenettes around the building which offered free coffee/tea.  Great,great company.",,Chicago,Libertyville,IL,2016-12-03T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/5f5dea9e-d1b6-443b-802f-1d50716f7091?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=3,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
