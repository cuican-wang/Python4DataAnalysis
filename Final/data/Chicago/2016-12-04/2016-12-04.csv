31,2198.0,Senior Data Scientist (IS Centers Of Excellence),"Tyson Foods, Inc.",3.7,1800.0,"Long hours, but pay is good and I had nothing but respect for my upper management, who weren't afraid to work those same long hours and then some. Some of the green hat managers weren't that good, but they eventually get weeded out. The blue hats were mostly good managers and the plant manager, production manager and 99% of upper management onsite were great people. Advancement is certainly there if you want it. A few employees there were pretty shady people, but in a plant that size that's to be expected. There were a lot of great employees as well.it was an hard job but i like the pay and hours and working on second shift it can help you get to where you want to be i like to meet new people and learn new things at tyson you learn a lot of different jobsGood paying jobFast pacedGood hours Good benefitsGood managementHard workHelpful to workersMany advancements opportunitiesNice managerFunGreat Benefitsthe people are wonderful there the pay is great the managment is good. everybody is hard working and its a clean n friendly environmentI started work there 5 years and supervisors don't listen to employee they make up ways to fire you and you have to be able to deal with gossip and ignore it, the best thing to do to stay along time is don't socialize with the employees but listen to them when it comes to your safetyI enjoyed my time working for Tyson Foods, New London, WI plant. I found that the maintenance department was very clickish and when management of the plant was faced with a difficult personnel challenge, their answer was to eliminate the problem.I enjoyed my time working at Tyson Foods. It's a good productive business. It gives you the chance to learn different things, and I also gives you the chance to be a good productive worker.Tyson Foods was a fun and fast paced place to work. I enjoyed  knowing that my work meant something. There are a lot of different cultures that work at Tyson.  It was fun learning about all of them.  For the most part, the management team was awesome.  But, there are always those few that make things difficult.  The hardest part of the job was being able to stand on your feet for long periods of time.  The first couple of weeks are a little difficult, but once you are able to get past those. It is a breeze.  The best part of the job, was the health insurance.  It was not too expensive. Plus, there are many options available.They hype it up so big as how great it is then once your in they change all the rules. nothing is ran as they say during orientation. they even go as far as to say you own your job that you bid on then even though your doing your job if you make someone else fix their error to continue your job turning out right they have a problem. quantity not quality.Love the people I worke with at my site but hate dealing with management and their tactic on things they know nothing about. Alot of micromanagement!!The job itself was easy but it didn't pay enough. It was dead end job where I would be living pay check to pay check. The job did have a lot of benefits such as good health and dental insurance.Tyson was a fun workplace, and the hours worked for my family. They had holiday meals which were nice for the employees and the work was not very difficult.  The people were fun to work with.Very interesting place you learned a lot I just don't like the long hours you couldn't leave until the jobr or  order was done for that shift. Highway package and shipped chickens to places like Boston Market and K.F.C.A typical day for me consisted of cleaning, climbing, and inspecting.  I learned a lot about handling chemicals, and factory operations.  The managements was very helpful and friendly.  My co-workers worked hard and as team to get the job done. The hardest part of the job was wearing all the equipment and climbing in to weird places. The best part of the job was the feeling of the was the feeling of transforming the building every time we came to clean.learned leader ship skills, how to operator heat presses, blenders, ovens, Fuji film packaging equipment, flatbread sheeter, data recording on sp charts. co-workers are mostly friendly and very productive. management is normally really involved with helping keep production and if members are in need of help. the hardest part is the 7 days a week. most enjoyable was the ability to learn new things and work your way up in the companyPlenty of work to do and to be done and at least 40hrs a week. Some team leaders and supervisors can and will seek to make good workers jobs harder than necessary. you only get about 2 breaks throughout a 8-10 hour work period and only a 20 minute lunch...included within the 2 breaksTyson works with you to find a good job that you can perform well and gives you opportunity to rise in the pay scale quickly. The environment if good for employees and the managment is excellent.Great  people to work with. Management  is cool too the work is easy too.  washing machines off with a pressure hose and chemicals the negative is you work everything night they pay is not bad but it ain't greatgood for job advancement manager's are good and understanding good safety practices,employees generally are helpful ,benefits are good especially for spouse and children.The pay rate is amazing here and seeing that they have their own store for fresh meat to buy is a plus. The people are helpful and don't make you feel stupid when you do something wrong.A good place to work. My job wasn't hard I had very little supervision.  The hardest part of my job was sometime the heat in my work area. I enjoyed not having to work on a production line all day.","10,000+",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-12-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/3e8e2d28-5ecc-42e2-a71d-9aaa63e62f86?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
