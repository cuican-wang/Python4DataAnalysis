41,2208.0,Senior Data Scientist,Kaplan Test Prep,3.7,972.0,"Kaplan as a for-profit university, has the right idea. As an educator they are above reproach. With a little reorganization and rethinking culture, I have no doubt Kaplan will become a top educator.I have been teaching for Kaplan for 3 years and my experience has been gradually getting worse. I have never gotten a raise or even qualified for a review despite having very good experiences with my students who seemed to like me a lot and whose scores improved. It seems to me that the company is not as concerned as it should be with keeping experienced and valuable instructors on board. In addition to the pay issue, management has been less helpful and responsive than they were when I began teaching 3 years ago.  I have also had to spend more time than necessary dealing with IT issues just to access platforms necessary to do my job. Overall, it was a good experience and I enjoyed teaching very much, but I found that the company does not adequately support its instructors and they did not reasonably review me so that I might qualify for a raise.Kaplan had great pay, good benefits, but they worked you to death!  I loved the free education that I received. Loved working with the students.The management left something to be desired, they wanted you to do your job, and anything else that you could do.  I taught 2 classes a day with approximately 24 students in each class, any assignment you gave you had 48 papers to grade!  So not just a 9-5 job!  But I loved it and still hear from my former students. Hours are long, I was usually gone from home about 12-14 hours a day.I enjoy working for Kaplan University.  I am looking to make a career change and leave the sales industry.  The management team is excellent and they do a great job creating a positive culture.  The hardest part of my job is being held accountable to meet goals, but there are some factors to meeting goal that are out of my control. The most enjoyable part of my job is the interaction I have every day with students and prospective students.Kaplan University is a great place to work. A typical day involves guiding students in their decisions with attaining a better future through education. I have learned that even though some roadblocks may seem insurmountable, nothing is unattainable with patience and persistence. Management is very supportive of assisting advisors with difficulties they may experience with students. Co-workers are family oriented and supportive. Everyone feels like one big family.The hardest part of my job will be when I leave to go elsewhere. I truly hate to go but I need to keep growing in my professional life and that involves relocating back to North Carolina. The most enjoyable part of the job has been working with the Difference Makers, United Way, and Browared ARC.Kaplan has been one of my best jobs! Secure, benefits start on the first day of employment, salary was above competitive and allowed for growth after the first 90 days depending on your production.Lead generation, lead outreach and interviewing prospective students. Could have provided better opportunities for advancement with more qualified management individuals.Good company but of course - no benefits, classes are hit or miss and no growth opportunities.  Worked at the company 10 years and no ability for full time or advancement.I'm not too sure why there are complaints. One, if you don't like working on phones, don't get a job working on phones; it's laughable really. Two, yes, you are required to work hard. I can't understand why that is a negative. Three, there are soooo many positives, that it would take too long to list them here, but, a few include nice break rooms, numerous company/department gatherings and events, excellent benefits, free education through the Gift of Knowledge program, and, believe it or not, there is definitely room for advancement---as long as you push for it. Kaplan is a giant company and it's easy for mediocre people to do mediocre things there for 20 years; don't be that person. My co-workers are the best I've ever worked with. My manager is the best manager I've ever had in my 22+ year career. I think, the most enjoyable part of my job is...it's very challenging. Yes, I work hard, but I love every minute of it. Upper management do their best to disseminate information, but remember, the company is enormous; it has many moving parts. Kaplan is the type of place you could go far if you really want to; but, you could also get caught in a rut. I would definitely recommend Kaplan to other people.I was hired as a classroom instructor for Kaplan after having had experience as only a substitute teacher, and I LOVED my starting pay rate. I also really liked that I could spend as much time as needed answering emails from students, and I could log it on my timecard without being interrogated by my manager. In fact, any type of enrichment studying that I wanted to complete towards the tests I taught was always approved for pay. I liked that I could set my own schedule every month by choosing which courses to teach. Unfortunately, bad management and weird advancement standards make this company worthless for me in the long run. Though my faculty manager never actively caused issues for me, she was almost completely absent and unresponsive to any need or question I ever had. She refused to answer her phone under any circumstance, and would often take weeks to reply to my emails. Also, it was impossible for me to advance within the company, because all advancement opportunities are based entirely on student reviews -- specifically in answer to the question, ""How likely would you be to recommend Kaplan to a friend or colleague?"" A teacher's composite ""score"" for this answer from students must be astronomically high before he or she can even help grade essays. I found this not just unfair, but crippling. Overall, Kaplan is a GREAT starting point if you want to continue a career in education. Just be sure you don't stick around too long.I love this company, there is a culture of support and embracing of change.  I work from home, with a flexible schedule where I can take 2 hours for lunch or to go to a doctor appointment and my manager doesn't even want to know, as long as I've addressed issues and taken care of my day to day responsibilities.I've learned that I am an awesome employee.  Through the care and appreciation of management, I have gained confidence in my skills and I am ready to move on to greater things.I thought the best part of my job was being at home an not being around people in an office, and I truly miss it, it has become a very hard part of my job not seeing my wonderful co-workers in person.My co-workers are the best I've ever worked with.The satisfaction of helping students and knowing at the end of the day I've made a difference.Its a good company to work with, Its a great work environment and learning opportunity in the academic field. This is a great starting point for anyone who wants to pursue teaching as their full time career in the future. Great quality of students and satisfactory compensation.The organization grew too fast and too much for the infrastructure and management to handle resulting in many missed opportunities, high turn-over rate, and fragile job security.My job duties consist of redundancy and can be boring at times, however because of my fabulous coworkers, and my manager at times, we provide each other with ""commercial breaks"" by sharing an experience or a joke during different parts of the day. The best part of my job is not being responsible for anything extra when I am out of the office. It seems when you are off or on vacation, work piles up and nobody does anything for you, but with the job duties that I have, productivity is based on when you are present at work.Admissions at Kaplan University provides little to no job security. Even worse, management plays favorites according to who is liked/disliked by them.Great ManagementBright Office SpaceSolid Team CamaraderieCreative Co-WorkersFostering of New IdeasExcellent Atmosphere with a Fun Work/Life Balancenot good with work life balance, they used to be really good about schedule accommodations, then they stopped that and made it impossible to get a good scheduleTwo things that are great about the job: 1) working alongside talented & driven professionals who truly take pride in their work, 2) interacting with the vast diversity of students. Everything else falls short. Teacher salaries are almost comically disproportional to the amount of time and effort put into the work. Success metrics are based purely on student reviews, which are unreliable and often biased by popularity or student temperaments. Double standards and deceptive practices pop up time to time but usually quietly dealt with. Poor to moderate benefits with little chance of career advancement -- most teachers are kept part-time due to ""budget constraints"". Keeping appearance is often more important than substance.I would like to say that I was able to assist with many roles but only because the management group in place at the time were not well equipped with HR abilities and assistance.  The Associate Directors and Directors were allowing their managers to write and rewrite Job Descriptions as well as make changes to the benefit only of that Director.  When we were required to meet new demands without proper notification or training to do the job, management would not support the employeeKaplan offers employees the opportunity to gain valuable experience within their specialized field. My employment at Kaplan allowed me to gain experience in digital and social media marketing as well as, video content development and editing. Top-level management was knowledgable and well-respected within the organization. I also had the good fortune to work with an outstanding group of individuals that help support our marketing efforts.The most difficult aspect of my job at Kaplan is working through projects that are delayed by multiple layers of approval. This often results is missed opportunities and revenue.The best part of my experience at Kaplan has been the opportunity to work with talented, dedicated individuals and the opportunity to gain new experience and learn, perfect new skills.In a typical day I greet the student, make sure she has breakfast food she can prepare for herself.I learn a lot about different cultures and customs from the students.The management has turned over so much I don't know any of them very well.I have no co-workers.The hardest part of the job is living on display.The most enjoyable part of this job is building the relationship.","10,000+",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-11-16T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/da13b91b-73a2-4db5-9340-181c5e330daf?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
