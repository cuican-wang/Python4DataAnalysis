76,2243.0,Senior Scientist - Enterprise Optimization,United Airlines,4.0,1100.0,"Handled a wide variety of situations while in continuous contact with the public. Worked independently or as part of a team without supervision. It was a pleasure going to work.Travel is exciting at first but the pay is so low you cant live or enjoy layovers if you are new. Company is top heavy-Too many over paid managers who need to justify their existence and the Senior Flight Attendants run the Union that creates rules to serve only them because they are rightfully angry their pension was taken in the bankruptcy after they agreed to a pay cut to save the company on the condition they would keep their pension. the company was supposed to return the pension money when they made any profit but the top heavy management would vote themselves raises keeping the money for themselves. The new hires have taken the brunt of this in pay, scheduling, and union protection.I love working for United. My boss is very approachable and my entire team is devoted to our performance not only as developing individuals, but as a holistic team on behalf of the entire company. We all help each other out when we have questions about new tools/processes, and enjoy celebrating and milestones with food and happy hours. The most challenging part of the job is leaving at the end of each day. My position requires me to take very time-sensitive actions, which frequently necessitates me to stay late to address new/unexpected requests.It's a good JOB (mind how I didn't say career) to have if you'd like to be more involved with the aviation industry. I was able to work with good people and see some pretty incredible things. The compensation, however, is almost sub-livable at the start, and the job requires relocation unless you're lucky enough to be based out of your home city. Do more research before applyingGet to work @7:45am, morning meeting on objectives & goals, first call @9am, last call is usually@ 5:30pm unless your on duty then u could get a call as late as 10pm, i learned alot about residential split system diagnosis and repairs, the hardest part was being in 150 degree attics for hours, the most enjoyable part was my coWorkers & the camaraderie that you build. If your 18-21 and don't have any true responsibilities this is perfect for you. But if u have a family depending on your income look elsewhere bc if the AHS (American Home Sheild) calls dry up, be prepared to sit at home not making a dime all day..Highly stressful hostile environment on a very consistent basis.Management is nowhere to be found when needed. Extremely unorganized. A typical day at work includes angry passengers screaming at you for following procedures and little to no support from management. Very low paying. Free flight benefits, but you cant afford to take time off to go anywhere! perfect for someone young with NO bills.Come in on time or early.Never pass an employee with out saying hello.Knowing everyone by first name.Check out the status of the operation, and go where the operation need me the most.Enjoy working with and supporting the employees with there personal problems or company difficulties.The biggest asset to any company is the employees, if they enjoy coming to work and are happy with their jobs, the customer will be happy with their service.A great company to work for with very good health benefits.  Safety minded when working around aircraft and around the airport environment.  Team work is encouraged to minimize in a changing weather and physical surroundings.  Nice to meet people from all walks of life and can be challenging at times to make sure flights are on time.  Must be able to work when service is needed 24/7 and safety not at risk. Must meet physical requirements, example equipment break down or short on staffing.The airline has struggled since the merger, there remains dissension within the ranks and upward mobility is stymied at present. There continues to be significant changes in the company and future job leveling happening.Always exciting days. lots of people to serve and please. I loved interacting with our guests and making sure they felt welcome' I learned a lot about world cultures and customs. immediate adaptability to those cultures is important to maintain good customer service standards.The hardest part was trying to maintain an objective mind, due to the terrorist threat, but still giving excellent customer service.United is a great place to work with friendly and interactive co workers across departments.  The flight benefits are a great reward for the hard work, but make the job worth it.  Management can be a challenge depending on the department, but for the most part it is a company of hard workers who are dedicated to delivering excellent customer service.Balance and multi-tasking is a daily must to run the operation of a major airline company. There are constant and continuous change and it requires quick thinking and adaptability skills to make key decisions.I love working at ORD, it's fast paced and I enjoy working with a lot of the passengers. But management and some of the veterans are extremely rude to not only us their co-workers but the passengers as well, and not very helpful to new agents like myself. Also the things you sit in a class for three and a half weeks to learn basically go right out the window once you are placed on the floor because everyone has a different way of doing things. So if you think your going to ask for help and it's done the way you were trained....forget about it. You end up being more confused than when you started out. Not to mention there is no job flexibility especially during you 90 day probation period. See there's a point system and I started with 4 points and they go like a snap of the finger. I got sick and had to go to the ER and got a point, I was told that it was an unexcused absence even with doctors orders to stay home that day. My daughter had surgery and had to go back to see her surgeon and I was told that that was an unexcused absence. So if you want to keep your job come to work half dead and pray your kids or close family doesn't get ill because your job to them comes first and everything else second.a job that is fast paced and always evolving with the culture around it with many opportunities to move around. Always a chance for advancement as well as great benefitsGood job. okay benefits. good flight benefits. good pay, but in the most expensive locations. good chance for advancement. good coworkers. great learning experienceUnited Airlines motto ""Work hard Play Hard"".  Working for United Airlines has a lot of perks especially the benefits of flying.  Working in two departments of United Airlines has made me meet allot of great people and understand the airlines better.I applied for a part time position there for the benefits.  Well I was scheduled for 6 and 1/2 hours during the middle of the day.  and they have called mandatory overtime for 4 hours several times.  I have never heard of a part time job where you work 40 hours a week.  Expectations of the job were not set correctly.i enjoy this company and love the industry.  I enjoy the staff.  I gained vast knowledge of Aircraft and enjoyed the challenging role.   Fast paced and enjoyed my position.I gave my heart and soul to the Frontline Workers. The Frontline Workers is the glue to United Airlines Operations. The Men and Women works so hard for their Beloved Company.Being a Ramp Agent lead was great. You are basiclly the voice of the managers, you kind of still have the same authority as a manager just not as muchh responsibilities and paper work. Great benefits, not a great job if you were in school. They care nothing about your outside life.I miss working there..People were great. the benefits were fair..Seeing the world was easy if you had the time and money to go..I just had to move to Oregon to be near ill family members","10,000+",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-09-13T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/28db8486-3481-4085-9176-36b0db264882?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
