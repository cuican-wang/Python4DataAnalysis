34,2201.0,Senior Data Scientist,National Opinion Research Center (NORC),2.8,15.0,"Its a good job but it can be very boring at times. You have to complete a lot of things to basically complete your task. You repeat yourself ALOT!! NOT ENOUGH HRS OR ENOUGH PAY FOT WHAT WE GO THROUGH ON THE PHONES.In the trainings they concentrate on telling you what you should not do and punishments if you do.Regional supervisors have a reputation for being mean and most of the team managers micromanage and nickel and dime every single expense, mileage and production time.You can tell that's the way they have been trained.If you complain they just fire you and blacklist you.I love my job but this company is HORRIBLE. They condone workplace harassment and do nothing to rid the place of it. Stuff gets stolen left and right- food, cell phones, personal belongings. Most of the supervisors don't know nothing and buttkiss and blame the ti's always!! They DONT COMMUNICATE AT ALL and everyday there's a problem with something because the lack of communication!! Raises are hilarious and they only promote those who they can take advantage of or if they like you and dont speak up against wrong doings. They outkast you if you have a brain and know your rights. They love to fire pregnant women and threaten your job even if you have written notice from a doctor. The morality and ethical treatment is hilarious and because they have NONE!!!!!! And I'm pretty sure if the contractors that hire them knew how they treat their employees they would DEFINITELY FIND SOMEONE ELSE!!!!!!! The job itself awesome!! Sit down and talk and the phone all day! Easy! I've made a few good friend in thankful for (only reason they got the 3 stars) But this company DEFINITELY NEEDS to reevaluate the way they treat you!!!!!!!! Ex. They recently promoted a perverted man who makes A LOT of women uncomfortable and NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE!!!!!!!! Even with NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS!!!!! And supervisors telling this man to stop...... Lawsuit waiting to happen..... And since they are relocating now they are downsizing yet still hiring!!?????? See???? No one knows nothing and they're not letting anyone know what's going on.... No consideration at all for the employees. People have kids, bills.One of thet largest research firm in the Country.  This company is known for providing the best care for its employees.company requirements-very attractive-require employees to  treat respondents with dignity and respect-something that is certainly lacking in the work force today.The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the respondents-always learned something while in their presence.  The hardest part was when I had to leave many of the respondents  and move on to another assignment.I have no comment about the CEO of the company, considering I don't know him to state an approval or disapproval-I have selected No only because I want to exit this page.I usually come in at 9:00 am speak to several different households through out the country to determine whether they are eligible for the National Immunization Survey.  Its take about 20 to 25 minutes to complete a single interview. I collect important data from respondants so that the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, state and local health bureaus can allocate funding in areas where they are needed. Hardest part of job is building a rapport with a respondant within the first 30 seconds of the call. The management and coworkers at NORC are very nice, polite, and helpful. The most enjoyable part of the day is quitting time.They tell us we are not doing telemarketing, but however you look at it, it is telemarketing.  We are trying to make people conduct a survey against their will and no matter how many times they tell us ""no"" we continue to call them back. I try not to complain because a job is a job, but they are ridiculous.great company pays well! Management is very supportive. Best company I've ever worked forThis is a great atmosphere to work in but very strict policies on attendance and in job decorum.I worked in the TSSO department. It is essentially a big call center to collect information on behalf of government agencies. It is run like a sweat shop. There is an incredible amount of micromanagement. You have to clock to break when you step away from your station even to use the bathroom. You cannot talk to the person next to you. You cannot eat while working. You are expected to work as fast as humanly possible all the time, and statistics are taken to measure your ""production"" There is no job security and HIGH job turnover. About the bottom %10 is fired and replaced monthly. They don't want you to think. They want robots.For me this place thee pits!! I took it as a means to generate some income after being unemployed for some time but after being there for a short time I knew my time there was coming to an end. I worked as a professional telephone interviewer for minimum wage, most people you call don't want to be bothered and others can be nasty and mean. There are production goals so you have to do somewhat well and also reading verbatim is crucial. Attendance is what can get you axed but they have a system where you create your schedule and trade hours, so it is possible to pick up more hours. Some people from management are nice, but the rest seem to be angry about life! Team leads walk the call center floor to watch you which made me feel uncomfortable - you can't read anything besides your own notes and no phones are allowed on the floor-of course people do. You get 6 minutes for every hour worked and there is 4 hour shift requirement. Minimum of 16 hours for each work week is required. Not much time to do anything considering it is on the 14th and 16th floor, and it takes like 3 minutes to get to the lower level in the elevator to get food/drink.Bottom line, if you are a student and need a flexible work schedule, then this is it. If you are looking for second job, this could work.There are other opportunities for you to do other things within the company, most still require for you to be on the phone.The promises in the ads NORC puts out sure knows how to reel you in. The big problem though is that this company falls very short on the delivery. I wouldn't take their ad for face value, if you know what I mean.Don't expect much in the salary department. Their ""competitive pay"" is merely fancy wording for minimum wage. The environment is very controlled indeed, they put all of their energy in the wrong place. It seems as if management goes out of their way to see if you're committing any office crime, such as forgetting to punch time, barely overshooting on breaks or working a little too loudly(whatever that means.)Speaking of management, they are a most conflicting bunch. It seems as though the different levels of management don't communicate with each other as well as they probably should. They do not make their guidelines for call production crystal clear. In fact, it sometimes seems as if their guidelines change on any given day. As a clerk, that makes it pretty difficult to know how to do your job, know when you're on top and when you're falling flat. They do offer the chance to have a 1-on-1 sit down to go over your stats. Unfortunately that turns out to be quite unproductive, as the person you meet with usually has no idea about the role of a production clerk, meaning they can't offer much in the way of advice or answer most questions you might have.As for the actual work itself, in my opinion things can get a little tedious. There is little variety in regard to the kinds of tasks you perform; you're either on the phone, on the computer, or both. On the off-chance  more... that there is another type of task available, you can pretty much forget about being considered for it if they already have you working the phones. Plus, I really didn't see many chances for true advancement during my time there. They only seemed to offer a handful of temporary projects, and once completed, it's right back to square one.On the upside, alot of the other employees there are pretty pleasant, scheduling is quite flexible, and NORC really does have a great, easily accessible location. Just wanted to say that this was not intended as a bashing rant, so I hope it wasn't taken as such. I just wanted to try to paint a very honest picture about what kind of company this is so people would really know what they were walking into if considering employment here.  lessI worked as a field interviewer. My main duties included planning and making trips into the field and/or telephoning respondents from my home office. Initial contact with respondents was with a cold visit or cold phone call; then explaining the study, persuading respondents to participate, and conducting the interview according to protocol. Also had to follow up (either in person or by phone) with respondents who had made appointments to be interviewed, or prompt and persuade resistant respondents to participate.My direct supervisor (field manager) was very easy to work with and very helpful and supportive.Being a field interviewer in not difficult, but one must be very organized and a self-starter, since you are working independently out of your home office. You also must not be shy about making a cold call or visit; and must be articulate enough to explain the study and why a respondent should participate in it.For me, the least enjoyable part of the job--which I didn't have to do too often--was doing occasional in-person visits with another field interviewer. I'd rather work independently than to have to put up with another field interviewer's quirks.Most enjoyable aspects: working out of my home independently, being able to by and large set my own schedule, doing a variety of tasks, and doing in-person interviewing in different areas of the region where I live.For one thing these are temporary jobs not permanent. They dock you for any bathroom time over 6 minutes. I never heard of such a thing the wages are minumum and you are expected to reach a quota this is more like a sweatshop than a job. Run away from this place it not worth it.Like the office setting, not loud and friendly coworkers. I like the ability of working for different government agencies and handling different tasks like data entry and telephone interviewing and clerical tasks.Sat at a computer cold calling individuals to complete the National Immunization Survey on behalf of the CDC.",,Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/541c4074-ce4c-420a-b97a-398435dcc090?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

I wish the company was a little less old fashioned and would allow telecommuting.Great company and products, loved my manager and working for allergan, comp was great and company is growing. highly recommended for sales professionalsAllergan is a strong company that has always had a great culture.  The work/life balance is good.  The benefits and good, but have been slipping over the last few years.  Following the merger with Actavis, the company has been overly focused on mergers and acquisitions and less concerned about research and growing existing product lines.Allergan is a nice company to work for that offers many opportunities with great benefits.  The Orange County campus has amazing talent. Work hours are flexible for most positions.As far as warehouses are concerned, this was a laid back place to work but we also took our jobs very seriously. Management was great and co-workers worked hard.I worked there for over 5 years before the location shut down due to lack of work, combined with other reasons. I really did enjoy the responsibility that the job required.A typical day at work with Allergan varied. I held lunches most days with doctors and staff of the clinic. I learned to be patient and how to make someone's day better. The hardest part of the job was that sometimes the doctors would be extremely busy and not have time to visit with me and go over the products I was representing. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and building strong relationships.Good place to work. Positive and friendly atmosphere. Can play basketball at lunch or go to the company cafeteria. Free gym for Allergan employees and secure parking with several ports for electric cars.I worked in records retention and was a temp employee. My duties were limited and direction was given to permanent employees. Good paying job to have and many options to move around the company.After the Actavis merger and Allergan purchase, there was a rapid change in management  ( three managers in three years) that created a very challenging and strange work enviroment.It's awful to see and hear from others how poor or non existent the culture is at this place.  Management (including Jr/Sr/Executive) is so poor due to the fact the CO only wants to save a buck by putting inexperienced and bewildered people in place just to follow orders like clowns and repeat their superiors like parrots.

The core values that management along with it's peers has made coming to work a delight.Allergan is a forward thinking company that considers its employees as an asset to its success. Great management teams and benefits. A global technology leader and is on the cutting edge of science and technology. They have great benefits and a strong team environment.I took a pay cut since I heard how great Anda was. Their bonus structure is horrible.  Barely make any money, and can't even keep up with bills.  DON'T LIE TO PEOPLE JUST TO GET THEM TO ACCEPT A POSITION.I was a former temporary associate working with the company and they only hire but kissers. I worked for them for two years and never got hired on. I was repeatively passed up by people who were there for three days ind i wad there way longer than them...I was given opportunities to learn different trades. I worked with different people. I enjoyed getting to know about different departments. My supervisor was always there if I had any questions and gave positive feedback and constructive criticism.the territories are quite large and the training was excellent. the expectations for new employees is vast given the geography of the territory. good management and coworker. the hardes part of the job is the size of the territories.Allergan is an awesome company to work for. You get surprise rewards and days off. Our Sr. Site Director has an open door policy. She listens and is really great. The company is understanding to life events and changes.

Though it was very predictable and gratifying, I missed the opportunity to have more creative outlets.I performed line maintenance support for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance on Bag fabricators, Fill/seal rotary fillers, Bag overwrap machines, Continuous Sterilizer and Packaging equipment. I completed plc program changes for installation on weekends, I completed all necessary paperwork. this included Cad drawings, ECR's, Printouts of electrical drawings, backups of the plc programs. I worked with production management, engineering, and maintenance personnel.

Being able to go home everyday knowing you are helping a company that save lives is one of the best feelings in the world.the working environment is good with knowledgeable staff and good management. Sometimes employees are asked to do very difficult tasks in an unreasonable amount of time. and there are some employees that are very cliqueish management will get rid of you if they feel you're damaging their percentages so attention to detail is key.The Rocky Mount site, under Abbott Labs, was a great place to work.  Employees were dedicated to providing quality products to meet customer needs.The company itself is good but the management working in our country is very much biased and the compensation given to the employees is well beyond the expected.Great work place and opportunities foe employee skills enhancements. leader in Pharma companies.

Overall it's generally a good place to work. liked the people that I worked with they liked being there. The number one reason people stay is because of the benefits for the pension plan and insurance.It is a positive environment to work and prosper in.

The management is amazing and makes sure that if you want to learn and grow in your career then opportunities are given.The people are very helpful and knowledgeable.   I would love to work with Abbott again. The facility has a full gym to work out and the cafeteria is open at night.Terrible to move from temp to hired. Worked as a temp for almost a year and there were no opportunities to get hired in. They were cutting jobs when I went elsewhere.I learned to processed and inspect various stents.

The position I  hold has little to do with my legal education.Currently I am managing the event space for Microsoft. Over the years, I have helped Microsoft and CBRE combine the event management position and successfully managed close to a 1000 events last year, ranging from 10 people to a 1000 people. While I do like what I do, I'm hoping to find something that will put my Legal Education into practice.CBRE is a great place to work, given the right opportunities.  I was exposed to a wide variety of situations, providing me a platform on which to grow & learn.My co-workers were very serious about their responsibilities and focused on providing accurate, timely information and reports. I learned a lot about new software and new supporting excel reports that provided excellent documentation. Every day was busy from beginning to end. The team that I was a part of was understaffed for all of the responsibility placed on it. There was too much required of every member in the amount of time that was available. The team management was too focused on the time allotted for each function to take into account when the out of the ordinary requests came in or when there were issues within everyday functions. There was no flexibility and ""your fault"" or ""your problem"" were common responses to requests for assistance.It is hard to get motivate to come to work everyday for this company. In the department I work in we haven't been properly staffed for more than two years. Managers and Supervisor will listen to you and disregard any of your ideas to make it a better work environment. Many will tell you it's even hostile.The benefits are absolutely horrible. You must meet a deductible before the insurance will pay for anything. You only come to work here if this is your last hope of finding work.Great work place with tons of upside potential, that allows any employee to proceed.In the years at CBRE , I have been mentored and learned tremendous amounts of knowledge.Typical work day always starts with a safety meeting, from there we get our daily tasks and are able to speak to management with any concerns we may have. This is a company that is wanting you to further your career and climb the ladder. Hardest part of the job is being able to complete the tasks assigned to you that day on time with all the restrictions on certain accounts.I learned a lot in this company it was with diversity of team and fun some times happy hours big fun. and well experienced  and organized  team.Good opportunities to improve a somewhat outdated system.

Really enjoyed the people I worked with fortunately. Would love the opportunity to join them full-time. Overall great experience.Have always loved working for CBRE. Great hours, Great Benefits, Great people to work with. They also provide continued education via online courses.I loved the people I worked with.  This was a good location for me and offered a lot of diversity with job responsibilities.Property Management Company that I worked was processing work orders from The Hartford Financial Services. Clients would call or submit a work order for their location for temperature issues, plumbing, elevators not working. Light bulbs need to be replaced.  Any property issues I would process the work order and contact the Landlord / Tenant of that location. I would also follow up with the client to make sure that the request was completed to their satisfaction. Management was easy to work with. They had your back on any decision that you made.Co-workers were also helpful we worked as a team. Communication was the key to make the workplace pleasant.The health care plans cost a lot. The. Yearly cost before plan paid any thing was almost 6000. He'd weekends off and not on call.Loved my position but unfortunately JP Morgan Chase was downsizing and my position was eliminated leaving only two engineers for all of Eastern WA. I was offered other positions within CBRE if i moved to another state which i did not want to do.In a typical day of work you never know what you are going to be working on, either you can spend your whole shift behind a computer or 30 minutes turning a screwdriver.  When there's actual work we all think safety first. Manager are good and well trained some other are just ok. Co workers are great cant complain. cant say there is one other than sitting around for long periods.A typical day at CBRE is wonderful. My coworkers invited me as family the moment I started working there. The feeling was amazing knowing that someone really cared on how I felt. I've learned that every voice matters working in the building here at CBRE. Management encourages their team to strive to keep a continuous smile on our faces. The most enjoyable part here at CBRE is that you interact with different people and that they show their appreciation by awarding snacks and great compliments on a daily basis.CBRE, Inc. is a great place to work for. Ever-changing and updating, this company is filled with good leadership and gives back to the community.Overall, very flexible with work/life balance. Getting parts/materials make doing your job difficult at times. Coworkers work well with one another.Great place to work, management felt a bit out of touch at crucial times. Great people to work with room to grow. There are many tools that are available for successCBRE is a OK company. Culture is fluid depending on your account. Lots of potential to move around and up. Don't stay in one place too long though.
