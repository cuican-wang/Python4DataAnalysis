89,2256.0,Associate Geologist/Geological Engineer,MWH,3.9,58.0,"Very good co-workers and all worked as a team. Management would always keep us informed about how the company was doing. Each day was fun and wanted to come to work.Professional and exciting work environment! Recommend this company for all career levels. This company does not disappoint.good overall atmosphere friendly work environment allot of good people and great leadership. Its a little hard adjusting at first but once you work here for a while is all good.Exposure to world renowned projects, but career growth and compensation is very slow for the bottom level. Company wants top talent but does not want to pay for it.  Promotional raises are the equivalent of a standard annual review raise.Razor thin business margins, no strategic vision and investment in future direction of company.  Business limited to a handful of clients.Enjoyable work place and co-workers. Hardest part of the job was when projects are slow. I am used to working multiple jobs at once.Enjoyed working with my co-workers, and worked well as a team.Hardest part is when the job comes to a close. The days went by quickly. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing it completed.Since this position was a contract the company was required to comply with evaluations of their client. MWH was cooperative with client when a personality conflict arose between client employees and MWH employee. Not at all helpful to work towards resolution of issue.Boys club with not a lot of room to move around. Company only cares about bottom line and people who directly work with clients.Company would re-organize every couple of years. Management did not share a clear view of the future.  Not very innovative.I had a great work experience at MWH where I used my knowledge as an Engineer and applied it to Projects. Great team efforts and it was enjoyable experience...Overall a good company. There is a lack of management at times and the older folks don't give the new folks to rise. You need to know the right people to move up.One of the most influential and meaningful job experiences of my life. My colleagues were competent professionals, always seeking to complete projects to their fullest capabilities.Interesting company with good employees and international diversity.In the document service department at MWH, it was a fast paced work environment that I enjoyed working in. I enjoyed the day to day interaction with the clients. What I learned most from MWH was that not only providing quality work was important, but having and displaying excellent customer service skills are a must and the backbone to a successful company.I got an opportunity to learn quite a bit about Compliance.  I also got experience Recruiting Engineers which was very interesting.A typical day at MWH for me was walking around the entire building asking my co-workers if they need any help weather it be scanning, copying, or filing. I learned to be more open to responsibility and meeting new people. The people I worked with were fantastic! I could ask questions without the fear of looking silly. Everyone could be fun when they wanted to be but they are also very dedicated to their job. The hardest part of the job was trying to juggle all the tasks I was given in one day, but throughout the day I could get it done. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able not only to talk with my co-workers but being able to connect with them. Also being able to have a regular conversation not always being about work, but sports, news and media, at appropriate times, of course.Strong safety culture. A typical day was composed of interaction with the subcontractors, safety walks and reports, toolbox talks, various other safety related paperwork.Great Company but after I fulfilled my contract I returned home for required surgery.Worked your solid 8, sometimes had to work more than 40hrs a week, great people, but always layoff people once a year after reorg. Some engineers are overworked, meaning that they charge their 40hrs to a project then have to work on business pursuits after.Best company to work for wages. people etc.The Management is excellent, the pay and benefits are in range","5,001 to 10,000",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-10-29T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/10bf1dda-6e31-4bb7-b8dd-668866479741?mescoid=1700187001001&jobPosition=25,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
