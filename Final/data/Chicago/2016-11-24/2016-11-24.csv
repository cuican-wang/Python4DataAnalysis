11,2178.0,HPLC Chemist,Astrix Technology Group,2.3,3.0,"This company will not help you when you have an issue with management. My supervisor was horrible and lacked leadership skills. She was very friendly with HR which why I believed they did not help me when my supervisor was rude, mean and unprofessional!They don't like to give raises or help advance their employees. They do paint a very pretty picture when you apply and interview.Compensation is very poor with little to know increase pay.Management is not fair and can be disrespectful to their employee.Very routine job and preferential / unfair treatment is common in the workplace.I worked on a contract as an Astrix employee. The client was difficult to communicate with and it took time to even find out if I had the job - even though it turns out I was the only one interviewed.... Throughout the wait I was kept informed by the account manager and was in touch with her at least once a week during the 6 months I worked for them. She was terrific to work for and I hope to have an opportunity to work with her again.",,Chicago,Skokie,IL,2016-11-24T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/hplc-chemist-job-skokie-il-us-162131173.aspx?mescoid=1900259001001&jobPosition=5,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
