8,2175.0,Senior Automation Data Scientist,Allstate Insurance,3.9,2900.0,"See above, work load always very heavy, employees stress levels extremely high. 2 people actually walked out after I was laid off. The hardest part of our day was prioritizing as everything was equally important.During my time at allstate I was able to perform in numerous areas such as personal lines adjuster, bodily injury claims, auto theft claims, auto appraiser, auto management and property appraiser. The company trained me in all aspects including creating an outstanding customer experience. Management provided the necessary tools and skill set I needed to perform my daily job. Allstate is extremely customer focused but at the same time, very employee focused. Allstate does a good job ensuring employees are given every opportunity to succeed. Differing opinions are encouraged. New ideas are solicited and open communication is welcomed. I enjoyed my time at allstate.Allstate was the best i have experienced in terms of a company actually caring about their employees. Although they couldn't satisfy everyone, they tried! I give them an applause for their efforts in trying to focus on work and life balance for their employees. Still it is a job or career path, and they have to do some things in the eyes of corporate as a business,which can at times feel a little too scripted and repetitive. Overall if you are looking for a reliable and respectable good paying job and for a company who treats their employees well, then this may be a good fit for some of you out there. Most of all, i will miss the awesome potlucks and free prize giveaways there.Overall, a good place to work. The last couple of years have been fraught with uncertainty. There is a definite push to outsource job functions. For an entry level position good place to start. You receive  pretty training. There are opportunities for advancement if you work hard and use the talent development tools available. The hardest part of this job was having to say goodbye to people that you've worked with for many years due to restructuring and outsourcing. What I learned is that you can accomplish anything you set your mind to if you use tools available such as networking and ensuring your manager knows what you want to achieve.Overall, Allstate is a great company at which to work. They provide a great compensation package. Allstate is a large company, with over 30,000 employees. Any company of that size, of course, has areas of opportunity, but Allstate does not run from them. They are constantly pursuing improvement. I plan to be with Allstate until I retire. They are an extremely ethical company, and they work to always be customer focused. I do feel appreciated at work, and I am consistently pushed and coached to always do the right thing for the customer.Responsible for performing clerical and administrative duties in an office setting. Assisted executive assistants and secretaries by sorting mail, filing, answering phones, greeting clients, This job allowed me to build a rapport with customers. The management and my co-workers were very encouraging and supportive of my ambitions both inside and out of work. I handled correspondence, preparing reports, maintaining office files and inventory. They are also responsible for limited bookkeeping activities, taking messages and preparing outgoing emails.Working for this company expect to be burnt out and overworked. The company only cares about productive and numbers. Only promote if they like you. If you have any college background please......stay far away from this company. The individuals that are in mgmt doesn't have any college education however are responsible for your future. If you want to work for insurance please go to Progressive or AAA...where they actually pay you a decent rate. Oh yeah you will have no personal life once you work here. Your coworkers will throw you under the bus to make themselves look better for mgmt.A typical day of work for me is driving 48 miles to work arriving 2 hours before opening to get a head start on the day.  Focus on meeting company sales goals while training new sales staff as well as holding tenured staff accountable.  Over the years I have learned how to manage multiple books of business as well as interview/hirer new staff, implement onboarding processes, train on policies/procedures for sales.I'm one of 4 individuals that runs the organization.  My title is Director of sales.The hardest part of the job is realizing that I have not further opportunity to grow or attain equity in the company after investing 10 years while helping grow the overall book of business by 45 million. The most enjoyable part of the job has been gaining wisdom of managing several small businesses while increasing my overall sales/management skills.The way this company and their offices operates the workplace is great.  The positions here allow employees to keep work in the office and not take it with us when off the clock.  It is very flexible there as far as requesting days off, days switches, vacations, etc.  The position I work in, though, is very intense--it is not an easy job; however, the compensation is what makes me continue to work as hard I have been, and strive for even better.  The job and company overall is definitely customer service driven and focused.  Having to investigate liability from a car accident, and delivering the not so good news when someone is found responsible for a loss is one of the most challenging part of this job.  Also, if you are not organized and fail to properly time manage, you will have a very hard time succeeding in this position.Thought it was a great place to work my first 6mos....but they want you to work for peanuts compared to the other insurance companies. They push more and more and more work on you and if lucky you'll get a 2-4% raise (maybe). Management changed too much for my liking and all they care about are the numbers not the employees (don't be fooled). You're sold a bunch of wooden nickels at this company, a lot of pipe dreams.... To many meetings and not enough development of employees.....I could go on and on ....only gave two stars because a few of the co workers were greatIt is a very stressful job. I have learned a lot of skills and you are critiqued on every thing you do. I have learned about production type work, developed a keen eye to search out problems. The hardest part of my day is all day, every piece of work that you touch could have the potential of being placed under scrutiny and you get dinged on minute issues. The most enjoyable part of my job was PTO and office recognition times which were far and few between.A typical day is busy handling calls and new files.  I learned all aspects of the auto insurance business.  Management is traditional and conservative.  The co-workers were the best part of the job.  The most difficult part of the job were technical issues.  There were many which delayed and frustrated employees and clients alike.  The benefits are still fairly good but diminishing yearly.I come into work and log in to my computer. First thing I do is check my email and process any service work that may need to be done. After that, I make about 200 calls throughout the day to sell insurance. I manage the staff and help them close policies and process service work for their clients as well. My co workers are great. I trained my current employer and have a great working business relationship with him and the other two guys that I work with. The hardest part of my job is trying to keep the clients at renewal.Allstate is a great place to start your career because of the flexibility of working in a smaller capacity agent. Much more room for you to go at your own pace. Good products but limited lines of business. Management can be fickle depending on the office you're in. Overall it's a good employer with a strong brand.Typical day at work is you go and sit at your desk and take anywhere from 40 - 90 calls a day assisting customers and local agents with information and changes on policies. I learned a lot of information about insurance and how the whole business is ran and how insurance works. I learned what not to do as a leader. I did learn some good leadership skills. Learned about insurance laws, Learned how to provide premium customer service. Learned the psychology behind customer service and people. Most of my co workers are awesome and great people, hard workers and very intelligent. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the stress of people calling in and yelling about premium increases and when people make mistakes. Dealing with all the corporate jargon and the company refusing to change for the better.Not amazing because the management is very low quality. Unfair hourly raises, and unprofessional sources. The most enjoyable part was time spent with coworkers and days that lunch was provided for us. The hardest part of the job was the fact that there were no new leads which carried into no new income for comission.I love building business and new relationships.  Fast paced position that is rewarding in recognition and compensation.  I have learned that to manage a team effectively you have to be able to lead from the front.  Time manage is critical for success.  The toughest part of my job is work life balance.  I enjoy helping people.a typical day at work is taking over 60 calls assisting customers with policy changes and billing questions. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to provide and effortless experience to all customers and hearing them say how much we`re appreciated. the hardest part of the job is not having any work life balance.A typical day was to have all technology functioning to perform a fantastic day of sell. Taking care of customer needs and staff needs all day and troubleshooting when necessary in order to meet expectations. At the en of the day will have end of day reports ready.Management were willing to accommodate much of our needs  and keep us inform of any new innovations or tactics to move forward.  Co-workers were very friendly and willing to cooperate with any given task.I enjoyed taking care of customer and meeting staff expectation.Administered the equitable recovery on 550 and third party administrator claims, including worker’s compensation, auto, general and product liability, integrated disability, claim administration, and risk management services nationwide.Established strategic connection with SRS claim directors and account managers to certify that data integrity remained high while reducing collection time.Communicated with claimant’s counsel to quickly resolve medical liens while preserving a high net recovery.Company experiencing growing pains. More employees need to be accountable. Compensation and benefits are above the norm. I personally traveled every week spending 3-4 nights in hotels. I would have  liked to have more contact and visits with home office.","10,000+",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-12-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/601bc48a-b1ad-43ff-b8a9-489b15eb5a01?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Sometimes worked  7 days. I loved it.Manufacturing/Cost Accounting is an environment that takes a certain individual, so be sure that you are comfortable with that environment prior to stepping into the arena.Very flexible work life balanced place to work. Constant change is always going on due to lot's of management movement. Training is not as strong as it was in the past. Lost lots of experienced employees over the past year.This was a job that needed me there every day on time, ready to make the orders that were needed for that day. We made protein bar for building muscles. some of the batches need a cure time for holding until the batch was ready. Management was tuff on making sure product would run normal on the line without any tweaks to the equitment.Management was great. The pay was good. The fellow workers were of a great help. It is kinda fast paced, but after the first hour of your shift it did die down alot.This is a great paying job for the job that you do. The office staff is great at what they do. The environment in the plant is cold as it has to be to keep the food at correct temps. So, dress warm and layer clothing.I have experience in QA, Production leader ship, leading production employees on the line. I work long hours if needed , to get job done. I fill in in defferent departments if needed,due to my experience..I lead the ff1 department in our recycle team.Could be better in some areasCould be worse in some areasGood Pay For This AreaUnionizedBenefits..Medical,Dental and Vision401KConAgra was a very large company with an incredibly diverse product portfolio.  The decision to acquire Ralcorp in order to become the major player in private brand products was ill fated; many of ConAgra's branded products competed with the private brands purchased and created a cannibalization effect.  This decision was what lead ultimately to the breakup of ConAgra and concurrent corporate reorganization,very good pay, most sections of plant are climate controlled. very clean!!Union facility, updated lunchroom, company discounts on conagra productsBurn up in the summer and freeze during the winter! Business operates day by day and management does not use common sense in decisions that affect employees. Management shows no appreciation to employees and has mentality that if you keep employees mad they will work harder! Co-workers are good to work with and job pays well for the area and benefits are average for this size company. Could be a good place to work and I really like and appreciate my job, but when you work for greedy stock holders all employees are just a number. Employees make the company money and should be treated as the greatest asset but Conagra senior management feel they are more important and they know best period!The time that I worked for ConAgra food were a very pleasant and productive work enivorment. The management department were fair to all staff and highly believed in customer rights.Nice bunch of people to work with driving distance was great learned a lot of things there packageing cans to putting ingredients together for different productscompleting daily assignments staying on task and assisting with packaging operators , ordering parts and scheduling repairs around production schedulevery hot work days and very stressful not to trust management management  just like to fire people co workers are ok stress and heat nothing enjoyableTheir were many changes over the 10 yrs, most of it good. Great opportunities to cross training in various areas of the business. Worked with many management levels on a daily basis.I loved working with ConAgra and was proud to be a part of their team. Coworkers made it fun.  I am a casualty of the move to Chicago and dismantling of the companies many brands.The hardest part of the job was waiting for the axe to fall and seeing many families affected by their job loss.the work schedule for slim jims is terrible, have to work 7days before you get any days off.  work most weekends, sucks.bakery side is not much better.  u get a schedule of what you are suppose to run each day.  you come in to work to find they have changed the days schedule.  do this on a regular basis.  it gets really old.  you have 2 maybe 3 different start times. depending on what the schedule says.  come in on one start time to find they have changed the schedule.  frustrating.Family type work atmosphere. Learning opportunities available and advancement. Management and co-workers easy to work with on a daily basis. The people are the most enjoyable part of the job.Overworked.  Good pay.  Liked the employees.  Communication was not stellar.  Boss was good but overworked too.  Generally no one was happy.  Company was bought out, laid off a lot of people and moved the headquarters.It's very hard work.Heavy lifting and working ovens and big heavy pots for mixing.  Co-workers good. Rotating shift not good. Temp. Service so if people not shoe have to work.","10,000+",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-12-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/a29b1458-302d-40bc-bdef-12533736f6a6?mescoid=1300079001001&jobPosition=7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
