98,2265.0,Bat Biologist,SWCA Environmental Consultants,3.3,12.0,"As a seasonal archaeologist, the project goals were clear and additional information regarding the project area were available upon asking.  Overall, the Tucson office had a great morale and work ethic .This company seems to have a high turnover, maybe more so in the Phoenix corporate office.  In every office there are people that should be fired and people who are worth retaining.  Trouble is, the fickle management doesn't seem to know the difference.  Good employees seem to be dismissed way too often; even when it doesn't seem to make sense. Just don't count on job security.Horrible place to work, no leadership, no advancement , no team work.  Seasonal work. No set processes or procedures.  Benefits are mediocre. Employees at a certain level are not held accountable.SWCA was a lousy company to work for.  Project Directors regularly threw underlings under the proverbial bus in order to cover their own ineptitudes.  Good archaeologists & biologists were regularly replaced & overshadowed by less skilled, but more ambitious & cutthroat coworkers.  SWCA also regularly overcharged clients, purposely did shoddy fieldwork, & arbitrarily changed pay.  Out of the several Cultural Resource Management firms I have worked for, as well as other places of employment in other fields, SWCA was easily the most unethical, devious, & all around negative work environment.This job is really fun and the work load is just enough were you don't feel overwhelmed. Although the work is project based, so some times it gets really slow. For example I had a couple weeks where I only worked 5-8 hrs. The Management is awesome.The best part about SWCA is that they have the technical expertise that provides the client a high quality environmental review in accordance with all regulatory requirements followed. The team works long hard hours.  The pay is lower on the scale, but the offset is in other benefits such as health insurance, investment options, and profit sharing. The name sake of the firm is very much involved in projects in most, if not all offices. SWCA is a large firm, but with a small firm feel.a typical day at SWCA start at seven o'clock the morning, driving to project area. This could be and energy location currently producing or a proposed energy location. we've been conduct the biological survey required for the client. The hardest part of his job was having to identify plants by their scientific names. The best part of his job was identifying plants by their scientific names.You can learn a lot if you are willing, a lot of very talented people at this office in Houston.  The management is fair and understanding.Its all right It just does not provide enough hours needed to make a living. If you get hired on part time its more interment so its when ever they need you. Which makes it hard to find a second job and be far to both employers.This company only used me certain times when projects came up in the area in which I went to school. The projects were usually very short and only required start up work on my end.I get to work and review what the day will bring. Checking mail and review my things to do list. Worked with good people and were willing to teach me new tasks",,Chicago,Lombard,IL,2016-10-27T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/d16e04f2-c6ab-4405-9d61-1612fd6b2e60?mescoid=1900240001001&jobPosition=34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
