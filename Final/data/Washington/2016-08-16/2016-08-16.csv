145,3198.0,Data Scientist,Berico Technologies,3.2,5.0,"The company has good management and they work at a fast pace to interview and hire personnel, the company has a good health care plan for a good price but it is a high deductible plan, to make up for this the company offers its employees a master card with 6k every year to cover expenses. A bad thing about the the comapny is that it has sunpeded it's 401k program, but other than that this company is great.Berico is a company which is very good at marketing to their employees, but is marginally competitive.Leadership is engaged but holding an empty hand.This company has great potential, but will only be truly succesful if they align employee interests with ownership interests. Otherwise, steer clear.Additionally, company will likely be sold if they win a few big contracts.If this company were employee owned, I would give them five stars and actively encourage bright people to work there.Enjoyed my time with the company. Medical benefits are the best i have had. training was non existant.Berico is a defense contracting company which is always growing. They take of their people with a great benefits package and very good management. On my project I work with a group of people who really gel together well and our boss is very involved (not in a micro-management manner, but in a servant-leadership manner). Although the company is spread out among many projects, the corporate office attempts to keep us all together as one company. I enjoy working for Berico, and I know it will continue to do well.Company was fast-growing and innovative to provide solutions to the warfighter.",,Washington,Gaithersburg,MD,2016-08-16T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/9b4d9cc6-abc7-4f11-b8b5-67f353de85f3?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=15,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
