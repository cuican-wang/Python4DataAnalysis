143,3196.0,Data Scientist,The College Board,4.2,30.0,"Proctoring the SAT Test for high school students.The job is very enjoyable, But it is not a consistent year long job. The test is only given a few times per year.Go thru emails every morning, check on job orders placed previously, handled members phone calls, assisted co-workers with conference/meeting preparation. Company provided classes on microsoft, etc.. (professional development). Conferences were fun, especially in another city, but hard if a speaker was late/no-show, sometimes a session had to be cancelled at the last minute.I loved the company. Management was great. The people in the department that I worked with were great. Typical day for me would be logging into my computer and reviewing our SS. This would set a focus for the day. Next I would review emails and voicemails left by customers. I would then prioritize callbacks and the urgent cases from the SS.I've learned to face my fears and not to allow fear get in the way of success.This is a nice stable environment if you are at the point of your career where you want to take it easy and predictable. If you are young and hungry and trying to get ahead and get significant experience this is not the place for you. I would avoid non profits until I am further ahead in my career.grey cubicle kind of officegreat initiatives, slow movingI worked directly with my director in department. I worked with students who had disabilities who were seeking accommodation on college entrance exams and work with their school counselor or special education department or parents in this process as every case was different. My manager traveled a lot so he kept me in charge and I was responsible for our two vendors, ETS and Xerox, and traveled at times to train them on our systems and go over new policies and procedures and making sure they were up to bare and answer any inquires they may have. If I didn't travel, then I would train via WebEx and prepare training manuals and every two weeks or so, my manager and I work hold a conference call to keep an update on their department. After 2.5 years, my contact expired and unfortunately, I lost my job and have been unemployed since then with the exception of administrative assistant and receptionist work through various temp agency as well an Nanning for several years as I love kids, education and working in customer service as I am a people person, but with a shy personality.The College Board is an organization that cares deeply about the educational experience of students. This organization is concerned with improving academic rigor around the country and tries to be innovative in its approach to developing educational tools. A typical day consists of multiple meetings with executive level colleagues; we engage in planning different stages of a new program or product. I've learned a lot about the importance of communication and planning, structuring processes so that others can follow work plans effectively, and the importance and power of being proactive and taking initiatives.  I've enjoyed meeting academics from different disciplines and working closely with them to develop academic tools and programs.  I've also enjoyed meeting heads of educational organizations with whom we work collaboratively on developing various educational services. I'm proud of having put together a team of very talented and creative colleagues and working alongside them to develop new programs in the arts and in the global learning fields.The hardest part of the job is to develop new programs quickly and effectively, especially new programs have multiple internal and external dependencies. The most enjoyable part of the job is to work with talented and creative colleagues who care about the students and the teachers we serve. I also enjoy being innovative in my work and constantly learning new information and new skills.Since starting at the College Board I have noticed that happiness is based on your manager. Some managers are very flexible, ""family friendly"" and open minded while others are very by-the-book and firm. These inconsistencies make some departments favored by employees and set a negative tone in others.Limited development due to functional siloes in HR departmentIt was a short and great experience. I graduated in May and found this job in August. As College Board had  lag in Account receivable department. I was part of collection team and helped them in reducing Account Receivable (A/R).A great place to work.  Driven to the mission of equity and access.Great compensation and benefits with even a perk of payment for your kid's college.  Professional and dedicated to their people.I really enjoyed the people I worked with and they were very fair with me.CB is a great place to gain work experience. While although a non-profit, they pay well and offer excellent professional development opportunities.The best part of the job were the occasional perks and my co-workers.Manged team responsible for processing transactions for College Board products and services as well as registrations for professional development workshops. Learned how to navigate fine line between organization as a non-profit mission-driven institution and as a business. Management was professional, receptive to employee ideas and accommodating to reasonable employee needs and requests. Co-workers were very committed to organizations goal to connect students to college success. Hardest part of job: Aligning program policies with operational efficiencies. Most enjoyable part of job: Collaborating with co-workers/colleagues. Passionate intelligent people are abundant within the walls of the College Board.Learned an enormous amount of information regarding educational systems outside the US.  The work of the College Board expands to students who live outside the US but dream of studying at a US institution.  The College Board does thankless work to make that happen.  Good benefits and good people but the adaption of the 'Common Core' will deteriorate the future value of the companyCollege Board is a wonderful company with a great mission.The new leadership team is great. I expect a lot of good things to happen at The College Board in the next few years.As long as you do your job well it is a great place to work. The benefits are unbelievable and a lot of great coworkers!","1,001 to 5,000",Washington,Reston,VA,2016-08-23T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/5f52d53d-fee2-4818-8917-0238f0f2dbe2?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=13,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
