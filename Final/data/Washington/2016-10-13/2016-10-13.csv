475,3528.0,Sigint Geospatial Analyst,"STG, Inc.",3.6,80.0,"The only qualm is that they are a government contractor, which means jobs are less secure feeling than when you work for other companies, depending on the contract you are on. Such is the contracting game.I spent the first two years of my career with this company. I learned a lot. They were always supportive of my education goals.No review needed this is the same company and place of work. this is a great place to work the daily challenges keep things fresh and the people are great to work with.none available - great atmosphere, I really do not have a lot to say it is a good place to work, I enjoyed my Vice President and Manager the most.I have been at STG for 10 years and it has been a pleasure.  I typically work alone and conduct all things security but when I need managements assistance they are always there to help.I am a contractor so there is no real job security.  The team that I work for is nice but not very close knit.  The team at our HQ that I have worked with is a lot more happy and outgoing and regularly do things for lunch or team building events.Things change quickly.  You may be part of that change.  The rank and file are good people.  Management is very fluid and changes often.  May be better with private equity investment... but not likely.STG Inc is a great company to work for. They notice our accomplishments and encourage further training and education. Benefits are great. Supportive management.The only con I have is that being a smaller company, growth opportunity hasn't been possible.worked in a secure environment, checked emails and Remedy/Tickets monitored network traffic. Worked with professional good people.My workday began with saying ""hello"" to my work-group, all of which were very professional in every way.  Also, no real supervisor on site to direct everyone focus toward a common goal.STG had great benefits.  Though being a medium sized company paying attention to politics was important.  I enjoyed my time at STG.STG, Inc. was a great place to work until the recent years. It was a government service company that was constantly changing. Low employee morale.Leadership is out of touch and losing business faster than ever.  Employees are treated poorly and tossed out capriciously.  In many areas, everyone over the age of 50 and all of the African Americans have been forced out or laid off.  In an attempt to keep existing business, salaries are being cut while overhead costs are skyrocketing.- A typical work day is working 8 hours a with zero over time.- I've learn leadership and how leadership plays a very important part in being a team player.- respecting your co-workers and valuing their opinion, -the hardest part of the job  was leaving-the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting different members of the military staff their families and culturesGreat place to work. Great management and coworkers. Flexible schedule. Good benefitsI manage day to day activities of each program assigned to me within my portfolio as determined by the Sector VP for Civil Agencies. Time sheets, invoicing, expense approvals, business development, white papers, presentations, proposal writing are completed as required. As a Sr. Program Manager in this function, I have learnt contract management, proposal writing, tiered processes for qualifying future work, pipeline management ,and the application of IT Service Management concepts (ITIL framework). I continue to provide and  bring new work to the company and pride myself in providing excellent service delivery to federal and private sector clients. My current employer has assembled a wonderful team, that are warm, welcoming, humble, honest, trustworthy, and dedicated to be brief. They are a wonderful group of individuals to work with and for. The most difficult part of this function are contractual terminations. Its always difficult informing letting good people go due to a project being completed. The most enjoyable part of this job are the networking and customer / client / professional relationships developed.  However, the best part of the job is playing a role in the economic growth of small to medium sized business within the DC metro area.Managed team of engineers:Critiqued engineering work, managed schedules, managed sub-contractors, attended coordination meetings.I greatly enjoyed working at Best Western. It was a relaxed, professional environment. I got to work with some wonderful people who taught me so much.I worked closely with Program Managers and Executives to manage projects for the Defense Sector.great pay and off on weekends. always doing something different every dayI have been with this company long enough to see the good, the bad, and now the ugly. What started out as a great pride to work for a company that actually cares about its employees where you feel the family atmosphere when you walk in the door has turned into a place of high turnover of employees, break down in the moral fiber of the company, and a chaotic work environment to say the least.","1,001 to 5,000",Washington,Annapolis Junction,MD,2016-10-13T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/38afc18b-7d25-4c01-af32-b6e47d22d75f?mescoid=1500140001001&jobPosition=30,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
