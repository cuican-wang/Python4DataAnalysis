A lot of room for growth and developmentEverything about this company screams idealistic and driven - CI is a very forward-thinking group with a lot of potential to make a dramatic impact in the realm of international conservation and development. Opportunities for advancement from within are often significant as of late due to high turnover of employees, but they struggle to retain talent and often are reluctant to advance individuals from entry-level to more senior positions without a decent amount of corporate networking.That said, this is a great group and, less a few of the management staff, are excellent people to work with.CI is a great company that has a strong mission and employees that are passionate about what they do, where they work, and the people they help.",,Washington,Arlington,VA,2016-05-08T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/af77ab3d-5a37-487a-813e-f964f808ca38?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
