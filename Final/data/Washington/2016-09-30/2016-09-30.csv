137,3190.0,Data Scientist – Senior,Altamira,3.8,10.0,"Good company, great people.  future is brightWork as a team and each individual contribution is receivedLearned the inner workings of HADOOP, MAPREDUCE, HDFS, SCALA &SCALDINGHardest part of the job....coming up with solutions to the clients problemsjust for working with adults with disabilities you get paid kinda like babysitting. they actually make sure the people that are working are people that can be trusted.Altamira is the merger of Invertix and NearInfinity. One was a services/butts-in-seats company and the other was a straight technology company. Over the last year, there has been a lot of shifting around. They spend a little on R&D but mostly it's onsite services contracts.Altamira, FKA Invertix, has been a great group to work for.  I really don't have any negative information to provide, they always did what they said they would and provided me with ample opportunity.I worked outside the facility. My job was direct support to the individual I was working with, in the community environment.The small company mentality of relying only on those in the 'in  crowd' poisons the atmosphere.  No attempt is made to create a team oriented environment anyone would want to work in.  There is a no awareness of a lack of tech leadership.",,Washington,Springfield,VA,2016-09-30T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/803e3a2c-cd6b-49a1-aeaa-4e8db40815a4?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=7,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
