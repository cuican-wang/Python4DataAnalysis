One thing that stands out at Freddie Mac is that they are very good at building their employees, not only to do well at their jobs, but outside of the workplace through their wellness rewards program and teleworking option.  I recognize Freddie Mac as one of the leaders in developing their employees through numerous vendor and internal training.  They make all their employees and contractors priority one.I was a contractor so my experience may not be representative of most peoples experiences, but it was by far the most difficult companies to work at. The team of 15 analysts had to squeeze into a small room, working 12-17 hour days, we also involuntarily worked weekends. My manager even went as far as to reprimand some coworkers for asking for time on Sundays to go to church. HORRIBLE experience.As a previous team member the company is doing good work in the REO area to assist homeowners.

They promote improvement by providing college reimbursement and health by providing health club reimbursement.  The company's culture is one that attempts to create a close family like environment for  employees by providing monthly events.  They attempt to keep the employees informed by having monthly Townhall meetings and has an open door policy.Management in the Business Rules area of Strategic Delivery demonstrates cronyism on a daily basis.  If you are not one of their 'favorites', they will go out of their way to withhold support and advancement opportunities.  Leadership is poor, at best.  The leadership team understands the technical side of the business but has little to no experience managing people.Big company with lots of opportunities and good work life balance.
