110,3163.0,Data Scientist,CACI International Inc.,3.9,826.0,"I enjoy working in this position, . Working in the Facility Management office new challenges are always turning up.  My typical day consists of tracking and assigning work request  for maintenance that are documented on line. Dealing with internal customers to help with problem solving, or maintenance that may be required. Assist in documentation for projects that requires external contractors to be completed to help the facility run smoothly.Excellent company with excellent benefits.  Everyone was willing to solve any issues within a timely manner.  Upper management:  "" Kudos "".A good company and program to work for, overall good environment for warehouse and supply chain employees with great health insurance and company benefits.The environment is beautiful and people are amazing friendly. I would love to work in this place because there are endless opportunities to grow.The company took over the contract and immediately began removal of experience personnel - after flooding the environment with new people. Very inexperienced personnel.Getting to work on time, greeting my coworkers and preparing to do my job. Which is either starting a new task or finishing up one. I normally  help coworkers  when  need to the best of my ability, then continue my work. Take lunches  and come back to work to finish my 8 hr or more work day.My last 4-5 years I have  been traveling all over the US and over-seas .Pretty good company to work for.  HR, security, job relocation and placement is above average.  A tremendous benefit to CACI are the Program Managers -- the liaisons between corporate and the workforce.  If your PM is good, which mine was, the ability to focus on your job is easy.  If not...Good Education opportunities.Better compensation would be a good addition.Expatriation is a good addition to the contract.Greater opportunity to engage with management.Caci was my first company to work for.They were an excellent organization and they took care of their personnel as well, great company.Better than average management. Company stresses and upholds high standards for integrity and performing quality work. It is diversified and not prone to micromanaging.Training Soldiers on a continuous basis can be challenging but very rewarding. During the working cycle stateside traveling is a frequent event to and from different locations.Manager is incompetent and his business practices are unethical. You will have little to no job security working with this company. Lay-offs are common. The manager has made a bad name for himself here at Crane, IN in the 8 short years he's been around.Provides the environment to support and stretch ones abilities. Employee advancement rests in the individual.  Your high level of success at CACI is directly tied to your skills and dedication and the opportunities provided for career growth.I Typed documents such as correspondence, drafts, memos, and emails, and prepared 3 reports weekly for management. I Opened, sorted, and distributed incoming messages and correspondence. I Purchased and maintained office supply inventories, and being careful to adhere to budgeting practices. I Greeted visitors and determined to whom and when they could speak with specific individuals and I Recorded, transcribed and distributed minutes of meetingsCACI so far has been a stable employer.  It is a good place to start your career.  I do recommend this company.  You are not tied to your work 24/7.Full of blowhards and suck ups. Promotions are based on ability to suck maximum bottom since no real work is ever completed. If you are good at pretending to work and staring at a computer for hours this might be the job for you. Spending time interning for a panhandler would be a better use of time.The setting was relax and fun. You know what you job i and what your goals are everyday. Management sometime was up and down but was willing to working on fixing the problem to the ensure a better workplace.Working for the CACI I was very productive and learned a lot while working in the position.While working in my position I learned a lot on the jobI started with CACI not that long ago. I love the environment. It  feels like everyone is trying to help you.  Great benefits and good healthcare. Overall one the best places I ever worked for.GIS processing with plenty of opportunities for additional training.  Pleasant environment with lots of opportunity for advanced training at college on online.I liked working here for the most part - the people were great and had lots of institutional support and even the benefits were above average. There is much to do within the company for someone who wants to learn new things. It is a major governmental contractor with 14,000 employees or thereabouts. However due the vagaries of the government-contract world most of the office was laid off or furloughed without any notice. We had been expecting years' worth of work but it did not come come to fruition. I do not blame CACI for this necessarily - it could very well have been the fault of another contractor - but in my particular realm of CACI jobs can be on the insecure side.","10,000+",Washington,Arlington,VA,2016-07-15T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/b21cd8b6-c091-4396-83e2-d54f3e86c4ee?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
