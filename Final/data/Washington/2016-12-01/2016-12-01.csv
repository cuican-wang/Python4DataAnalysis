30,3083.0,"Associate Scientist, Microbiology",Canon,3.7,437.0,"canon was a great place to work at wish i could have worked longer. I love my department the warehouse was clean. the food was amazing i just loved everything about it.- Great work atmosphere- Great career opportunity- Great benefits- Great people to work with- Competitive salary- Enjoy working with global customersGood environment Great place to work, excellent benefits. Lot's of opportunities to move to different areas. Indoors.A typical day included confirmation of prior pending sales. Approval of pending credit claims and marketing program claims. Review of specialty area items. Verify emails regarding orders. Correcting or verifying status of order. Respond to dealer, sales or management inquiries. Work on processing returns and documenting conditions and response for approval or denial. Forecasting current sales with potential for meeting designated goals. Submitting trending reports. Completing presentations. Participating in team meetings.This is a great place to work if in need of a job.  Good schedules to choose from, great benefits, laid back culture. The customers called in for ""technical assistance"".  Most were nice. Company goals are very attainable.My only complaint is lack of advancement opportunities which is common with call centers & starting pay is a little low.outstanding, learned a lot, there was a repetition of taking pictures all the time. enjoy with the pay raise was great and the people.Great company, too bad they are moving. I love working here and love the hours and the people. I would recommend this company to anyone who is looking for a career in a different state.Excellent company to work for, professional environment, good benefits. Logistics operations were relocated to their headquarters in New York.Great Canon. Tell you what you need to do to achieve goals. Pay is the only reason why I am wanting to leave but benefits such as health are very good. Atmosphere is nice. Everyone is nice.Do not apply unless you ""NEED"" a job. There is no room for advancement. They do not pay well. Their vacation is horrible. Management does not communicate with employees. The benefits are not good either stay away from this company.there are opportunities to advance quickly with this company and the employees are a little spoiled with a cafe and gym in the building plus a masseuse that comes every other month. management and co-workers were easy to get along with. the biggest con for me is the work, I didn't perform well in a call center environment and there's a lot of phrases that the company wants employees to use on a call and will penalize employees who does not use them. also few bathroom breaks allowed.Good people to work with. You answer incoming calls from customers all day, so of course you will face the basic downsides of working at a call center.  Other than that, they will train you, have good benefits, and it is very hard to get hired from there.  Sometimes it feels good to help customers out, other times it is hard to deal with them.  Management is good. The raises are not that much, but they do give them to you every year.If your desperate and need the job then go for it. Plenty good people there.If you have a family to support then the wage is under the family goal. Unless managers get way more but I dont think its all that much. A lot have stayed and a lot have gone that I knew. This is either family or dont have. Dont forget floor compliance's as with every other call center your gauged more on a minute than how well you kept a customer. If your day consist of you having to do family doctor visits, or lets just say important rolls outside the job. If you explain it to HR they give you some room to do so with good cause. A + for Canon there. Everyone is great to work with and management are not really to blame. They are hovered everyday about someone or changing something.Canon is a great company with a household name in the technology industry.  Good compensation package.  Salary and Commission.Instructed employee's and temp staff of daily needs. Worked with NY for required work and completion dates. Processed all reports including all contact with temp agencies time keeping and payroll information. Worked with packaging venders to create new packaging when needed for projects. Created a Rebox Department and this saves millions of dollars each year as this process is now in the VA facility. Hardest part of job was getting enough temps to complete job requirements to meet all required completion and ship dates. Fun part was designing my own floor plans and stations to run projects.Over all great but top management direction not always clear and decision making can take a long time. Mixed culture environment great but at times causes conflict in the way of business processes.Working at Canon USA is working for a Japanese company.  The culture is evident and it is difficult to navigate.  80% of the work is done by 20% of the employees.  If you work hard and do good, your reward is more work.  If you do nothing and make mistakes, you will just be given less responsibility but these people remain at the company.  I have had friends ask for referrals and I pushed them in the opposite direction.Not a very progressive corporate culture for a company with technology at its core.Canon is a place where you will meet a great number of people from different cultures.  They are a strong technology company but could improve on how their management mentor's people in developing to become successful.- 9-5 job- I have learned a lot of useful skill with Exel and PowerPoint. I have learned to corporate with disatified customers. Pro multitasker. - Overall corporate management is poor. I got along well with my supervisor and boss.- Co-workers are friendly.- The hardest part of my job are the busy season (during the gov't fiscal year)- The most enjoyable part of my job is completeing a task that I could file away and move on from.The job was great.  My favorite job I have ever had as far as the work day goes.  Your day is busy but you they make sure you take your breaks and the day goes by so fast because of it being busy.  A typical day consists of processing lots of packages to deliver to VISA employees as you work at a Visa office that has thousands of VISA employees.  You then deliver the packages and assist with shipping out packages as well.I had a strange American boss who reported to a Japanese boss who would not address the strangeness of his management. He micromanaged and ALWAYS took people's work and edited himself since he had major OCD issues. Again they were not dealt with !","1,001 to 5,000",Washington,Rockville,MD,2016-12-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/83b344b6-5d38-4a61-bae7-190e749095e1?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
67,3120.0,Data Scientist,Leidos,3.8,199.0,"I have mixed feelings. The job was good, but they were always trying to call me in on my off time. The pay was good, but that was negated by the seemingly yearly reduction in benefits. Management turned over in one form or another once every few months in the office I worked in. There wasn't much of a pay increase over time and fewer opportunities for advancement in the company. People seemed to muddle through the day with discontent in the office. It seemed to suck the joy out of some of our coworkers just to be in the office.Leidos is a great place to work. Management is engaged and fellow workers are eager to assist each other. Salary was highly satisfactory. The fact that it was a contract job has inherent risks.Hired and then let go 6 weeks later because of funding. Lied about the contract being good for a full year.Not happy with this company currently.Leidos is a young very diverse company that has difficulty figuring out how to organize itself. Needs more mature SR management and  leadership.Leidos offers a great work life balance. Leidos offers a competitive 401K plan and insurance plans. Leidos also offers annual performance reviews ensuring that you have a way to move up the ladder.Excellent position to help train first responders and help protect the nation from disaster. This is a rewarding position and excellent working conditions.I was my own boss and made my own schedule to the needs of the mission. I learned a great deal about turning in old and no longer useful equioment. Management always ensured you had the proper training to complete your mission. Co-Workers were always there to help with moving any equipment that needed to be loaded into a truck or van. The hardest part of the job was not having enough time to get everything completed. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I had complete control over everything I did.Leidos is not a bad company to work for, they just aren't great either. Leadership is out of touch, but compensation is competitive and the benefits package rivals other companies. Not a lot of room for advancement.Leidos is a pretty standard large size company. I feel the training/mentorship could use some work. I wish there was a stronger connection between middle management and the workers. I don't know if that is the case for most of the contracts that Leidos holds though.Over all I feel like it's a fine company to work for.Normal working place, five days a week 9-5 Monday to Friday. Friendly atmosphere, easy going no pressure, you have to be willing to work hard and help other when they need help.There are lots of potential to move elsewhere within the company.  Benefits provided through work are very generous and easy to take advantage of. Has overall decent job outlook.The company culture is about the employee and the company offers great resources to help with your career and educational goals.There is nothing enjoyable about working for this company. They do nothing to incentivize talented individuals and try to keep them for dirt cheap.I've been working for the company for the last four years and have been enjoying working as a Linguist/Translator with Leidos. It is a great company and provides excellent benefits for employees.A typical day of work includes tracking/monitoring hardware assets from inbound shipments from vendors to de-installation/life cycle replacement.Management is for the most part hands-off of our day to day operations.  High visibility projects will sometimes be monitored by management.I work with a dedicated work force that know their jobs and normally perform tasks in a timely manner.The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that hardware accountability is accurate and complete.Not a good environment to work in.  No support, from your team leader and you are asked to do more than what you hired in for.Working for Leidos has been a great learning experience as I have supported several training courses including hazmat, radiological, and law enforcement courses. Negative aspects include substandard healthcare and also lacks sufficient compensation for everything the job entails.Rewarding whent customer is satisfied and give us kudos.I love to work with this company. If I get opportunity, will love to stay with this company..Poor communication from management and little concern for the employee as long as the company does well.Very little comradery among the team. Everyone is more concerned with trying to stay employed.I enjoy working with LEIDOS, I appreciate the helpful management and work peers. I also enjoy that I was allowed to travel and the internal considerations for job employment.The Management at CACI was awesome, however the opportunities for advancement were very slim.  The benefits were good, and they really do try to place you, however, they do low bids from time to time and does not leave room for greater growth.","10,000+",Washington,WASHINGTON,DC,2016-12-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/c3575fcb-fce8-477e-9604-ca5d278cf3bd?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=7,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
117,3170.0,Data Scientist,"Applied Research Associates, Inc",3.8,19.0,"I have been employed here for 10+ years. I love the company. They care about their employees and try to help them further their careers. They have absolutely EXCELLENT benefits -- health, dental, 401K, and vision.  Their Paid Leave policies are beyond wonderful and are flexible.A bunch of guys that blew stuff up in the desert - Now they are trying to expand their business foot print and have the know how to get it done, but have trouble executing this.Worked with 12 personnel daily ensuring they got assistance from me in equipment checks & accountability, training, and deployment of personnel and equipment.  My co-workers were all active duty Air Force members that were subject to deploy to any location in the world with only short notice.  The hardest part of the job was making sure members were ready to meet military requirements to support our country.  The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing job satisfaction that they were ready and that I made that happen.Our work is mostly research oriented. We conduct experiments sing our equipments depending on the project we are handling and the runs usually go on for 7 hours. Most of our work involves research to find out how to get better results by going through a lot of papers and articles. We are guided by my adviser and Post-Doc who mention our goals and assist us in understanding our experiments better. The hardest part is getting the machine to work properly as it gives trouble from time to time while the fun part is the freedom we are offered. We can conduct experiments with our own ideas provided they are feasible. This has helped us gain a lot by means f trial and error.Outstanding to work for. Great support form all levels of management and branches of the company. As a contractor, I am at a remote site, and have never actually met my supervisors face-to-face, but have any support if needed. They leave you alone to perform your job, and the review/ratings for promotion/pay increase is very fair! As a recently seperated veteran, this company was an easy transition to make. But- with all DoD contracting firms, job security is only as good as the politicians and the needs of the military. No fault of the company- but I got my sequester notice. They are assisting us every step of the way to the last day- and helping to us to find other jobs. Typical day of work at ARA includes little to no communication with/through staff.  Great experiences and work with customers. Coworkers, with the exception of a few, have little to no communication and/or personal skills.  There is little to no appreciation for employees and even customers.  Nepotism and management ""favorites"" ruin the work environment.Great work environment.Learned excellent team collaboration techniques.Management genuinely concerned for the work force.Hardest part of the job was the commute.Most enjoyable part of the job was traveling.Working at ARA allows lots of people interaction with interesting projects being developed by Scientist, Engineers, and Software Developers. The culture is very strict, and based in military/government schools of thought.ARA is a Department of Defense contract firm so I had direct client interfacing while planning military exercises for United States Strategic Command. A typical day included collaboration with other working groups, developing training and exercise objectives and identifying requirements to meet those objectives.  Coordination with trusted agents and other planners to build story lines and integrate those vignettes with the master scenario.Co-workers were other DoD contractors, government civilians and military members with varying skill sets.The hardest part of the job was working with the exercise scripters to integrate smaller story lines.The most enjoyable part of the job was during exercise execution when we got to see the flow of the exercise and how the training audience reacted and worked together to develop solutions to the problem set created.All employees own stock in the company. They have a good benefits and retirement package and are flexible with work schedules.good benefits but an ""eat what you kill"" company;  hard to get good balance of work and outside life.  divisions have had lot of turnover of late with sequestration.  juggle many projects.ARA provides a good solid work environment that promotes learning and growth. All members of the staff that I interacted with were always friendly and professional.Diverse technology, has a strong team with excellent skills and technology for innovative products and projectsGreat environment and benefits. Typical 9-5 job. Pay is good. The managment is understanding of the balace of work and family life. Good stock options and retirement plans.  Interesting subject matter with the military.Testing new machines to upgrade security in the  fight against terrorism.9-5 job. Great work environment and great people to work with. wrong application of QA, hard employer for women in general, difficult to succeed as QA.Each day at Applied Research Associates was different. Being a consulting/contracting firm (dealing mostly with government and military) presented various challenges and projects. A typical day would usually consist of reviewing lab write ups/white papers, preforming a variety of tests, generating lab reports, and finally submitting lab reports.I learned a variety of tasks including (but not limited to) preforming various tests, generating test protocols, generating lab write ups, designing and manufacturing test jigs/fixtures.The management at Applied Research Associates was relatively strict, but still very knowledgeable. They were very strict on meeting deadlines and being under budget, which is completely understandable when dealing with contracts. But it can however make for a very stressful work environment.My co-workers were very knowledgeable and came from a variety of backgrounds and schools/degrees. It was not unheard of for an engineer to work with a physics major. It made for very interesting group dynamics, but also made it easier to generating new concepts by having people from different backgrounds.The hardest part of the job was generating the white papers and lab reports while still meeting the, usually, tight deadlines.The most enjoyable part of the job was the challenge. Every day you worked on something different, it was great for keeping you stimulated and interested in the work you were doing. Each day was a great learning opportunity.","1,001 to 5,000",Washington,Reston,VA,2016-12-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/ca70eab7-8a03-4539-a55c-913c5a74b0cd?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=22,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

With that said the environment was great and the people there were amazing and helpful.The market knows about Novavax's unsuccessful phase 3 RSV trial. Novavax is a great place, where there should still be reason to believe in their programs. It is a great place to work, with a very personable culture. I love the company, and the employees and management. However, they are in a bit of a struggle right now due to lost value after the trial. They did just go through layoffs, and are unlikely to be hiring in the immediate future. I would go back to work there, but right now (Nov'16) would not be the time to start a new position with them.Novavax is a good place to work. They provide relatively good work environment  and benefits. In general, employees get good training and job/life balance is just right.It was a good experience to work there, however, due to the failure of phase II trail, the company is in trouble now and laid off more than 1/3 of their work force.one can typically easily finsh tasks with in the work day. There are lots of chances to improve your skill set and knowledge base. everyone is very supportive and friendly. management are open and willing to talk about how progress is going and ways that you can improve yourself. The only downside to working here is that there are some long days and long nights, but it is very fulfilling when you get a final product.I enjoyed the short time I was at Novavax. Everyone was very helpful, I learned a lot, and gained some great experience. I worked at a comfortable pace everyday and was in control of my hours and when I could break for lunch.I saw people fabricate data to please managment.  Backdating and making paperwork disappear is a daily occupance.   This place is so driven to get sponsorship they are willing to bend basic scientific ethics to get there.Like any Business, the lower management culture was very catty.As a seasoned biotech and PM professional, I can honestly say this company was the biggest disappointment of my career. Please beware!This is a public trade company relocated from North Carolina. Working at the company’s Finance department was very challenging due to SEC reporting and SOX compliance deadlines. I have worked at all tasks of SEC reporting, SOX compliance, month end close, FAS123R, Fixed Assets, Audit and etc. which significantly enhanced my professional skills and knowledge.The hardest part of the job was to meet job responsibilities and deadlines with limited resource.

474,3527.0,Associate Scientist - Clinical/Microbiology Lab,"Microbac Laboratories, Inc.",2.7,23.0,"Laboratory position with faced pace work environment perfect for just out of school hire. Management positions require several years of experience.It is a good job to get your feet wet, I have learned all I can, but there is no room for advancement.  We have a huge turn over rate, I have been there the longest at 5 years.I was employed at Microbac for almost 15 yrs. A typical work day consisted of finding the samples to test that day. Calculate media needed to complete the days samples. Writing up your analysis for the day. I learned a great deal in my time at Microbac such as aseptic technique, method suitability / validation. While I was working in the Food chemistry lab I learned how to work with HPLC and GC. The Managment at Microbac are good smart people but most lack personnel management skills. I had many friends that I enjoyed working with in the Food Chemistry lab as well as the Microbiology lab. The hardest part of the job was the inconsistent hours. Being a contract lab there would be slow times and sometimes we would have more work then the amount of people employed could handle in a reasonable amount of time. The most enjoyable part was always the people I worked with.High speed environment that is detailed oriented. Communication between clients and managers are a must to get work done in a timely manner. Multitasking and time management are important to meet the clients needs.Fun work place with very nick coworker. But lots of time very busywork, need very good organized time schedule. I have been working as a chemist in several companies and have a great chance to get lot of hand-on working experienceThis place is a good place to learn laboratory skills, but is a place that will destroy you if you stay with it to long.  There are some good people and some horrible managementMicrobac is a great place to start fresh out of college when you don't know any better. After gaining experience, I suggest looking to improve yourself. Microbac is a good resume builder, but they don't demonstrate that they care about their employees. Tactics used by management are often demoralizing.Good hours and great group of individuals to work with. The job was not very stressful, management was easy to talk to, I learned how to run the samples and how to mix the solutions for the samples.Must adapt to changing requirement quickly. Gained experience in a wide range of responsibilities.One of the few benefits of working at Microbac is gaining experience to enhance your resume and... get a different job. Another benefit is that you may very well like people you work with, as I met many friendly individuals during my time here. Now on to the drawbacks. You will probably be hired with empty promises of quick advancement, pay raises, reasonable compensation, and steady work hours. Kiss that goodbye. A new hire should expect to be kept at the same pay rate for as long as possible, while amassing more responsibility, and maintaining poor employee benefits. The company in general, and most specific locations are managed poorly. The emphasis throughout the company is profit. Morale be damned. Stay here long enough, and half (or more) of the people you work with will quit or be fired and replaced with someone grossly under-experienced. The work is challenging at first, like any new task, but quickly becomes very monotonous. You will most likely master most of the assigned tasks within a month or two, but will be expected to continually increase efficiency and fidelity. While working there, I did the same set of about 15 tasks every day. Over and over. After working in two divisions over the course of three years, I hated it most of the time from about 1 month onward. I worked with a few great people, but I also dealt with a lot of idiots (from bench level up to President level). If you have another option of employment, TAKE IT. If not, I pity you. Hopefully your hellish existence working here will serve as a catalyst to better yourself.No communication between management and staff.  Staff roles are not properly identified.Microbac is a privately held laboratory services organization where each location has complete autonomy to operate.   The lean nature and independence of the locations creates an environment where the fire-fighting that is normal to a services organization is unsupported by intra-company resources.  This also leaves the organization without the ability to capitalize on operational synergies in an effective manner and struggling to leverage its size to a more profitable and rewarding outcome.  With a relatively young and dynamic workforce the environment is typically upbeat and positive tempered against a high turnover rate.  As a career start, Microbac provides excellent learning to be leveraged to the next career opportunity.On a typical day, I was responsible for testing many dairy samples for customers that regulatory bodies required them to test.  Each day I was also required to test all media that came into the lab that we used for testing to guaranteed sterility, productivity, and selectivity if required.  Probably the hardest part of the job would be remembering all the different tests that the job required us to run.  The best part of the day would probably be when all the analysts in the department would bounce ideas off each other to figure out the best and most efficient way to accomplish something.  My co-workers were all highly educated and fun to work with.  Every one of them were easy to get along with and willing to help you as much as they possibly could every day.This is a good company to start your career however the longer you stay the less appreciated you feel as an employee. I've learned several different test methods however very few of those are utilized. There seems to be a disconnect between management and lab staff often leaving the lab staff in the dark on new projects.It was a great place to work for a while. They are understaffed in some areas and over staffed in others. Gossip central if that is what you like. There is a lot of favoritism that goes on in this company. ""Management"" likes to tell employees that they are all expendable. This brings the moral down. They do not lead from the front and the lab director and assistant manager run from their duties.Very busy everyday. Always had overtime due to constant jobs coming in and very little time to break. Co-workers were great and helped me a lot with the time at work. The best part of the job was having the support of the co-workers. The hardest part was the constant jobs rolling in and no way to finish them all with not enough equipment. The management was fine.When I started at this job it was a great place to work. Everyone worked together for the good of the company and the clients we serviced. As more employees left or where let go and not replaced this made for difficult work environment.If you interview there, look into the eyes of the people who work there and understand that those people were just like just you only about 2-3 years before.You will work 50-60 hours a week just to keep up with what is expected of you. Management is fine with that until they realize the OT is going to kill their bonuses. Then you will only be allowed to work 40 hrs /week causing you to get further and further behind. When you are so far behind that clients call in to complain ( which makes management look bad) you will be back to working 50-60 hours/week.Enjoy.Work starts when I gather all the sample info I need to run for that day. I then gather supplies and start to plug away at data and sample start up. I then repot data by a computer data program and work with my project managers as needed to help keep our customers in the loop. This is a job I enjoy because it is a high pressure environment where customers need results in a fast and timely manor and I feel I do my best work when I now people are counting on me to give a 110%.I really enjoyed working for Microbac Laboratories. The company had at that time GREAT ideas of growth and took care of their employees as well.The Microbac organization has over 20 labs in the US. The Wilson division is a good place to get a job straight out of school to learn a variety of skills.",,Washington,Sterling,VA,2016-12-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/cba1cd24-d001-4746-8376-68da22bf06f5?mescoid=2900515001001&jobPosition=29,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
