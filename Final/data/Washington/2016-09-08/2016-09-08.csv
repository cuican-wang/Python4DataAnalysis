570,3623.0,Senior Research Scientist,CEB,3.3,74.0,"THose with masters or PHDs treated those working towards a graduate degree and just had a BA as if they were not smart enough or qualified to interact with clients.There was one individual who was the reason for 2 people leaving the company and management promoted him because of his knowledge even though his colleagues and CLIENTS were unhappy with the way he interacted with clients.I went in with high hopes & came out nothing but disappointed- specifically with management. The culture is super inmature & management lacked any leadership.Typical day for me would involve attending many meetings and working long hours to ensure all work was completedMy manager was great but was also stretched very thin.  My team was wonderful and I could always rely on them to get their work doneMy work life balance was not great and working while on vacation was the norm.  This does not happen everywhere within CEB though.8:30- 5:30 Job. Great working atmosphere, with great colleagues to help you out if you ever have a problem or question. Management is good, closely work with either an Account management or Sales Executive.  Work life balance is the most enjoyable aspect of the job.It is a great place to start your career I the sales environment. It has continually pushed me out of my boundaries and has allowed me to become a more productive and efficient worker. Having said that, the management there is as all high pressure sales environment. It is an all right position if you don't mind dialing 100 times a day and pitching all day over the phone.The work in the CEB project is amazing, challenging and gives opportunities to be focused but creative every day. From having barely any people we grew to 15 members in the team in three years and completed work volume normally handled by twice as many peopleThe one thing that I have never understood is the lack of possibility to arrange work hours more flexibly and integrate suitable technology. If we would have been allowed to work at least part time from home (50/50) it would be the most ideal project ever.I am glad to have been a part of it and will always cherish itIt's a cool career startup for a recent college graduate. Nice company culture and learning experience. Not for everyone but the right candidate or employee can be successful doing what is expected.Lots of office politics here. Highly dysfunctional. Everything takes lightyears to get done. Processes they use are archaic. Overall, the charity does make a difference in a lot of people's lives. They just need to fix themselves and they will make an even bigger impact.CEB is an ok company. I started there almost a  year ago. Not a lot of room for advancement. Especially after earning my CISSP.Really loved the culture and people at CEB. It's such a great place to learn and grow - you can really do a lot! Management is great, and if you are a hard worker, you can go far.Overall CEB is a great company to work for and to get professional work experience.  They pride themselves on hiring the best of the best, including extremely smart and innovative individuals.The environment is friendly and they offer a great benefits package that is very competitive, however in many departments they lack career advancement.Great company to work for. Salary could be a bit better but the benefits and Paid-time-off are second to none. Positive work environment and great training system. Positive managers and supervisors and everyone is helpful.There are so many brilliant and kind people working at CEB who support organizations around the world with research and best practices yet CEB does not follow its own guidance.  Horrible career pathing, low pay and poor management at the top.Work in my division often consisted of doing the same thing each day but that might have changed since then. The rah-rah culture was not my favorite.Fun but unorganized.  Good leadership in some sections but in other departments there is a lot of confusion.  Work hours are pretty good except they micro manage a lot.I really enjoyed my time at CEB.  However, the travel was over the top and advancement opportunities in the Chicago area are limited or non-existent with corporate headquarters being in Virginia.  Daily activity included cold calling, presenting to C-level executives, managing team.  The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting and talking with executives across all industries.CEB has a great company culture that promotes work life balance. It's a wonderful place to get your bearings, build a foundation, and network. Networking is a must because promotions are clearly based on who you know. Some teams play favorites more then others.Are you (or someone you know) looking for a new career opportunity in the Washington, DC area? If so, I would highly recommend investigating CEB. I have the pleasure of working at CEB and believe it is a great fit for me during this portion of my career. CEB has great benefits and career development opportunities, is true to its values and is committed to its employees.CEB has a young atmosphere. The majority of the employment population are recent graduates. The offices are modern, and if you are willing to ""play politics"", there's room for advancement.You'll learn a lot at CEB and work with some very smart people and even sharper clients. The work life balance is also pretty good. The problem is that the work tends to become extremely repetitive after about a year or two and upward mobility is extremely limited. Furthermore, upper management is still treating CEB as if it were a 200 person firm. Growing pains abound including antiquated performance metrics that handicap the company and stale, groupthink from upper management.Fun place to work for young professionals.  CEB has good training, but the career path is not as clear as they make it out to be.  High turnover.","1,001 to 5,000",Washington,Washington,DC,2016-09-08T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/e554a572-0a97-43ad-8907-ce0ede383310?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=20,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
