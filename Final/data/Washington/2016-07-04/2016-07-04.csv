163,3216.0,Expert Data Analytics Engineer,"SRA International, Inc",3.7,293.0,"Excellent company. Good work environment. Good advancement opportunities.They supported their employees well. Got at least a cost of living raise each year.Good benefits.They really tried to find work for employees who lost contract coverage. They would continue to pay them for a short time and provided them with a contact to help search job opportunities in the company.We recently merged with CSC Gov about a year ago and the company has drastically reduced benefits as well as pay across the board. Annual reviews/raises have not been given for over a year and morale has appeared to have reduced due to thisUntil they were bought out by a larger company they were an amazing company with amazing employees. They knew how to get the job done and in the most efficient way and upper management was always supportive and willing to listen to as well as take on new ideas and concepts to make things better.Fortune 500 company for many years running.I loved going to work for SRA. Each morning I would greet everyone with a smile and a ""Good Morning"" every day. Hoping to put a smile going into their day. All of my co-workers were wonderful, we were a team. We worked and laughed together. The hardest part of my job was letting go of teams do to the loss of a contract. I learned a lot while working for SRA, they had wonder employees to mentor other employees, even management did the mentoring. Everyone was family. I did learn that the better a company treats its employees the better the employee will be for the company.SRA is a good workplace environment.  Management lacks experience in certain areas and compensation and pay is minimal compared to others in the industry.ProsGreat coworkers. Great IT support.ConsHard work, a great track record, and many years of service don't mean a thing. Management is spread so thin they barely have time to do their own job, much less worry about helping you stay employed within the company. While my supervisor swore he'd done everything he could to help find me a position within the company, it was somebody else who alerted me to a position I was qualified for. CSRA might talk a good gameâ€¦ Show MoreAdvice to ManagementStop treating employees solely as a means to profit. In eight years of working with CSRA, I never met my supervisor or anyone else in management. Why talk about the ""CSRA FAMILY"" when you don't even care enough to meet the employees? Or at least be honest. I was no more than a name and a number.Hours at the center are from 9:30a-6p, Monday through Saturday, except Tuesdays which closes at 8p. Great people to work with, but clients would often take out frustrations on employees and management is very menacing. You cannot bring up an issue about management without almost instant retaliation. Somewhat difficult to maintain 40 hrs per week.Suitable for a job but not career wise.  No room for growth.  Difficult to move on to new projects.  Internal hiring system needs improvement. Overall, company employee relations declined after it  was acquired by CSC.very friendly environment, supportive management, busy at work, very helpful team, very lucky to be in that team, challenging work.There is no room for growth. No bonuses, salary increase, employee recognition. HR wants you to work like a slave and not be compensated.  Only concern for them is to make the company look good so they can win contracts.Excellent company, super staff and managers, great benefits, and supportive management. They provide education training, mentoring, and job security. They are worldwide and make career moves easier than most.Worked at SRA for 17 years. ""Lived"" through the process of becoming a publicly traded company and then privatization, downsizing and reorganizing. Original corporate motto was ""Honesty, Integrity And Services"" then it changed to ""Honesty And Services."" Worked with many of the original staff who were recognized experts in their fields but who now have left as culture changed.The benefits were top of the average offerings before it returned to being a private company and corporation restructured. Perhaps SRA will be a great place again to work, discover one's talent and or become a subject matter expert.The Directors Document Records Management system was a project that supported over 400 customers and application users. My responsibility was to support, train, troubleshoot, enhance, issues tracking, requirements tracking, testing, documenting and enhance.  I loved serving our customers.safb location.  SRA appointed a strange micromanager who thinks she knows everything and rude to the point you couldnt work in peace, nobody likes her.  They are now CSRA and always have the same jobs open because nobddy wants to work with this micromanager.Not a very nice place to work.  Very low employee morale.   Terrible managers who are hands-off who routinely undermine and degrade their employees to the customer.  As a result employees have a very negative attitude.  Zero opportunities for advancement.The hours are amazing because management fit them around your schedule. The EAC site are neatly kept and work comfortable. As any other office setting, your co-workers are about the same. However, management will make it as comfortable as possible for everyone. Equipment is well kept and always accessible. When conducting outreach, you are required to use your personal transportation. However, there is mileage reimbursement. Overall SRA is an positive 9 out of 10. Lunch is 30 minutes but you do have two 15 minutes breaks as well. Only problem is dress code. The polo shirts could be a better quality. Bandages can be better quality. Other than that the company is amazing. You do have a gap in work, hopefully this year they can get a year around contract with CMS. Houston North Location always have a great center. The site supervisor is caring, hardworking, and very attentive. She goes over and beyond for her staff. If you do your work, then you can always come back to SRA for a second term or contract.Worked for SRA for more than 9 years and never regret having to work for this company. It allows you to grow and advance your career with a family work atmosphere rather than a stressful work environment.SRA seems like a good medium sized company but I have only been acquired from a different company during a contract rollover.  My experience has been tainted by a manager that does not have clearly articulated goals or expectations.  The corporate culture seems pretty good and the onsite training was great.  I think that if I was in a different environment within SRA, I would feel better but where I am now just seems like a pit that is getting deeper and deeper. I may change my review if I move to a different position/contract but for now I will say that SRA is no worse than any other larger government contractor.SRA used to claim that the company ""hired for a career, not for a contract"". That changed when the company was purchased by an investment firm, and the new dollar-driven management philosophy took hold. All that was good in the old SRA has been gutted by the new owners. The Cyber Practice, a core SRA capability, was disbanded in the name of cost cutting efficiencies. Highly trained, cleared cyber employees were released as contracts came to an end. The company has changed dramatically, with the sole focus being on the bottom line, no longer on the employees.This a great company to work for if you are starting your career. Management is pretty good, the work is challenging at times, and my co-workers are pretty good. However, salary and benifits are not competitive at all. Moving up or moving to a new career can become a bit of a hassle as well. They also do not compensate you will for moving to a new position. I went back to school to start a better career, and when I finally found a new opprotunity with more responsiblity, they did not offer me a raise to take the new position.Being on client site 100% of the time, I hardly ever hear from HQ except to sign the time cards. This company is all about the bottom line, which has become more and more evident in the few years I've been here (cutting benefits; merit increases based on HQ-determined numbers, not your actual performance). They have far too many mid-level managers at HQ that don't actually do...anything. Reward the people that represent the company.Work/life balance is good, but that has to do with site management/client and not the actual company.",,Washington,Herndon,VA,2016-07-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/9e14841b-16d1-4c14-b9b3-ce2ce2496e1b?mescoid=4300761001001&jobPosition=33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
