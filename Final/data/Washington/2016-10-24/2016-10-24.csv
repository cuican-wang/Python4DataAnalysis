129,3182.0,Data Scientist Principal Job,SAIC,4.1,1300.0,"Work for them for over 6 years, great company! Worked on a variety of Coast Guard support contracts. They care about their staff.It was my favourite place. The people, the contracts, the systems we worked on. Fascinating. But these are government contracts and those come with rules and the contracts are sometimes awarded as 1 year with 3 extra years optioned. So carefully charging correctly and staying in POP dates and not charging incorrectly is a big deal. Option years suck because that means your only guaranteed 1 year. They could go somewhere else for the next 3. Every year, your worried about the next option year being approved. It's like working on one year contracts and stressing every year that you might be laid off.Large Company tough to fit into management perspective, not a great situation when it comes to re-deployment, pretty much on your own to find new job.A place to help young people grow. Once you go through schooling and have degree, it's hard to advance. Then you have to look for work elsewhere.My fellow associates were all very responsible and professional enough to make sure we accomplished all of our testing requirements. Everybody pitched in to assist wherever help was needed.SAIC is prime on several contracts so it is easy to go to a different project if you wish, but for a company whose only product is it's people it really does not invest in its product. They cut benefits and then the following year sent out flyer bragging about record profits. That just has not sat well with many employees.nothing out of the ordinary, good work environment, fellow employees were friendly, helpful and professional, work location was close to the house and flexible.Great benefits and wonderful leadership. Enjoyed visits from managers taking us to lunch and spending the time to get to know us. Very forward looking company. Hands off management style.Destroyed chemical weapons while employed. Was a shift supervisor and the job was rewarding. Primarily I made sure that operators were safe while destroying the chemical weapons.boeing is fun you just work a ton of hours if your a contractorthey say that there is no prejudice towards contractors or Direct hires but that is false....they will treat you like dirtGood company to work for.  Managers take care of their people.  Great opportunities for networking within and outside of the company.  Lots of opportunities to change work locations to move around.I was lucky enough to  work for SAIC on the same contract for 5+ years.  The pay was excellent and the travel was exhaustive at times, but rewarding.  If I could, I would stay with SAIC but our contract was not renewed and the Company does not have any positions open for my skill set.SAIC is, in my opinion, primarily focused on getting the job done and protecting their resources - the people that work for them. Typically at work, people work with one another on complex problems and the atmosphere seems open to others asking questions.Really the only down side of the management is that they're intent on starting new initiatives to benefit employees, but there is often little follow through.The most enjoyable part of the job is when the customer expresses their gratitude and delight at the job we've done.Contact management mentality with personnel assigned and managed by assigned organization, in this case U.S. Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC).I was employed by SAIC but was contracted out for eleven years to SIMS and JRDC contract did not have much to do with SAIC except for one or two times a year. It was an ok place to work the benefits could be better.The SAIC team that I worked with in Charleston, SC took on projects in a team orientated manner.  Most work performed had input from other team members and project managers. This helped in preventing errors in projects and put more confidence behind the product. Also, management was good about being flexible when it came to needing time off for family, etc.. Overall my time at SAIC was a pleasant experience and I was able to learn, take on new tasks, and grow within the company.work Monday threw Friday 8 hours days start early A.M. when I'm home I typically test equipment an build the system up before we send them out on road before we install them into vehicle's. I travel all over united states to different military bases. Typically about five to seven guys who go on the road.  we  make sure after we install the system into vehicles we make sure it is operational then we train an teach military guys that the system is up an running an answer any question that they have.Working in a small dynamic engineering team, we have set product goals to meet quarterly. I work closely with a group of engineers that are motivated and innovative, like me. The culture of the company is very cohesive. I have enjoyed working here with much gratitude, and I hope to accrue the same with a new company in the mid-west where my parents reside.I was able to walk into a great paying job doing the same GIS tasks and further my professional career. I will never regret my decision to join SAIC.At SAIC I have learned a lot about working with customers and working as a team. There are many high quality people with a lot of skills which I work with.The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to work with a group of professional people and knowing I am performing work for the military.SAIC is a relatively large company in my program office.  The only gripe that I would state is that the HR is not extremely helpful when dealing with their employees.  Instead of typed emails they're much more likely to send a PDF which does not always assist.","10,000+",Washington,Reston,VA,2016-10-24T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/a5471939-1b84-4886-bc6a-27420d454122?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
