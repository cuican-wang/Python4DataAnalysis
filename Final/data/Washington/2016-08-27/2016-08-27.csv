142,3195.0,Data Scientist,Grant Thornton LLP,3.6,126.0,"I've been with the company over a year and everything  was great till company is considering to out source there IT. It is a great place to work for the time being.During my time at GT i was exposed to both public and private company financial statement audits. I was exposed to many different areas of the financial statement auditing process. This is a good place to start a career if you work under the right people.Many years since I left, so don't know what it is like now. At the time it was undergoing significant change and was searching for its identity. My colleagues were generally a smart and dedicated group.Too much travel for me and poor recognition for the non- client facing staff.The management was supportive but in many cases was pushed against the budget which limited learning opportunities. Overall, it is a great place to start your career and gain work experience.The people are great, and GT definitely relies pretty heavily upon your commitment to your coworker.  It's public accounting; you work crazy hours with a solid annual compensation....just never calculate your per hour rate.Grant Thornton is a great place for young professionals to gain experience in a variety of industries.  There is the long hours and heavily workload you would expect from public accounting, but overall a good place.Worked in the Property Tax Department. Helped prepare property tax returns for various states and depreciation calculations. Also helped prepare federal forms 1040 (Individual) and 1041 (Trusts) as well.I will forever be grateful for the opportunities and experiences I gained while working at GT. Working with clients from different industries doing a myriad of work was extremely valuable.Grant Thornton, Cleveland was a great place to work.  Unfortunately, there were changes within the IT department that has resulted in me having leave a great organization and group of people.Management is trying hard to make it a fun place to work. Perhaps they're are trying too hard, as it becomes a distraction with multiple ""feel good"" e-mails.This company works it's employees hard as is typical of public accounting firms (50-60 hours a week).  This company is a larger firm, so employees will be specialized into service areas (Audit, Tax, Services).  Audit will involve regional travel.In general there is high turnover due to the hours and travel.  This provides opportunities to move up in the company.Grant Thornton has been on a journey that focuses on its culture and people over the past fiscal year and it is making a positive difference to the firm overall. If they continue to make strides with this initiative and keep people engaged, GT will be phenomenally successful.Excellent experience,  This was a great experience.  I worked as a federal consultant.  I really enjoyed it.  My clients were highly satisfied with my work.Great place to work.  Employees are like family.  Great work life balance.  Great IT department.  I would highly recommend.I really enjoyed the time working for Grant Thornton. Thanks to Grant Thornton opportunity I have experience and a good knowledge in the cycle of business personal property tax, and business real property.Work/life balance is extremely important to Grant Thornton and they are very flexible with schedules.The company is going through many organizational changes so what is coming remains to be seen.I supported the CIO and his Executive Leaders. I worked side-by-side with his full leadership team. They drove a wonderful culture of collaboration, professionalism and understood well what work/life balance was all about. The atmosphere in the department was positive and I believe that was a huge contributor to their success. Good leadership is key to success.The company was built by a very hard working woman who values her staff and treats them as family.  As in most jobs that I have been given the opportunity to place my foot in the door, the sky was the limit with this company.  They valued my opinion and gave me free reign to submit my ideas for the betterment of the company.Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop.Resolving administrative issues by coordinating, preparation of reports, analyzing data, and identifying solutions.Pros: Lots of exposure to different types of clients, industries and accounting policies; typical to move from client to client every 2-5 weeks in the first year; friendly co-workers; lots of upper management change and company leadership people and culture changeCons: long hours, tedious/monotonous work, if you don't like accounting, it is a struggle; as an auditor, clients don't welcome your presence; high turnover and not enough training or supportOverall, GT was a good company to work for and is where I gained the most valuable experience in my field. Work life balance was sometimes not considered by managers and was often a challenge.",,Washington,Alexandria,VA,2016-08-27T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/f1ef9e31-3bb5-4a20-96c8-21d2046dbd97?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Learning new security process. Learning new project manager. Get a long and work well with my co-workers.Greet Customers I enjoyed working around military etcGood managementPersonally I worked at NSA for 2 years and it is not a recommended place of work by myself, due to the very short breaks, un-appreciation and lack of a health safe environment, if you do end up working here, ask for a RESPIRATOR! preserve your health.A very friendly atmosphere where I was able to perform at a high level due to the excellent training I received early on.Fast pace environment, Learned all mode of transportationLegally informed DOT rules and regsI  loved working at NSA, of course there were long days but it was fun and we were busy so that made the day go by fast. A typical work day i would go in pick up my order list and go to my desk separate them and pick the product from the floor then pack and ship the product. Everyday was usually a busy day. Because my father was part owner of the company the manager didn't really like me but i didn't let keep me from doing my job. I got along with most of my coworkers of course you know in every company theres always a trouble maker or someone who don't like you but other then that i got along with everybody. The hardest part of the job i would say some of my coworkers were very lazy and didn't do there job which made it hard for me to do mine. I loved going in everyday Because it was fun and i liked what i did. I i liked the security of the job and knowing that i would always have a job and benefits.I have played softball since I was a little girl so still staying connected with the sport is a dream!  Its only during the summer and only on weekend.  I try my best to umpire all that I can because i love being outside and working with these young ladies!Supervisor's unbearable- Verbally abusive and unprofessional.  A typical day was a major marathon.  Had to literally run to each work station all day and provide all the necessary materials.  However a part of me still loved all the different thing's I did.  Creatively it was stimulating.  I love to sew.We were not allowed to talk.  So getting to know people was hard.Arrive 15 minutes prior to clock in time  . A  brief talk with supervisor and obtain assignment for shift. This can mean quite a variety of assignments and types of machines I could be running for the shift. Report to job site and converse with co-workers/worker about job specifics. Clock in and start job with packet.The hardest part of the job is keeping a machine producing perfect parts with a human at the controls.The most enjoyable part of the job is that I learn something new everydayThere were no typical days, I would just assist with various projects. My mangers were very flexible with my school schedule.NSA is a great organization for those seeking to increase their abilities as a public speaker. Very insightful and valuable information is presented by established speakers from various parts of the United States.Clock in and start scanning finished product on single ship line 2 and 4. When order shipments are complete we build product according to inventory level.Learned how to read blueprints. Use micrometers, calipers, depth gauges, and set up machine's. My co-workers were fine to work with. The hardest part was standing all day with poor air ventilation. The best part was my co-workers.Although the owner was great, his management team lacked education and knowledge to run a once small company effectively in todays world. Therefore there was no room to grow because the management team were all ""friends"".No work dealing with Logistics, only Intel. Had other personnel that handle logistics.",,Washington,Fort Meade,MD,2016-08-27T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/542de223-7f6a-4977-8cae-3b1e79b12037?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=26,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
