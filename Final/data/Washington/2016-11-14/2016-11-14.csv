611,3664.0,"Senior Scientist, Microbiology","Canon U.S.A., Inc.",3.7,437.0,"canon was a great place to work at wish i could have worked longer. I love my department the warehouse was clean. the food was amazing i just loved everything about it.- Great work atmosphere- Great career opportunity- Great benefits- Great people to work with- Competitive salary- Enjoy working with global customersGood environment Great place to work, excellent benefits. Lot's of opportunities to move to different areas. Indoors.A typical day included confirmation of prior pending sales. Approval of pending credit claims and marketing program claims. Review of specialty area items. Verify emails regarding orders. Correcting or verifying status of order. Respond to dealer, sales or management inquiries. Work on processing returns and documenting conditions and response for approval or denial. Forecasting current sales with potential for meeting designated goals. Submitting trending reports. Completing presentations. Participating in team meetings.This is a great place to work if in need of a job.  Good schedules to choose from, great benefits, laid back culture. The customers called in for ""technical assistance"".  Most were nice. Company goals are very attainable.My only complaint is lack of advancement opportunities which is common with call centers & starting pay is a little low.outstanding, learned a lot, there was a repetition of taking pictures all the time. enjoy with the pay raise was great and the people.Great company, too bad they are moving. I love working here and love the hours and the people. I would recommend this company to anyone who is looking for a career in a different state.Excellent company to work for, professional environment, good benefits. Logistics operations were relocated to their headquarters in New York.Great Canon. Tell you what you need to do to achieve goals. Pay is the only reason why I am wanting to leave but benefits such as health are very good. Atmosphere is nice. Everyone is nice.Do not apply unless you ""NEED"" a job. There is no room for advancement. They do not pay well. Their vacation is horrible. Management does not communicate with employees. The benefits are not good either stay away from this company.there are opportunities to advance quickly with this company and the employees are a little spoiled with a cafe and gym in the building plus a masseuse that comes every other month. management and co-workers were easy to get along with. the biggest con for me is the work, I didn't perform well in a call center environment and there's a lot of phrases that the company wants employees to use on a call and will penalize employees who does not use them. also few bathroom breaks allowed.Good people to work with. You answer incoming calls from customers all day, so of course you will face the basic downsides of working at a call center.  Other than that, they will train you, have good benefits, and it is very hard to get hired from there.  Sometimes it feels good to help customers out, other times it is hard to deal with them.  Management is good. The raises are not that much, but they do give them to you every year.If your desperate and need the job then go for it. Plenty good people there.If you have a family to support then the wage is under the family goal. Unless managers get way more but I dont think its all that much. A lot have stayed and a lot have gone that I knew. This is either family or dont have. Dont forget floor compliance's as with every other call center your gauged more on a minute than how well you kept a customer. If your day consist of you having to do family doctor visits, or lets just say important rolls outside the job. If you explain it to HR they give you some room to do so with good cause. A + for Canon there. Everyone is great to work with and management are not really to blame. They are hovered everyday about someone or changing something.Canon is a great company with a household name in the technology industry.  Good compensation package.  Salary and Commission.Instructed employee's and temp staff of daily needs. Worked with NY for required work and completion dates. Processed all reports including all contact with temp agencies time keeping and payroll information. Worked with packaging venders to create new packaging when needed for projects. Created a Rebox Department and this saves millions of dollars each year as this process is now in the VA facility. Hardest part of job was getting enough temps to complete job requirements to meet all required completion and ship dates. Fun part was designing my own floor plans and stations to run projects.Over all great but top management direction not always clear and decision making can take a long time. Mixed culture environment great but at times causes conflict in the way of business processes.Working at Canon USA is working for a Japanese company.  The culture is evident and it is difficult to navigate.  80% of the work is done by 20% of the employees.  If you work hard and do good, your reward is more work.  If you do nothing and make mistakes, you will just be given less responsibility but these people remain at the company.  I have had friends ask for referrals and I pushed them in the opposite direction.Not a very progressive corporate culture for a company with technology at its core.Canon is a place where you will meet a great number of people from different cultures.  They are a strong technology company but could improve on how their management mentor's people in developing to become successful.- 9-5 job- I have learned a lot of useful skill with Exel and PowerPoint. I have learned to corporate with disatified customers. Pro multitasker. - Overall corporate management is poor. I got along well with my supervisor and boss.- Co-workers are friendly.- The hardest part of my job are the busy season (during the gov't fiscal year)- The most enjoyable part of my job is completeing a task that I could file away and move on from.The job was great.  My favorite job I have ever had as far as the work day goes.  Your day is busy but you they make sure you take your breaks and the day goes by so fast because of it being busy.  A typical day consists of processing lots of packages to deliver to VISA employees as you work at a Visa office that has thousands of VISA employees.  You then deliver the packages and assist with shipping out packages as well.I had a strange American boss who reported to a Japanese boss who would not address the strangeness of his management. He micromanaged and ALWAYS took people's work and edited himself since he had major OCD issues. Again they were not dealt with !","1,001 to 5,000",Washington,Rockville,MD,2016-11-14T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/cd8f6418-3bf2-476b-a24b-c0adeb75cf18?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=26,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
