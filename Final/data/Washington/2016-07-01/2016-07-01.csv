304,3357.0,Geospatial Intelligence Analyst,Intergraph,4.0,29.0,"Great place to work. Fun environment with lots of learning and daily challenges. The work experience i have ever worked for. Paid vacation and Holidays. Very responsive to my requests and answers in a timely fashion. Work is very easy and challenging at the same time. Very stress free environment. Great co-workers and overall teamWent through several lean years only to watch the company pour millions into a new building in order to attract younger, cheaper employees.  Existing employees get little to no advancement opportunities and about the only thing to look forward to is a cost of living raise. There is little upward or even lateral mobility in the company.There is little real long term direction in the company with not much to look forward to except meetings, meetings and more meetings.The benefits package has also consistently gotten worse year over year.Intergraph is not custom to change and new challenges.  The tier 1 analyst are use to custom ways of operations, and management allows it.  No one is held accountable for his/her actions, and management does not step up to manage responsibility or change.  The most enjoyable part of the job is building rapport with the analyst and enforcing change and better business practices however, it takes a team to accomplish these actions and not just one person.  I learned if everyone is not on the same page of new challenges/change, it can be a hostile environment which turns into  what is and not capable of accomplishing its goals.Sales driven culture.  Project Managers have limited chances of success.  Work from home is a positive.  The professional services organization is immature.  Cumbersome back office processes.Enjoyed my last position at Intergraph because it provided exposure to a number of customers each with their own challenges.have was very hard during my inception of my job career and it was also much knowledge growing process and I got time to learn new technology like salesforce, HTML .Interesting place to work. New building is nice and very open. There's not much room for lateral movement/advancement. Company is willing to pay for you to complete you masters program (with some restrictions). People overall are quite friendly. Upper management are personable for the most part and easy to talk to. Has a cafeteria and barista on the terrace level along with a pool table, ping pong tables and foosball tables.Great place to work and a supportive management.I enjoyed the environment and had a fantastic boss who was supportive cared for her team. I would recommend working for Intergraph.I am glad that I am a part of Intergraph. Friendly environment with supportive management . A good place to start career with.Decent Company to work for. Not much room for advancement. Great for entry level positions. You will wear several hats.I enjoy working here for the most part, but there is a lot of politics and bad management decisions based on politics. The pay is also much lower than most companies.Good place to work.  Management needs to do better in keeping moral up at job.  More classes are needed to keep you abreast on ever changing work structure.Shift started worked on collecting and entry the data from my part of a nautical chart. I learned how to read nautical charts. The management was hard to approach the cartographer where easy to talk to if you had a problem with the chart you where working or could not identify something. My fella co-workers where easy to talk to and helpfully if they had a section of the same chart you where working on to see if you could read off there's.The hardest part is you have no access to help from the cartographer at night then getting trained for the next step of the job and begin dropped in to it with no help.learning how read nautical charts was fun.This was a great company to work for. I had several opportunities to grow early on in my career. I learned alot about Professional Services Management and working with external customers.Shipping and receiving, check in material, duplicate discs, assembled material for kits, labeled and boxed material for shipping, received material for computers.Great people, frequent food days and activities. Good location in Madison is easy drive from Huntsville. Management goes above and beyond for those in need, and keeping employees happy.  Insurance premiums are keep low.Very good place to learn when new things come up, Helpful team when an issue you struggle with. Nice people in office complex.I take inbound calls from hospitals, care centers or rehab centers and i assist them with our program if they have issues with working in it. I learn that everyone is different. The hardest part of my job is trying to figure out what the issue is that they are having if I can't fix the issue I escalate it to my Tier 2's. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I speak with all kinds of people and I get to help them in assisting them with their issues.Really enjoyed working with a great team of people.  I worked in the DC area with strong support from the software developers located in Huntsville, AL.  Great people in both DC area and Huntsville area.I only worked at intergraph as a temporary employee on a temporary assignment. It was an excellent experience.I used Intergraph for several years I find it to be a very user friendly","1,001 to 5,000",Washington,McLean,VA,2016-07-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/4ee13d57-85aa-4b8f-971a-8dc51d3e3e5f?mescoid=1500140001001&jobPosition=34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
