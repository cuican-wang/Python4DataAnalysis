89,3142.0,Data Scientist 3,Northrop Grumman Corporation,4.0,2200.0,"I learned a lot about fingerprints, understanding USCIS immigration paperwork and procedures. Worked with a high volume of people in a fast paced environment. Everyone was great to work with and would help each other when possible.Grumman used to be a very good company to work for lately New Management transitioning from California to Florida the management really does show appreciation to the employeesI worked at NG on the VITA/COV project. This project was somewhat negative in that all three major entities (NG, VITA, State agencies) distrusted and disliked one another which made meetings, strategy and planning extremely tedious and painful.The work, however, was strategically challenging and enjoyable, and the staff was mostly great to work with.I would no recommend NG if you are under a contract. As a direct hire, they seemed like quite a nice place to put down roots if you could handle the pace.I enjoyed working at Northrop Grumman. The work was challenging and interesting. Management was helpful and communicated well. My colleagues were friendly and helpful.Working in the B-2 aircraft depot I tested and verified that all systems were functioning before flight. During build process, troubleshot systems that are not working. While working in the depot I learned the B-2 aircraft as a whole. When I worked in engineering, I was responsible for my specific box. now I know the aircraft as a system. I have never worked with such an amazing team of people before. I looked forward to going to work every day. my co-workers contribute to that.The hardest part and the most enjoyable is trying to fix a system that is not working.I already reviewed this company. This program will not allow me to pass up this part of the process of applying for a job. And I already did it once.The work is rewarding overall but the Management leaves quite a bit to be desired in some of the departments. Depending on the person and the Manager is whether you can even get advancement. By this I mean, your work doesn't matter, it's the person themselves that counts and not the work.I learned so many things working for Northrop Grumman. I was able to learn how to do sheet metal work and SMAW welding. Highlt recommend this company. Excellent benefitsThis is the best company I worked for. Great pay. Great work place. Great benefits. Great training. Great lanes for advancements. Great job projects. Many different work locations to select from.The company has good benefits overall.  I was present on a project that replaced the PM with someone barely out of school.  Lack of understanding of Client caused a loss of contract.Excellent for technology education and advancement into shipping, space programs or a military career.  This companies in field hands on training process is the one of the better ways for skilled labors to achieve a certificate of completion while being paid for an honest days work.I enjoyed working there. Wish the company was more involved in the community especially in the Oklahoma City Area. Good job security depending on the program.Management at the office constantly had hands tied in assisting people under them by their managers. The ability for advancement of job or work environment was not there.NGC has made a lot of progress under current leadership. Definitely heading in the right direction as far as sales and technology go. Very talented top management and overall a good place to work.The pay scale is low and layoffs are a part of culture there.  If you take a job here, don't expect longevity.  The production manager's leadership style leaves a lot to be desired.  Seems to be okay with categorizing employees based upon gender.I really liked working there because the job(s) were interesting and the people are great. the hours are good and they have an employee gymcompany was fined for pesticide spraying and never compensated any injured employees. Managers were fined and severely warned for repeated wrong behavior but never terminated or disciplined.I loved working for the company as well as the people.Definitely room for advancement in the company, and diversity is very well important and acknowledged.Management only listens to management.  There are benefits in working for a large company.  There is an atmosphere that it's easier to get ahead because of who you know and not what you know.I support a very small team of technical writers and testers.  We sit together daily and communicate all day discussing work issues.  The atmosphere is extremely present.  I am not only a supervisor but a key contributor.  The hardest part of my job is delivering unpleasant reviews or terminations to staff because of budget cuts.  I enjoy the team and the team atmosphere.  It is a pleasure to come to work with seasoned professionals who love their job.I feel like I lost a family. The site managers looked out for its people, and we did our best to make it work for all of us.  Like all sites, it wasn't perfect, but we all knew what had to be done, and we had a team spirit going on (everybody accomplishing their duties and responsibilities). --- We all got the job done, and help one another to make sure everything got done, and to make sure we kept the Air Force satisfied. --- Yes, a family with some ups and downs, but what I sense today is that we have lost a key thing in business today - friendship & loyalty, but nothing last forever. Some employees I consider good people, which I sought their advise and again friendship. Maybe I will find that again.","10,000+",Washington,Falls Church,VA,2016-11-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/c3e9fd4c-9b39-43d1-8945-cfe5c9a575ad?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=29,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
