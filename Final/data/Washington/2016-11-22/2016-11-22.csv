17,3070.0,Statistician III,Bowhead,4.1,25.0,"Good company to build up work ethics for morale, interacting with different  character, looking forward to get a chance to work for them again in the future.Nice people to work for. Very open and positive management team. Co-workers were good to work with. Management team came to visit often.Friendly environment place to work and enhance your knowledge . I gathered a lot of experience from Bowhead and learned the value of interactions between different societies.Bowhead may be a great place to work if you work at one of the contract locations.  Working at headquarters in Alexandria, VA, is a different story.  The CEO, formerly the office manager in Lexington Park, who is for some reason adored by the shareholders in Barrow, micromanages everything, is quick to cast blame when something goes wrong, plays favorites, and is generally vindictive.I love learning something new every day.. great environment to work in. No worries about work there's plenty. Everyone has a good attitude.typical work day is steady work i learned soldering management is nice coworkers r great nothing hard about my job just time consuming and i enjoy my workgood company to work for. works with you on problems you may have. will work to keep you having a job.  co workers are great  team of peopleGreat work force team, give them a thumbs up.Learned that I didn't like being Part-time-on-calland thought hourly rate should had been higher.typical work day is steady work i learned soldering management is nice coworkers r great nothing hard about my job just time consuming and i enjoy my workI began working for this company shortly after I retired from the military.  Throughout my time with this company I was able to learn so much valuable information.  The company was very good to their employees.  I enjoyed the experience and training they offered.  This job gave me the opportunity to travel.This is one of my first jobs, and I feel that it is one of the best IT companies to work for. The people are so helpful and we all work as a team to accomplish tasks. I couldn't have asked for better opportunity to display my skill level.Overall working for this company is ok. They are close to as good as it gets in this line of business. The people make it tolerable.none I don't have nothing to say about the company ..Just is a good company to work for thanks BowhaedA typical day at work includes, researching part number, taking type 8 confirmations, controlling major end item and secondary programs.The senior management is great, however not everyone gets along well. There are still some little kingdoms that exist. Also Bowhead is setup like no other company I have ever worked for in the past when it comes to IT & trusting employees. There is a family atmosphere that is promoted by senior management but gets lost at the director level. At times it seems even presidents are powerless to get something done. All in all my only complaints would be the healthcare benefits and IT.Was simply contracted through them, so very little direct contact through the company. No complaints.my typical day consist of arriving 10 minutes early,then receiving part in from delivery that day and storeing them away,also consoladate and filling pick orders for the next day.Benefits are not so great, but the pay is decent.  Job culture is awful, but that has to do with where this company is located, not so much the company itself.managements are very supportive and friendly through out the whole process of employment.Great people to work with and for.  Good learning experience, benefits are good, and the travel is great.  The hardest part of the job is being on the road (family members) but it works out.  Retired Army and I love working with soldiers of all branchs, makes the job a lot more enjoyable.I enjoyed working for the company. Looking for something to challenge my knowledge and ability to better myself in my career.",,Washington,Washington DC,DC,2016-11-22T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/statistician-iii-job-washington-dc-dc-us-176554456.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
26,3079.0,GIS Developer,Quotient Inc,3.0,4.0,"Typical day consists of working with the sales team, investigating any issues that came up regarding shipping, incorrect invoices, etc.  I process and distribute reports, assist the Office Manager with coordinating meetings/sales events.  I learned that communication is key to be productive.  Worked closely with the Office Manager and the President of the company (the only 2 in the office).  The hardest part is communication between our office and our other US office in NC.  The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with people and being able to work independently.An advantage of working for a company this size, is that they actually listen to their employees. if you want to work for a company that cares, work for Quotient. They just did a major overhaul (improvement) of the benefits package (health insurance, disability, retirement, etc), and after asking input from their employees. They have a very pleasurable work environment, and staffed with smart people.  Quotient will get you the tools you need to get your job done without hassle.keep up the good work, you have a strong foundation for todays company, and the future. companyI enjoyed working for Coupons.com as a contract Copywriter. I learned a lot through this position that will help me in future roles.

78,3131.0,Senior Data Scientist,Snagajob,3.5,6.0,"It was a very challenging job. Calling 80 prospects a day could be very stressful and that is why I think the fun culture and activities at Snagajob were so important. I really enjoyed the people I worked with and the office building was full of fun things that allowed you to escape the daily grind when needed. There was not a lot of job security with my position, but the company took very good care of its employees. I was constantly challenged with this position and I enjoyed using my problem solving skills to make sales and achieve success. Everyday was a little different and I enjoyed the different classes that were offered to us to enable us to live more fulfilling lives and become more valuable employees.Snagajob has a very strong culture and mission statement which makes a huge difference in our lives as employees and serving the jobseekers and employers nationwide.This is one of the greatest employers that I ever had.  The company culture is very conducive to success.  At the same time, everyone is accountable for their actions.Your job is not secure and management doesn't know what they are doing. The company is spending more than it is making which is leading to lay offs and other people moving on to find better jobs. Not the great place to work as advertised.Great atmosphere, great people, all around fun place to work.A typical day at snagajob would include coming in to work; logging on to your computer and expecting your manager to ask a boat load of questions about your evening.It was nice to have the freedom to complete projects freely, however, I wish I was able to work on more advanced projects.",,Washington,Arlington,VA,2016-11-22T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/94e6cc70-6df5-41f5-84e2-8c0d0b34d425?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
