99,3152.0,Counterterrorism Communications Data Scientist,OBXtek Inc.,3.0,4.0,"Was laid off due to performance issue but given no verbal or written documentation explaining what the issues were. I just got a call one morning from PM saying I am off the contract due to the Fed's sayingI was not training up fast enough. Two things here went wrong. 1) I should have been counseled by the PM prior to being notified. 2)The PM should have investigated the issues and not let the Fed's influence them as I don't work for the Fed's I worked for OBX.It is not up to a Fed to say who goes or who gets hired it up to the contract.I actually liked the job and it was a up training for me but it certainly was not out of my realm of knowledge. I was actually doing 70% of the job in the short amount of time.All I can say is this is a horrible company to work with and for.  AVOID!.  Owner hires Project Managers that don't know a thing about Federal contracts or any experience with Information Technology.  Saw a complete turn over of staff due to the mismanagement of the Project Managers lack of experience with Gov Contracts.  Had numerous complaints to the owner of the company but was told he can't touch the project manager due to a contract they had with him.  I saw 1 co-worker forced to be fired by the Gov Contract agency due to PM mis-mismanagement and 1 was written up for providing passwords that the PM requested even though the PM had not been PIV'd, he should not of even been allowed in the building............I realized quickly upon joining OBXtek that I had an opportunity to roll up my sleeves and be part of real team of professionals. Hard working and very smart people who legitimately take pride in their work. I am looking forward to working with this team again and wish them the best as they grow!I just started at OBXtek and couldn't be happier.  Ignore the negative press.  Ignore the negative internet chatter from their competitors.",,Washington,"Washington, DC",DC,2016-08-31T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/c86558f8-5006-4ab9-ad85-a4c8333690db?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=4,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
