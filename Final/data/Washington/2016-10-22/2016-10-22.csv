439,3492.0,SAS Programmer,NETE,3.0,3.0,"I was given many opportunities at NETE that I otherwise might not have had access to.  Everyone was very friendly, collaborative, and willing to work together (sometimes long hours) to complete projects.  I am lucky to have been exposed and trusted with taking on new projects.- The management is highly unorganized and has no flexibility whatsoever. - They ""ask"" you to come on weekends to help out with work. It is not ""required"" but everyone is worried that it is not a ""good look."" - Stingy and greedy. They only care about making more money as a company and gives no attention to their employees. HR is supposed to be in charge of a lot of these things, but turn-over rate just within HR is crazy. Employees don't know the HR people and HR people don't take the time to know the employees. So, it's very awkward and unproductive.- No structure/philosophy/corporate value. Anything and everything that will bring in money, they will do. They don't care about your values/work-life balance.- No structured performance review system. This may be good for some people, but for those who are rockstars, there is no motivation. Apparently you have to work your butt off to just get CEO's attention and then you will get promoted...after years.DO NOT WORK HERE.I used job as my step stone. Never planed to continue as a carrier. But learn a lot about marketing, sales & met lot of people.",,Washington,Rockville,MD,2016-10-22T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/44b464a9-7cdf-404c-8610-c590ef63e695?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=29,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
