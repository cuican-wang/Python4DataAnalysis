74,3127.0,Data Scientist,Humana Inc.,3.7,2100.0,"quite a productive experience, management is superb and very professional atmosphere.  A very fun loving and easy going place to be inI have had some great managers, one's who push you to advance and move up in your professional life.  There is room for advancement dependent on management.  I have also had a not so positive experience with management.  The work at home option is amazing, traveling for the company is also another great experience. I did learn that once I reach the peak of my career, always be willing to teach the person after you.8am to 6 or 7pm - common but it helps knowing you are doing the right thing for our customers.I learned a LOT about claims, Medicare, medical records, grievances, appeals, investigating healthcare providers.The vast majority of management do a great job in communication of goals and how to accomplish a successful career.My last role was difficult since it was ""on the job""/teach yourself type of training.Meeting great friends and mentors. A great understanding of Medicare and passing that knowledge to others.I genuinely like helping people. Working with the elderly population teaches patience, communication skills, and problem solving methods. The hardest part of my job is when i am rarely not able to meet the customer needs. The most enjoyable part of my job is the many members lives I touched over the 8 years I have worked here. Providing members with the health plans they need are of great importance, I educate them so they can enjoy their healthcare experience.They do not care about their employees. It's all about the bottom line. They don't protect their employees. Medical insurance has 1,500 deductible for their employees who are bringing them the customers and the money. Insurance rates are also extremely high. Employees cannot get injured on the job or report anything that happens to them on the job without the fear of losing their their job if they report it to HR.A typical workday involved gathering leads from various sources and contacting businesses (cold calling)I learned how time management and how to be persistent with my goalsManagement was good, however at times if calling on the phone, it may take some time to answer questions due to large number of agents calling in.I was independent contractor. I did not have direct contact with other personnel.The hardest part of this job was working alone... I was not a team environmentThe most enjoyable part of this job is that I was able to set my own hours. Overall I would rate this a great company!!!!Performed audits to ensure Quality and Accuracy of over 200 employees. Coached individuals for peak performance and provided feedback regarding monitoring evaluations to supervisors and employees. Developed and maintained departmental policies, procedures, objectives, and patient care standards. Performed quality control audits to ensure accuracy, completeness, and proper usage of clinical systems data.I work for the medicare-certified area of Humana at home. The state manager is completely inept, rude and hateful. If you go to her manager or HR you are then targeted and harassed until you quit. At that point they don't even know how to work out your notice..sending you home that day. HR does nothing to help you. I actually work with your manager against you. Don't go there you will regret itHumana  provides learning opportunities of strategic paths to improve partnerships between providers and members collectively. There is great collaboration with customers, co-workers, Operating standard contract and providers development and relationships..Process with a goal to make our self and members healthier by 2020The environment is ok but the company really doe not show that they care.  People have gone without raises for the past 4 years.  I would say its a good place for someone who's in school and needs a flexible schedule. Overall not a career job.I enjoyed working at Humana.  I had to navigate through a lot of technical requirements independently as my manager was not very knowledgeable and computer savy.  A typical work day was very busy.  The greatest challenge was related to my lack of wifi coverage due to Humana having a poor service provider.  This was significant because 98% of my job was dependent on access to the internet.A typical day at work consists of providing service to members by directly responding to questions. While delivering value and quality and actively engaging with the members; through every step of their road to wellness. Provided guidance on transactions, inquires, or complaints from consumers. Educated customers, providers and employers about Humana’s products and services; both over the telephone and through face-to-face briefings.Answer inbound calls, and answer any issues for the call Claims information,benefits, except billing,update any new information, and check  payments. How claims were paid, why they may have been denied. Find providers and provide the information to members. I had to go through many different programs to provide information to the members, or provider that were required. Most of all to make sure the clients were happy regardless of the outcomes.job security is based on revenue and departments are  operating in very segregated silos. My department was very laid back and the dress code was lenient most of the time. Working for Humana has a certain positive response from people because it is a large employer in the state of Kentucky, but there is really no corporate loyalty to the the overall well-being and financial security of their staff. You are a cog in a very large machine, no matter your rank.At first things were great then things went south quick.  HR wouldn't protect employees being treated unfairly, bosses were bullies and help personal grudges and bosses showed carelessness by violating an employees protected health information and sending the info out becoming viral.  My career was officially over after that it was just a matter of time.  I only miss helping the patients.i am working in Agile environment with good communication channel and visibility. the are i am working in is core development project where i have roles and responsibilities in all phases of development, right from initial requirement gathering phase to final deployment.Since i have been working in the same area for more then 5 years i am looking forward for more challenges and growth.Humana preaches work/life balance and even allow one hour of ""wellness time"" a week yet your coaches and direct management don't actually allow that. So focused on metrics and meeting numbers and there is no actual caring or helping provided to the members. The coach watches every minute of your day and will notify you accordingly with borderline harassing messages. The focus is all wrong.Working with Humana has opened my eyes up to the real working environment. It allowed me to experience numerous of personalities. My co workers did a great job of making me feel in place when it came down to enhancing my knowledge in certain areas I was not knowledgeable in. I learned how to be a team player in certain situations. The management always had an open door policy when it came to issues and concerns. The hardest part of the job is speaking with members who have had traumatic things happen to them and knowing that there was nothing I could do about it. I really enjoyed how the leaders tried to incorporate fun activities to help understand a new rule that was put in place. I would recommend this job to anyone. It was a stepping stone in my life.Great place to work, great benefits, plenty of overtime. fairness of staff. Learned a lot about office management, Microsoft products.How to research using some of the best systems in the country.  Co workers and management were overall great.hardest part of the job is you are on their schedule and if you have kids that could be hard. But i do not so i did not mind.I enjoyed the learning, the friendships.I just need a change.Contact new and existing customers to discuss their needs, and to explain how these needs could be met by specific services, Seek out new clients and develop clientele by networking to find new customers and generate lists of prospective clients that sometimes get a little hard sometimes but he great team I had is what made it possible.This company is great at the little things that make an employee feel at home.  However, the big things still need some work.  There are a few instances of the ""right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing."" This has occurred as it is a large company and one coast may not keep in mind the factors occurring in certain markets.  Coworkers and direct management is quite good, but the senior leadership is out of touch with certain aspects of roles and responsibilities.","10,000+",Washington,Washington,DC,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/0272fc8f-df27-4d9f-9d0a-7ce65e19f236?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

120,3173.0,Data Scientist,"SOS International, Ltd.",3.7,58.0,"Flexible hours, good time management. Helpful peers; new and senior employees can always find assistance in work environment whatever the time might be, even after midnight.SOSI takes care of their people very well. Honored to have had the opportunity to work for them!  Detailed in program management operations, transportation, training and human resource management.The poor rating in this review is specifically tied to a project I was a part of overseas, not SOSI corporate or SOSI in CONUS locations.  Without going into details, there was not much management support to the few contractors deployed forward, and the job itselt had no upward mobility or stablity.  Compensation was great but tied to danger pay due to location, rather than job performance or duties.The only bad thing about this job was the contract basis, but other than that it was a fast pace and there was something different everyday.Avoid if you can continue to interview while your there. attrition is constant and never ending. No process or guidelines that resemble a professional company or effective process. Most new folks are still interviewing once they start.I can not recommend this company.  While there are some wonderfully talented individuals who have worked at this company the senior leadership chruns through managers in every department and the turnover is very high with each manager lasting an average of 1 year.  This is due to the ineffective top leadership.  There is no trust established among the senior and departmental leadership and at the time of my employment the company had failed to establish an effective ethics program or transparency in their financials which is key to doing work in the government contracting space.As a former manager in this company, reviews were conducted for every overhead employee but no direct individuals.  Once rated and reviewed the reviews went before a board of top management where the CEO often directed changes in the ratings (lowering them) for individuals under my supervision whom he had no day to day contact with.  Both merit increases and promotions were predicated on these reviews and I found the process discriminating and ineffective as it became an evaluation of how well the senior management team (specifically the CEO) liked the individual or not and not a fair assessment of performance.  I feel like this is the number one reason employees can not advance in this company or receive proper mentorship and development. Before considering a position with this company it is advisable to talk to past as well as present employees before accepting a position and research their reputation in the industry by talking to teaming partners, former customers, etc. before making your decision.I have been working for SOS International LLC for years and the company has provided me with an incredible amount of opportunity to work in a client driven environment focused on developing its staff to be the best they possibly can. Commitment to the mission and dedication to the work is the expectation from employees. An ideal place to develop your skills.Mid-size company with ambitious and lofty goals - but the culture and feel of a smaller company.  Its an exciting, fun place to work.I would go back there today if there were still around.  You have to be selected and qualify to do the job.My immediate supervisor were very nice and very understanding, you can make up your own hours according to the working hours.family oriented, professional, opportunity for growth, great benifits.A typical day at work consists of performing daily tasks in a timely, accurate, & quality manner. I have learned to maintain attention to detail in this job at all times in which case an error is not an option. My co-workers have great personalities, are friendly, and are a great people to work alongside. However, there were several that lacked integrity, and some of us found ourselves picking up extra workload of others.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with its instability, and not being able to grow or promote. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of knowing that I am performing my best for a greater cause.Everything they do for proposals is done very patchwork and contract recruiters are used and then dumped. Vulgar language is prevalent throughout, and employees are mistreated and verbally undressed by supervisors in the open. I saw a middle-aged woman yelled at to tears on several occasions.My coworkers were great to work with, however management was so horrid it was near impossible to accomplish anything.Finally, they use no discretion on tasks which require a security clearance. Contracted employees without clearances are read into areas of contracts that they should not be. Great place good benefits... calm corporate culture.A little greedy when it came to pay cuts.. worst compensation but kept benefits at a good compensation. Overall best experience!Work was mostly in combat hospitals in Iraq.I learnd to be more carefull and vigilant .We had a reasonable management support.Worked in harmony and high cooperation with my co-workers.Hardest part was to be away from family.I enjoyed helping paients and their families during cnflicts.All other reviews are clearly written by disgruntled employees who can't even spell right. I've had a great experience with this company, they reimbursed a lot of my training, I got a lot on the job training and got a career advancement that I didn't even expect to get in just a few years. I've moved through several different roles and if you are proactive you can do that in SOSi. The company has great benefits, immediate 401K 100% vesting schedule, great health/dental, great number of days off/PTO but lacks remote work arrangement or relaxed casual Fridays just because of the owner's perceptions. Most of the staff is really nice, very personable and easy to deal with. The professional quality of people differs - there are some gems but there are some random people too, unfortunately, sometimes the management just hangs on to those random people just for the sake of emotional attachment and continuity though they really suck at what they do and are not employable anywhere else. Because of this situation and the uneven quality of management across the company departments gems often leave so the turnover is pretty high. The company is NOT run by a foreign family. Everyone is American and has clearances, the main owner was born outside of the US, that's about it. Every department is as great as its leader, the COO is a bit intense and not often easy to work with, so some execs are able to stay and work with him, others don't. The family likes to have the headquarters in NY, however, they don't really have a business there as it is a government contractor. NY office is a huge financial  more... and operational burden because the payroll and finance is run out of NY while the rest of other corporate departments including PMOs and billing are in VA. There is often a disconnect when people work in the next cubicle, imagine the situation with the different states. Some execs are really old and complacent, others are lazy being hired for big name companies they used to work for. Unfortunately, often there is no punishment for a bad performance, people aren't held accountable for very big mistakes or procrastination and it's a real morale issue for lower level employees. The company has a lot of entry level low paid employees and senior high paid questionable quality execs, the lack of the 'middle class' costs the company money but somehow they don't see it. Overall, I loved my time with the company and my advice is to accept the job depending on your specific offer/department circumstances.  lessIf I could do it again, I would have never worked here. The company is run by a foreign family with dubious international ties, yet they do classified work for the Government. They are loose-lipped about classified information and are overall documented unethical. They are notorious about not paying you so if you're out in Iraq or somewhere and relying on your salary, just don't work here.Great work environment.  Very individualized (contract).  Great mid-level management.  Unfortunately I just do contract work.  Would work full time if the opportunity presented.•	Performed general administrative support•	Was present during interviews and served as a translator•	Translated both written and spoken word•	Interviewed and screened potential applicants and visitors•	Moved to and from various bases throughout Afghanistanno room for advancement, liked my co-workers a lot, not treated with respect at all, I learned a lot about sterile processing from this company.I enjoyed the employment, pay and benefits.

I hardest part was leavingDespite being away from home for months at a time, and waking up rolling into the office at 6am on Monday in North Phoenix not knowing where in God's hot South Western Mojave dessert my crew and I will be working that week, The comroderie and overall respect that was nutured in that envronment was amazing, We were all a team, and it was felt as soon as you steped in the door. I would still be climbing for Bechel if thay were in Grand Junction and were going to stay in Western Colorado.Projects in Bechtel pose a great opportunity to develop technical skills within a team environment. Types of project vary depending on the business unit of your employment.Working for Bechtel was a great experience. I learnt more things over there and it was my pleasure working for them. I do recommend that company and would to have chance to work for them again.A great place to work and learn. I was able to learn a lot of new skills while employed with this company as well as hone the skills I already had. Besides learning I enjoyed working with my co-workers where I gained more knowledge. This company believe in training and offered training in various aspect of your job.Great overall company, family oriented, good amount of PTO and family/work life balance.  Hardest part of the job is that everything is project based.  Bechtel tries very hard to keep employees, but sometimes relocation is the only way to stay on board.Great work place, the foremans they hire need more experience. I learned a lot more about my craft. They promised lay off  compensation but they did not come through.Lots of favortism going on at this site. Poor site supervisor that was rarely onsite. Work was very difficult and we were working nights with limited lighting which is dangerous when your going up and down scaffolds all night with heavy equipment. Very poor coordination for the nightly workloadI love working for Bechtel , lots of challenges but rewarding . I am waiting for a position now from them . I love their insurance and their benefitsThe people at this company are great. Peers are always willing to help out. I have learned a lot about engineering since college working here. The most enjoyable part of this job is the opportunity to move around and work on many different projects.people are great to work with. The only problem they have is upper management. they need to learn that the working man is what makes him what he is. They seem to think that if your not a supervisor out there then your nothing to them.A typical day at work would be completing daily task from creating and finishing up calculations packages, spot checking, reviewing vendor drawings, back checking isometric drawings, turing in calculations packages to document control after checking thoroughly, and other tasks that arises daily.On a typical day my crew and I will work as a team to make sure our day duties are done on time. I as a journey man made sure my duties where done on time as well as my co- workers. I will do it all over again in a heart beat.Good days working on 48""pipe.Most days look busy sweeping .good employees to work with .jobs not being done because of managementGreat company to work for!

There are a lot of great benefits at Bechtel.enjoyable environment and would like to work with this company again. we were always busy which helped the day go by and we all enjoyed pay dayExcellent company except for small time politics will work for this company again I learned a lot.I can only say good things about BECHTEL you took my career to levels I never believed possible for that I say THANK YOU.Management was ok except for the politics.Co-workers were ok very good team spirit in all departments.Trying to keep the project schedule.At the end of the day accomplishing what I set out to do on that day or what my assignment called for on that day. Satisfying the requirements of the sub and seeing the project progress from stage to stage.A typical day at work every day was different and never a dull moment. I accomplished most times what was assigned. If the opportunity be given I will be happy to work for BECHTEL again. I will also be willing to relocate.My experienced at Bechtel was surreal in the sense that I could not believe the level of negativity towards hispanics and color individuals. 1. I was treated very unfair for been a latino as well as my Mexican co-workers. 2. I felt opressed and misguided from the very first day by management.  3. Our employee reviews were vague and meaningless. 4. Management did not take the time to get to know they're employees and the qualities they posses that could help the company be a better working environment.Worked here for 5 yrs plenty of work Alot at home time if and when you need they are very flexible. They have classes to futher your career.

No regrets, only fond memories knowing that our children slept soundly while we were arresting the most violent individuals in this country.Great co-workers and team environment. Lack of upward advancement and career opportunities as a contractor. Management is inexperienced. Salary and benefits of contractor company are incredibly low for the quality and quantity of work provided to the government.If your not hired directly as a federal employee and go through a contractor company,  expect people to treat you like garbage! You get paid way less and the health benefits are so bad there isn't a point to even purchase it.  I worked as a Financial Analyst in FLU and the Assistant US Attorney is smug, condescending and doesn't deserve his position. Other AUSA attorneys say he is unteachable and errogant. Keep in mind the U.S Attorney's office hires these people fresh out of law school with little knowledge of what they are doing. Half the time people sit at there desk and twiddle their thumbs all day. I was very disappointed and expected to learn and experience much more when I was working there. The women are very catty and quick to make up lies about you...the only good thing about this job is you can request a 4 or 5 day weekend almost on every federal holiday....again, showing u how much everyone wants to really work there. If you want a good job and a lasting job,  look somewhere else!Great benefits, plenty of room to advance and move within the company. Management could use some more training but overall great work/family balance.  Yearly raisesHigh stress correctional environment with increasingly acute and chronic medical and psychiatric patients. Law enforcement benefits are exceptional. Pay compensation lacking in comparison to hospitals.Have not received a raise in almost 8 years, not satisfied with working conditions. Very unsafe.  Director is very stand off does not engage with staff uses he super-intents to talk to staff.Early mornings, lots of responsibility.Learned to produce meals for a large number of people.Decent management team.Lots of different personalities in co-workers. Earle mornings...4 AM!Seeing peoples response to great food.i wish that I can go back to working for the D.O.J. I would recommend any young person to start in the government to get a good salary and they can advanceFirst, I have a busy morning to start off with but, work in a good environment with employers and employees.Since, I've been employed whether through my current position law enforcement and health field it has touch me to have good work ethics and more diverse.Management in both my current position micro manages, but, although it can be overwhelming at times it only makes me into a better employee and complete my job duties correctly.My co-workers are so so because when dealing with different personally it can be a bit difficult, but, I can work with anyone at the end of the day. Dealing with the strict environment and some managersThe public and learning different work related materialDOJ's Asset Forfeiture Management Staff (AFMS) comprises of several departments including it's information security team. Forfeiture Systems's (FS) security team deals with continuous monitoring, incident response, vulnerability assessment, vulnerability remediation, working with various security tools, and analysis of vulnerable findings within AFMS networks. The essential part and the most challenging part of the job was to maintain a good security posture so management would be satisfied with overall security structure. The most enjoyable part of the team was the flexibility in work schedules and balance between professional and personal life.Workload is sufficent for pay. Some Managers are amazing and others not so much. I have learned many of skills that will assist me in my career. The hardest part of the job is when Managers do not provide training. I am not saying this is every Manager. I have experienced the lack of training from more than one Manager. The most enjoyable part of the job is the majority of coworkers are extremely friendly. DOJ fosters a positive work environment for the most part.Day normally starts with my initial paperwork then begin driving routes. Friendly environment and we all help each other, along with management. The best part is being on the road meeting people while completing the task at hand.My time with the Justice Department was enjoyable and exciting, as I have gain many years of experience as Paralegal Specialist. I was able to work with inter agencies and many agencies within the Justice Department, DEA, FBI, U.S. Marshals, Courts and Prison facilities. My daily work schedule was pretty busy setting up interview of witnesses in cases and organize documents and filing pleading and arrange conference calls closing case files.  I didn't find the job to hard. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the attorney win there cases because everything was done in a timely manner.This company dose not train new employees very well.  This company expect you to understand what was told you, they do not explained nor show you how to do the work.  This company has very bad communication skills as well as the management  team is very un-organized and un-appreciative of a good worker.  The management teams is extremely strict and some what bully's their workers in doing other duties that is not within their job description.As a language professional you perform a wide variety of translations and interpretations which makes the job challenging but fun and rewarding at the same time. Co-workers are very well educated and come from different backgrounds. Management sees you as family.

Where you end up is completely up to you.This is a typical government agency. The people I worked with were great. Sometimes the work became mundane, which is why I was always looking for a challenge. Being in the administrative field tends to get a little boring at times. However, you get out of a job what you put into it. I really enjoyed working for the federal government with the exception of the commute. The only reason that I left there was due to some extenuating medical issues that have now been taken care of to the best of my ability.While I believe the benefits could use some tweaking, CBH is an outstanding place to work.  By far the best place I have ever worked.  The nurses were treated with such respect from management staff and they were truly appreciative and rewarding for hard work!  Would highly recommend!Review loans that are in potential foreclosure status. outbound and inbound calls from customers to advise status of loan.A great government agency with a stellar reputation; however, I wish I had done my due diligence into my job title and overall duties and responsibilities because there is not a lot of leverage and career growth for non-attorney staff (unless you are an analyst or project manager). That said, I worked to gain a new position on my own with little guidance or mentorship and to date, has improved my standing considerably. Overall, management could be much better especially to assist employees interested in building a career at the DOJ on a non-attorney track. The work-life balance could not be better and the benefits packages are also quite excellent. There are trade-offs to any job, but the DOJ does provide its employees with an alternative to private sector work that most find attractive.",,Washington,Washington,DC,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/acdbf272-b6c3-4820-bbe4-73c9f3135159?mescoid=1300093001001&jobPosition=35,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Co-workers are generally friendly and management is (for the most part) competent. It can be hard dealing with entitled students and unfriendly parents.

Everyday you have a work leader who gives you the run down on how to be succesfull at the task at hand. About 1000 tax documents need to be edited and reviewed a day. The Hardest part about the job is knowing when to take breaks throughout the day. The most enjoyable part of the day is the end when everyones about finished with their documents. Its a pretty bland and boring day. But very easyI learned how to effectively deal with upset customers.

I learned a great deal about analyzing tax accounts, procedures and systems.  As far as management there is definitely room for improvement.  I enjoyed all of my coworkers there were many people from different nationalities, backgrounds, ages cultures.  The hardest part of the job lack of moral, encouragement and support from management.

Taught me a lot professional though. Great time off.AM shift is 5:30 am - 2 pm and PM shift is 3 - 11:30 pm.  Management needs a lot of improvement and training.  Not all are bad but most still need adequate training.  Best part of the job are the people you work with.  Hardest part of this job is finding out the correct answers on how to solve certain issues.  Not everyone is on the same page and are given different solutions to one problem.As a Taxpayer representative and being able to handle different people from all backgrounds, this was an very interesting position that I loved to do.  This position was one of the best positions to have that was directly related in my field of an Accounting degree.  My co-workers had made it an easy place to work, because they were enjoyable to be around while we processed and answered questions related to filing, preparing, and adjustments related to individual and business taxes.My day was productive and busy. I have learn how things worked in the corporate world. I enjoyed working with the people I encountered. hardest part of my job was staying focused, I worked at a different pace that what I normally worked at. I enjoyed the people and the work experience I that I got to have at such an early age.When I worked at the IRS, it was my very first office job.  I had no expectations of office work in general.  It was a lot more wacky and fun-loving than I thought the IRS would be.Defined job responsibilites - training provided to perform various jobs that you may be required to perform on an as-needed basis.  Defined career path structureLearned several new things on a weekly basis.  The job at times was very stressful.  Enjoyed the people that I worked with and got to know them on personally.Ok place to work, the majority of the job is on the phone helping customers. depending on your manager, management can be a blessing or not. Co-workers are fun to work with.After a training of basic tax knowledge, we would be able to help tax payers to prepare their tax returns. It is a great chance for accounting students to have a general overview of how the taxation system works.Great place to work. The learning environment was amazing. I was given many different opportunities to expand my knowledge and customer service skills..","10,000+",Washington,Washington,DC,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/789c4793-33a6-4c5c-9361-8aa827754db2?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

515,3568.0,Satellite Sensor Calibration Scientist,ERT,4.0,23.0,"ERT is a very good company to work as a Software Engineer. My manager was one of the coolest person to work with.He provided me with all kinds of work during my internship including development, automation & unit testing.Amazing place to work. Very challenging but worth it. I've learned a very lot from working here. Never a dull moment. High volume when it comes to work. Very high pace.Reserve SWAT officer assigned to support the US Marshals office in serving warrants on violent, drug, domestic abuse and many others. Outstanding working environment, it is great to work on the entry team with the best this nation has to offer.ERT just purchased PHT Crop. in May 2015. The transition is still going on so it is hard to judge how it will turn out. So far things look good. Although they only strive to provide average compensation.  Aside from better pay and questionable job growth potential I think things are going well.I came to work for ERT, when my previous company PHT was merged with ERT in 2015. ERT and PHT work both in the ePRO industry, and the management of clinical trial data for pharmaceutical companies. When I started at PHT in 2012, the company was doing roughly. Lots of data mismanagement, and clients whom were not happy with the management of the clinical trail data. After an intense 2 weeks at the company, the CEO at the time and the Client were very pleased with the expediency in which we resolved the issues. I went full time after 5 months at the company, something I was working hard towards.As the company PHT began to rise from the issues of 2012 , so did my responsibilities. I became more knowledgeable in clinical trial matters. Not just the management of data, but the development process of the studies prior to being active. I was continually in demand by our international project teams, for the work I was putting out. It became more challenging as the years progressed, but I dived into every situation open minded. I made myself available for my colleagues from Project teams to Support staff. I guided Junior team members in the Data Quality Specialist department, in the understanding of studies and their approach to cases and task management.When the PHT merged with ERT, I felt as if things in the company changed, not all for the good. Staff were leaving at a enormous rate prior to the merger, review process was completely changed, with no opportunity for a one on one with my manager. The environment did not feel the same to me any longer; I hardly worked  more... with my immediate team members, communications seemed to have been less through phone calls and more through massive email chains(which caused confusion for many team members), and my growth and progression in the company felt stunted.  lessExperience with emergent counseling for clients struggling with severe psychosis, suicidality, substance abuse, attempted suicide and family crises. Working as an Emergency Response Therapist brought experience in the process of hospitalization (for high risk clients), diversions and outpatient care. Emphasize on lest restrictive level of care needed based on 27-65 statute training in Colorado.Wish they didnt take work from home away. I was more productive in a more closed environment. Also shouldnt have sole to third party company.It is a very responsive company and their HR/admins sincerely serves their employees with in the boundaries of the resources made available to them. They have a very flexible training program. What more can an employee ask for!The job was a regular job, but the employees made it fun to work there. We would attend social functions together and Phillies games.A typical day is touching base with an employee that I am responsible for in regards to his training.  We interact with one another throughout the day and work well together to make sure all deliverables for the quality team is in order.  As a Quality Assurance Auditor I have learned allot about how very important it is to maintain certain standard operating procedures and for each and every person within the organization to abide by them.  If these SOPs are not followed the productivity and effectiveness to to our tasks on a day to day basis may be at risk.  The outcome, may even affect the client in some cases and this is something we strive to avoid.  The hardest part of the job, is actually trying to explain that individuals cannot and should not deviate from their own written processes.  The enjoyable part of the job is making the end result, making the clients happy as well as knowing the tasks assigned was done accurately without any risks along the way.ERT is passionate and committed about transforming the way you conduct the drug development and healthcare efforts.
