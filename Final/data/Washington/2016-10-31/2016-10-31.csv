126,3179.0,Statistician/Data Scientist,CACI International Inc,3.9,826.0,"I enjoy working in this position, . Working in the Facility Management office new challenges are always turning up.  My typical day consists of tracking and assigning work request  for maintenance that are documented on line. Dealing with internal customers to help with problem solving, or maintenance that may be required. Assist in documentation for projects that requires external contractors to be completed to help the facility run smoothly.I liked working here for the most part - the people were great and had lots of institutional support and even the benefits were above average. There is much to do within the company for someone who wants to learn new things. It is a major governmental contractor with 14,000 employees or thereabouts. However due the vagaries of the government-contract world most of the office was laid off or furloughed without any notice. We had been expecting years' worth of work but it did not come come to fruition. I do not blame CACI for this necessarily - it could very well have been the fault of another contractor - but in my particular realm of CACI jobs can be on the insecure side.I Typed documents such as correspondence, drafts, memos, and emails, and prepared 3 reports weekly for management. I Opened, sorted, and distributed incoming messages and correspondence. I Purchased and maintained office supply inventories, and being careful to adhere to budgeting practices. I Greeted visitors and determined to whom and when they could speak with specific individuals and I Recorded, transcribed and distributed minutes of meetingsManagement was good, no issues with benefits or the working conditions as a whole. Biggest issue is complacency among veteran employees. Enjoyed working there and saw opportunity for advancement when I went looking for it. Opportunity for overtime and to set yourself apart from others was pretty prominent while I was there although it comes in waves.Team members in my current project is great.They help to understand the complexity of the client systems.Management only provide need to know information.Hardest part is the uncertainty at the end of fiscal year, don't know if the contract is funded.  Raise of last 2 years is around 1% or 1.5%.Most enjoyable part of this project is the flexibility to work from home sometimes.You will find an extremely professional work environment with friendly people. They offer great benefits, and you can also have a life outside of work. The only negative thing is the lack of job security since most of the jobs or positions are based on contracts that can end at any moment.Working with CACI was a pleasure. Working there I learned how to properly input data information, how to check others work, and how to scan information into the system. After working there for 2yrs the hardest part was being under a new manager and instead of being praised/awarded for all the hard work you put in your fired instead. (however i doubt that manager is still there).The company took over the contract and immediately began removal of experience personnel - after flooding the environment with new people. Very inexperienced personnel.Good Education opportunities.Better compensation would be a good addition.Expatriation is a good addition to the contract.Greater opportunity to engage with management.CACI takes care of their employees.  Even as a contractor, they attempt to do all they can to retain good employees.  Work is always busy.  There is more than enough to go around working as a government contractor.  My management is excellent! Easy to work with, and expects you to take lead when necessary.Their benefits are goodGreat company to work for the only problem was that pay is low. But the benefits are good and the management was good. I would work for them again. Really enjoyed the balance of work and family there.First time working as a contractor after 30 years of military service.  Great experience.  Working alongside other employees who work for different contacting companies, it is clear that CACI is among the best.I started with CACI not that long ago. I love the environment. It  feels like everyone is trying to help you.  Great benefits and good healthcare. Overall one the best places I ever worked for.Excellent company with excellent benefits.  Everyone was willing to solve any issues within a timely manner.  Upper management:  "" Kudos "".CACI employs some great people, but the management at the corporate and business unit level is lacking. The performance-based raise system is an absolute joke.Caci was my first company to work for.They were an excellent organization and they took care of their personnel as well, great company.A good company and program to work for, overall good environment for warehouse and supply chain employees with great health insurance and company benefits.I had the great pleasure to work for this great company for 2 years. Excellent project managers, excellent HR, excellent directors, good play, good benefits.CACI is a great company, I actually love working here, the environment is peaceful and the people are really nice. They truly care about you having a life outside of work, They will work with you to take care of your family and personal needs.CACI is a big defense contractor in Virginia. They possess many contracts for the Navy. However, as a contractor, they tend not to do much new development work, at least at the location I am at. Most of my work has either been maintenance, making small changes to the system, or IA security. The only time I actually felt like I learned anything valuable was when I was loaned out to the Database team. In that situation I picked up on some PL-SQL. The management has very poor planning abilities and does not assign appropriate timeframes to complete assignments, usually overallocating very simple tasks, and assigning few hours for important ones, while pressing hard to follow the schedule for the sake of Earned Value.The workforce is a mix of retired military and civilian; so interaction and social environment is very favorable.  At the co-worker level you are practically family, which makes the work and life manageable.However, the company is growing at the time I'm writing this and is changing direction.The new mood of management is to promote young and headstrong types.  Those that are content with being on the low end are being weeded out slowly.Another note: Since this is a contract company, job security is not guaranteed unless you are lucky enough to still be around after the first 3-5 years.  It's not the company's fault, its just the budgets of the contracts.","10,000+",Washington,Springfield,VA,2016-10-31T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/d043dbe6-ba04-4065-8ac8-7d7833112462?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=31,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
