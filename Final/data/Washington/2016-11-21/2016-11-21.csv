581,3634.0,Statistician Consulting Manager,Pricewaterhouse Coopers,4.0,2700.0,"great place to work - I enjoy working with smart people and the talented network at PwC.  Limited career growth in Marketing and Sales.As an intern I was able to participate in multiple audits for various companies. I gained hands on experience in the auditing field. The people there are great to work for.PwC is a great company. It provides great benefits and career opportunity to any staff level. It's great to be part of one of the most prestigious public accounting firm in the world.In the financial services market, there is constant pressure to meet short deadlines with an intense amount of work. Among other groups, there is a flexible work environment.Overall a great place to work! It was as an early place in my career, it was definitely a learning experience. Overall, I would recommend this location to anyone who is looking for a great job experience!- Work on requests with time limits - Laid back environment - Workload varies - Lots of benefits - Great experience- make friends with everyone - Managers are good people -Overtime pay - Must stay overtime if work at hand is due and not completedGood work environment, challenging but satisfying, not much work/life balance but they are working on it. I great place to start working and understanding the corporate world.PwC allows you to learn and grow. Great projects are mixed with miserable ones. A lot of really good people work in the company with excellent experience and expertise, but some are far from being perfect.There was no work/life balance and employees were expected to give up their weekends for about 9 months out of the year. Management was very appoachable however and had an open door policyGreat opportunity for recent graduates. Exposure to a lot responsibilities and different types of jobs. Team work required, long busy seasons.Working at Pwc as a contractor at the moment, I'm lucky to be surrounded by a team of professionals with great attitude and personality. we provide help to the employees on daily basis on their laptops mostly but we also make sure everything else is working perfectly, things like printers, video conference equipments, phones, TVs and more..Co-workers are extremely smart and talented. They help you to grow your personal brand and establish your unique value to the firm through diverse experiences.Great people, great work mostly, and excellent support. Need to remember that it is a business driven by revenues. Long-term, one needs to align what they do with how the firm makes money.I was part of a small close-knit group of consultants with good access to my management. I truly enjoyed the minimum 2-week mandatory learning opportunities.I landed on the wrong team that over hired in anticipation for some big wins that unfortunately did not come.  The culture and people that work here are great however; you really need to find a great project/teamPwC provides a good opportunity to expand your understanding of auditing and accounting principles. PwC has very high expectations of its employees. Employees are expected to learn on their feet and to keep up with long hours and high stress deadlines.I loved this job. I worked there for about 8 years. Management team was great. All the tellers were great. I have no problems with this bank. It was the best working experience of my life.Great company, depends on your group, obviously a global company with similar opportunities.  Beautiful office and locations, great benefitsCareer is propelled forward through combination hours over standard and networking in addition to performance. Although the work alone won't guarantee you the promotion, management is always willing to speak with you and help you be as well rounded as you would like. It's a great place to start your career.This office is a great opportunity for recent college graduates seeking experience to build their marketability.  There is little opportunity for advancement for individuals with years of financial industry experience. This is not the core practice which causes limitations in growth.Good training program and a lot of projects to learn and growGood work environment and locationHours is long Coworkers are awesome","10,000+",Washington,Washington,DC,2016-11-21T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/0da46a2d-6c20-4550-95a8-5a61ae4e4de0?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
