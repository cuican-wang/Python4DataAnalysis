103,3156.0,Senior Data Scientist,IMTAS,2.9,11.0,"The best thing about working here is the personnel on my team.  We communicate well and work well as a unit. I have had the opportunity to take on a greater leadership role, which has been very satisfying.A typical day begins with emails about a dozen new policies. God and the favoritism! Hardwork is not valued here and there is constant harassment of one form or another.There is a high staff turnover.Management have favorites. Promotion is non-existent, all moves are lateral. Working harder does not equal compensation. Low compensation.I truly enjoyed my time with IMTAS, it was a team oriented company that tried to make sure their employees where taken care of when working away from the HQ building.  During my time there, I was able to learn and broaden my knowledge of Project and Program Management.  I had the support of IMTAS and my supervisor when stuck with difficult decisions.  If I had an option I would have stayed with IMTAS and continued my career with them.IMTAS was a great company to work for, they always had an open door policy. If ever I had an issue with pay or any HR related topics,all i had to do was place a call and they would address the issue.The company seems alright in the beginning. But seems like words are are stronger than their actions. Compensation is minimal. They will task you with work with no long term benefits. Management has their favorite picks. Promotion seems to be based in who they like more rather than who has done a better job.At IMTAS I did a little bit of everything. Some days I would help receive new equipment in.  I ran Excel sheets on all inventory. Helped organize the warehouse. Once the equipment was in I shadowed engineers as they completed their diagrams. I helped install servers to racks, run wiring back and forth, and install and update firewalls. I also helped test cameras and software.Uncommunicative management and frequent policy upheaval.Great place to work.There were no difficulties with work.Everyday brought new task but it also depends on your job placement.It was a good company to work for but unfortunately my contract ended. My co-workers were very nice and we had a good team work.I also liked my supervisor, he was very nice and helpful.Responsibilities include supporting various project management teams in controlling project cost and schedules, using Microsoft EXCEL to develop project plans, status reports, financial reports, budgets, and data updates for Government and contractor project management personnel to use in the management and control of project activities. In addition, using Microsoft WORD, PowerPoint and Visio to develop documentation and briefings as required. Responsible for a myriad of activities associated with overall project management support. Track and manage inventory of all project equipment, most of which are highly sensitive Communications Security-related items. Submit, track, and manage all requisitions and purchase orders using a variety of agency-specific forms designated for such requests and entering into Government approved requisition database. Provide weekly status reports to Government and contractor program management",,Washington,Washington,DC,2016-08-18T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/4164a248-0441-419e-b811-e14d09099451?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

467,3520.0,"Senior Staff Scientist - AUG16-01  - Alexandria, VA",Human Resources Research Organization,4.0,3.0,"I've done some freelance writing work for HumRRO for the past couple of years and all of my interactions with them have been professional and positive. They respond to all questions promptly, they handle payments and paperwork quickly and efficiently, and they provide quality feedback. The feedback and suggestions I've received from my editors there have improved the actual writing product and made me a better, more intuitive writer. Though I've never actually met anyone at HumRRO  face to face (all of my work has been done via telecommuting), I still feel a part of their organization and I hope my working relationship with them will continue.Poor managment, little room for advancement, raises not based on performance.Worked for HumRRO for 6 years and really enjoyed the experience. Whether as an intern or full time, HumRRO is a great company with a VERY long history.",,Washington,Alexandria,VA,2016-08-18T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/759c8194-52fa-41e5-9bf4-ef099f44330f?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=22,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
