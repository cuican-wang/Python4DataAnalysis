21,3074.0,Satellite Sensor Calibration Scientist,ERT Inc,4.0,23.0,"ERT is a very good company to work as a Software Engineer. My manager was one of the coolest person to work with.He provided me with all kinds of work during my internship including development, automation & unit testing.Amazing place to work. Very challenging but worth it. I've learned a very lot from working here. Never a dull moment. High volume when it comes to work. Very high pace.Reserve SWAT officer assigned to support the US Marshals office in serving warrants on violent, drug, domestic abuse and many others. Outstanding working environment, it is great to work on the entry team with the best this nation has to offer.ERT just purchased PHT Crop. in May 2015. The transition is still going on so it is hard to judge how it will turn out. So far things look good. Although they only strive to provide average compensation.  Aside from better pay and questionable job growth potential I think things are going well.I came to work for ERT, when my previous company PHT was merged with ERT in 2015. ERT and PHT work both in the ePRO industry, and the management of clinical trial data for pharmaceutical companies. When I started at PHT in 2012, the company was doing roughly. Lots of data mismanagement, and clients whom were not happy with the management of the clinical trail data. After an intense 2 weeks at the company, the CEO at the time and the Client were very pleased with the expediency in which we resolved the issues. I went full time after 5 months at the company, something I was working hard towards.As the company PHT began to rise from the issues of 2012 , so did my responsibilities. I became more knowledgeable in clinical trial matters. Not just the management of data, but the development process of the studies prior to being active. I was continually in demand by our international project teams, for the work I was putting out. It became more challenging as the years progressed, but I dived into every situation open minded. I made myself available for my colleagues from Project teams to Support staff. I guided Junior team members in the Data Quality Specialist department, in the understanding of studies and their approach to cases and task management.When the PHT merged with ERT, I felt as if things in the company changed, not all for the good. Staff were leaving at a enormous rate prior to the merger, review process was completely changed, with no opportunity for a one on one with my manager. The environment did not feel the same to me any longer; I hardly worked  more... with my immediate team members, communications seemed to have been less through phone calls and more through massive email chains(which caused confusion for many team members), and my growth and progression in the company felt stunted.  lessExperience with emergent counseling for clients struggling with severe psychosis, suicidality, substance abuse, attempted suicide and family crises. Working as an Emergency Response Therapist brought experience in the process of hospitalization (for high risk clients), diversions and outpatient care. Emphasize on lest restrictive level of care needed based on 27-65 statute training in Colorado.Wish they didnt take work from home away. I was more productive in a more closed environment. Also shouldnt have sole to third party company.It is a very responsive company and their HR/admins sincerely serves their employees with in the boundaries of the resources made available to them. They have a very flexible training program. What more can an employee ask for!The job was a regular job, but the employees made it fun to work there. We would attend social functions together and Phillies games.A typical day is touching base with an employee that I am responsible for in regards to his training.  We interact with one another throughout the day and work well together to make sure all deliverables for the quality team is in order.  As a Quality Assurance Auditor I have learned allot about how very important it is to maintain certain standard operating procedures and for each and every person within the organization to abide by them.  If these SOPs are not followed the productivity and effectiveness to to our tasks on a day to day basis may be at risk.  The outcome, may even affect the client in some cases and this is something we strive to avoid.  The hardest part of the job, is actually trying to explain that individuals cannot and should not deviate from their own written processes.  The enjoyable part of the job is making the end result, making the clients happy as well as knowing the tasks assigned was done accurately without any risks along the way.ERT is passionate and committed about transforming the way you conduct the drug development and healthcare efforts. Understanding that you need the most accurate, cost-effective and convenient support systems to collect timely, regulatory-compliant data. You expect unparalleled service, proven process and leading technology managed by professionals, ensuring our pledge to you of “getting it done right.”Great environment to work. Structured.

Keeping management aware of changes and be flexible to change along with working closely and assisting co-workers with assignments. the hardest part of the job was can please everybody, but you do your best. the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing and hearing people give me or the job compliments on a job well done.Arrive to work in uniform.Prep food and Hotel lounge for Happy Hour.

Delivering the orders in a timely manner. Handling cash as well as credit cards  when dealing with payment of goods.Closing down The Happy Hour Lounge. Close out for the night turning in all receipts and exact payments for the services rendered.Clock out and Exit the Building.A typical workday you go clock in then head down to the basement/laundry room. Once down there you immediately start sorting the dirty laundry to start washing and drying them. While doing that process for a long time co-workers always will talk and play around alot,their main language is spanish so they would mix between talking english and spanish.Around 7 pm the managers all leave so it would just be me and my co-workers finishing up all of the daily task until the end of all of our shifts at 11:30 pmResponsible for all end of day reports, accounts closures, and accurate audit of the days transactions.Monitor and maintain all area of the hotel including rooms, pools, and all common area to ensure property meets andexceeds guest expectations and safety.Responsible for checking in as well as checking out quest.Served as the main liaison between customers, management and sales team.Monitored cash drawers in multiple checkout stations to ensure adequate cash supply.Replenished supplies, bags and other materials at each cash wrapUpper management including HR doesn't listen to the people. HR forgets everything and lose everything.  They are not supportive of their employees.  They only take the word of the manager without doing a thorough investigation.  This job has its favorites, no matter how much of a good worker you are.  The employees work well with each other (we were like family).  This company including upper management used to be so caring: they went from sweet to sour with the change of upper managers.Embassy Suites was always fast paced, fun, and lots of room to move up within the company. There was always something taking place in different rooms, whether it be booked for parties, business trips, or just family reunions. I learned a lot about the culture and origin of Embassy Suites, from who founded it to the history of how long its been around. Management was always so great, they always made you feel special and part of the family. The hardest part of my job was learning how to bartend, this is where I learned most my bartending skills. Overall I would say the most enjoyable part of my job was to laugh and go about everyday duties within such a positive environment.We worked together like family but, as a employee working based off of gratuity I feel like the company is cheating us. There is no way that I am busting my butt working 12 to 15 hours a day and only making $12 an hour for a party an hour for a party that cost well over $40,000.  someone has some explaining to do .Working in the food department we were always slammed whether it was someone dining in to eat, or ordering to go or ordering room service we did it all, if the bar needed to refill on one of their beverages I had to go and get it for them. There is always something different that you are doing, its routine its just you will never have the same day.I worked the overnight shift which was a self managed shift. It was great and allowed me plenty of time to spend with family.  This job didn't come between anything other thing that went on in my life. i.e., church, family outings, birthdays etc.This place makes you want to never go home, I really loved working there. The work is very fast paced, but it makes your work day go by faster. You can learn different criteria's and earn different job experience. That's definitely one of the pros of working there.the company does not care about their employees, in fact the banquet department, which included a sales team, RARELY attended any banquet events; they only saw the individuals when it came to selling a banquet event and when it was time to pay for their eventI had served in the past, but working as a banquet/cocktail server offers the opportunity to meet and experience many different cultures. I would definitely do it again. It is a fairly easy job and I enjoyed being a part of the hustle and bustle.I have out look with appiontments but some days do not go as plan, Guest issues or employee concerns has to be taken care of...Check on previous day revenues, balance all accounts. Check on food and beverage, Embassy suites breakfast is always busy and I am always happy to help. Daily Huddle at 10am ...update all department on what's going on for the day and very near future. The hardest part of the job is the are a few days that I wish we have more than 24 hours in one day. The most enjoyable part is certainly seeing the team grow..... that moment when they gets it. Teaching is fun but when that student is transitioning to become a teacher himself/ herself is the joy and it's all worth it.Working at the Embassy was an great experience for me it was nice and clean with OK benefits. Sometimes we were short hand and it caused me to work harder but I love been in a good work environment so I didn't have a problem with it.It's been a pleasure working for such a great company. They truly believe in promoting from within. I have learned alot from all my managers over the years but since I currently moved to the eact bay the commute is not what it used to be, and thats why I am now looking for other opportunities.I use to enjoy my job here but things have changed do to management.  They judge you on your past and hold that over your head but I work with some good people that like me for me.  I work hard and Im always there I never call off unless I'm very sick which is not a lot.Checking in guests and providing customer service was a typical day at work. I learned how to work with the public and deal with complaints in a fair and personable way. I loved my co-workers and we had a great time every day. There really was no hard part, except that in down times our hours would have to be cut. Also, our salaries were very low for the caliber of the hotel.my experience with embassy suites I would describe it as a growing experience, a typical day at work started with a quick meeting with the chef or supervisor and get informed of people in house, specials of the day including soups and entrée, in my  time working for embassy suites I learned how to work under pressure, manage it and get the work done with a smile on my face , management was good, I personally had a great experience whit my co-workers, I had the pleasure to work with people from different parts of the world and learned about others cultures and use that experience to give the guests a better service, like any job involving food production the hardest part would be getting everything ready on time and keep the work and food flow, but at the same time the most enjoyable part of it its when the guests congratulate us for the good job and having the satisfaction of knowing that you did your best!!My typical workday was very busy from start to finish. I learned a lot at the Embassy suites Hotel. Management was great and my co workers were very hard workers indeed. The hardest part about the job was my feet hurting and that's it. I know the rules of life, no pain no gain.I learned a lot while working here. The training was one of the best I have ever had. The work was easy going. The people were great to work with. The hours were long but the coworkers made it worth it.","10,000+",Washington,McLean,VA,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/2d038e57-ff89-49a0-8513-2892b98b4c05?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=10,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
