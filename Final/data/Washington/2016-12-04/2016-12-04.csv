13,3066.0,Data Scientist,Wiser,4.2,9.0,"Great co-workers throughout the company.  Great job culture and work/life balance.  Opportunities available to work in multiple areas of the company.Great place to increase your product knowledge and expand your tech skills. Upper management needs to be reorganized in order for this company to really be successful.work hours are flexible, so you can come in anytime before 9 and leave anytime after 3, Learned alot working in different carto, Feature data and urban data products, many different tools learned in Arcmap, some training was avalible for learing new skills in GIS and also commputer programming. Management overall is pretty good except for a few internal issues of not giving enough information to the extractors on some project problems. Co- workers have been great and are easy to get along with. Hardest part of the job I would say would be starting new projects not done yet by the comapny also making sure you are on top of security issues and keeping ISO compliance. The best part of the job is learing new and faster ways of getting a particular project done, and gaining new skill sets from that, and being in a more relaxed environment makes to the job easier and less stressful.A typical day at wiser starts by going to my office and works on different CAD drawings.I learned how to collect data and maintain productivity for various activities in a project also building up reports progress of project.Management was really good i didn't got any conflicts while i was working at co12 hour rotating shift. You work off site and never see your company. The perks are great, stock options, pay, web based tools. The recent change to its primary health care plan is a bit harsh, more of a single payer HSA than any form of Insurance Iâ€™ve heard of. Loved the job but company had no positions open other than shift work.Let my clearance expire and didn't handle issues they should have addressed in a professional manner whatsoever.",,Washington,Springfield,VA,2016-12-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/75bbbb93-2916-4801-8a2d-cb88f3aa2374?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

478,3531.0,Statistician,Department Of Labor,4.0,272.0,"Enjoyed every moment of this position. Everything was paced perfectly, and my co-workers respected  my time.My professional and sub-professional work history has spanned a period exceeding 30 years.  I am in reasonable good health and love outdoor activities.  Management in the companies that I have worked for varied as the work environment demanded.  I enjoyed underground mining and stability monitoring of mine works.  The hardest and most challenging work in underground production was longwall and continuous miner continuity of operations and complying with state and federal regulations.I would get to work and put on my coveralls, gloves, hairnet, and hat, and start to assemble the machinery to be used for the day, as well as using the power jack to bring in the product of the day for cooking and packaging.  Then after assembly my team and I would continue to work until break.  My co-workers and I would all have designated jobs and activities to do, and some of the workers would excel in certain areas as opposed to others.  Creating a relaxed but diligent environment was necessary to finish the day's work on time so we could get a head start on the next day's preparations.I was a student trainee for the black lung office. Within this job I had several duties. This included making sure all documents processed within that day got mailed out to the client, the lawyer, the judge, and/or the survivor. I was responsible for tracking the large documents that have been mailed out. Overseen the file room and mail room. Overseeing the large file room and keeping that in order helped me gain valuable operations management skills. I also met all requests gave by claims examiners and senior claims examiners.This was a very enjoyable job. It was only for students so when I graduated I had to quit.A typical day at work shows high demand from the clientele we have either over the phone or in person. The work provided to us is consistent and we always learn something new everyday. With the change in daily instructions, sometimes there is an issue with lack of communication which can make the job difficult at times. But the best part of the job is always being able to satisfy the client.Working in this department is a difficult prospect. The salary is good and competitive, but the job is a perfect representation of the metaphor ""a cog in the machine."" Processing the same amount of work day in and day out and being mandated on a metric basis is very demoralizing, add in the lack of advancement and this job has a clear turnover.Greeted patients and provided triage depending on need, such as appointment schedules and records.  Managed office supplies, vendors, organization and upkeep.  Prepared treatment rooms for patient examinations, keeping the rooms neat and  Maintained a clean reception area, including lounge and associated areasMaintained a case management for at 20 veterans, conducted workshops such as resume writing, interviewing skills, dress for success, stress release and more. I learned how to conduct case management and a new software. The hardest part of the job was not being able to find suitable employment for a veteran. The most enjoyable part of the job was going beyond my job description and see the veteran get medical benefits due to my refer. The technology for this local government was great and training also.On a typical day, I would go to a local bakery to be picked up by the people in charge of the internship program I was in. The program was held at a house, belonging to a local entrepreneur. The least enjoyable part of the job was working with people unprofessional, and ignorant. The most enjoyable part of the job was making homemade goods and selling them to the public. This job also gave me an opportunity to make friends with co-workers.I was tasked to implement safety features and render audits to  center staff. I also supervised a security staff of 45 around the clock. Working closely with staff and trainees in making there campus life safe and without concern. Implemented active shooter drills.At DOL Job at work and family life of employees are balances. Compensation at DOL is competitive while benefits are exceptional. Job security and advancement are guaranteed as long as the employee performs right. Management is always pro employees, while job culture is based on the mission of the agency.I enjoyed my last two positions with Goodwill and when my time was up and no longer eligible to work for them due to a four year limit I continued working as a volunteer at Foxwood because I enjoyed the job and the work I was doing.Management at this job was really, really good.  Lower-level employees, especially the older employees, were unqualified and routinely obstructed work from being done.  Once I got access to the systems that I needed access to (6 weeks) the lower level employees were suddenly really hostile.  Files disappeared. I got yelled at for retrieving files that I was supposed to have to do my job.  It's not a professional environment on the lower levels. People spent hours (say noon to 3) at lunch and worked through one or two cases per day when the cases only take 15 minutes at maximum to enter into the system. Trying to squeeze promotions out of management and eliminate rivals were my co-workers' main goals.The best part of the job was getting paid.  It was easy, light work and the pay seemed phenomenal for how little I was doing.A typical day was helping the clients as needed on the computer,It was very easy talking to the management team.  Good relationship with my co-workers.  The hardest part was having the clients wait for their turns for a computer.  The most enjoyable time was when we all spent time together.Worked with finance and accounting management to audit internal controls.  Worked on a variety of audits.  Prepared budgets, audit reports.  Management and trained audit staff members.Good company to work for with many benefits and chances for job advancement. Typical day on Second shift; Clock in and get report from 1st Shift, Start patrolling 30 acre grounds, Mentor and Monitor trainee behavior and report all problems to shift supervisor.Excellent place to work. very supportive people and very good management group.employee benefits also very good. career growth also very good as always more opportunities to explore on different tasks.Enjoyed training new employees on the technical nature of telecommunications and customer service.  Felt I was very good at customer relations, trouble shooting issues and communication.A typical day at work is just coming in 8am in the morning and continue working on the most recent task assigned to us by our boss. I have learned so much working for this department, from gaining more customer service skills to gaining more experience working in the Office field. The management and co-workers are very friendly, understanding and flexible. The hardest part of this job is when we get assigned a last minute assignment that needs to be done right away. The most enjoyable part of this job is having the opportunity to meet successful people on a daily basis and having the opportunity to gain more knowledge and experience working in the office field.The Department of Labor, Job Corps Division, gives youth ages 16-24 the opportunity and ability to continue growth and development in life through vocational and academic pursuits.  Many are able to correct mistakes of the past or enhance their education and skill development through disciplined training.  The residential setting is a huge adjustment for the trainees and only 2 of the 125 centers nationwide are non-residential.  Just as anything else in life, you get out what you put in!Co-Workers are energetic eager to go set health and safety inspections.  Management is easy and understanding, My enjoyable part of my job is going out in the field to translate.",,Washington,Washington,DC,2016-12-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/a13b7b4f-c8f6-42c9-ab92-385076e56f0e?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
