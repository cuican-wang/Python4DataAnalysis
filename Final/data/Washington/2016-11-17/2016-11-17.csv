3,3056.0,Data Scientist,MDA Information Systems LLC,4.0,1.0,"MDA is a fantastic company to work for. Upper management is very receptive to new ideas from all position levels. It gave me the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects to help develop my professional skills and I ended up leaving with an expanded network of friends and colleagues. The most difficult part of the job was dealing with the constant anxiety of budget-based layoffs, but everything else was enjoyable.",,Washington,McLean,VA,2016-11-17T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/data-scientist-job-mclean-va-us-175787362.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
7,3060.0,Data Scientist,System One,3.8,104.0,"It's nice to be able to go in when you want as long as the work is done before the next business day.  Flexability as well as able to pick up extra buildings is always available.Sys1 will place you at a customer site and you will be trained for that customers needs. Sys1 will bill the customer and pay you as their employee. You wont have any benefits as a contracting employee. Your co-workers will mostly be the customers but you may be placed with other SYS1 employees.I personally have trained half a dozen Techs for sys1 at my current customers location and the hard part for me is I make as much as my co-system1 workers make.I personally enjoy the people I work with both customer and sys1 but you have to remember they are the customer and not a friendly face.Fun work place, Good communication, Great learning skills, and awesome teamwork. Good starting pay, better pay once you're rolled over. At times it could be a lot of layoffs due to the lines breaking down in the warehouse. Once you start working good its guaranteed to work 40hrs and over with overtime pay.Management structure seems very disorganized. ""Too many Chiefs and not enough Indians"". Very hard to get in touch with immediate supervisor. They don't want to spend the money for quality equipment/tools. Work trucks onsite were over 10 years old and in very poor condition. Work/Life balance is WAY OFF-balance!!!.  You go to work before the sun comes up, and you usually do not get home until around 6:30pm. So, you can never get your personal business done before 5pm.....which usually requires you to take off work early to get any personal business done. I was contract only, so absolutely NO benefits whatsoever. Hourly and overtime only. THAT'S IT. No per diem. No medical. No dental. No vision. No 401K. NOTHING. Upper management never seemed to know what was going on.We worked long hard days, but I loved every minute of it.  You spent weeks on the road, but the job was very rewarding.  Working in the alternative energy field is something everyone can't say they have done and I have.Great company to work for. A typical day is recruiting coordinating and sourcing.The most enjoyable part is leaving the office on a daily basis knowing that I met my deadlines.Very accommodating. Top notch staff and co-workers. Occasional travel. Get to work independently during most travel. Great job for motivated, self-starter type of people.The bought out the company I was working for so I did not work for them long enough to give a good review. The did offer a benefits package but I did not need it because I already had insurance. I did not have much interaction with the company. Everything from my previous employer's contract stayed the same when they took ownership.System One has been a very good place to work because what I most needed was flexibility.  I returned to work after being a stay-at-home parent and still needed to be available to my young children.  they offered the flexibility I needed at a competitive salary.  I have worked for them for over 13 years.  The Management was always available if I needed any assistance.Salary comparableexcellent benefitsEmployees are excellentManagement excellentthe hardest for me is climbinggoing to the same place dailyEveryday we have a team meeting letting us know about daily safety and about things that go on though out the shifts. Team leaders are very good about giving us information about the line we are working on. I've learned from hand packing, stacking boxes onto a pallet, use of jacks/power jacks, doing rework, and numerous of different inspections of candy bar. Everybody is very friendly and like to help you learn the job you need to do that day. Hardest part would be the overtime but you accept that when taking the job. The people make the job easier making the day go by faster.Everyday was different.Moved to different building every other day.Worked around machines.Had a awesome Crew leader/Superiors!I love cleaning so that was a plus.Got a lot of walking in.Had a great staff of employees.Pulling over 1,000 pounds up hill on a manual forklift was challenging    Lots of tasks to do everyday.they would have to you work long ours 7 days straight with out a day off or asking. would not switch people around to learn anything productive. as for doing different duties.Thorough and always communicative.  Enjoyed my time with this company and would be willing to work again for them. Each person I spoke with was professional and responded timely.good co workers and great system of operations made it a good working environment but if problems occurred and you fell behind you got moved along and had to try to catch up and if other crews fell behind you also did on account of waiting.......went out of businessco-workers for good to work with. very enjoyable job.Project was very interesting to work on. learned a lot about nucleur power plants from Westinghouse employeesThey are small group of very talented people who work very well together.  They work on a broad range of pharmaceutical test equipment for some rather big clients.  A typical day of work was divided between service, calibration and validation and I normally worked independent.  l enjoyed doing what I was assigned to do.  The hard part was the extensive commuting back and forth to the different sites I worked on.i loved the job it was just to far away for me and my ride to get up and be there on time the people where really nice and great i just couldn't take then ride to and from thereFrom my experience it was a better than average temporary or contract company and would work for them in the future. It was a contract company based in Pittsburgh, PA and the location I was assigned to was in Shoreview, MN, being it was a contract company advancement was not available and little to no benefits were reasonable.Only worked one job with system one and it was ok. I contracted through westinghouse to work at power plants. The hours were long but OT was paid so it all worked out in the endManagement was not in control of issues that arose between shifts and assembly issues. Broken tools to work with. Really No wonder I would not qualify.",201 to 500,Washington,Reston,VA,2016-11-17T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/data-scientist-job-reston-va-us-176277985.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
8,3061.0,Data Scientist,Dewberry,4.0,26.0,"It has been a great company with good work life balance. Dewberry wants you to succeed financially and career wise while having fun life outside of work.Dewberry is a great company to work as various departments can be available in one area. I learned computer skills such as Autodesk AutoCad and Bentley Storm/Water Cad. In addition, I learned a lot of each municipality and city differs from one another.I traveled working in the pipeline survey area. It's more like they hire their friends that have no experience and let go people that actually know what they are doing.Nice place to work, all employees and the office manager, were always nice. I loved the schedule and all the people that work in this office were very professionalDewberry is has a great productive and friendly work environment. Everyday one can learn different things in technology as you are expected to be on your toes. I am very lucky to have a very relax and friendly co-workers and managers.The co-workers are the best part of this company.  They make up for the lack of support from management tolerable.  This company is very top heavy---which wasn't always the case and its sad to see that its come to that.Tasks included: Scheduling inspections for affected homes to assess damages from Hurricane Sandy such as finding unsafe amounts of lead or asbestos containing materials;Uploading data collected from Lead and Asbestos Reports onto a case management system to track progressUtilizing a switchboard phone system to handle a high volume of telephone calls in order to assess clientsâ€™ needs; andProofreading and editing Lead and Asbestos reports before entering data into case management system. It's a very lax work environment as long as you get your work done. You get your own work space and computer. You make your own schedule and the pay is hourly; I had a part time position so I was able to come in at any time as long as it was between 8am and 5pm from Mon - Sunday and complete up to 30 hours a week. Co-workers are very friendly; the environment is very professional.  There are copious amounts of paperwork that you must process accurately and efficiently.Emergency Management. Please let applicants apply.I performed field services for FEMA hurricane disaster management on Louisiana GulfCoast. Involved numerous assessments and monitoring, including public and privateproperty assessments; demolitions, salt water damaged tree removal DR 1607, DR 1603Hurricanes Rita and Katrina.A typical work day is working hard at the computer.I learned a lot at Dewberry, and the really cool thing is that I'm still learning a lot. To name a few, I learned how to use MicroStation and how to manage LiDAR data. The co-workers are very nice and easy to talk to. The ironic thing is that no one seems talkative, though.The hardest part of the job is being able to finish the task in the given time that's handed to you because the task can be a large quantity of work.The most enjoyable part(s) is constantly learning as you go and seeing the final product make a huge impact in a community. For example, the hazardous debris projects.I learned a lot at Dewberry in my field of work, and gave me the work experience I needed and involve myself in. It gave me the opportunity to work with a team, on an individual level, and on my own to develop ways to better myself and the way we worked. However, management seems a little sloppy. While I was expected to be temporary, the way it was handled was poor and was essentially laid off without being told so. While the main project was coming to a close; they told us to find other work within the office -- but no other projects were in line leaving many of us stranded.The most important thing to Dewberry is that you have an engineering degreeDay of traveling from job to job. Management errors at times. Most co-worker were hard workers. I learned time management, How to lead a crew, operated different survey equipmentGreat technical people and strong managers. No strong growth for technical people. Most of the fast grown in their career are those who management to move to the management track.In this position I learn how to review contracts, PO, mod, etc. and jobs set up and to billing clients on a monthly basis.  The hard part is to get project managers to submit their invoice proofs on a timely manner.I enjoy going into work everyday! The office environment is great and the work is fun.Performed intensive assessments of damaged homes and estimated repairs required for habitability requirements.  Separate calculations from Xactimate sketches were made to differentiate actual storm damage, previous repairs, new repairs, deferred maintenance and neglect.  Worked with a cohesive group of talented individuals with a very wide range of background from all over the United States.Received great work experience in a variety of fields of Civil EngineeringGreat place to work.  Would recommend it to anyone looking to work here.I have worked here for several years and the company is nice to work for. Headquarters is in Fairfax VA.Depending on your position you can work a lot of overtime although they pay for it which is nice. The contract work can be stressful and there are ridiculous demands at times. Overall, not bad benefits and a good experience.Overall the environment is good. Not a lot of training in other areas and no room for advancement if you are working within Administration. Everything is outsourced to the Corporate office in Virgina.",,Washington,Fairfax,VA,2016-11-17T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/data-scientist-job-fairfax-va-us-176269172.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=3,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
