215,3268.0,Experimental Human Stress Scientist,Clinical Research Management,3.4,9.0,"It's hard to rate CRM as I am employed by them but working offsite at a military installation and it would be hard to accurately rate what the enviroment is like working directly with CRM on a day to day basis. I can say that they are very communicative though and always try to make employees aware of any company changes, benefit changes or contract changes. Because I am in a contract position, I do not think it would be fair to rate compensation but I do like the benefits. I have always been able to reach my manager when needed and he has always helped me out when he could. Overall, I have been happy with CRM.Contractor for CRM working in Frederick.  Enjoy working with the people in my division.  Management is good, especially Human Resources.I am contractually bound at this time from making any derogatory or damaging remarks, comments, or statements about the company.I've enjoyed my time as an employee with this company. They offer competitive benefits packages to include paid vacation, sick leave, and retirement plans. I highly recommend this company for employement.A relatively hands-off federal contracting company.  They are not very involved or knowledgeable about the details of their employees work environment with the government client, and relatively ineffectual in helping when problems arise.Great company with good work life balance. Real concern for employees,  sponsors and clinical trials.  Does not put metrics ahead of quality.Felt like I had a new supervisor every 3-6 months because of high turnover rate in HQ management.A typical day at work includes:Perform studies as related to the project Coordinate and perform various functions related to research project Perform study schedulingAnalyze research dataCollect and enter research dataDevelop and maintain research databasePrepare survey keys and all required PDF FilesPrepare initial survey draftsAssist with the scanning and cleaning of dataAssist with Quality Control of dataTrain new team members on data collection proceduresI was responsible for our Talent Acquisition Team as the Manager. My role allowed me the opportunity to source, recruit, and hire professionals in the Biomedical Field. The culture at this company provided a great team environment with the management and co-workers. The hardest part of the job was working with our government customers and being able to adapt to their ever changing needs. So there was a lot of turnover due to the positions being contract positions under the government contracts.The most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying the customers and knowing every time we hired someone we were increasing company revenue. We had a direct impact on that in our Talent Acquisitions Team.",,Washington,Silver Spring,MD,2016-11-07T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/99b98990-455b-4445-b636-78cca743e58c?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
