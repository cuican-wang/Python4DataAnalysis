855,3908.0,Sr. Geospatial Systems Engineer,Defense Engineering Inc,2.4,5.0,"Huge discrepancy with internal equity and no clear path of sight concerning corporate initiatives besides getting new business and the bottom line. Left in dark concerning direction of the company and future growth. Experiencing extreme growing pains as the company moves from small to large. Corporate staff is more focused on the bureaucratic ways of the olden times instead of setting DEI apart and developing talent. Micromanagement runs rampant. Was once run as a family oriented business but those at the helm are choking the organizational culture, there is little left. There is no advocate for the employee.  Work-life balance non-existent.The company has serious issues with compensating employees for work done outside of your job description. You are constantly being asked to perform duties that don't pertain to your job description and when you inquire about compensation, you are continuously given the runaround. They are quickly developing a negative image in the contracting world because of their lack of structure and knowledge. I understand that companies go through growing pains, but there is a point in which things become ridiculous. Also some individuals are underpaid, while others are overpaid.The culture of this company is antiquated with inflated egos poorly managing the staff. I question their ability to obtain or maintain government contracts. There is poor knowledge of the contracting world among management and compensation and business etiquette is poor. This is a horrible place to work and I strongly advise anyone applying for a job here to find a more established business.They took good care of me and the benefits were awesome.  They went to bat for me when negotiating my pay.  They offer a really competitive 401K plan and were willing to pay for me to attend Cisco Live in San Diego, CA.  Really nice people to work with.Defense Engineering Inc. (DEI) is a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, headquartered in Arlington, Virginia.Very small company.
