687,3740.0,Mathematician / Statistician,ECS Federal,3.9,15.0,"The company is good but you do not receive a raise and the only way to receive a higher salary is to get a higher paying position....only theres no room for advancement to a higher paying position...pretty much stuck.Great location, great group of people to work with. Continuous opportunities for growth. Excellent pay and benefits.m Management is very knowledgeable and friendly.ECS is a great company to work for. Management is very understanding of balancing your personal and work life. Only cons with ECS is the compensation and job advancement. The salary is not adequate to your job responsibilities.Management is supportive while we work off site with the Goverment client. Upper management makes everyone feel like they are part of the team.The company is a great company to work for they are really understanding and it is a very open environment. Great coworkers for the most part. My supervisor was great just wish it was a little more money.Working with ECS provides us the ability to provide real-time support to ongoing military operations around the globe. By supporting U.S. Army efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, or training and validating Field Support Teams prior to deployment, our work is relevant and necessary.I have been working with ECS for around 1 year now and feel they are a great company to work for. ECS Federal is a good company to work for, very diverse both in employees they hire and in job opportunities.ECS is your typical mid-sized consulting firm. Unless you work at the main office, you will more than likely be one amongst the many faceless minions. There's not much room for advancement, and the benefits are pretty lacking. The latter wasn't always the case, but beware: health insurance is now based on a defined benefit structure rather than a defined contribution, and to get a decent plan, you will have to shell out $$$$The helpdesk is a great entry level job into the IT world. Starting with tier 1, employees deal with different applications and work to help the customer solve their issues or escalate the ticket up for further assistance.Working as a government contractor I get to see the other side of the federal work coin. Where the brunt of the effort is focused and needed. As a contractor I do nearly all the same tasks as my government counterparts, but with the added incentive of knowing inaction or complacency can get me removed. The change of pace, the pressure to perform, has done more for me in terms of desire to improve than my years in government service. Best part is I am allowed to work with whomever I choose on the contract. I can surround myself with equally motivated co-workers from both the contract and our government peers. Allowing me to surround myself with the best people on both sides.On par with other contracting/consulting firms; not better or worse than others for which I've worked. Compensation and benefits similar to competitors.The constant churning of responsibilities and management expectations make this a difficult place to be. Add to the fact that you never know if/when a restructuring will take place and leave you unemployed!ECS is a great place work. The company management are involved in work and personal aspects of the employees. The work is interesting and they encourage employee growth.Daily challenges understand priority and workflow. Managers not empowered to set or establish priority and timelines. Constantly changing priorities. Do it because I said to attitude. Limited appreciation for individual experience and input.",,Washington,Arlington,VA,2016-09-27T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/765a1546-4d00-480e-8b6e-1f7e88e67096?mescoid=1500150001001&jobPosition=32,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
