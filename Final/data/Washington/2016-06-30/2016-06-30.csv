171,3224.0,Expert Data Analytics Engineer,CSRA,3.4,66.0,"CSRA has been very good to me. My coworkers are great and management keeps you informed of everything. Great place to get your start in the IT Field. I love it here!A positive work environment without the typical stress of deadlines. I learned that a full Agile development lifestyle can be very effective with Government customers. Some of the best so-workers I've had the pleasure to be a part of. The hardest part of the job was keeping the communication open throughout the team and having higher management support a decision\solution until the end. With an Agile approach there was no direction or an individual to make the difficult technical decisions when needed causing re-work.*	Ensure that all HIPAA and Government security requirements with regards to sharing and storage of Personal Health information are meet at all times.*	Maintain the timelines on enrollment/credentialing schedules, communicate with providers and other departments to update as needed, clarify carrier information requirements, and maintain a strict level of confidentiality for all matters pertaining to provider credentialsI have only worked for CSRA for just over a year now and it appears to be the right fit for me.  The management team are good, hard working people who seem to genuinely care for the workers.  My co-workers and peers are great to work with.  They work as a team and extended family.  So far, this has been a great transition from Active Duty Military.Morale is poor.  People seem very unhappy.  There is high employee turnover.  Senior management is very uncaring and disorganized.  In the quest to cut costs they have made it very frustrating for people to do their jobs. Worst place I ever worked.CSRA has a smaller budget than most Defense Contracting companies, and therefore, they pay their employees far less than bigger contractors, such as Raytheon for example.  If any employees want any On-the-Job Training (OJT), you LITERALLY have to break an arm and a leg to get CSRA to fund any training related to your career field.If you wish to work for a company that will provide you with job security and advancement; this is not the one.  Compensation is horrible espeically with the amount of work you will be given.  It is rare that they back fill positions when others leave, so that means triple the work for you and no additional pay.Worked at CSRA. The compensation is very competitive. The culture for my project really depends on the federal client. Had to be in the office no later than 8:30. The Agile Sprints were 10 days and very fast pace. Lots of work.If you are looking for short term employment working in a call centertalking to rude immigrants all day. Supervisors cheat you outof you PTO time. If you have a family member pass away you will be forced to use sick or vacation time. All though the company states they cover bereavement..Some days were more stressful then others. Everyday I learned something new which in my case was a good thing. Coworkers are great. Management staff was there to assist.The company used to be CSC.  We merged with SJA in October of 2015. Though they are trying be a a more ""hip"" place, its still has a  way to go.  Not all of the offices are on board with things that make coming to work fun and exciting.Most people I worked with have very poor skill sets and are lazy, Management are very unprofessional. Most will only speak to you if your a certain rank... many haven't transitioned to civilian life. No raises, Never recognized for work.. not what you know its who likes you. If you need a job go for it.I enjoy the individual and group training of the soldiers. I like to make sure they are properly trained to survive. This job allows me some freedoms to change how things are taught and find different ways to teach the same thing.  Some are visual learners but most are hands on.  I like the variety of individuals and groups.In the two years I was there, the company decided not to give anyone raises one year, because a merger wasn't working out the way they'd planned. They hadn't given managers a raise in five years. They also transitioned two weeks of sick leave and two weeks of vacation into three weeks of paid time off for me. I only had two weeks of vacation as a new hire, but some were getting four weeks of vacation, and they also got three weeks of PTO. Those who had accrued up to six months of vacation had six weeks to use it or lose it. Nobody took six weeks of vacation; the company saved a fortune. Asked, in a conference call, to justify significant cuts in the vacation accruals of their most veteran employees, the company president responded, ""I'm sorry that impacted you that way. Next question.""Lots of pressure to produce good work, but no recognition when you did, and with no raises, absolutely nothing but your salary for compensation.Company is not really caring for it employees.. There is no benefit to be a employee of CSRA over being a consultant here.. THEY treat you as temporary employees and never cross train of place you elsewhere if one project ends.. AVOID itAmid restructures a whole lot of turnover has occurred and salaries have been affected drastically. New requirements have been placed for roles with no salary adjustments to match certifications.The Company continues to experience new management changes and most likely will continue until next year.  Excellent employees who have great skills and knowledge of consulting.CSRA has a great work life balance. A great deal of the employees, subcontractor and military personnel are friendly and good to work with.I would just like to thank CSRA for the opportunity to work for a great company. The communication with management to subordinates and other workers is awesome. The pay is also great for the hours work. Great leadership and well experienced personnel on ground to help operation continue in a smooth process.Originally started as CSC working on the Army Material Command Logistics Modernization Project. Last year the Federal segment of the company merged with SRA to become CSRAI've been with CSRA for a few months and I enjoy the company and the colleagues who I work with. There is a huge opportunity for growth. My work schedule was fit to coincide with my personal life and that a plus for me.","10,000+",Washington,Herndon,VA,2016-06-30T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/d53c2054-ffc2-4c2a-b369-8d83ba43fef2?mescoid=4300761001001&jobPosition=6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
