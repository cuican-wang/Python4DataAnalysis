24,3077.0,Senior Advanced Analytic Applications Engineer,General Dynamics Mission Systems,3.6,156.0,"Learned a lot while employed with GDMS. Was able to cross train in all departments. No room for advancement At this time in a different department that I haven't already worked in.In the beginning, this was a great place to work. Personal growth and advancement were encouraged. Pay was a little lower than the competition, but security was better than the competition, so it worked out. Today, pay is still a little low, and there have been several cuts in the benefits. Work hours vary greatly from position to position. I honestly enjoy my job, but work hours as a salaried employee can be ridiculous. Middle management seems to normally care about what is happening with the employee and will help you to grow. Senior management within Mission Systems varies, but is usually appears to understand the project and includes several technical people. It will be interesting to see how the upcoming election changes the workplace. Overall, I still recommend this company as a workplace.General Dynamics is like any other major defense contractor when it comes to employees and cutting the profits. Employees rank last middle management a little higher and Corporate taking the biggest cut of the pie. GD was the first large defense contractor that I worked for and in order to substantiate their bloated corporate profit the employees were offered expensive substandard insurance options. The stress to produce was constantly in motion and the stress level was out of this world. I saw literally a 100 percent turn over in the year that I worked for them. Prior to being laid off the stress got so bad that I came within an inch of walking away and forgetting that I ever worked for them. If the employee didn't kiss butt to the customer they were gone in a heartbeat.The company went down hill much in five years. Management likes to pretend that they are still in the military, ignore rules, lie to workers, hire friends, blame others for bad decisions.Many middle age workers have a GD pension, a military pension, a 401k and soon will draw Social Security, and often like to talk about how much they have saved and the great plans they have. The younger workers get a 401k and have to listen to how much better the others have it, and have to accept that they will not be able to afford to retire.Management only looks out for itselfOpen door policy does not workPay is goodBenefits are fairExpense reports get processed quicklySuccessfully ignores all of Colin Powell Leadership GuidanceGreat management and benefits. Flexible work hours, tough objectives and talented personnel made the job an amazing experience.Daily work is good with some long hours as working with the government brings unexpected periods of added work loads. Company is going through a rough period where many employees are leaving due to economic turbulence.From what I hear, this company was a lot better in the past.  However, they have been slowly but steadily reducing benefits to the point where they are barely competitive.Good ol' boy network is firmly established and there is a pretty clear line between the connected few and the rest of the organization.  Management is basically out of touch with the day-to-day operations and generally poor morale of the employees.Decent salary for new hires and well-maintained facilities to work in.However, after a little over 2 yrs here, I realize it's time for me to move on, and I'm finding that my experience here is of no interest to the 3 companies I've actually had the opportunity to interview with.Uggh!The company is well positioned to continue growing but severely lacks a kind of company culture that makes people excited to work there. It's a comfortable job but promotions come slowly and the work gets boring very quickly.We would arrive and open the site, Do preventative maintenance on the vehicles. Get any failed items repaired or replaced from our parts warehouse. shipped bad parts to vendors received parts from vendors. Inventoried and store all equipment and tracked all repairs. compiled spread sheets of repaired items for upper management. when we are all finished we lay out all of the equipment for the military to inventory and sign for the vehicle. The hardest part of the job is having a inventory in excess of 100 million dollars for a standard time frame of 5 months. The most enjoyable part is finishing with no lose of equipment.Flexible work schedule, very supportive of military life, always engaged in some type of project and you are able to chose your career path.The people who work at GD are all very nice, it's a lovely place to work in terms of flexibility and work/life balance. Management does a good job of sticking up for employees.That being said, there is very little control over the direction your career goes. You will get bounced around from one project to the next with little regard for making the best use of your skills or where you want to go with your career in the future.If you are a hard worker, looking for challenges, growth and working in a team environment then this is a good place to work. If you like working on projects that build systems to help protect our troops, our country and our way of life then you can't help but want to work here.This company is ok if you are starting out in the workforce. Definitely not a place to be at if you're seeking growth in logistics. I've been with this company for over 5 years and can't to leaveGood work environment at this location, which is one of the smaller GDMS locations. Management is fine. Had a good boss and peers.The first 4 years were pretty decent other than the fact that I was always traveling and didn't get much in the way of raises, or a promotion.  But I did what I was hired to do and was left alone to get it done for the most part.  I had oversight where I needed it and help to accomplish my goals. The remaining 4 years there were trash, they cut our benefits to the bone, lied to us, harassed us, changed policy every other day, so no one knew what was going on anywhere, I was doing the jobs of 3 people and getting paid less than when I started, and when I was Injured, I was threatened and harassed even more.Great place to work, challenging environment to learn and grow.  Flexible work schedule.  Good pay and benefits.  Great people to work with.If you're under 35, good luck trying to fit in here.  The average age is probably closer to 40-45 or maybe older, with many employees only sticking around because they're waiting to get their pensions.  There's very much an old boys' club atmosphere since a lot of folks have been there for 25 years or more and for many, their tenure at GD spans their entire career. As such, there's very little room for growth while you're expected to just play your part and won't learn much outside the confines of your specific role.  Management largely doesn't care about your career development because they're often not even located in the same office or state.Employees are very passionate about their jobs! They develop excellent product for the government systems part of GD. I worked for this company when they were also part of GTE.Typical government contractor environment. Beige walls and linoleum floors. Minimal training budget, essentials only, plenty of politics and constant reorganizations.The engineering staff and the technical know how made General Dynamics (once Motorola) a leader in the communications industry. Due to the current management style annual earnings has become more important than customer satisfaction. On the positive side there is a lot of diversity in individual assignments. Co-workers are friendly and get together outside of work often.","5,001 to 10,000",Washington,Oakton,VA,2016-11-30T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/senior-advanced-analytic-applications-engineer-job-oakton-va-us-176893485.aspx?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=7,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Provided information to Dr offices with status of loans and paper work they may need. Transferred customers to correct department such verification, sales, etc.. Dealing with irate office on check that should of arrived days ago. Or maybe an office that wanted to sign up but did not meet qualifications to do so. Another depressing part was letting customer know they were not approved for the loan. Had pizza parties once month for setting goals on productivity. Won gifts on raffles such Christmas parties and they also gave my kids gifts for Christmas.Working at Capital One Bank has been an amazing experience for me. I have been in a fast paced teller role, at times alone, working through pressure effectively and efficiently all while have a great conversation with the customer. I've been a Relationship Banker where I build lasting financial relationships to help the customer short and long term. I've been in leadership roles where I lead the team successfully, perform duties, and make executive decisions on a Branch Manager level. Although sometimes the hours can be rough, I enjoy every bit of it.Before accepting a management position with this bank, I was warned by industry colleagues about this banks culture and lack of advancement and nepotism.  Well, I took the chance and found that it was true.  Upper management will only promote their friends or hire them with no experience to the role.  Most advancements are for upper leaderships close confidants. Senior Managers are clueless with the department they manage and out of touch of the daily grind.  The company offers great benefits and PTO's and the company sponsored events are great.  Overall, if you are over 40 yrs. old, you will feel unease since they will change the department and create confusion to all associates and will be laid off.  Overall, great company if you are in upper management role and good working relationship with them.Manage and Coach Team Members, Direct Onboarding of New Employees, Conduct Staff Training Sessions, Adhere to Federal Regulations, Complete Monthly Operational Audits, Prepare Daily Over/Short Report, Complete Daily Closing Paperwork, Review New Accounts for Accuracy and Completeness, Champion Service Excellence Culture, Product Education, Referrals / Sales, Transaction Processing, Cashier’s Checks, Cash Advances, Cash Handling, Vault Change Orders, ATM Custodian, Open /Close and Revise Accounts (Checking, Savings, Certificate of Deposit, Safe Deposit Box), Online Set Up / Maintenance.Over the years I have grown a lot working at Capital One because of the opportunities, classes, and encouragement of management.  There are people here who share the same passion and as one team the dream of having superior customer service internally and externally becomes a reality daily.  My favorite part of the job is my daily interaction with people, I really enjoy pouring into people and giving them the tools they need to succeed.  I have learned that hard work, determination, and and consistency are the keys to being successful.  Creating impactful moments is something want to do everyday because its those moments that matter the most and help the company grow.I cannot say enough about the company and the leadership. My three years with Capital One were a blend of positive working relationships, professional development and personal growth. Work life balance made it possible for me to enjoy the fruits of my labors. Long days were not uncommon, but there was always someone there right alongside you to support or lead as needed. Great management team, solid benefits and a fun work environment!Job satisfaction and advancement are largely within your own control.  You must be aggressive, declarative and go after what you want.  The office environment is pleasant, convenient and has lots of perks -- onsite gym, bank, copy facility, health facility, pharmacy.  They provide shuttle service to other buildings.  The culture is spotty...some teams are great and others are disastrous.  This has a lot to do with your individual leader.  They encourage participation in outside organizations, pursuit of additional training and education and have a generous compensation program.  Overall, this is one of the best places I have ever worked.A typical day is taking inbound banking inquiries such as transferring funds and offering beneficial products to customers. Not that much management around since they are constantly changing. There was an awesome co- worker atmosphere, the hardest part was the poor work/life balance. They said that I would not have to close for more than sixth months, but it has been over ten months. The most enjoyable part was making the calls fun and interacting with the customers on a more personable level.A typical day is spent working with my team on a variety of interesting and challenging projects.  Management has been very good in helping us learn new skills and make our team stronger. The recent transition to becoming a ""technology company"" has forced us to learn a lot of new things relating to cloud computing and also how to implement a suitable DevOps model in a very short period of time.  I couldn't ask for a better team.  Everyone on my team is smart and we enjoying learning from each other.  We also mentor one another and there are no ""domain experts"" within the team.The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the massive amount of work that has to be done with very few people doing the work.The most enjoyable part of my job is working on new things and trying out new technologies.  The company is very good in giving us the freedom to branch out and experiment.From day to day, the job is pretty consistent. On the phone servicing high value credit card customers. I work a ten hour day. In my history with capital one there have been many focus sessions on handling different types of customers, ways to change your communication style etc to help you excel to the very best of your ability. The hardest part of the job is the monotony. Though the culture is always changing, quality assurance expectations, incentive changes, etc, at the end of the day the job is still the same and can grow tiring. The things I enjoy most are the people and the extras. We have team outings quarterly, snack carts, merchandise, and competitions to keep things lively and interesting. The benefits are also phenomenal.Offer great work life balance.  Decent benefits.Fairly competitive salary.  Onsite gym and medical office in some locations.  Too many organizational changes and redeployments within Technology. Your bonus will be based on how strong your manager will present your skills against others - so hope for a manager who will fight for you.... Very difficult to be promoted as each department is only allowed so many promotions per year.Working for one of the Best Places to Work in a Banking culture, full benefits and a progressive attitude was a great opportunity to have. Exceptional training, mentoring, advancement and bonuses to truly make a great salary too.High stress environment, bilingual incoming calls, resolving escalated issues for customers and being empowered to arrive at real solutions in a one call scenario. Great work environment.COAF is really a great company to work for. They work hard to keep morale high and really recognize and compensate you for your hard work. My only issue, is that you are reprimanded for things outside of your control (ie a customer cannot or will not pay). Other than that, I highly recommend this company. Not just for employment but for services, too.It was an absolute pleasure to work at Capital One. I have nothing negative to say. Working with my co-workers was a wonderful experience. Most of management was very supportive and available when I needed them. The best part of the job was helping a customer overcome challenges and giving them hope. I've learned to trust my own abilities from my experiences working here.While at Capital One I was able to learn all of the skills that I possess today.  I wrote policies and procedures, assisted with third party agencies to audit financial transactions, and work with internal employees to resolve account issues.  Worked out of Excel and Word on a daily basis.  Created PowerPoint presentation to give to all levels of management.  Answer and return calls in a timely manner and reply to department specific emails.Working here was amazing. Knowing the customer by name and having conversations that where not only about there transactions but also about personal life. Management cared about employee's opinion and worked hard to satisfy their needs. The hardest part was having to leave the company to continue school. The most enjoyable part of working for this company was the overall experience being around management, coworkers, and customers.This is by far the best company I have ever worked for. The atmosphere in our whole building is just friendly and welcoming. Of course there is always one or two bad apples, but for the most part everyone is a pleasure! There are so many opportunities for advancement and growth. Scheduling is extremely flexible and they give a good balance between personal life and work. The Las Vegas site even has an on site health center! I had to leave the company to relocate and unfortunately they do not have a call center where I'm headed, but if I ever return I would definitely reapply!A typical day at work consists of customer service through our call center.  Each call is personal and has its own impact.  I have learned to think outside the box and really put myself into the shoes of the customer as a call center representative.  Leadership is great here and truly ensure you are doing the best you can.  My co-workers make the day go by with conversation and the atmosphere is very comfortable. The hardest part of my job is a dissatisfied customer. I strive to make sure every customer feels valued, so when one is upset after we disconnect it impacts me on a personal level. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I know that I have changed the mood of an upset card holder from a company detractor to a company promoter.Very enjoyable and energetic environment both on campus and  off.  Ratings for compensation and benefits plus security and advancement do not apply as I was a consultant.  Salary rates paid to consultants are very competitive if not more so than other financial institutions or employers for the level of skill required and experience across multiple platforms.Very flexible work environment with the ability for 100% remote work as on-site is not required for firewall administration, design, etc. except in the event of a failure.  Co-workers and management were always available for assistance when needed in order to help the employee and organization succeed in desired goals.A great company to work for if you can get into the right location.  There are a lot of benefits presented by the company, such a tuition reimbursement but managers tend to not like working with students.  The company promotes something but it's not enforced by management which is why it can be a great job if you can get in with good management.Capital One was a pleasurable experience for the most part. They ask a lot but compensate well with salary, bonus, and amazing benefits package that includes not only 401(k) but investments as well! My experience was in a call center. It was fairly laid back although it felt like high school most days due to the lack of maturity exhibits by some associates and most notably management. As my first corporate experience out of college, I learned that you have to stay on top of your stuff in every aspect if you want to move forward. You have to take charge of your future and if one person says ""no"", keep asking people until you get the answer you seek or find out how to change that ""no"" to a ""yes"".","10,000+",Washington,Mclean,VA,2016-11-30T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/22b0835c-872f-4ce7-a654-0d1b519ce39a?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=9,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
