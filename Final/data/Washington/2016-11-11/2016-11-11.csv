84,3137.0,Data Scientist Solution Architect,Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC),4.1,1300.0,"Work for them for over 6 years, great company! Worked on a variety of Coast Guard support contracts. They care about their staff.SAIC is, in my opinion, primarily focused on getting the job done and protecting their resources - the people that work for them. Typically at work, people work with one another on complex problems and the atmosphere seems open to others asking questions.Really the only down side of the management is that they're intent on starting new initiatives to benefit employees, but there is often little follow through.The most enjoyable part of the job is when the customer expresses their gratitude and delight at the job we've done.It was my favourite place. The people, the contracts, the systems we worked on. Fascinating. But these are government contracts and those come with rules and the contracts are sometimes awarded as 1 year with 3 extra years optioned. So carefully charging correctly and staying in POP dates and not charging incorrectly is a big deal. Option years suck because that means your only guaranteed 1 year. They could go somewhere else for the next 3. Every year, your worried about the next option year being approved. It's like working on one year contracts and stressing every year that you might be laid off.The SAIC team that I worked with in Charleston, SC took on projects in a team orientated manner.  Most work performed had input from other team members and project managers. This helped in preventing errors in projects and put more confidence behind the product. Also, management was good about being flexible when it came to needing time off for family, etc.. Overall my time at SAIC was a pleasant experience and I was able to learn, take on new tasks, and grow within the company.work Monday threw Friday 8 hours days start early A.M. when I'm home I typically test equipment an build the system up before we send them out on road before we install them into vehicle's. I travel all over united states to different military bases. Typically about five to seven guys who go on the road.  we  make sure after we install the system into vehicles we make sure it is operational then we train an teach military guys that the system is up an running an answer any question that they have.Working in a small dynamic engineering team, we have set product goals to meet quarterly. I work closely with a group of engineers that are motivated and innovative, like me. The culture of the company is very cohesive. I have enjoyed working here with much gratitude, and I hope to accrue the same with a new company in the mid-west where my parents reside.SAIC is prime on several contracts so it is easy to go to a different project if you wish, but for a company whose only product is it's people it really does not invest in its product. They cut benefits and then the following year sent out flyer bragging about record profits. That just has not sat well with many employees.A typical day at work involved classroom instruction with students from a specialized branch of the Navy. I learned that no matter how much you think you know that there is always something new to learn. The client management was very demanding and did not provide much in the way of resources. The Corporate management of SAIC was supportive and went out of their way to take care of us. My co-workers were all former military professionals that provided subject matter expertise on many different subjects.The hardest part of the job was the long hours, many times in excess of 14 hour work days. The most enjoyable part of the job was the realization of our students comprehension and application of the instruction we provided for them.I was lucky enough to  work for SAIC on the same contract for 5+ years.  The pay was excellent and the travel was exhaustive at times, but rewarding.  If I could, I would stay with SAIC but our contract was not renewed and the Company does not have any positions open for my skill set.At SAIC I have learned a lot about working with customers and working as a team. There are many high quality people with a lot of skills which I work with.The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to work with a group of professional people and knowing I am performing work for the military.It was a contract job but the Management treated all staff very well with great benefits. It was a great environment to work and there was a great team work in accomplishing the tasks.Unfortunately the contract ended and we were laid off.I love this company, it is a fast paced work environment that lets you utilize both technical knowledge and common sense to get the job some. the people are a great to be around, and the work is enjoyable.I have worked here for four years and enjoy helping the training of our first responders in courses for terrorist attacks. You get to work in a unique environment.This job was Gov't  contract work, so your job is always on the line, I learned so much at this job, as I was just a material handler but I wore many hats, wherever needed I was there.Great contractor company to get your feet wet in. Poor management at 1602. Fun people to work around but upper management they all are friends and if your not in the CLICK you get walked on. It's hard to advance unless you know someone.The managers are dedicated to looking after the employees and supporting needs for change or adjustment based on the growing development of SAIC and its clients.Good company to work for.  Managers take care of their people.  Great opportunities for networking within and outside of the company.  Lots of opportunities to change work locations to move around.SAIC has been a great opportunity. This company believes in mentoring their employees and ensuring professional growth. SAIC is a fast moving environment that requires extensive detail to systems and paperwork.A work day was always filled with something new. From preparing for a class to being out on the range. I learned a lot about self motivation and resiliency. Along with hosting classes I had my own personal duties consisting of ordering supplies, organizing my co workers schedules, accompanying the managers for meeting. My managers where very kind and had a vast knowledge base if I ever had any questions. There was nothing really to hard about working there. We worked as a team and someone was always able and willing to help the next person. I really enjoyed the fact that everyday was different and that we worked so closely with or customers.SAIC provides a great stable work environment. At SAIC you will work with some of the brightest and smartest people in the whole  country.The hardest part of the job is when the client does not take your recommendations.Best of part of job is that SAIC customers are world  class.I know it's hard to claim, but there are few places that truly have that organic relationship between management and workers. SAIC happens to be one such place. At no time do the workers feel under appreciated. That being stated it should be pointed out that SAIC is in the same work category as Booze Allen, Harris, Lockheed Martin and other DOD contract companies. So if you don't care for uncertain futures or periodically searching for another place of employment, seems to happen every bid cycle. Avoid. However if none of that bothers you and you love the excitement of it all, SAIC is the place for you.","10,000+",Washington,MCLEAN,VA,2016-11-11T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/e58a9fc5-5d48-44ee-9268-61a9095d050f?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
