90,3143.0,Data Scientist,Hassett Willis & Company,2.7,3.0,"Company is very young and energetic; management is very focused on personality, politics, socializing and cliques and somewhat cynical, possibly Machiavellian.  Co-workers not professionally diverse but eager to learn.  Company very focused on formula driven growth rather than innovation, although some staffers are inquisitive about learning other disciplines and innovation.  Most enjoyable part of the company is working with an enthusiastic staff, while hardest part is team building - not a team culture.  I really enjoy working here! The Downtown DC office is a fun environment to work in -complete with a foosball table/game room and massage chair. The Partners of the company are really down to Earth, easy to get along with, and you can tell they really care about the employees. HWC does a lot of nice things for its employees like Happy Hours, parties, monthly birthday cakes, and a paid day of community service. The management team really seems to notice and reward hard work in terms on bonuses and promotions.wouldn't work there again... the management sucks and the projects are unpredictable",,Washington,Washington,DC,2016-10-27T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/4d7ece72-55f7-4656-ae14-0b1dba1ea9ae?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=30,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

410,3463.0,Senior Biologist - Advanced Human Cancer Models,ATCC,2.8,10.0,"Stability, low pay, not so great management and co-workers were not very cooperative either.  It was a good experience as a first time job.Be very careful before you sign up here. Lots of politics (particularly from HR and upper management) lead to high turnover. Lots of people unhappy with the place; with a smaller group of people who have been at ATCC since the beginning of time. These folks will never leave, but they're not interested in doing much work. The new people have high turnover because they're not as tied to the vacation benefits that increase over time.Pay scale is low and a 'bell curve' to give year end bonuses and raises makes for a ""zero sum gain"" culture- if you get a good review, it means it's not likely I could get a good review too, because the manager only has a few of them to give. This makes people unhappy; they feel like they have to wait until next year to get the higher bonus or good review. Or they look for another job. HR says ""like it or leave"" and many people have left. If you are interviewing ask about the turnover of the newer people- HR talks about how the ""average"" person stays X years. But they're averaging in those lifers who have been there 25 + years.They keep hiring more senior directors and senior VPs; they need people who get the work done. It's kind of a mess. This is a temporary stop for me, and for many others.I have worked 4 years at ATCC and since that time I've seen 3 company heads and 3 department heads. If you think that is bad, the turnover rate for lower level employees is worse. Management from senior to supervisor level are either incompetent or in a state of fear. Since I started, 2 lab supervisors out of the 4 in our department have been removed due to abusive behavior toward their charges. The lab equipment is horrible and older then my teenage son. There are no promotions, no advancement. The pay is on the extreme low end for Northern Va (the CEO's is an exception of course).  I've been in the Biotech business for over 20 years and this place is the worst place I've ever worked.ATCC is a good place to start your career, but it's very hard to advance.  They're willing to hire new grads and career changers, and you will get a solid foundation in laboratory work.  Upper management is almost continually churning and they prefer to hire middle management from outside the company. Morale seems to be low with many employees.ATCC provided all student employees with everything needed to complete their job. Including an outline on how to work while being a student. The most enjoyable part of work was hearing the praises given by all the teachers who were more than happy to strike up conversations even if you weren't their direct student.Before working at ATCC I was a Food Service Manager for fifteen years,  I suddenly became divorced and needed more of a work/life balance because of my two small boys so I left food service and started working for ATCC in a entry level position as an invoicing clerk.  This was my first real office job so I have learned a lot and also brought a lot of skills with me from the food service industry. My co-workers are great people very helpful.  The hardest part of the job is Tuesdays and days after a holiday because that is when the check volume is the highest.Bullied by long time e'ees. Micro-management. Mandatory OT at straight time pay.  My way or the highway co-workersManagement does not support its employees. Decent hours and low pay.my department IRR was not the best department to work for at ATCC  high turnover and inconsistant manangement",,Washington,Gaithersburg,MD,2016-10-27T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/85afbf8d-f2ed-4320-a4a5-2da8107d83c7?mescoid=1900240001001&jobPosition=35,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
