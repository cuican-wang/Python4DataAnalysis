Productive wonderful living arrangement.Great response from company if an issue.Great co-workers and immediate supervisor. Medical benefits cost WAY too much.  $1500+/month for married person/no kids.  Upper management is immature and not qualified and/or experienced to be in management role.Management played favorites with employees.Never followed the Collective Bargining Agreement.No so called Supervision of employees.When a concern was bought up, supervisor would say"" I don't want to talk about it""I focus on my assignments and get it done.

My coworkers and managers were highly capable, professional, and a pleasure to work with. Employees that truly care about working to their highest level are respected and appreciated. I was given a great deal of latitude to perform my job as well as excellent compensation and benefits. I enjoyed a 9/80 work schedule which meant that I was off every other Friday. Also, due to my length of employment,  I accumulated about 6 weeks of paid time off that could be carried over. The Business Development team I worked with was top notch. I would still be there, but I chose to become a consultant to ease into an early retirement. I would not hesitate to recommend working with the offices that I became familiar with: Greenville, SC and Ft. Worth, TX. A number of colleagues stood out as superior. I've worked for other companies where that's more of a rarity.Good place to work with good benefits (health, Vacation, Sick leave).  Employees treated well.The Sr. Vice President and General Manager was a hands on individual and very approachable.Great place to work and would recommend employment there.

You have to walk around the shops on egg shells.PAE was a great company to work for. The people were hard workers and everyone came from different backgrounds from all over the world.I really don't have an opinion of PAE either way.

They are like any other company I have worked for.PAE came in and took over a government contract in Fort Lewis, Wa. Within 3-4 years the work force was cut by over 60-70% and we began to lose contracts. ive worked for multiple companies and they were by far the worse.always working with the schedule between overtime and travel trips you have to be willing to work with other team members and always be willing to work. it takes a very motivated person to be successful in this group.Stable   organized  attentive to employee needs.

Best company i have worked for but i would like to further my careerI started this job with little to no training. I started when the company was in the process of changing policies so everything I was taught was outdated almost immediately. I had to constantly call and sometimes even stalk people to learn policies and how to use programs needed for my job. Then after a month I was let go because I was not ""learning fast enough"". I would only recommend this company to someone who plans to move to another company very quickly.Within the first week I learned about a huge group fighting within the company making it impossible to talk to one person without the other finding out and assuming you were on the others ""side"".Always looking forward to something new, and always learning new things, mangement is very good along with several of the co- workers, there is no really hard part of the job I enjoy every sigle bit of it.The duties of this position include a wide variety of tasks.
