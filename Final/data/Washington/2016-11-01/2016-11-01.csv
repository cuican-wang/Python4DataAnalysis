618,3671.0,Image Scientist–Modeling & Simulation,Harris Corporation,3.7,244.0,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Harris Corporation. The management and overall environment are fantastic. My favorite part of the job is the people with which I work.Harris has some of the best technology going. Great for engineers.In my dept the older workers were not considered when applying for positions.Jobs were given to younger candidates and young females. Thought it was a fluke at first but after five positions were slanted to much younger less experienced candidates, contractors and Coops.  Frequently the requisition would be changed to fit the younger candidate.Focus is on education and not on experience.  Only the chosen ones are given opportunities for promotion (pre-selected by management).  Environment is cold and distant.  There is a lack of focus on a team culture.  Job security is non-existent.  Management continues to reduce employee benefits and increase individuals personal expenses for healthcare and other benefits.In a nutshell, that's it - good pay, great people (the best) but absolutely no loyalty or job security. The hiring swells followed by hiring freezes and layoffs, followed by more swells, it's all pretty unnerving and disruptive. It's nice to know my team appreciates the hard work and overtime, if only upper management could do the same - their decisions to outsource key pieces of our product make it sometimes impossible to deliver quality.I enjoyed working for Harris for the time that I did, but I was unfortunately laid off due to a contract being cancelled on the government side. Therefore everyone who was working on that project was let go. This was also during the recession so I feel that contributed to it. I would still work there again if I got the chance, they are very good.A typical day starts with a good cup of coffee, logging in to the system to get to work. I learned that using email to communicate with internal and external customers is a great tool in getting resolutions.   My manager relied on my ability as a fast learner, to work independent. Good friends with co-workers.From my experience, the company seems to care about keeping their employees happy. The work culture is very friendly and open, they encourage new hires to contribute from the start. Managements was willing to listen to any suggestions people had on making improvements. Overall, I would recommend working for this companyThe company is very well establish in few market niches such as Weather Satellites, Air-Traffic systems, and moderate IT systems.IT was challenging to innovate due to the long time retention of certain cultured management, who they were set in their own way.Very good place to begin your career. There are numerous opportunities for personal grown and good benefits. Typical work week is a 9/80, 4/10, or 5/40 schedule and usually have the weekends and nights off. Its an engineering company so to get in the door, usually a degree is required.Facilities  does not have a typical day, everything is different  everyday. My managers were awesome and they made you feel like a member of the team.I loved my time working for Harris Corporation.  I was giving the opportunity to succeed through hard work.  In my last role, I managed 20+ government networks security compliance.  I enjoyed interpreting government policies and implementing that guidance to the network configuration.I truly enjoyed my position at Harris.  I enjoyed the interaction and providing immediate support to the quality assurance group, supervisors, mechanical/electrical engineering, procurement, scheduling, product analysis lab, production floor associates, assemblers, testers, and troubleshooters.Overall, the job was perfect except the relocation to New York was not a preferred choice.I met so many good people at Harris corp. different learning opportunities are provided. great team and leadership. I would recommend it to other people.They are the better paying companies in the area, but short lived when they downsize.  They treat managment with high regards and do not respect the lower paying employees.Used to be a decent place to work.  What they lacked in pay scale they made up for in benefits.  Since they switched insurance companies they no long can justify the poor pay scale.This was my first job on the East Coast of the US (which I took a big pay-cut for, but was told it was worth it)... I nearly moved right back out West. I stayed for 8 or 9 months, tried to give it the ""benefit of the doubt"", but management was entirely incompetent. Having been in this field for over ten years, I have picked up a few tips and tricks... Made some suggestions to management that would help the whole of Harris, resolving issues before people even called in, and I was SCOLDED for this. Their reasoning was that ""we need those phone calls""... that's right-- they are more interested in job security than they are resolving issues.Tip for management-- if your entire job can be replaced by a batch file and a spreadsheet, you are IRRELEVANT. Go back to school.ProsMost of the employees are highly talented and dedicated and work to meet the needs of the customer. Harris provides an environment where people can see the impact of the work they do as most projects are small-medium sized programs and each team member plays an important role. For the employees that have not yet lost their 9/80 work week, this provides a nice work/life balance.ConsThe corporate focus has shifted away from the customer and is overwhelmingly fixated on cost cutting. The and the primary means for achieving this objective is reducing labor costs through layoffs of senior personnel, cutting salaries and reducing benefits. Benefits have declined sharply in recent years. There is a great distrust of executive management and morale is very low.Never hire people fully on and the projects never last as expected always trying find work pay is ok this not a job or a careerEven as a full time employee i didn't start with benefit's because i was considered a ""job shopper"" which i was hired and paid by an another company where they were paid say 20 an hour for me and only paid me 15 an hour. once a spot opened in Harris itself i could be accepted or not which normally takes a year.Harris is a great place to work. It re-introduced unlimited paid time off program, which is one of the most coveted employee benefits. The rest is fairly standard with the corporate culture.if you find yourself employed in this company don't let this job go! you can actually support your family with these wages!","10,000+",Washington,Herndon,VA,2016-11-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/eb80943d-74f3-4f3c-b57b-41bc50549497?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=33,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
