374,3427.0,GIS Analyst,Tesla Government,3.6,320.0,"Great Company to work for. They take good care of their employees. Everyday seems to go buy very fast, it's a fast paced work place. Many of people enjoy the atmosphere.First off , it is not Tesla Motors, It's Tesla Electric : Tesla Electric is a very young company in Sulphur , La. which has had it's growing pains but is coming into it's own. The work place is very friendly , yet professional, one of teaching and learning while putting out very high quality work in the residential and commercial electrical arena. I would reccomend Tesla to anyone wanting a high quality electrical finished product. Tesla Electric performs much bigger than it is.Great opportunity learning variety of skills. working here was a great experience and you get to meet different people everyday and the majority of people are all very nice, although you gain many skills and definitely have good income working there, if you want a job as well as a social life and be able to have time for outside of work activities or such especially if you are not a local to the area this would not be able to mix well together since the majority of people working here are required to work a maximum of 70 hours a week, about 12 hours a day.Great place to work with a nice balance of work and home. I worked four twelve hour shifts with three days off a week. Starting pay was $17.00 an hour with a raise every six months of about a dollar. However you are on your feet for just about your whole shift and some of the management can be hard to work with at times, but definitely a great job to be at.The best work ethics I have ever seen. Most people would push for getting things done and are not very political. Work-life balance is poor (in Body in White at least), management would push for quick return but undermine sustainability of employees. Burned out employees will only stay for a year or two max. Great learning opportunity for employees, but because of the non-sustainable attitude, most employees would not last long.Geat place to work, the people are very experienced there talents. Helps you grow into a better, more reliable person. The hardest part is being there for 12 hrs and only get a 15 minute break but you get used to it. The work was very easy when you leaned it. The pack line was the easiest to work. The assembly line was tough but when you do it a lot it comes easier.• Consistent high monthly performer within the top 4% of worldwide influenced orders among Product Specialists. Influenced over $4.6 million of annual revenue. • Assist in the launch of the Tesla Stanford location by training new Product Specialists, Owner Advisors and Store Manager.• Assigned as the liaison for group presentations and marketing campaigns regarding Tesla product knowledge• Help to develop a new way to market and sell electric vehicles to the community. A part of the first Pop-Up launch in San Francisco• Qualify inbound and outbound lead generation through dashboard KPI's and opportunity tracking within SalesforceAt tesla you had no life, and politics play a big roll. Moving up in the company you had to bend and always break rules to be considered as someone who wants to move up in the company. Living while working for tesla is like being in jail, your life, relationship life and family values they all go down. Tesla don't give a penny about your health, they love to take advantage of you to the most they can as for as money and paychecks go. And if you don't do what they say even if it's the law you be breaking then they will threat your job to get you scared. Overall tesla and there management is ugly, they don't know how to manage things well. That's why there stocks go up and down.Tesla motors is a good company. if you don't mind working 12 hour days 6 days a week. keep in mind you will have no time to do anything else, friends,family,wife,husband you will have to sacrifice a lot. if your a single person and have no significant other then this is perfect job. they pay very well and have lots of benefits.you even get stocks if you stay the full 4 years. management is good.very fast past working job with a lot of over time. Employees were very respectful, the management was excellent and everyone worked as a team.  As far as the hardest part, i would say nothing about the job was difficult. Everything was very organized and well managed. My most enjoyable part of the job was the money that was coming in from all those 12 hour shifts.Working for Tesla was an opportunity of a life time and I miss it every day. It was awesome being part of something great to help improve our environment. However I was promised a lot when i took the job, but Tesla's management never followed through with there word. I also was injured off the job and Tesla would not modify my position temporarily until I healed and was just let go.Warehouse/ manufacturing                                     My job was to assemble the spine of the battery pack and making sure all parts are in their proper places so it can move forward in the assembly line process with no defaults. Had worked in a team to get our job done in a safe and timely manner ●	production worker Keeping count of all ship outs ●	Safety first wearing all protective gear in workplace●	Battery pack assembler ●	Prepare and complete orders for delivery or pickup according to schedule ( load, pack, wrap, label, ship)5am start time meeting every morning for Electricians and Data team members. we leave about 540am to collect equipment that we will need for the days job. Then take a cart to the level job is and once we would find our pillar and IDF and Jboxes and Racks and servers working with switches labeling correctly and running CAT5 liines from the IDF up 60 feet into the ceiling and along side the beams  using ladders or scissor lifts even booms. We would run between 2 to 14 lines from one point to another before that we were installing and hanging security cameras.Work varied on a weekly basis, between  building and testing newly designed test equipment for the Tesla Powers Electric Drive Systems, Installing Test equipment, Building wiring harnesses, trouble shooting and repair of equipment.  Worked with an outstanding manager and several seasoned engineers.  Loved the challenge of developing new equipment.  Hardest part was working with new engineers just out of college with no real life experience in electronic circuitry and wiring.Tesla is a company with a great direction but is striken by poor managerial decisions.  Most of my coworkers are incredibly passionate about what they do and supporting Tesla's mission.  Tesla pushes all of its employees to strive for greatness and do more than they think they're capable of.  However, the upper-lower level management does not communicate directives well, and does not take feedback from employees.I really liked working at Tesla, the people were cool and really helped out , management was great the leads and managers actually know what they're doing and the free cereal and snacks and fountain drinks really are a plus, only thing is that my lunch breaks were only 35 minutes, i can't go out and buy something because i won't make it back on time, and terribly they're really strict on the background checks thats the reason why i got let go.This company is FAR from honest with their customers. Rude trainers who don't believe that people should be able to make emergency phone calls, and if you don't fit their fold, they'll kick you out. If you have a strength in Data Entry, but was hired as Production, which is a weaker strength, they'll fire you instead of putting you where your strengths are. That's precisely what happened to me. Extremely discriminatory regarding people who have pain syndromes. I waited 2 months for this job, forsaking other employers, despite being hired back in June, I couldn't start until August 18th, and lasted for nearly 2 weeks. Terrible company, there is no love for their employees, and no love for their customers. All they care about is image. I wish I could say more, but I'd end up breaking my NDA.Great place to work at for a while with a very fast paced and dynamic environment, good advancement, with lots of learning opportunities if you are willing to jump in and get your hands dirty figuratively and practically speaking. Management although often best in their fields is also often inexperienced managing people, sometimes lacking leadership and good management skills. It is often very demanding and not very forgiving with poor work-life balance and high expectations. Sometimes lacks processes, clear direction and constructive feedback. Resources are sometimes missing or stretched thin. It can however be very rewording and self revealing on a personal level when you do meet expectations and overcome challenges. It has good health insurance, and some small perks.Regular 8 hour shifts with optional overtime. Management not the brightest but also not the worst. Overall you are given the tasks and are expected to complete them before the days end.A typical day is doing audit, inspection and engineering trials. Learned different hand tools and mechanical tools as well.Learning the processes of building a car. Learning different parts of the car and it's function. Seeing our CEO most of the time brings a smile to my face.I learned many valuable skills about working in a production environment by spending three years at the Tesla factory. The most enjoyable part of working there was being part of a growing company, and having a chance to see some cutting edge technology.","1,001 to 5,000",Washington,Vienna,VA,2016-11-03T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/64e605f9-47d0-4e29-93fc-f5ea047d6e71?mescoid=1500140001001&jobPosition=34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
