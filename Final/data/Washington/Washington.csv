4,3057.0,Data Scientist,CDI Corporation,3.7,262.0,"CDI Corp was an excellent company to work for. The hiring team was well versed in the HR process and the on boarding was fairly easy to complete.  Only bad experience was the exit process, no details given and when contract was about to expire very little communications from management. When trying to find additional employment there was absolutely no follow up and no new job prospects presented.CDI is a third party contract business. I actually worked as a contractor for IBM. CDI has a great system for payroll and communications. The management team there really cares about their employees and will make sure that they are gainfully employed.They are very good at negotiating with the customer and very good representing the employee to the customer.They do a decent job managing contract workers for clients but no job search. Their orientation does not seem to be a job house so much as a contractor wrangler.Great temporary employment agency. Who they vendor for is hit or miss. Some contrats are great and some are not. Some companies will keep you for multiple and exttended contracts. Chances of get fulltime employment.CDI is a small construction, development and investment company in east Tennessee that strives to do quality work for a fair price and improve the homes, land and lives of the people in east Tennessee.Subordinate to IBM work requirements,  so Little actual advancement opportunities. Mostly just a payroll administrator.IBM has a major initiative to move as much work offshore as possible. I have trained about 10 offshore groups & transferred work to them. I am about to do another one in the near future.CDI allows for my career to succeed and improve with current industry standards. Very competitive and a major turning point in the planning industry. CDI maintains and focuses on serving our clients with a combination of innovative technologies, increased efficiencies, and leading edge solutions with an end-goal of achieving client excellence.too small to grow or move up.  owners were flaky.  rainy days = panda express (free).  Fridays were very casual. I enjoyed my coworkers.Very pro family was able to work and do family events. Management was very good on making employees feel good about what they were doing. The cost of insurance was the only poor item.CDI gets the job done.  But I was looking for something a little more long term with upward mobility opportunities.  Such an opportunity cannot be had with CDI.With CDI, I have been doing Civil/Structural Engineering work.  It have been very fun and challenging.  Very large company, but a great group of people.I have an outstanding team to work with. It is a managers dream. The hardest part of the job is keeping a team of billable employees in a services industry busy whenever their is an economic down turn, or the client work load diminishes, considering the low overhead budgets that we have to work with to maintain shareholder profitability.Great company just wish previous owners did not run it into the ground as we have a lot of work to do to recover the profit margins we are comfortable with. Hours will always be long at a start up and compensation low. but the new leadership is outstanding and has given the company with a 39 year track record a real chance to recover.I've worked for several years for CDI Corp. I initially was placed as a web author for a large tech company (client) and over the years moved up through CDI to be a project manager, working on various contracts with the same client. My experience within the organization has varied a great deal based on changes within CDI management, contracts I worked on for the client, and the teams I worked with. By and large, I had the privilege of having excellent managers who advocated for my advancement and fantastic teams made up of intelligent, motivated people who were a pleasure to work with. For the last 3 years, I have also been able to work from home full time, and I have loved this flexibility.The downsides to working for CDI is that it is ultimately a staffing company. The pay and benefits are not great, and your long-term growth are limited by the contracts available. It is nearly impossible to continue advancing your career beyond a certain point, and for an ambitious person, this can be very frustrating. It can also be frustrating as a manager not to be able to see your employees advance to the levels they should because there simply is not opportunity. While local management is fantastic, corporate management, whom we rarely deal with on a regular basis, are out of touch with the local teams, and meaningful rewards for truly outstanding performance are few and far between. For instance, it's been 4 years since the company last had annual merit pay increases, and the last round of merit pay increases were so low, they didn't keep up with cost of living increases in the  more... area we were based. There is no loyalty from the corporate office, and excellent employees who have been loyal to the organization may be laid off with limited notice when their contract is up. Local management tries to mitigate this, but corporate has made it increasingly difficult to reward and retain top talent.  lessWorked in cubicles, very impersonal assignment, manager was good to work for, but limited access to SKM and power systems analysis.Coordinates and implements the established referral process for children and families, ensures the implementation of recruitment including the child find effort, implement the enrollment process, provide accure record keeping, assist in the parent committees.I learned that I was a case manager for 30-35 families and that together with the parents, teacher and core team, we can guide parents to coordinates efforts to ensure services for children including children with disabilities. Ensures that children are up to date on epsdt. The most enjoyable part of the job is work with children and families and help them.Working Remote was a plus, and  flexible schedule . Internally processes were unorganized, not easy to change, big disconnect between departments/process. there was a lack of communication and sales training.Daily tasks are spread out so you do you have some down time. Work environment is ok. Work long hours sometimes. Occasional saturday workThis is a good company that appreciates hard work and getting the job done right. Being a part of a team that knows how to work together to produce a great product was an honor.There are a million things wrong with this company, so where do I begin?1) Their on boarding system is a joke. I had no idea who my manager was and no idea what my job really entailed. 2) They try and do a horrible job covering up their mistakes. I saw a job posting for my same position with higher pay. When I confronted them about it, they took down the posting immediately and brushed it under the table. 3) Their entire internal software system is extremely antiquated. They need everything to be run on a PC and through Internet Explorer. I used to have to travel 3 miles every week so that I could input my timesheet on a brick of a laptop. I still have to use a totally outdated timesheet system that they just ""updated""4) There's little to no interaction with management or anyone higher ups5) Absolutely zero career growth and development. I tried for a year to try and get some momentum on growth opportunities... NOPE6) Benefits are a joke. The pay is already horrible, you really expect us to pay for benefits out of pocket?!?!Corporate restructuring underway, patience is needed while this is in progress.  It could be another year before progress is really seen externally.","10,000+",Washington,Washington,DC,2016-11-16T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/data-scientist-job-washington-dc-us-176192530.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

Flexability as well as able to pick up extra buildings is always available.Sys1 will place you at a customer site and you will be trained for that customers needs. Sys1 will bill the customer and pay you as their employee. You wont have any benefits as a contracting employee. Your co-workers will mostly be the customers but you may be placed with other SYS1 employees.I personally have trained half a dozen Techs for sys1 at my current customers location and the hard part for me is I make as much as my co-system1 workers make.I personally enjoy the people I work with both customer and sys1 but you have to remember they are the customer and not a friendly face.Fun work place, Good communication, Great learning skills, and awesome teamwork. Good starting pay, better pay once you're rolled over. At times it could be a lot of layoffs due to the lines breaking down in the warehouse. Once you start working good its guaranteed to work 40hrs and over with overtime pay.Management structure seems very disorganized. ""Too many Chiefs and not enough Indians"". Very hard to get in touch with immediate supervisor. They don't want to spend the money for quality equipment/tools. Work trucks onsite were over 10 years old and in very poor condition. Work/Life balance is WAY OFF-balance!!!.  You go to work before the sun comes up, and you usually do not get home until around 6:30pm. So, you can never get your personal business done before 5pm.....which usually requires you to take off work early to get any personal business done. I was contract only, so absolutely NO benefits whatsoever. Hourly and overtime only. THAT'S IT. No per diem. No medical. No dental. No vision. No 401K. NOTHING. Upper management never seemed to know what was going on.We worked long hard days, but I loved every minute of it.  You spent weeks on the road, but the job was very rewarding.

Top notch staff and co-workers. Occasional travel. Get to work independently during most travel. Great job for motivated, self-starter type of people.The bought out the company I was working for so I did not work for them long enough to give a good review. The did offer a benefits package but I did not need it because I already had insurance. I did not have much interaction with the company. Everything from my previous employer's contract stayed the same when they took ownership.System One has been a very good place to work because what I most needed was flexibility.  I returned to work after being a stay-at-home parent and still needed to be available to my young children.  they offered the flexibility I needed at a competitive salary.  I have worked for them for over 13 years.  The Management was always available if I needed any assistance.Salary comparableexcellent benefitsEmployees are excellentManagement excellentthe hardest for me is climbinggoing to the same place dailyEveryday we have a team meeting letting us know about daily safety and about things that go on though out the shifts. Team leaders are very good about giving us information about the line we are working on. I've learned from hand packing, stacking boxes onto a pallet, use of jacks/power jacks, doing rework, and numerous of different inspections of candy bar. Everybody is very friendly and like to help you learn the job you need to do that day. Hardest part would be the overtime but you accept that when taking the job. The people make the job easier making the day go by faster.Everyday was different.Moved to different building every other day.Worked around machines.Had a awesome Crew leader/Superiors!I love cleaning so that was a plus.Got a lot of walking in.Had a great staff of employees.Pulling over 1,000 pounds up hill on a manual forklift was challenging    Lots of tasks to do everyday.they would have to you work long ours 7 days straight with out a day off or asking. would not switch people around to learn anything productive. as for doing different duties.Thorough and always communicative.  Enjoyed my time with this company and would be willing to work again for them. Each person I spoke with was professional and responded timely.good co workers and great system of operations made it a good working environment but if problems occurred and you fell behind you got moved along and had to try to catch up and if other crews fell behind you also did on account of waiting.......went out of businessco-workers for good to work with. very enjoyable job.Project was very interesting to work on. learned a lot about nucleur power plants from Westinghouse employeesThey are small group of very talented people who work very well together.  They work on a broad range of pharmaceutical test equipment for some rather big clients.  A typical day of work was divided between service, calibration and validation and I normally worked independent.  l enjoyed doing what I was assigned to do.  The hard part was the extensive commuting back and forth to the different sites I worked on.i loved the job it was just to far away for me and my ride to get up and be there on time the people where really nice and great i just couldn't take then ride to and from thereFrom my experience it was a better than average temporary or contract company and would work for them in the future. It was a contract company based in Pittsburgh, PA and the location I was assigned to was in Shoreview, MN, being it was a contract company advancement was not available and little to no benefits were reasonable.Only worked one job with system one and it was ok.

8,3061.0,Data Scientist,Dewberry,4.0,26.0,"It has been a great company with good work life balance. Dewberry wants you to succeed financially and career wise while having fun life outside of work.Dewberry is a great company to work as various departments can be available in one area. I learned computer skills such as Autodesk AutoCad and Bentley Storm/Water Cad. In addition, I learned a lot of each municipality and city differs from one another.I traveled working in the pipeline survey area. It's more like they hire their friends that have no experience and let go people that actually know what they are doing.Nice place to work, all employees and the office manager, were always nice. I loved the schedule and all the people that work in this office were very professionalDewberry is has a great productive and friendly work environment. Everyday one can learn different things in technology as you are expected to be on your toes. I am very lucky to have a very relax and friendly co-workers and managers.The co-workers are the best part of this company.  They make up for the lack of support from management tolerable.  This company is very top heavy---which wasn't always the case and its sad to see that its come to that.Tasks included: Scheduling inspections for affected homes to assess damages from Hurricane Sandy such as finding unsafe amounts of lead or asbestos containing materials;Uploading data collected from Lead and Asbestos Reports onto a case management system to track progressUtilizing a switchboard phone system to handle a high volume of telephone calls in order to assess clients’ needs; andProofreading and editing Lead and Asbestos reports before entering data into case management system. It's a very lax work environment as long as you get your work done. You get your own work space and computer. You make your own schedule and the pay is hourly; I had a part time position so I was able to come in at any time as long as it was between 8am and 5pm from Mon - Sunday and complete up to 30 hours a week. Co-workers are very friendly; the environment is very professional.  There are copious amounts of paperwork that you must process accurately and efficiently.Emergency Management. Please let applicants apply.I performed field services for FEMA hurricane disaster management on Louisiana GulfCoast. Involved numerous assessments and monitoring, including public and privateproperty assessments; demolitions, salt water damaged tree removal DR 1607, DR 1603Hurricanes Rita and Katrina.A typical work day is working hard at the computer.I learned a lot at Dewberry, and the really cool thing is that I'm still learning a lot. To name a few, I learned how to use MicroStation and how to manage LiDAR data. The co-workers are very nice and easy to talk to. The ironic thing is that no one seems talkative, though.The hardest part of the job is being able to finish the task in the given time that's handed to you because the task can be a large quantity of work.The most enjoyable part(s) is constantly learning as you go and seeing the final product make a huge impact in a community. For example, the hazardous debris projects.I learned a lot at Dewberry in my field of work, and gave me the work experience I needed and involve myself in. It gave me the opportunity to work with a team, on an individual level, and on my own to develop ways to better myself and the way we worked. However, management seems a little sloppy. While I was expected to be temporary, the way it was handled was poor and was essentially laid off without being told so. While the main project was coming to a close; they told us to find other work within the office -- but no other projects were in line leaving many of us stranded.The most important thing to Dewberry is that you have an engineering degreeDay of traveling from job to job. Management errors at times. Most co-worker were hard workers. I learned time management, How to lead a crew, operated different survey equipmentGreat technical people and strong managers. No strong growth for technical people. Most of the fast grown in their career are those who management to move to the management track.In this position I learn how to review contracts, PO, mod, etc. and jobs set up and to billing clients on a monthly basis.  The hard part is to get project managers to submit their invoice proofs on a timely manner.I enjoy going into work everyday! The office environment is great and the work is fun.Performed intensive assessments of damaged homes and estimated repairs required for habitability requirements.  Separate calculations from Xactimate sketches were made to differentiate actual storm damage, previous repairs, new repairs, deferred maintenance and neglect.  Worked with a cohesive group of talented individuals with a very wide range of background from all over the United States.Received great work experience in a variety of fields of Civil EngineeringGreat place to work.  Would recommend it to anyone looking to work here.I have worked here for several years and the company is nice to work for. Headquarters is in Fairfax VA.Depending on your position you can work a lot of overtime although they pay for it which is nice. The contract work can be stressful and there are ridiculous demands at times. Overall, not bad benefits and a good experience.Overall the environment is good. Not a lot of training in other areas and no room for advancement if you are working within Administration.

I travel extensively to work with the companies largest client and assess where improvements can be made and work with the recruiting teams to ensure these practices are put into place. I love the people I work with and I love working with my customers and making a positive impact. I do not currently have a retirement in place - as it is not offered and have not had a pay rate increase in several years. Benefits keep rising and the coverage keeps declining, as we are a small company and not many people take out the insurance. Stinks when you are single!!Contract position with a large manufacturer working in HR. Worked directly for HR manager handling FMLA and Worker's Compensation. Co-workers were very pleasant and helpful. Great experience to be working with a much larger group than I have in the past. I thoroughly enjoyed the pace which was constantly busy. Was also allowed to focus primarily on two aspects of HR instead of being spread across the board as I have been in the past. This was positive experience as well.Talascend is a recruiting company and I was contracted into an engineering firm. When I was laid off Talascend did very little to try to place me again. I was not very satisfied with that.They gave me a very low rate going in because I had been out of the workforce for 19 months due to the economy and downsizing of GM.It was difficult to negotiate even the 50 cents extra that I received.I enjoy this work assignment.

No complaints.my typical day consist of arriving 10 minutes early,then receiving part in from delivery that day and storeing them away,also consoladate and filling pick orders for the next day.Benefits are not so great, but the pay is decent.

21,3074.0,Satellite Sensor Calibration Scientist,ERT Inc,4.0,23.0,"ERT is a very good company to work as a Software Engineer. My manager was one of the coolest person to work with.He provided me with all kinds of work during my internship including development, automation & unit testing.Amazing place to work. Very challenging but worth it. I've learned a very lot from working here. Never a dull moment. High volume when it comes to work. Very high pace.Reserve SWAT officer assigned to support the US Marshals office in serving warrants on violent, drug, domestic abuse and many others. Outstanding working environment, it is great to work on the entry team with the best this nation has to offer.ERT just purchased PHT Crop. in May 2015. The transition is still going on so it is hard to judge how it will turn out. So far things look good. Although they only strive to provide average compensation.  Aside from better pay and questionable job growth potential I think things are going well.I came to work for ERT, when my previous company PHT was merged with ERT in 2015. ERT and PHT work both in the ePRO industry, and the management of clinical trial data for pharmaceutical companies. When I started at PHT in 2012, the company was doing roughly. Lots of data mismanagement, and clients whom were not happy with the management of the clinical trail data. After an intense 2 weeks at the company, the CEO at the time and the Client were very pleased with the expediency in which we resolved the issues. I went full time after 5 months at the company, something I was working hard towards.As the company PHT began to rise from the issues of 2012 , so did my responsibilities. I became more knowledgeable in clinical trial matters. Not just the management of data, but the development process of the studies prior to being active. I was continually in demand by our international project teams, for the work I was putting out. It became more challenging as the years progressed, but I dived into every situation open minded. I made myself available for my colleagues from Project teams to Support staff. I guided Junior team members in the Data Quality Specialist department, in the understanding of studies and their approach to cases and task management.When the PHT merged with ERT, I felt as if things in the company changed, not all for the good. Staff were leaving at a enormous rate prior to the merger, review process was completely changed, with no opportunity for a one on one with my manager. The environment did not feel the same to me any longer; I hardly worked  more... with my immediate team members, communications seemed to have been less through phone calls and more through massive email chains(which caused confusion for many team members), and my growth and progression in the company felt stunted.  lessExperience with emergent counseling for clients struggling with severe psychosis, suicidality, substance abuse, attempted suicide and family crises. Working as an Emergency Response Therapist brought experience in the process of hospitalization (for high risk clients), diversions and outpatient care. Emphasize on lest restrictive level of care needed based on 27-65 statute training in Colorado.Wish they didnt take work from home away. I was more productive in a more closed environment. Also shouldnt have sole to third party company.It is a very responsive company and their HR/admins sincerely serves their employees with in the boundaries of the resources made available to them. They have a very flexible training program. What more can an employee ask for!The job was a regular job, but the employees made it fun to work there. We would attend social functions together and Phillies games.A typical day is touching base with an employee that I am responsible for in regards to his training.  We interact with one another throughout the day and work well together to make sure all deliverables for the quality team is in order.  As a Quality Assurance Auditor I have learned allot about how very important it is to maintain certain standard operating procedures and for each and every person within the organization to abide by them.  If these SOPs are not followed the productivity and effectiveness to to our tasks on a day to day basis may be at risk.  The outcome, may even affect the client in some cases and this is something we strive to avoid.  The hardest part of the job, is actually trying to explain that individuals cannot and should not deviate from their own written processes.  The enjoyable part of the job is making the end result, making the clients happy as well as knowing the tasks assigned was done accurately without any risks along the way.ERT is passionate and committed about transforming the way you conduct the drug development and healthcare efforts. Understanding that you need the most accurate, cost-effective and convenient support systems to collect timely, regulatory-compliant data.

No room for advancement At this time in a different department that I haven't already worked in.In the beginning, this was a great place to work. Personal growth and advancement were encouraged. Pay was a little lower than the competition, but security was better than the competition, so it worked out. Today, pay is still a little low, and there have been several cuts in the benefits. Work hours vary greatly from position to position. I honestly enjoy my job, but work hours as a salaried employee can be ridiculous. Middle management seems to normally care about what is happening with the employee and will help you to grow. Senior management within Mission Systems varies, but is usually appears to understand the project and includes several technical people. It will be interesting to see how the upcoming election changes the workplace. Overall, I still recommend this company as a workplace.General Dynamics is like any other major defense contractor when it comes to employees and cutting the profits. Employees rank last middle management a little higher and Corporate taking the biggest cut of the pie. GD was the first large defense contractor that I worked for and in order to substantiate their bloated corporate profit the employees were offered expensive substandard insurance options. The stress to produce was constantly in motion and the stress level was out of this world. I saw literally a 100 percent turn over in the year that I worked for them. Prior to being laid off the stress got so bad that I came within an inch of walking away and forgetting that I ever worked for them. If the employee didn't kiss butt to the customer they were gone in a heartbeat.The company went down hill much in five years. Management likes to pretend that they are still in the military, ignore rules, lie to workers, hire friends, blame others for bad decisions.Many middle age workers have a GD pension, a military pension, a 401k and soon will draw Social Security, and often like to talk about how much they have saved and the great plans they have. The younger workers get a 401k and have to listen to how much better the others have it, and have to accept that they will not be able to afford to retire.Management only looks out for itselfOpen door policy does not workPay is goodBenefits are fairExpense reports get processed quicklySuccessfully ignores all of Colin Powell Leadership GuidanceGreat management and benefits. Flexible work hours, tough objectives and talented personnel made the job an amazing experience.Daily work is good with some long hours as working with the government brings unexpected periods of added work loads. Company is going through a rough period where many employees are leaving due to economic turbulence.From what I hear, this company was a lot better in the past.  However, they have been slowly but steadily reducing benefits to the point where they are barely competitive.Good ol' boy network is firmly established and there is a pretty clear line between the connected few and the rest of the organization.  Management is basically out of touch with the day-to-day operations and generally poor morale of the employees.Decent salary for new hires and well-maintained facilities to work in.However, after a little over 2 yrs here, I realize it's time for me to move on, and I'm finding that my experience here is of no interest to the 3 companies I've actually had the opportunity to interview with.Uggh!The company is well positioned to continue growing but severely lacks a kind of company culture that makes people excited to work there. It's a comfortable job but promotions come slowly and the work gets boring very quickly.We would arrive and open the site, Do preventative maintenance on the vehicles. Get any failed items repaired or replaced from our parts warehouse. shipped bad parts to vendors received parts from vendors. Inventoried and store all equipment and tracked all repairs. compiled spread sheets of repaired items for upper management. when we are all finished we lay out all of the equipment for the military to inventory and sign for the vehicle. The hardest part of the job is having a inventory in excess of 100 million dollars for a standard time frame of 5 months. The most enjoyable part is finishing with no lose of equipment.Flexible work schedule, very supportive of military life, always engaged in some type of project and you are able to chose your career path.The people who work at GD are all very nice, it's a lovely place to work in terms of flexibility and work/life balance. Management does a good job of sticking up for employees.That being said, there is very little control over the direction your career goes. You will get bounced around from one project to the next with little regard for making the best use of your skills or where you want to go with your career in the future.If you are a hard worker, looking for challenges, growth and working in a team environment then this is a good place to work. If you like working on projects that build systems to help protect our troops, our country and our way of life then you can't help but want to work here.This company is ok if you are starting out in the workforce. Definitely not a place to be at if you're seeking growth in logistics. I've been with this company for over 5 years and can't to leaveGood work environment at this location, which is one of the smaller GDMS locations. Management is fine. Had a good boss and peers.The first 4 years were pretty decent other than the fact that I was always traveling and didn't get much in the way of raises, or a promotion.  But I did what I was hired to do and was left alone to get it done for the most part.  I had oversight where I needed it and help to accomplish my goals. The remaining 4 years there were trash, they cut our benefits to the bone, lied to us, harassed us, changed policy every other day, so no one knew what was going on anywhere, I was doing the jobs of 3 people and getting paid less than when I started, and when I was Injured, I was threatened and harassed even more.Great place to work, challenging environment to learn and grow.  Flexible work schedule.  Good pay and benefits.  Great people to work with.If you're under 35, good luck trying to fit in here.  The average age is probably closer to 40-45 or maybe older, with many employees only sticking around because they're waiting to get their pensions.  There's very much an old boys' club atmosphere since a lot of folks have been there for 25 years or more and for many, their tenure at GD spans their entire career. As such, there's very little room for growth while you're expected to just play your part and won't learn much outside the confines of your specific role.  Management largely doesn't care about your career development because they're often not even located in the same office or state.Employees are very passionate about their jobs! They develop excellent product for the government systems part of GD. I worked for this company when they were also part of GTE.Typical government contractor environment. Beige walls and linoleum floors. Minimal training budget, essentials only, plenty of politics and constant reorganizations.The engineering staff and the technical know how made General Dynamics (once Motorola) a leader in the communications industry. Due to the current management style annual earnings has become more important than customer satisfaction. On the positive side there is a lot of diversity in individual assignments. Co-workers are friendly and get together outside of work often.","5,001 to 10,000",Washington,Oakton,VA,2016-11-30T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/senior-advanced-analytic-applications-engineer-job-oakton-va-us-176893485.aspx?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=7,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The hardest part is communication between our office and our other US office in NC.  The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with people and being able to work independently.An advantage of working for a company this size, is that they actually listen to their employees. if you want to work for a company that cares, work for Quotient.

30,3083.0,"Associate Scientist, Microbiology",Canon,3.7,437.0,"canon was a great place to work at wish i could have worked longer. I love my department the warehouse was clean. the food was amazing i just loved everything about it.- Great work atmosphere- Great career opportunity- Great benefits- Great people to work with- Competitive salary- Enjoy working with global customersGood environment Great place to work, excellent benefits. Lot's of opportunities to move to different areas. Indoors.A typical day included confirmation of prior pending sales. Approval of pending credit claims and marketing program claims. Review of specialty area items. Verify emails regarding orders. Correcting or verifying status of order. Respond to dealer, sales or management inquiries. Work on processing returns and documenting conditions and response for approval or denial. Forecasting current sales with potential for meeting designated goals. Submitting trending reports. Completing presentations. Participating in team meetings.This is a great place to work if in need of a job.  Good schedules to choose from, great benefits, laid back culture. The customers called in for ""technical assistance"".  Most were nice. Company goals are very attainable.My only complaint is lack of advancement opportunities which is common with call centers & starting pay is a little low.outstanding, learned a lot, there was a repetition of taking pictures all the time. enjoy with the pay raise was great and the people.Great company, too bad they are moving. I love working here and love the hours and the people. I would recommend this company to anyone who is looking for a career in a different state.Excellent company to work for, professional environment, good benefits. Logistics operations were relocated to their headquarters in New York.Great Canon. Tell you what you need to do to achieve goals. Pay is the only reason why I am wanting to leave but benefits such as health are very good. Atmosphere is nice. Everyone is nice.Do not apply unless you ""NEED"" a job. There is no room for advancement. They do not pay well. Their vacation is horrible. Management does not communicate with employees. The benefits are not good either stay away from this company.there are opportunities to advance quickly with this company and the employees are a little spoiled with a cafe and gym in the building plus a masseuse that comes every other month. management and co-workers were easy to get along with. the biggest con for me is the work, I didn't perform well in a call center environment and there's a lot of phrases that the company wants employees to use on a call and will penalize employees who does not use them. also few bathroom breaks allowed.Good people to work with. You answer incoming calls from customers all day, so of course you will face the basic downsides of working at a call center.  Other than that, they will train you, have good benefits, and it is very hard to get hired from there.  Sometimes it feels good to help customers out, other times it is hard to deal with them.  Management is good. The raises are not that much, but they do give them to you every year.If your desperate and need the job then go for it. Plenty good people there.If you have a family to support then the wage is under the family goal. Unless managers get way more but I dont think its all that much. A lot have stayed and a lot have gone that I knew. This is either family or dont have. Dont forget floor compliance's as with every other call center your gauged more on a minute than how well you kept a customer. If your day consist of you having to do family doctor visits, or lets just say important rolls outside the job. If you explain it to HR they give you some room to do so with good cause. A + for Canon there. Everyone is great to work with and management are not really to blame. They are hovered everyday about someone or changing something.Canon is a great company with a household name in the technology industry.  Good compensation package.  Salary and Commission.Instructed employee's and temp staff of daily needs. Worked with NY for required work and completion dates. Processed all reports including all contact with temp agencies time keeping and payroll information. Worked with packaging venders to create new packaging when needed for projects. Created a Rebox Department and this saves millions of dollars each year as this process is now in the VA facility. Hardest part of job was getting enough temps to complete job requirements to meet all required completion and ship dates. Fun part was designing my own floor plans and stations to run projects.Over all great but top management direction not always clear and decision making can take a long time. Mixed culture environment great but at times causes conflict in the way of business processes.Working at Canon USA is working for a Japanese company.  The culture is evident and it is difficult to navigate.  80% of the work is done by 20% of the employees.  If you work hard and do good, your reward is more work.  If you do nothing and make mistakes, you will just be given less responsibility but these people remain at the company.  I have had friends ask for referrals and I pushed them in the opposite direction.Not a very progressive corporate culture for a company with technology at its core.Canon is a place where you will meet a great number of people from different cultures.  They are a strong technology company but could improve on how their management mentor's people in developing to become successful.- 9-5 job- I have learned a lot of useful skill with Exel and PowerPoint. I have learned to corporate with disatified customers. Pro multitasker. - Overall corporate management is poor. I got along well with my supervisor and boss.- Co-workers are friendly.- The hardest part of my job are the busy season (during the gov't fiscal year)- The most enjoyable part of my job is completeing a task that I could file away and move on from.The job was great.  My favorite job I have ever had as far as the work day goes.  Your day is busy but you they make sure you take your breaks and the day goes by so fast because of it being busy.  A typical day consists of processing lots of packages to deliver to VISA employees as you work at a Visa office that has thousands of VISA employees.  You then deliver the packages and assist with shipping out packages as well.I had a strange American boss who reported to a Japanese boss who would not address the strangeness of his management. He micromanaged and ALWAYS took people's work and edited himself since he had major OCD issues.

Dusty warehouse conditions. Also worked certied forklift. Hard working labor for a minimum quick pay check.overall good place to work, great friendly environment good management. happy place to be if you make it that way. I enjoyed going to work everydayI went thru this company as Siemens called me back after lay off. They were very professional and helped me go thru the process very quickly.I like company because it has lot of opportunity to work with and get lots of experience but they are slow with they employees and sometime I cant understand them because they send u different places to work but I like that at sametime I want to stable schedule.scheduling staff, talking with guests, managing servers, bartenders and chefs.  lots of customer service and talent development.This position started as a dream job for me; seemingly great compensation, almost immediate benefits, promise of bonuses!  However, things quickly went south.  Mostly this was due to the lack of support; my manager moved away and was communicating remotely once a week or so, my partner went on maternity leave and there was no replacement that was knowledgeable enough to keep from making extra work, much less helping with the work load, etc.  There was no ""typical day at work,"" which isn't so bad unless your boss demands perfection at a constantly variable position.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting the two bonuses I received during my four months there; the least being the constant verbal lashings and lack of praise I received from my area vice president over things as trivial as post-its.The ratings depend on the manager who oversees the Randstad office that the talent works with. As of today, I have an excellent manager.  She listens.  She is helpful.  She is attentive, makes sure we are treated fairly, makes effort to match us with departments that would be a ""good fit"" for both parties.  She keeps open communication and good relations between both the talent and the contractors.The manager before her was not good.  She was not on our side.  She would advocate for the contractor over her talent (employees).Its a good place to get into, just for experience. there is no advancement. A raise a very difficult to get in this company.I enjoy my job and like being on the move. My co-workers are great people and ive learned I can excel myself now that I have the experience!Just an overall poor performance for a staffing agency. I did all the leg work and there was little to no communication after I had the position. Not a place that I would stay.At first it was a good place but then everthing change they be came mean people so i just left. But i use to love it. They pack pills and make traysI love working for this agency. I've learned how to operate different medical systems for different states.The management team is very enthusiastic and outgoing and likes to communicate with their employees.My job was great I really enjoyed my co-workers and I learned a-lot about urethane mold making and pouring the job was very hot and was only as hard as you made itManagement should really learn to listen to the associates that are out on the floor.Co-workers are great.Hardest part of the job is the long hours however it does feel great when a team reaches one goal togetherI work with good people and the management did not no what they was doing we had to put up and take down the same thing 3 to 4 time everyday because the management did no what was going on the pay was not no goodRandstad is a very professional organization to work for.  I spent 16 years with the organization and was involved with multiple clients.  I enjoyed with the clients and the employees.  It can be a challenge to balance the needs of the client and the employees.  This challenge can be very rewarding.Helpful for job hunting. Not much contact other than hiring process and online portal. They come across as professional and well organized.We load and unload trucks. We load the material take it to where it needs to go then we unload the material. After we unload it we go back to warehouse to load more material.When there are assignments available they will get you to work. They can be rude at times when they are busy. They hire just about anybody which was a problem for me because I don't like to work in just any type of environment.I have no complaints about Randstad. They have assisted me with my job search many times and have always been successful. Good pay and good hours, as well as the opportunities.",,Washington,Rockville,MD,2016-11-20T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/d8660ee4-ccd8-48ba-af04-e9198d62488e?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

67,3120.0,Data Scientist,Leidos,3.8,199.0,"I have mixed feelings. The job was good, but they were always trying to call me in on my off time. The pay was good, but that was negated by the seemingly yearly reduction in benefits. Management turned over in one form or another once every few months in the office I worked in. There wasn't much of a pay increase over time and fewer opportunities for advancement in the company. People seemed to muddle through the day with discontent in the office. It seemed to suck the joy out of some of our coworkers just to be in the office.Leidos is a great place to work. Management is engaged and fellow workers are eager to assist each other. Salary was highly satisfactory. The fact that it was a contract job has inherent risks.Hired and then let go 6 weeks later because of funding. Lied about the contract being good for a full year.Not happy with this company currently.Leidos is a young very diverse company that has difficulty figuring out how to organize itself. Needs more mature SR management and  leadership.Leidos offers a great work life balance. Leidos offers a competitive 401K plan and insurance plans. Leidos also offers annual performance reviews ensuring that you have a way to move up the ladder.Excellent position to help train first responders and help protect the nation from disaster. This is a rewarding position and excellent working conditions.I was my own boss and made my own schedule to the needs of the mission. I learned a great deal about turning in old and no longer useful equioment. Management always ensured you had the proper training to complete your mission. Co-Workers were always there to help with moving any equipment that needed to be loaded into a truck or van. The hardest part of the job was not having enough time to get everything completed. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I had complete control over everything I did.Leidos is not a bad company to work for, they just aren't great either. Leadership is out of touch, but compensation is competitive and the benefits package rivals other companies. Not a lot of room for advancement.Leidos is a pretty standard large size company. I feel the training/mentorship could use some work. I wish there was a stronger connection between middle management and the workers. I don't know if that is the case for most of the contracts that Leidos holds though.Over all I feel like it's a fine company to work for.Normal working place, five days a week 9-5 Monday to Friday. Friendly atmosphere, easy going no pressure, you have to be willing to work hard and help other when they need help.There are lots of potential to move elsewhere within the company.  Benefits provided through work are very generous and easy to take advantage of. Has overall decent job outlook.The company culture is about the employee and the company offers great resources to help with your career and educational goals.There is nothing enjoyable about working for this company. They do nothing to incentivize talented individuals and try to keep them for dirt cheap.I've been working for the company for the last four years and have been enjoying working as a Linguist/Translator with Leidos. It is a great company and provides excellent benefits for employees.A typical day of work includes tracking/monitoring hardware assets from inbound shipments from vendors to de-installation/life cycle replacement.Management is for the most part hands-off of our day to day operations.  High visibility projects will sometimes be monitored by management.I work with a dedicated work force that know their jobs and normally perform tasks in a timely manner.The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that hardware accountability is accurate and complete.Not a good environment to work in.  No support, from your team leader and you are asked to do more than what you hired in for.Working for Leidos has been a great learning experience as I have supported several training courses including hazmat, radiological, and law enforcement courses. Negative aspects include substandard healthcare and also lacks sufficient compensation for everything the job entails.Rewarding whent customer is satisfied and give us kudos.I love to work with this company. If I get opportunity, will love to stay with this company..Poor communication from management and little concern for the employee as long as the company does well.Very little comradery among the team. Everyone is more concerned with trying to stay employed.I enjoy working with LEIDOS, I appreciate the helpful management and work peers. I also enjoy that I was allowed to travel and the internal considerations for job employment.The Management at CACI was awesome, however the opportunities for advancement were very slim.  The benefits were good, and they really do try to place you, however, they do low bids from time to time and does not leave room for greater growth.","10,000+",Washington,WASHINGTON,DC,2016-12-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/c3575fcb-fce8-477e-9604-ca5d278cf3bd?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=7,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

69,3122.0,Lead Data Scientist in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Tech College,Capital One,3.9,3000.0,"Answered inbound calls and helped customers apply for healthcare loans. Provided information to Dr offices with status of loans and paper work they may need. Transferred customers to correct department such verification, sales, etc.. Dealing with irate office on check that should of arrived days ago. Or maybe an office that wanted to sign up but did not meet qualifications to do so. Another depressing part was letting customer know they were not approved for the loan. Had pizza parties once month for setting goals on productivity. Won gifts on raffles such Christmas parties and they also gave my kids gifts for Christmas.Working at Capital One Bank has been an amazing experience for me. I have been in a fast paced teller role, at times alone, working through pressure effectively and efficiently all while have a great conversation with the customer. I've been a Relationship Banker where I build lasting financial relationships to help the customer short and long term. I've been in leadership roles where I lead the team successfully, perform duties, and make executive decisions on a Branch Manager level. Although sometimes the hours can be rough, I enjoy every bit of it.Before accepting a management position with this bank, I was warned by industry colleagues about this banks culture and lack of advancement and nepotism.  Well, I took the chance and found that it was true.  Upper management will only promote their friends or hire them with no experience to the role.  Most advancements are for upper leaderships close confidants. Senior Managers are clueless with the department they manage and out of touch of the daily grind.  The company offers great benefits and PTO's and the company sponsored events are great.  Overall, if you are over 40 yrs. old, you will feel unease since they will change the department and create confusion to all associates and will be laid off.  Overall, great company if you are in upper management role and good working relationship with them.Manage and Coach Team Members, Direct Onboarding of New Employees, Conduct Staff Training Sessions, Adhere to Federal Regulations, Complete Monthly Operational Audits, Prepare Daily Over/Short Report, Complete Daily Closing Paperwork, Review New Accounts for Accuracy and Completeness, Champion Service Excellence Culture, Product Education, Referrals / Sales, Transaction Processing, Cashier’s Checks, Cash Advances, Cash Handling, Vault Change Orders, ATM Custodian, Open /Close and Revise Accounts (Checking, Savings, Certificate of Deposit, Safe Deposit Box), Online Set Up / Maintenance.Over the years I have grown a lot working at Capital One because of the opportunities, classes, and encouragement of management.  There are people here who share the same passion and as one team the dream of having superior customer service internally and externally becomes a reality daily.  My favorite part of the job is my daily interaction with people, I really enjoy pouring into people and giving them the tools they need to succeed.  I have learned that hard work, determination, and and consistency are the keys to being successful.  Creating impactful moments is something want to do everyday because its those moments that matter the most and help the company grow.I cannot say enough about the company and the leadership. My three years with Capital One were a blend of positive working relationships, professional development and personal growth. Work life balance made it possible for me to enjoy the fruits of my labors. Long days were not uncommon, but there was always someone there right alongside you to support or lead as needed. Great management team, solid benefits and a fun work environment!Job satisfaction and advancement are largely within your own control.  You must be aggressive, declarative and go after what you want.  The office environment is pleasant, convenient and has lots of perks -- onsite gym, bank, copy facility, health facility, pharmacy.  They provide shuttle service to other buildings.  The culture is spotty...some teams are great and others are disastrous.  This has a lot to do with your individual leader.  They encourage participation in outside organizations, pursuit of additional training and education and have a generous compensation program.  Overall, this is one of the best places I have ever worked.A typical day is taking inbound banking inquiries such as transferring funds and offering beneficial products to customers. Not that much management around since they are constantly changing. There was an awesome co- worker atmosphere, the hardest part was the poor work/life balance. They said that I would not have to close for more than sixth months, but it has been over ten months. The most enjoyable part was making the calls fun and interacting with the customers on a more personable level.A typical day is spent working with my team on a variety of interesting and challenging projects.  Management has been very good in helping us learn new skills and make our team stronger. The recent transition to becoming a ""technology company"" has forced us to learn a lot of new things relating to cloud computing and also how to implement a suitable DevOps model in a very short period of time.  I couldn't ask for a better team.  Everyone on my team is smart and we enjoying learning from each other.  We also mentor one another and there are no ""domain experts"" within the team.The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the massive amount of work that has to be done with very few people doing the work.The most enjoyable part of my job is working on new things and trying out new technologies.  The company is very good in giving us the freedom to branch out and experiment.From day to day, the job is pretty consistent. On the phone servicing high value credit card customers. I work a ten hour day. In my history with capital one there have been many focus sessions on handling different types of customers, ways to change your communication style etc to help you excel to the very best of your ability. The hardest part of the job is the monotony. Though the culture is always changing, quality assurance expectations, incentive changes, etc, at the end of the day the job is still the same and can grow tiring. The things I enjoy most are the people and the extras. We have team outings quarterly, snack carts, merchandise, and competitions to keep things lively and interesting. The benefits are also phenomenal.Offer great work life balance.  Decent benefits.Fairly competitive salary.  Onsite gym and medical office in some locations.  Too many organizational changes and redeployments within Technology. Your bonus will be based on how strong your manager will present your skills against others - so hope for a manager who will fight for you.... Very difficult to be promoted as each department is only allowed so many promotions per year.Working for one of the Best Places to Work in a Banking culture, full benefits and a progressive attitude was a great opportunity to have. Exceptional training, mentoring, advancement and bonuses to truly make a great salary too.High stress environment, bilingual incoming calls, resolving escalated issues for customers and being empowered to arrive at real solutions in a one call scenario. Great work environment.COAF is really a great company to work for. They work hard to keep morale high and really recognize and compensate you for your hard work. My only issue, is that you are reprimanded for things outside of your control (ie a customer cannot or will not pay). Other than that, I highly recommend this company. Not just for employment but for services, too.It was an absolute pleasure to work at Capital One. I have nothing negative to say. Working with my co-workers was a wonderful experience. Most of management was very supportive and available when I needed them. The best part of the job was helping a customer overcome challenges and giving them hope. I've learned to trust my own abilities from my experiences working here.While at Capital One I was able to learn all of the skills that I possess today.  I wrote policies and procedures, assisted with third party agencies to audit financial transactions, and work with internal employees to resolve account issues.  Worked out of Excel and Word on a daily basis.  Created PowerPoint presentation to give to all levels of management.  Answer and return calls in a timely manner and reply to department specific emails.Working here was amazing. Knowing the customer by name and having conversations that where not only about there transactions but also about personal life. Management cared about employee's opinion and worked hard to satisfy their needs. The hardest part was having to leave the company to continue school. The most enjoyable part of working for this company was the overall experience being around management, coworkers, and customers.This is by far the best company I have ever worked for. The atmosphere in our whole building is just friendly and welcoming. Of course there is always one or two bad apples, but for the most part everyone is a pleasure! There are so many opportunities for advancement and growth. Scheduling is extremely flexible and they give a good balance between personal life and work. The Las Vegas site even has an on site health center! I had to leave the company to relocate and unfortunately they do not have a call center where I'm headed, but if I ever return I would definitely reapply!A typical day at work consists of customer service through our call center.  Each call is personal and has its own impact.  I have learned to think outside the box and really put myself into the shoes of the customer as a call center representative.  Leadership is great here and truly ensure you are doing the best you can.  My co-workers make the day go by with conversation and the atmosphere is very comfortable. The hardest part of my job is a dissatisfied customer. I strive to make sure every customer feels valued, so when one is upset after we disconnect it impacts me on a personal level. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I know that I have changed the mood of an upset card holder from a company detractor to a company promoter.Very enjoyable and energetic environment both on campus and  off.  Ratings for compensation and benefits plus security and advancement do not apply as I was a consultant.  Salary rates paid to consultants are very competitive if not more so than other financial institutions or employers for the level of skill required and experience across multiple platforms.Very flexible work environment with the ability for 100% remote work as on-site is not required for firewall administration, design, etc. except in the event of a failure.  Co-workers and management were always available for assistance when needed in order to help the employee and organization succeed in desired goals.A great company to work for if you can get into the right location.  There are a lot of benefits presented by the company, such a tuition reimbursement but managers tend to not like working with students.  The company promotes something but it's not enforced by management which is why it can be a great job if you can get in with good management.Capital One was a pleasurable experience for the most part. They ask a lot but compensate well with salary, bonus, and amazing benefits package that includes not only 401(k) but investments as well! My experience was in a call center. It was fairly laid back although it felt like high school most days due to the lack of maturity exhibits by some associates and most notably management. As my first corporate experience out of college, I learned that you have to stay on top of your stuff in every aspect if you want to move forward. You have to take charge of your future and if one person says ""no"", keep asking people until you get the answer you seek or find out how to change that ""no"" to a ""yes"".","10,000+",Washington,Mclean,VA,2016-11-30T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/22b0835c-872f-4ce7-a654-0d1b519ce39a?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=9,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

74,3127.0,Data Scientist,Humana Inc.,3.7,2100.0,"quite a productive experience, management is superb and very professional atmosphere.  A very fun loving and easy going place to be inI have had some great managers, one's who push you to advance and move up in your professional life.  There is room for advancement dependent on management.  I have also had a not so positive experience with management.  The work at home option is amazing, traveling for the company is also another great experience. I did learn that once I reach the peak of my career, always be willing to teach the person after you.8am to 6 or 7pm - common but it helps knowing you are doing the right thing for our customers.I learned a LOT about claims, Medicare, medical records, grievances, appeals, investigating healthcare providers.The vast majority of management do a great job in communication of goals and how to accomplish a successful career.My last role was difficult since it was ""on the job""/teach yourself type of training.Meeting great friends and mentors. A great understanding of Medicare and passing that knowledge to others.I genuinely like helping people. Working with the elderly population teaches patience, communication skills, and problem solving methods. The hardest part of my job is when i am rarely not able to meet the customer needs. The most enjoyable part of my job is the many members lives I touched over the 8 years I have worked here. Providing members with the health plans they need are of great importance, I educate them so they can enjoy their healthcare experience.They do not care about their employees. It's all about the bottom line. They don't protect their employees. Medical insurance has 1,500 deductible for their employees who are bringing them the customers and the money. Insurance rates are also extremely high. Employees cannot get injured on the job or report anything that happens to them on the job without the fear of losing their their job if they report it to HR.A typical workday involved gathering leads from various sources and contacting businesses (cold calling)I learned how time management and how to be persistent with my goalsManagement was good, however at times if calling on the phone, it may take some time to answer questions due to large number of agents calling in.I was independent contractor. I did not have direct contact with other personnel.The hardest part of this job was working alone... I was not a team environmentThe most enjoyable part of this job is that I was able to set my own hours. Overall I would rate this a great company!!!!Performed audits to ensure Quality and Accuracy of over 200 employees. Coached individuals for peak performance and provided feedback regarding monitoring evaluations to supervisors and employees. Developed and maintained departmental policies, procedures, objectives, and patient care standards. Performed quality control audits to ensure accuracy, completeness, and proper usage of clinical systems data.I work for the medicare-certified area of Humana at home. The state manager is completely inept, rude and hateful. If you go to her manager or HR you are then targeted and harassed until you quit. At that point they don't even know how to work out your notice..sending you home that day. HR does nothing to help you. I actually work with your manager against you. Don't go there you will regret itHumana  provides learning opportunities of strategic paths to improve partnerships between providers and members collectively. There is great collaboration with customers, co-workers, Operating standard contract and providers development and relationships..Process with a goal to make our self and members healthier by 2020The environment is ok but the company really doe not show that they care.  People have gone without raises for the past 4 years.  I would say its a good place for someone who's in school and needs a flexible schedule. Overall not a career job.I enjoyed working at Humana.  I had to navigate through a lot of technical requirements independently as my manager was not very knowledgeable and computer savy.  A typical work day was very busy.  The greatest challenge was related to my lack of wifi coverage due to Humana having a poor service provider.  This was significant because 98% of my job was dependent on access to the internet.A typical day at work consists of providing service to members by directly responding to questions. While delivering value and quality and actively engaging with the members; through every step of their road to wellness. Provided guidance on transactions, inquires, or complaints from consumers. Educated customers, providers and employers about Humana’s products and services; both over the telephone and through face-to-face briefings.Answer inbound calls, and answer any issues for the call Claims information,benefits, except billing,update any new information, and check  payments. How claims were paid, why they may have been denied. Find providers and provide the information to members. I had to go through many different programs to provide information to the members, or provider that were required. Most of all to make sure the clients were happy regardless of the outcomes.job security is based on revenue and departments are  operating in very segregated silos. My department was very laid back and the dress code was lenient most of the time. Working for Humana has a certain positive response from people because it is a large employer in the state of Kentucky, but there is really no corporate loyalty to the the overall well-being and financial security of their staff. You are a cog in a very large machine, no matter your rank.At first things were great then things went south quick.  HR wouldn't protect employees being treated unfairly, bosses were bullies and help personal grudges and bosses showed carelessness by violating an employees protected health information and sending the info out becoming viral.  My career was officially over after that it was just a matter of time.  I only miss helping the patients.i am working in Agile environment with good communication channel and visibility. the are i am working in is core development project where i have roles and responsibilities in all phases of development, right from initial requirement gathering phase to final deployment.Since i have been working in the same area for more then 5 years i am looking forward for more challenges and growth.Humana preaches work/life balance and even allow one hour of ""wellness time"" a week yet your coaches and direct management don't actually allow that. So focused on metrics and meeting numbers and there is no actual caring or helping provided to the members. The coach watches every minute of your day and will notify you accordingly with borderline harassing messages. The focus is all wrong.Working with Humana has opened my eyes up to the real working environment. It allowed me to experience numerous of personalities. My co workers did a great job of making me feel in place when it came down to enhancing my knowledge in certain areas I was not knowledgeable in. I learned how to be a team player in certain situations. The management always had an open door policy when it came to issues and concerns. The hardest part of the job is speaking with members who have had traumatic things happen to them and knowing that there was nothing I could do about it. I really enjoyed how the leaders tried to incorporate fun activities to help understand a new rule that was put in place. I would recommend this job to anyone. It was a stepping stone in my life.Great place to work, great benefits, plenty of overtime. fairness of staff. Learned a lot about office management, Microsoft products.How to research using some of the best systems in the country.  Co workers and management were overall great.hardest part of the job is you are on their schedule and if you have kids that could be hard. But i do not so i did not mind.I enjoyed the learning, the friendships.I just need a change.Contact new and existing customers to discuss their needs, and to explain how these needs could be met by specific services, Seek out new clients and develop clientele by networking to find new customers and generate lists of prospective clients that sometimes get a little hard sometimes but he great team I had is what made it possible.This company is great at the little things that make an employee feel at home.  However, the big things still need some work.  There are a few instances of the ""right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing."" This has occurred as it is a large company and one coast may not keep in mind the factors occurring in certain markets.  Coworkers and direct management is quite good, but the senior leadership is out of touch with certain aspects of roles and responsibilities.","10,000+",Washington,Washington,DC,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/0272fc8f-df27-4d9f-9d0a-7ce65e19f236?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

My coworkers and managers were highly capable, professional, and a pleasure to work with. Employees that truly care about working to their highest level are respected and appreciated. I was given a great deal of latitude to perform my job as well as excellent compensation and benefits. I enjoyed a 9/80 work schedule which meant that I was off every other Friday. Also, due to my length of employment,  I accumulated about 6 weeks of paid time off that could be carried over. The Business Development team I worked with was top notch. I would still be there, but I chose to become a consultant to ease into an early retirement. I would not hesitate to recommend working with the offices that I became familiar with: Greenville, SC and Ft. Worth, TX. A number of colleagues stood out as superior. I've worked for other companies where that's more of a rarity.Good place to work with good benefits (health, Vacation, Sick leave).  Employees treated well.The Sr. Vice President and General Manager was a hands on individual and very approachable.Great place to work and would recommend employment there. They generally take care of their personnel and offer great locations to work and willing to relocate.Pretty sad when management allows people under them to influence there decisions.  You have to walk around the shops on egg shells.PAE was a great company to work for. The people were hard workers and everyone came from different backgrounds from all over the world.I really don't have an opinion of PAE either way. They were awarded the contract at Vance AFB and I have worked for many companies of the past 20 years here. They are like any other company I have worked for.PAE came in and took over a government contract in Fort Lewis, Wa.

I like the hustle an bustle of nightlife and want to be involved with marketing, promotions, and sales. Collabera was great management experience but I want more!Company did great with handling issues that arose during contract.  Great staff and very helpful getting me acclimated to the work environment as well as ensuring frequently that all needs were met.  Would recommend this company for any IT contractor.I've worked with Collabera twice on two different contracts. They establish effective relationships with their clients, their contractors and do a great job of making both stakeholders happy. They view contractors as strategic resources. Outstanding Professionals.Great people to work with. In all it is a really great company to work with.Just please try to help your customers more quickly. Keep up the good work.They tell that when your Temp Job ends they will have something else for you, but they don't. I did like the fact that while I was working there I was always able to get in contact with someone if necessary. They were very nice and would call you every so often to ask how everything was going at work.With Collabera, I worked at CAT in Denison, TX.  I enjoyed my position while working there because I knew exactly what my job requirements were and had the knowledge to achieve my duties.  I appreciated that the management team gave me direction and tools, and allowed me to come up with my own techniques/processes to complete the task at hand.My co-workers and I were very successful at dividing the workload and completing the tasks that were assigned to us.  We actually completed our project 6 months earlier than expected.  This was partially due to the reports that I created to show and changes within the system on a daily basis. This report prevented duplicate efforts since there were several departments working on the same project.The hardest part of the job was when a supplier didn't respond at all to a request that was sent to them. To tackle this obstacle, emails were sent with follow up reminders.  If we continued to receive no response, the supplier's lack of response was escalated to the management team for further action.I truly enjoyed working with a fun group of people at CAT.  The most enjoyable part of the job was creating a rapport with the suppliers and being able to reach and surpass goal expectations.Assured stock levels on the sales floor are maintained at all times.

They never respond to your requests or questions, but if you do anything wrong they will bother you about it. They suck, suck, suck.The company treats its contractors very poorly and under pays them. Contractors often complained to me that all of their support came from India and no one seemed to care. Contractors get no support from Collabera once they are placed in a job. Collabera employees do not have it any better. Management is too focused on the competition to focus on their own employees. Many regional managers are under-trained, do not respect their employees, and the turnover is very high. There is no training. The pay is mediocre and the commissions are, too.see previous review - Collabera is a very good Contract Agency.  I was able to work at IBM for 5 years without any issues with Collabera.  They are professional and everything was handled in a professional manner.Collabera is a good contracting firm to work for, pay and benefits are decent. Their representatives would contact and want to know how things were going. Also, after a contract was completed they made attempts to find the contractor a new contract.I will recommend Collabera to others,  They are a professional IT recruitment agency and has been responsive to all my inquiries. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI have been approached by this ""company"" on over a dozen occasions in the past few months, sometimes via email, sometimes via telephone.   All saying ""We have a postion in PA, Want it?""  (and that is hardly paraphrased).    Oh, and I live 3000 miles AWAY, which they would know if they read the resume of mine they supposedly have.   Today alone, I have had 3 phone calls, and 3 emails, all amounting to not much more than one-liners.    The first phone call was at 5am!.     Attempts to reach the local office to complain resulted in ""We are not accepting calls at this time"".   Seriously?   Based on this unprofessional conduct, I will never to business with them, and they are doing a huge disservice to any employer they represent.In my opinion, Collabera is a great place to work and really has great training for those looking for entry level type positions.The manager at BofA are great. They are very understanding and willing to assist in any way possible. The work experience there was okay. I mean Okay. I like to keep busy. So the majority of the time there. We were looking for something to do. I like to have job security to fill like I am earning an honest pay. The co-work were great to work with. The hardest part of the job was waiting for some grant us access to the different software applications we needed to complete the request.Collabera has provided multiple opportunities to me with its clients to provide consulting services for wireless, wireline and backbone internet solution opportunities.Great contract company always on time and upfront with news from client. in my opinion it could make the contract agency stronger if they could offer some type benefits as in PTO, Sick time. other then that its a great agencyOnce you get a job and or the assignment ends, they don't contact you for another position.

I really enjoyed the people I worked with and the office building was full of fun things that allowed you to escape the daily grind when needed. There was not a lot of job security with my position, but the company took very good care of its employees.

Not the great place to work as advertised.Great atmosphere, great people, all around fun place to work.A typical day at snagajob would include coming in to work; logging on to your computer and expecting your manager to ask a boat load of questions about your evening.It was nice to have the freedom to complete projects freely, however, I wish I was able to work on more advanced projects.",,Washington,Arlington,VA,2016-11-22T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/94e6cc70-6df5-41f5-84e2-8c0d0b34d425?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

84,3137.0,Data Scientist Solution Architect,Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC),4.1,1300.0,"Work for them for over 6 years, great company! Worked on a variety of Coast Guard support contracts. They care about their staff.SAIC is, in my opinion, primarily focused on getting the job done and protecting their resources - the people that work for them. Typically at work, people work with one another on complex problems and the atmosphere seems open to others asking questions.Really the only down side of the management is that they're intent on starting new initiatives to benefit employees, but there is often little follow through.The most enjoyable part of the job is when the customer expresses their gratitude and delight at the job we've done.It was my favourite place. The people, the contracts, the systems we worked on. Fascinating. But these are government contracts and those come with rules and the contracts are sometimes awarded as 1 year with 3 extra years optioned. So carefully charging correctly and staying in POP dates and not charging incorrectly is a big deal. Option years suck because that means your only guaranteed 1 year. They could go somewhere else for the next 3. Every year, your worried about the next option year being approved. It's like working on one year contracts and stressing every year that you might be laid off.The SAIC team that I worked with in Charleston, SC took on projects in a team orientated manner.  Most work performed had input from other team members and project managers. This helped in preventing errors in projects and put more confidence behind the product. Also, management was good about being flexible when it came to needing time off for family, etc.. Overall my time at SAIC was a pleasant experience and I was able to learn, take on new tasks, and grow within the company.work Monday threw Friday 8 hours days start early A.M. when I'm home I typically test equipment an build the system up before we send them out on road before we install them into vehicle's. I travel all over united states to different military bases. Typically about five to seven guys who go on the road.  we  make sure after we install the system into vehicles we make sure it is operational then we train an teach military guys that the system is up an running an answer any question that they have.Working in a small dynamic engineering team, we have set product goals to meet quarterly. I work closely with a group of engineers that are motivated and innovative, like me. The culture of the company is very cohesive. I have enjoyed working here with much gratitude, and I hope to accrue the same with a new company in the mid-west where my parents reside.SAIC is prime on several contracts so it is easy to go to a different project if you wish, but for a company whose only product is it's people it really does not invest in its product. They cut benefits and then the following year sent out flyer bragging about record profits. That just has not sat well with many employees.A typical day at work involved classroom instruction with students from a specialized branch of the Navy. I learned that no matter how much you think you know that there is always something new to learn. The client management was very demanding and did not provide much in the way of resources. The Corporate management of SAIC was supportive and went out of their way to take care of us. My co-workers were all former military professionals that provided subject matter expertise on many different subjects.The hardest part of the job was the long hours, many times in excess of 14 hour work days. The most enjoyable part of the job was the realization of our students comprehension and application of the instruction we provided for them.I was lucky enough to  work for SAIC on the same contract for 5+ years.  The pay was excellent and the travel was exhaustive at times, but rewarding.  If I could, I would stay with SAIC but our contract was not renewed and the Company does not have any positions open for my skill set.At SAIC I have learned a lot about working with customers and working as a team. There are many high quality people with a lot of skills which I work with.The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to work with a group of professional people and knowing I am performing work for the military.It was a contract job but the Management treated all staff very well with great benefits. It was a great environment to work and there was a great team work in accomplishing the tasks.Unfortunately the contract ended and we were laid off.I love this company, it is a fast paced work environment that lets you utilize both technical knowledge and common sense to get the job some. the people are a great to be around, and the work is enjoyable.I have worked here for four years and enjoy helping the training of our first responders in courses for terrorist attacks. You get to work in a unique environment.This job was Gov't  contract work, so your job is always on the line, I learned so much at this job, as I was just a material handler but I wore many hats, wherever needed I was there.Great contractor company to get your feet wet in. Poor management at 1602. Fun people to work around but upper management they all are friends and if your not in the CLICK you get walked on. It's hard to advance unless you know someone.The managers are dedicated to looking after the employees and supporting needs for change or adjustment based on the growing development of SAIC and its clients.Good company to work for.  Managers take care of their people.  Great opportunities for networking within and outside of the company.  Lots of opportunities to change work locations to move around.SAIC has been a great opportunity. This company believes in mentoring their employees and ensuring professional growth. SAIC is a fast moving environment that requires extensive detail to systems and paperwork.A work day was always filled with something new. From preparing for a class to being out on the range. I learned a lot about self motivation and resiliency. Along with hosting classes I had my own personal duties consisting of ordering supplies, organizing my co workers schedules, accompanying the managers for meeting. My managers where very kind and had a vast knowledge base if I ever had any questions. There was nothing really to hard about working there. We worked as a team and someone was always able and willing to help the next person. I really enjoyed the fact that everyday was different and that we worked so closely with or customers.SAIC provides a great stable work environment. At SAIC you will work with some of the brightest and smartest people in the whole  country.The hardest part of the job is when the client does not take your recommendations.Best of part of job is that SAIC customers are world  class.I know it's hard to claim, but there are few places that truly have that organic relationship between management and workers. SAIC happens to be one such place. At no time do the workers feel under appreciated. That being stated it should be pointed out that SAIC is in the same work category as Booze Allen, Harris, Lockheed Martin and other DOD contract companies. So if you don't care for uncertain futures or periodically searching for another place of employment, seems to happen every bid cycle. Avoid. However if none of that bothers you and you love the excitement of it all, SAIC is the place for you.","10,000+",Washington,MCLEAN,VA,2016-11-11T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/e58a9fc5-5d48-44ee-9268-61a9095d050f?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I would love to work in this place because there are endless opportunities to grow.The company took over the contract and immediately began removal of experience personnel - after flooding the environment with new people. Very inexperienced personnel.Getting to work on time, greeting my coworkers and preparing to do my job. Which is either starting a new task or finishing up one. I normally  help coworkers  when  need to the best of my ability, then continue my work. Take lunches  and come back to work to finish my 8 hr or more work day.My last 4-5 years I have  been traveling all over the US and over-seas .Pretty good company to work for.  HR, security, job relocation and placement is above average.  A tremendous benefit to CACI are the Program Managers -- the liaisons between corporate and the workforce.  If your PM is good, which mine was, the ability to focus on your job is easy.  If not...Good Education opportunities.Better compensation would be a good addition.Expatriation is a good addition to the contract.Greater opportunity to engage with management.Caci was my first company to work for.They were an excellent organization and they took care of their personnel as well, great company.Better than average management. Company stresses and upholds high standards for integrity and performing quality work. It is diversified and not prone to micromanaging.Training Soldiers on a continuous basis can be challenging but very rewarding. During the working cycle stateside traveling is a frequent event to and from different locations.Manager is incompetent and his business practices are unethical. You will have little to no job security working with this company. Lay-offs are common. The manager has made a bad name for himself here at Crane, IN in the 8 short years he's been around.Provides the environment to support and stretch ones abilities. Employee advancement rests in the individual.  Your high level of success at CACI is directly tied to your skills and dedication and the opportunities provided for career growth.I Typed documents such as correspondence, drafts, memos, and emails, and prepared 3 reports weekly for management. I Opened, sorted, and distributed incoming messages and correspondence. I Purchased and maintained office supply inventories, and being careful to adhere to budgeting practices. I Greeted visitors and determined to whom and when they could speak with specific individuals and I Recorded, transcribed and distributed minutes of meetingsCACI so far has been a stable employer.  It is a good place to start your career.  I do recommend this company.  You are not tied to your work 24/7.Full of blowhards and suck ups. Promotions are based on ability to suck maximum bottom since no real work is ever completed. If you are good at pretending to work and staring at a computer for hours this might be the job for you. Spending time interning for a panhandler would be a better use of time.The setting was relax and fun. You know what you job i and what your goals are everyday. Management sometime was up and down but was willing to working on fixing the problem to the ensure a better workplace.Working for the CACI I was very productive and learned a lot while working in the position.While working in my position I learned a lot on the jobI started with CACI not that long ago. I love the environment. It  feels like everyone is trying to help you.  Great benefits and good healthcare. Overall one the best places I ever worked for.GIS processing with plenty of opportunities for additional training.  Pleasant environment with lots of opportunity for advanced training at college on online.I liked working here for the most part - the people were great and had lots of institutional support and even the benefits were above average. There is much to do within the company for someone who wants to learn new things. It is a major governmental contractor with 14,000 employees or thereabouts. However due the vagaries of the government-contract world most of the office was laid off or furloughed without any notice. We had been expecting years' worth of work but it did not come come to fruition. I do not blame CACI for this necessarily - it could very well have been the fault of another contractor - but in my particular realm of CACI jobs can be on the insecure side.","10,000+",Washington,Washington,DC,2016-11-08T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/33838d5b-e571-431a-a772-5976a64c503e?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Everyone was great to work with and would help each other when possible.Grumman used to be a very good company to work for lately New Management transitioning from California to Florida the management really does show appreciation to the employeesI worked at NG on the VITA/COV project. This project was somewhat negative in that all three major entities (NG, VITA, State agencies) distrusted and disliked one another which made meetings, strategy and planning extremely tedious and painful.The work, however, was strategically challenging and enjoyable, and the staff was mostly great to work with.I would no recommend NG if you are under a contract. As a direct hire, they seemed like quite a nice place to put down roots if you could handle the pace.I enjoyed working at Northrop Grumman. The work was challenging and interesting. Management was helpful and communicated well. My colleagues were friendly and helpful.Working in the B-2 aircraft depot I tested and verified that all systems were functioning before flight. During build process, troubleshot systems that are not working. While working in the depot I learned the B-2 aircraft as a whole. When I worked in engineering, I was responsible for my specific box. now I know the aircraft as a system. I have never worked with such an amazing team of people before. I looked forward to going to work every day. my co-workers contribute to that.The hardest part and the most enjoyable is trying to fix a system that is not working.I already reviewed this company. This program will not allow me to pass up this part of the process of applying for a job. And I already did it once.The work is rewarding overall but the Management leaves quite a bit to be desired in some of the departments. Depending on the person and the Manager is whether you can even get advancement. By this I mean, your work doesn't matter, it's the person themselves that counts and not the work.I learned so many things working for Northrop Grumman. I was able to learn how to do sheet metal work and SMAW welding. Highlt recommend this company. Excellent benefitsThis is the best company I worked for. Great pay. Great work place. Great benefits. Great training. Great lanes for advancements. Great job projects. Many different work locations to select from.The company has good benefits overall.  I was present on a project that replaced the PM with someone barely out of school.  Lack of understanding of Client caused a loss of contract.Excellent for technology education and advancement into shipping, space programs or a military career.  This companies in field hands on training process is the one of the better ways for skilled labors to achieve a certificate of completion while being paid for an honest days work.I enjoyed working there. Wish the company was more involved in the community especially in the Oklahoma City Area. Good job security depending on the program.Management at the office constantly had hands tied in assisting people under them by their managers. The ability for advancement of job or work environment was not there.NGC has made a lot of progress under current leadership. Definitely heading in the right direction as far as sales and technology go. Very talented top management and overall a good place to work.The pay scale is low and layoffs are a part of culture there.  If you take a job here, don't expect longevity.  The production manager's leadership style leaves a lot to be desired.  Seems to be okay with categorizing employees based upon gender.I really liked working there because the job(s) were interesting and the people are great. the hours are good and they have an employee gymcompany was fined for pesticide spraying and never compensated any injured employees. Managers were fined and severely warned for repeated wrong behavior but never terminated or disciplined.I loved working for the company as well as the people.Definitely room for advancement in the company, and diversity is very well important and acknowledged.Management only listens to management.  There are benefits in working for a large company.  There is an atmosphere that it's easier to get ahead because of who you know and not what you know.I support a very small team of technical writers and testers.  We sit together daily and communicate all day discussing work issues.  The atmosphere is extremely present.  I am not only a supervisor but a key contributor.  The hardest part of my job is delivering unpleasant reviews or terminations to staff because of budget cuts.  I enjoy the team and the team atmosphere.  It is a pleasure to come to work with seasoned professionals who love their job.I feel like I lost a family.

Co-workers not professionally diverse but eager to learn.  Company very focused on formula driven growth rather than innovation, although some staffers are inquisitive about learning other disciplines and innovation.  Most enjoyable part of the company is working with an enthusiastic staff, while hardest part is team building - not a team culture.  I really enjoy working here! The Downtown DC office is a fun environment to work in -complete with a foosball table/game room and massage chair. The Partners of the company are really down to Earth, easy to get along with, and you can tell they really care about the employees. HWC does a lot of nice things for its employees like Happy Hours, parties, monthly birthday cakes, and a paid day of community service. The management team really seems to notice and reward hard work in terms on bonuses and promotions.wouldn't work there again... the management sucks and the projects are unpredictable",,Washington,Washington,DC,2016-10-27T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/4d7ece72-55f7-4656-ae14-0b1dba1ea9ae?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=30,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
91,3144.0,Data Scientist,CIA,4.4,88.0,"Like any large bureaucracy, there are issues, but I found lots of advancement opportunities, interesting work, and even travel! Something for everyone there.The CIA offers unique experience, and predominantly train on the job for these positions, once professionals exceed the final cut for education, a battery of tests, and clearances.  Individuals are encouraged to think for themselves within the framework of regulations, and often travel alone worldwide to assist case officers abroad with technical help.Great equal opportunities for all sexes, races, and health handicaps (I even saw a blind man pushing the postal cart through the halls). One has to get used to paranoid behavior when working in this environment.I served as an Executive Assistant at the Agency for 23 years,  I had no typical day!  I woke up every morning wondering what new and exciting thing I was going to learn that day, and I was rarely disappointed,   I was fortunate to have excellent managers who truly appreciated and rewarded exceptional performance, both monetarily and with plum assignments,  I served at eight different Embassies and Consulates all over the world.  My spouse was an agency employee as well (a finance officer) and management made every effort to see that we had tandem assignments.Our co-workers were dedicated public servants who were there for the same reason we were - to serve our country,  There were the usual petty complaints but they were infrequent.The hardest part of my job was also the most enjoyable:  being away from my extended family for long periods of time, but living overseas and exposing my children to an international life was an experience I wouldn't trade for anything!Work at the Agency has been one of my best life experiences.  They work hard to breed a culture of trust, mentoring, and good management.  From the people, to the continuous learning opportunities, and diversity of work all under one employer.  There are few companies that can provide work that interests you no matter how your interests change, and with the flexibility that they do.  A very positive culture all together.A typical day in the office consisted of typing documents that were classified and handled according to the classification code that was given to it.  When the documents were completed, it was given to the appropriate supervisor for review.  The position also required that all files were locked at all times except when it was necessary to insert additional information in them.  Management was easy to work with and like most organizations, they rated your performance.  I was fortunate to have a good relationship with all of my co-workers.  The hardest part of my job was remembering to always destroy the burn bags when there was a fire drill.  If someone forgot to do this, they were reminded that this action was not acceptable.  Having a good working relationship with my co-workers (of all ages and backgrounds) was an enjoyable part of my job.Outstanding Career Opportunities. Over my 36 year career I advanced to the Senior level of Government Service. Although I was hired on as a Mechanical Engineer, I was able to choose other career paths as desired.I had a long and successful career with CIA for 39 years.  I changed job tracks 3 times during my career and served in several different support jobs.  Training opportunities were excellent.This is an HOA management company. Company is one of the best in their industry, but doesn't value it's employees. There is no motivation or supervisor support.The best part about my job is serving my country.  I've learned key leadership skills, as this company provides some of the best leadership courses available.This place developed my research skills and taught me to be a better analyst.  The hardest part of the job was finding the right fit for my skills and interests.  I wanted to maximize my potential and be in a position of leadership.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when I had the opportunity to travel, brief and manage projects.It's very different.  Basic / Flexible hours. Everything is discreet. Management is not that great. Co-workers are co-workers. If you would like an opportunity to serve your country, this is it.The agency is everything you wouldn't expect. The management style is severely lacking and it causes a lot of problems. People are reassigned constantly in positions they aren't qualified for which also causes havoc.The office politics are very charged and can effect you easily. Stay on your toes.Security is very tight and you will have a gun aimed at your face at least once during your time an as employee here. I did meet some very famous people during my 2 years here. No names of course, sorry.Work/life balance is excellent as you can't take any work home with you. But you probably figured that out by now.Exciting - moving - hectic. Loved it all - sorry I left! Family life was the reason I left.Excellent Benefits, great work/life balance. Very stable environmentWork was enjoyable do to the places lived and visited.  Like anywhere some people were fun to be around at work and some not.There is no better place to use your technical skills and talents to the benefit of our nation's security and no better place to have an impact on our nation's leadership.By law, I am not permitted to provide information on this subject.Great federal employer and provides challenges to today's global issues that need to be solved.  Would do it all over again.Working for the government is great if you like to travel.  The pay is not so great and living in the DC area is also not so great.  Lots of opportunity to move around and learn other things.It has it good and bad points, it has good benifits and good pay.A typical workday for a finance and operations support officer is a standard 8-5 work schedule.  This all depends on the particular job, operation and location as this could obviously increase from time to time.  It is all dependent on the particular set of goals at the time.You learn to work with a variety of personnel during the course of your career.  From staffers to briefings to senior management.Management, at least in the area of finance and support, is at times lacking.  Like any office, I have had great managers and at others absolutely horrible.The hardest part of the job is coming to grips that regulations basically outweigh common sense at times.  Hey, it's the government.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the opportunities that the Agency offers and the sense of duty it can provide. It has in some offices, flexible schedules which are family friendly.  You will also have the opportunity to travel abroad if that is one's goal.",,Washington,Washington,DC,2016-10-26T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/11d586be-405f-4a88-aad8-e4e3e4e81d42?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=31,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
92,3145.0,Data Scientist,The Advisory Board Company,3.6,71.0,"I was only an intern at the company for little over a month and a half last summer... but I had a great experience working for such a high end company for the first time.Working retail is like a surprise party, you never know what to expect but it will be wonderful When a customer enters the store I assist them with their every need, if it be a small gift for themselves, a gift for a special occasion, or a corporate gift. Personal service is key to customer service and it pleases me to provide it!I can honestly say that the people at the Advisory Board are the smartest I've ever worked with.  They're very technically savvy and interacting with them is pleasant (especially from my position in IT).  The business processes are somewhat outdated, but we're working to change them.  I'm very bullish on the future of ABC.I've loved working here. I would recommend anyone looking for place to start their career to look here. They are very fast, and systems oriented, and also offer great training. Very selective though.Company is filled with many bright and talented individuals. Training and onboarding are rapid and do not allow for an adjustment period. Management, unfortunately, likes to micro-manage. Benefits package is robust and more than generous. ""Work/Life Balance"" is touted often, but you are judged for not making your job part of your life.Fun place to work but definitely will have some growing pains. Need to work a lot of overtime for a very minimum salary. Will learn a lot and get support that you need but it is not the best place to work.great place to work for. lots of opportunity for someone with no experience in the work place. Lots of vacation, not enough time t take them.Over the 3 years I've worked at the company it has struggled to transition from a startup to a larger organization. Lot of the fun qualities that attracted top talent have left, along with the talent. The software is facing scaling issues and lacks the flexibility needed to stay competitive in the current market.Advisory Board is a great place to grow your career. You're going to be around highly motivated, and intelligent people, who are also there to see your succeed.A sincere company that earnestly wants to be as good as it can b, but is in conflict between product and service driven priorities.Great culture with brilliant employees, everyone is incredibly hard working but can make it difficult to maintain a reasonable workload.  Salaries are quite lowGreat culture and intelligent bunch of people to work with. Great opportunities for career advancement. Great benefits and paid time off. Only con that I can think of is that the compensation is a little low for entry level jobs.Great benefits, working with smart, great people. Can work from home, lots of PTO days. Management was chaotic, and they kept incompetent people around for way too long.I did not serve directly on this board as the contract that I was working under expired prior to a meeting being held.  The board was created to assess and recommend projects for the school.Difficult for career advancement for non-consulting positions. Transparency in communication of expectations across multiple areas is lacking. Collaborative working space. Benefits include typical health benefits, but also include gym memberships, healthy life hours, and community impact hours.Great work place to start right our of college.  Everyone is super young, including management.  Which is a draw-back.  Once you're no longer interested in an entry-level position, it is extremely difficult.Great people. Bad work/life balance. Decent managers that are transparent. A lot of work but good experience if you are a new graduate entering the workforce.Working for Crimson, the Austin-based subsidiary of the Advisory board, can be pretty rewarding. The office is modern, the people are smart, and there is potential to do exciting work. However, the company struggles with product acquisitions and working on one of those teams can be a nightmare. The company also struggles with its upper level management and strategies and during my time there I witnessed a lot of wasted money and effort because of meaningless corporate politics and misguided decisions. Finally, managers and directors talked a big game when it came to creating a solution for data analytics in the healthcare space but never showed or proved that they had even the slightest clue as to actually creating a marketable product in this category.The purpose of the one advisory board  was to improve communication, access to care and collaboration with other colleagues who were nurse educators to improve the MYO programABC is a fun place to work with great benefits and trips involved. They make it sound pretty glamorous as far as advancement, chanting that in 8-12 months with internal internship experience and great performance you are for sure going to get promoted and in turn make a high a salary... don't believe it.They find an ""excuse"" to deny almost every promotion, and hand out performance plans to ever entry level employeeA day in the concierge position is never Typical! anything can happen and anyone can come off of the elevator.

I have not learned much because the options are very few for advancement at this company. I feel that the communication levels and people skills are below effective. In my case, there is no hardest or enjoyable part about the job.This job has always had me on my feet. I worked months straight. But at least I always had something to do. Although it was very productive, it would be hard at times. Mainly, because you have to find the appropriate person for the job.Seneca was a decent place to work but I was warned when I started by many of the employees that had been there for some time that they layoff frequently. One such employee told me she had survived 3 layoffs last year she was layed off. The company is very secretive about it and you won't know until it's too late. I enjoyed working here because it was an easy environment with good managers in my department. The layoff and the way they handled it made me feel very much betrayed by those that I had come to trust and regard as collegues.Great place to work. People were nice, and the environment was a nice office to work in. Always enjoyed the holiday parties and company picnics.Great place to learn the ins and out of the oil and gas industry.

98,3151.0,Data Scientist – Predictive Analytics,Gallup,3.9,64.0,"For my first job right when I turned 16 making two dollars over minimum wage; I was ecstatic about this job.  We made our own work schedule with breaks whenever we decided. I learned how to time managed and it taught me what being accountable for yourself is about.I worked at Gallup for a very short period of time. This was because I had been ill and just recently found out I was pregnant. They have a minimal 20 hours you must meet weekly, but with being ill and doctors appointments, I was unable to meet that requirement and was terminated. Truthfully, my medical absents should have been excused, but clearly was not. I was working as a telephone interviewer, and by outbound calls, spoke to various people about taking a survey. Many said no, due to the fact we were always calling around their dinner times, and I was often cursed at, yelled at, or hung up on. Although these statements are true, my experience at Gallup was not entirely miserable. During my employment there, I learned how to professionally handle complicated situations over the phone and how to maintain an understanding of people's time schedules. The management and other employees were very nice, especially during the training period of this journey. It seemed there was always something going on in the office, other than working. They had games set up that you could earn a spot to, and each hour team were able to win prizes.I got to do the StrengthsFinder and found out that my strengths are- Competition, Strategic, Achiever, Activator and WooWorked part and full time through college earning tuition reimbursement while a full time college athlete and part time employee at Strike Zone and at the Gateway.Gallup has an amazing culture, which allows for a material amount of autonomy in execution.  Their only requirement of employees is the completion of time sheets.  This enables the teams to develop ways to complete work that fits the individual or small team needs very well.It's a fairly straight forward job; you know what is expected of you, you come in and get your work done and leave. The work environment is incredibly positive and encouraging, and there is plenty of room to advance in that career. The cold calling can be difficult at times, and dealing with difficult customers on the phone can be challenging, but in the end, you know what you're doing is going towards something bigger than yourself.You'll love this job if you like struggling to meet quota and talking to rude people all day. The pay is good when you can actually meet quota which is rare unless you're a chick. Nobody wants to pick up their phone and participate in a stupid Gallup poll. The questions are very personal and repetitive. If I got called by Gallup I'd tell them to f*%# offI loved Gallup & the people who worked there, had there been a chance for FT, benefits etc, I'd have stayed there until I retired.You make your own schedule but Gallup doesn't open until 3pm. The training takes three to four weeks. During the training period you get a guaranteed $10.00 an hour.  Once off the training team you can start on banks if youre good enough. Your days consist of mainly taking surveys. You get a half hour break time that wont affect your dial time, any longer than that and you lose some.good flexibility and good pay if you can handle the work.  I had no problems when I had 2 best friends there but one left and one got fired.  same thing day after day week after week really gets the best of you after about a year.Gallup tends to lure most of their applicants in at the beginning: promising you lots of benefits such as health insurance, job security and easy relocation/reestablishment past the contract period, tuition reimbursement, and a high base pay. They also continue when you arrive for training: you are a prestigious member of their company and practically irreplaceable, etc. (their ""group interviews"" and the first night of training is basically sitting through a long propaganda lecture about how great Gallup is). What they neglect to tell you is that is purely a commissions based position (after the training period) and you may struggle to earn minimum wage a lot of the time. They have a lot of confusing methods you have to learn through a brief classroom training period and also as to how you can ""progress"" at this company. I asked the manager about it at the group interview and he pretty much admitted this is basically a dead-end job; the only real way to ""progress"" is by adding more hours on your schedule, but this definitely isn't a career to carry you through life (unless you're impeccably charismatic and persuasive on the phone, in which case you'd be better off being a used car salesman or a real estate agent where the pay is more promising). Obviously with these kinds of jobs there is a high turnover rate, and the kick to that is that they are constantly dealing with the new people and dealing with space decreases as you desperately try and find a place to work everyday (unless you manage to earn a desk, which can be done in 4 weeks at the very SOONEST). You won't be  more... very appreciated, either in this environment or society in general, because you'll be doing cold calling all over the country at the weirdest hours that disturb people - you're basically a telemarketer in their eyes. Be prepared to deal with that. The props I can give are the mostly flexible hours. As long as you work 20 hours/week when you start, you can work anytime as long as you work a full shift on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. Note that your hours here aren't necessarily calculated in time but production units. So yeah, you can begin work at 3pm, maybe not complete as many surveys as anticipated (yeah there's a quota for each survey project), clock out at 11pm and maybe you've only earned less than promised pay. Because if you're not on the dialer, you many as well be slacking off in their minds. If you need some extras and you don't mind struggling through a job, this is good for you. If you prefer stability, a stable work environment, more appreciation, then I'd look elsewhere.  lessThe work environment and people were awesome and the spirit and everyone  was so positive i enjoyed my time working there.i currently work here at Gallup and its a great job but only a great student job or part time job. If youre living on your own taking care of bills and things like that its not the best job. Only reason i say this is because you wont have a set pay itll vary depending on your surveys. Besides that its an okay job i guess.A typical day at work involves greeting my co workers, calling clients and gathering opinions about various topics. I enjoy working with all my coworkers and managers. The hardest thing about my job is making sure I spend adequate time with my respondents and making sure that I stay on task. The best part about my job is the opportunity to speak with a wide variety of people.call and place surveys for the company, nice co-workers, clean environment, flexible with those who are in school. I would not recommend the job to a friend though.I enjoyed my experience with Gallup. I learned and developed customer service skills via telephone while working inside their company.A typical day at Gallup was a blessing or a curse. You never knew how the people you were calling were going to be that day. The hardest part of the job was having to stay on the phone while being cussed out by a complete stranger.Typical is sitting in a small cubicle with an auto dialer . Calling and asking people questions. Management is okay people who work there very nice. Job is extremely boring.  Everything must be read verbatim. Best part is its flexible hours worst part is pay.Did not like working here. The people were rude and cold. There was not a chance for job advancement at any time I worked there. Just awful.Enjoyed coworkers and got along well with management.  The company lunches and frequent traveling team leads that gave insight into upcoming projects kept things interesting.  Weekly Agile design meetings were the best.I would recommend working here.I've been at Gallup for the past couple years. The people are extremely talented and you know what is expected of you when you come to work.Writing and producing a shared vision is an amazingly fulfilling experience.  Talking to an audience one - to - one exhilarates any tired mind.

99,3152.0,Counterterrorism Communications Data Scientist,OBXtek Inc.,3.0,4.0,"Was laid off due to performance issue but given no verbal or written documentation explaining what the issues were. I just got a call one morning from PM saying I am off the contract due to the Fed's sayingI was not training up fast enough. Two things here went wrong. 1) I should have been counseled by the PM prior to being notified. 2)The PM should have investigated the issues and not let the Fed's influence them as I don't work for the Fed's I worked for OBX.It is not up to a Fed to say who goes or who gets hired it up to the contract.I actually liked the job and it was a up training for me but it certainly was not out of my realm of knowledge. I was actually doing 70% of the job in the short amount of time.All I can say is this is a horrible company to work with and for.  AVOID!.  Owner hires Project Managers that don't know a thing about Federal contracts or any experience with Information Technology.  Saw a complete turn over of staff due to the mismanagement of the Project Managers lack of experience with Gov Contracts.  Had numerous complaints to the owner of the company but was told he can't touch the project manager due to a contract they had with him.  I saw 1 co-worker forced to be fired by the Gov Contract agency due to PM mis-mismanagement and 1 was written up for providing passwords that the PM requested even though the PM had not been PIV'd, he should not of even been allowed in the building............I realized quickly upon joining OBXtek that I had an opportunity to roll up my sleeves and be part of real team of professionals. Hard working and very smart people who legitimately take pride in their work. I am looking forward to working with this team again and wish them the best as they grow!I just started at OBXtek and couldn't be happier.  Ignore the negative press.

102,3155.0,Data Scientist,Vox Media,4.3,4.0,"A wonderful workplace environment. Everyday is a new challenge, in a sense. My experience has forced me to become more diligent and resourceful with my time. The onus is entirely on you to get better. I learn from the people I work with because they, too, are writers. Which is maybe the hardest part of the job: finding the time to read everything. And I read more than anything else I do! I also enjoy working from home quite a bit, easily the best part of the job.I've only worked for Vox Media for a short time on a part-time basis as a news desk writer for SB Nation, but I like what I've seen from the company. They are clearly on the cutting edge of new technologies and innovations in the field. My work consists of writing news stories in four hour shifts. At time the work can be tedious, but it also provides me opportunities to be creative.A typical day included myself and my studio manager, creating lighting set ups for the first show and prepping our control room to capture it. During the run of the show I would get a list of tasks from my executive producer for the day. They would include anything from trouble-shooting new equipment, going on a run to meet one of our freelance editors, or even cleaning up our storage space. Our management was good, they were fair, understanding, and only pushy when they needed to be. My co-workers were all similar to me in age and we generally had a good deal of fun while working together. Hardest part of my job would be after lunch when I normally broke down both studios alone since my manager had to be in meetings with the higher ups. The most enjoyable part was just working in the studio, listening to music and telling funny stories from the night before.it's a great place to work! each day is a new adventure. Projects are great, people are great for the most part.

I have had the opportunity to take on a greater leadership role, which has been very satisfying.A typical day begins with emails about a dozen new policies. God and the favoritism! Hardwork is not valued here and there is constant harassment of one form or another.There is a high staff turnover.Management have favorites. Promotion is non-existent, all moves are lateral. Working harder does not equal compensation. Low compensation.I truly enjoyed my time with IMTAS, it was a team oriented company that tried to make sure their employees where taken care of when working away from the HQ building.  During my time there, I was able to learn and broaden my knowledge of Project and Program Management.  I had the support of IMTAS and my supervisor when stuck with difficult decisions.  If I had an option I would have stayed with IMTAS and continued my career with them.IMTAS was a great company to work for, they always had an open door policy. If ever I had an issue with pay or any HR related topics,all i had to do was place a call and they would address the issue.The company seems alright in the beginning. But seems like words are are stronger than their actions. Compensation is minimal. They will task you with work with no long term benefits. Management has their favorite picks. Promotion seems to be based in who they like more rather than who has done a better job.At IMTAS I did a little bit of everything. Some days I would help receive new equipment in.  I ran Excel sheets on all inventory. Helped organize the warehouse. Once the equipment was in I shadowed engineers as they completed their diagrams. I helped install servers to racks, run wiring back and forth, and install and update firewalls. I also helped test cameras and software.Uncommunicative management and frequent policy upheaval.Great place to work.There were no difficulties with work.Everyday brought new task but it also depends on your job placement.It was a good company to work for but unfortunately my contract ended. My co-workers were very nice and we had a good team work.I also liked my supervisor, he was very nice and helpful.Responsibilities include supporting various project management teams in controlling project cost and schedules, using Microsoft EXCEL to develop project plans, status reports, financial reports, budgets, and data updates for Government and contractor project management personnel to use in the management and control of project activities.

Difficult to get promoted or increase earnings if established employee.I work in the IT department and we make up more than half of the company, even though we're a financial institution.  So if you're looking for an IT position, you're in good hands.  One thing that stands out at Freddie Mac is that they are very good at building their employees, not only to do well at their jobs, but outside of the workplace through their wellness rewards program and teleworking option.  I recognize Freddie Mac as one of the leaders in developing their employees through numerous vendor and internal training.  They make all their employees and contractors priority one.I was a contractor so my experience may not be representative of most peoples experiences, but it was by far the most difficult companies to work at. The team of 15 analysts had to squeeze into a small room, working 12-17 hour days, we also involuntarily worked weekends. My manager even went as far as to reprimand some coworkers for asking for time on Sundays to go to church. HORRIBLE experience.As a previous team member the company is doing good work in the REO area to assist homeowners.  The company is aware of how the REO department can impact homeowners and has put some really good programs into place to assist homeowners possibly stay in their home and/or assist the homeowners move to the next phase in their life.•	Worked in the design and development phases of the application using ROR framework.•	Used Rails, AJAX, JSON, CSS and JQUERY to design the front end of the application. Back end of the application is developed mainly using Active Records.•	Created and deployed new features and amend existing features.•	Developed and tested many features in an AGILE environment using Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS JavaScript, Bootstrap, Rspec, and Html.•	Involved in developing and implementation of the web application using Ruby on Rails.•	Coded model level validation using Ruby programming with emphasis in web security.•	Handled caching in Ruby on Rails.Freddie Mac has a great work/life balance.  They promote improvement by providing college reimbursement and health by providing health club reimbursement.  The company's culture is one that attempts to create a close family like environment for  employees by providing monthly events.  They attempt to keep the employees informed by having monthly Townhall meetings and has an open door policy.Management in the Business Rules area of Strategic Delivery demonstrates cronyism on a daily basis.  If you are not one of their 'favorites', they will go out of their way to withhold support and advancement opportunities.  Leadership is poor, at best.  The leadership team understands the technical side of the business but has little to no experience managing people.Big company with lots of opportunities and good work life balance. Lots of training and development opportunities. Easy to move around within company and people are friendly and easy to work with.Good culture. Productive company moving in great directions. Great co-workers, network opportunities.  The learning experience is an asset you carry with you to other career opportunities.Freddie Mac is a secured campus, with five buildings in row that reminds me of a college campus. Cafeteria was delightful and Tysons Corner mall was a five minute ride up the street.While Management is very political and bureaucratic in nature, this company offers employees great opportunities for work-life-balance at a reasonable pay.Freddie Mac is one of the best organizations to work for in the Mortgage / Finance Industry.In the almost 15 years of working at the firm, I have had amazing opportunities to work in multiple divisions within the organization, and be recruited into special projects that impacted the firm at large.  Freddie Mac offers competitive salary and fantastic benefits such as relocation benefits, outstanding healthcare and work life balance work arrangements.Smart motivated people doing good things. One challenge is that the perpetual state of conservatorship makes it harder for the company to align itself with long-term business goals.Scrum meeting daily Work on test case execution Log issues within ALMCo-workers are helpful and knowledgeable to the best of there abilitiesThe most enjoyable part of the job is working with the development teamIt's not a bad company, the issue with the company is its small, and people in positions of leadership do not dedicate enough effort to grow young employees.Clean, productive place to work, enjoyed my co-workers they were the most enjoyable part of the job. However advancement is hard and management is poorly trained.Excellent environment to workI did the PMP certification.The management is great. It was pleasure to work for these people.The co-workers were so knowledgeable, smart, and friendly.Promotes innovative ideas. Very Challenging work environment. The company also company offered ability to utilize my industry expertise and analytical skills.I learned about the single family and multifamily mortgage market and the financing of these different types of mortgages.  Management is very open to change, and co-workers are the brightest I have worked with.  Overall direction of the company is the biggest unknown, as the government is in charge.Good TeamExperienced Business analysts TeamWell formed SIT and UAT Team Best Work CultureFull versed infrastructureIts a very professional environment, and help is always there when needed.

My typical day consists of tracking and assigning work request  for maintenance that are documented on line. Dealing with internal customers to help with problem solving, or maintenance that may be required. Assist in documentation for projects that requires external contractors to be completed to help the facility run smoothly.Excellent company with excellent benefits.  Everyone was willing to solve any issues within a timely manner.  Upper management:  "" Kudos "".A good company and program to work for, overall good environment for warehouse and supply chain employees with great health insurance and company benefits.The environment is beautiful and people are amazing friendly. I would love to work in this place because there are endless opportunities to grow.The company took over the contract and immediately began removal of experience personnel - after flooding the environment with new people. Very inexperienced personnel.Getting to work on time, greeting my coworkers and preparing to do my job. Which is either starting a new task or finishing up one. I normally  help coworkers  when  need to the best of my ability, then continue my work. Take lunches  and come back to work to finish my 8 hr or more work day.My last 4-5 years I have  been traveling all over the US and over-seas .Pretty good company to work for.  HR, security, job relocation and placement is above average.  A tremendous benefit to CACI are the Program Managers -- the liaisons between corporate and the workforce.  If your PM is good, which mine was, the ability to focus on your job is easy.  If not...Good Education opportunities.Better compensation would be a good addition.Expatriation is a good addition to the contract.Greater opportunity to engage with management.Caci was my first company to work for.They were an excellent organization and they took care of their personnel as well, great company.Better than average management. Company stresses and upholds high standards for integrity and performing quality work. It is diversified and not prone to micromanaging.Training Soldiers on a continuous basis can be challenging but very rewarding. During the working cycle stateside traveling is a frequent event to and from different locations.Manager is incompetent and his business practices are unethical. You will have little to no job security working with this company. Lay-offs are common. The manager has made a bad name for himself here at Crane, IN in the 8 short years he's been around.Provides the environment to support and stretch ones abilities. Employee advancement rests in the individual.  Your high level of success at CACI is directly tied to your skills and dedication and the opportunities provided for career growth.I Typed documents such as correspondence, drafts, memos, and emails, and prepared 3 reports weekly for management. I Opened, sorted, and distributed incoming messages and correspondence. I Purchased and maintained office supply inventories, and being careful to adhere to budgeting practices. I Greeted visitors and determined to whom and when they could speak with specific individuals and I Recorded, transcribed and distributed minutes of meetingsCACI so far has been a stable employer.  It is a good place to start your career.  I do recommend this company.  You are not tied to your work 24/7.Full of blowhards and suck ups. Promotions are based on ability to suck maximum bottom since no real work is ever completed. If you are good at pretending to work and staring at a computer for hours this might be the job for you. Spending time interning for a panhandler would be a better use of time.The setting was relax and fun. You know what you job i and what your goals are everyday. Management sometime was up and down but was willing to working on fixing the problem to the ensure a better workplace.Working for the CACI I was very productive and learned a lot while working in the position.While working in my position I learned a lot on the jobI started with CACI not that long ago. I love the environment. It  feels like everyone is trying to help you.  Great benefits and good healthcare. Overall one the best places I ever worked for.GIS processing with plenty of opportunities for additional training.  Pleasant environment with lots of opportunity for advanced training at college on online.I liked working here for the most part - the people were great and had lots of institutional support and even the benefits were above average. There is much to do within the company for someone who wants to learn new things. It is a major governmental contractor with 14,000 employees or thereabouts. However due the vagaries of the government-contract world most of the office was laid off or furloughed without any notice. We had been expecting years' worth of work but it did not come come to fruition. I do not blame CACI for this necessarily - it could very well have been the fault of another contractor - but in my particular realm of CACI jobs can be on the insecure side.","10,000+",Washington,Arlington,VA,2016-07-15T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/b21cd8b6-c091-4396-83e2-d54f3e86c4ee?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

They care about their employees and try to help them further their careers. They have absolutely EXCELLENT benefits -- health, dental, 401K, and vision.  Their Paid Leave policies are beyond wonderful and are flexible.A bunch of guys that blew stuff up in the desert - Now they are trying to expand their business foot print and have the know how to get it done, but have trouble executing this.Worked with 12 personnel daily ensuring they got assistance from me in equipment checks & accountability, training, and deployment of personnel and equipment.  My co-workers were all active duty Air Force members that were subject to deploy to any location in the world with only short notice.  The hardest part of the job was making sure members were ready to meet military requirements to support our country.  The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing job satisfaction that they were ready and that I made that happen.Our work is mostly research oriented. We conduct experiments sing our equipments depending on the project we are handling and the runs usually go on for 7 hours. Most of our work involves research to find out how to get better results by going through a lot of papers and articles. We are guided by my adviser and Post-Doc who mention our goals and assist us in understanding our experiments better. The hardest part is getting the machine to work properly as it gives trouble from time to time while the fun part is the freedom we are offered. We can conduct experiments with our own ideas provided they are feasible. This has helped us gain a lot by means f trial and error.Outstanding to work for. Great support form all levels of management and branches of the company. As a contractor, I am at a remote site, and have never actually met my supervisors face-to-face, but have any support if needed. They leave you alone to perform your job, and the review/ratings for promotion/pay increase is very fair! As a recently seperated veteran, this company was an easy transition to make. But- with all DoD contracting firms, job security is only as good as the politicians and the needs of the military. No fault of the company- but I got my sequester notice. They are assisting us every step of the way to the last day- and helping to us to find other jobs. Typical day of work at ARA includes little to no communication with/through staff.  Great experiences and work with customers. Coworkers, with the exception of a few, have little to no communication and/or personal skills.  There is little to no appreciation for employees and even customers.  Nepotism and management ""favorites"" ruin the work environment.Great work environment.Learned excellent team collaboration techniques.Management genuinely concerned for the work force.Hardest part of the job was the commute.Most enjoyable part of the job was traveling.Working at ARA allows lots of people interaction with interesting projects being developed by Scientist, Engineers, and Software Developers. The culture is very strict, and based in military/government schools of thought.ARA is a Department of Defense contract firm so I had direct client interfacing while planning military exercises for United States Strategic Command. A typical day included collaboration with other working groups, developing training and exercise objectives and identifying requirements to meet those objectives.  Coordination with trusted agents and other planners to build story lines and integrate those vignettes with the master scenario.Co-workers were other DoD contractors, government civilians and military members with varying skill sets.The hardest part of the job was working with the exercise scripters to integrate smaller story lines.The most enjoyable part of the job was during exercise execution when we got to see the flow of the exercise and how the training audience reacted and worked together to develop solutions to the problem set created.All employees own stock in the company. They have a good benefits and retirement package and are flexible with work schedules.good benefits but an ""eat what you kill"" company;  hard to get good balance of work and outside life.  divisions have had lot of turnover of late with sequestration.  juggle many projects.ARA provides a good solid work environment that promotes learning and growth. All members of the staff that I interacted with were always friendly and professional.Diverse technology, has a strong team with excellent skills and technology for innovative products and projectsGreat environment and benefits. Typical 9-5 job. Pay is good. The managment is understanding of the balace of work and family life. Good stock options and retirement plans.  Interesting subject matter with the military.Testing new machines to upgrade security in the  fight against terrorism.9-5 job. Great work environment and great people to work with. wrong application of QA, hard employer for women in general, difficult to succeed as QA.Each day at Applied Research Associates was different. Being a consulting/contracting firm (dealing mostly with government and military) presented various challenges and projects. A typical day would usually consist of reviewing lab write ups/white papers, preforming a variety of tests, generating lab reports, and finally submitting lab reports.I learned a variety of tasks including (but not limited to) preforming various tests, generating test protocols, generating lab write ups, designing and manufacturing test jigs/fixtures.The management at Applied Research Associates was relatively strict, but still very knowledgeable. They were very strict on meeting deadlines and being under budget, which is completely understandable when dealing with contracts. But it can however make for a very stressful work environment.My co-workers were very knowledgeable and came from a variety of backgrounds and schools/degrees. It was not unheard of for an engineer to work with a physics major. It made for very interesting group dynamics, but also made it easier to generating new concepts by having people from different backgrounds.The hardest part of the job was generating the white papers and lab reports while still meeting the, usually, tight deadlines.The most enjoyable part of the job was the challenge. Every day you worked on something different, it was great for keeping you stimulated and interested in the work you were doing. Each day was a great learning opportunity.","1,001 to 5,000",Washington,Reston,VA,2016-12-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/ca70eab7-8a03-4539-a55c-913c5a74b0cd?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=22,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

120,3173.0,Data Scientist,"SOS International, Ltd.",3.7,58.0,"Flexible hours, good time management. Helpful peers; new and senior employees can always find assistance in work environment whatever the time might be, even after midnight.SOSI takes care of their people very well. Honored to have had the opportunity to work for them!  Detailed in program management operations, transportation, training and human resource management.The poor rating in this review is specifically tied to a project I was a part of overseas, not SOSI corporate or SOSI in CONUS locations.  Without going into details, there was not much management support to the few contractors deployed forward, and the job itselt had no upward mobility or stablity.  Compensation was great but tied to danger pay due to location, rather than job performance or duties.The only bad thing about this job was the contract basis, but other than that it was a fast pace and there was something different everyday.Avoid if you can continue to interview while your there. attrition is constant and never ending. No process or guidelines that resemble a professional company or effective process. Most new folks are still interviewing once they start.I can not recommend this company.  While there are some wonderfully talented individuals who have worked at this company the senior leadership chruns through managers in every department and the turnover is very high with each manager lasting an average of 1 year.  This is due to the ineffective top leadership.  There is no trust established among the senior and departmental leadership and at the time of my employment the company had failed to establish an effective ethics program or transparency in their financials which is key to doing work in the government contracting space.As a former manager in this company, reviews were conducted for every overhead employee but no direct individuals.  Once rated and reviewed the reviews went before a board of top management where the CEO often directed changes in the ratings (lowering them) for individuals under my supervision whom he had no day to day contact with.  Both merit increases and promotions were predicated on these reviews and I found the process discriminating and ineffective as it became an evaluation of how well the senior management team (specifically the CEO) liked the individual or not and not a fair assessment of performance.  I feel like this is the number one reason employees can not advance in this company or receive proper mentorship and development. Before considering a position with this company it is advisable to talk to past as well as present employees before accepting a position and research their reputation in the industry by talking to teaming partners, former customers, etc. before making your decision.I have been working for SOS International LLC for years and the company has provided me with an incredible amount of opportunity to work in a client driven environment focused on developing its staff to be the best they possibly can. Commitment to the mission and dedication to the work is the expectation from employees. An ideal place to develop your skills.Mid-size company with ambitious and lofty goals - but the culture and feel of a smaller company.  Its an exciting, fun place to work.I would go back there today if there were still around.  You have to be selected and qualify to do the job.My immediate supervisor were very nice and very understanding, you can make up your own hours according to the working hours.family oriented, professional, opportunity for growth, great benifits.A typical day at work consists of performing daily tasks in a timely, accurate, & quality manner. I have learned to maintain attention to detail in this job at all times in which case an error is not an option. My co-workers have great personalities, are friendly, and are a great people to work alongside. However, there were several that lacked integrity, and some of us found ourselves picking up extra workload of others.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with its instability, and not being able to grow or promote. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of knowing that I am performing my best for a greater cause.Everything they do for proposals is done very patchwork and contract recruiters are used and then dumped. Vulgar language is prevalent throughout, and employees are mistreated and verbally undressed by supervisors in the open. I saw a middle-aged woman yelled at to tears on several occasions.My coworkers were great to work with, however management was so horrid it was near impossible to accomplish anything.Finally, they use no discretion on tasks which require a security clearance. Contracted employees without clearances are read into areas of contracts that they should not be. Great place good benefits... calm corporate culture.A little greedy when it came to pay cuts.. worst compensation but kept benefits at a good compensation. Overall best experience!Work was mostly in combat hospitals in Iraq.I learnd to be more carefull and vigilant .We had a reasonable management support.Worked in harmony and high cooperation with my co-workers.Hardest part was to be away from family.I enjoyed helping paients and their families during cnflicts.All other reviews are clearly written by disgruntled employees who can't even spell right. I've had a great experience with this company, they reimbursed a lot of my training, I got a lot on the job training and got a career advancement that I didn't even expect to get in just a few years. I've moved through several different roles and if you are proactive you can do that in SOSi. The company has great benefits, immediate 401K 100% vesting schedule, great health/dental, great number of days off/PTO but lacks remote work arrangement or relaxed casual Fridays just because of the owner's perceptions. Most of the staff is really nice, very personable and easy to deal with. The professional quality of people differs - there are some gems but there are some random people too, unfortunately, sometimes the management just hangs on to those random people just for the sake of emotional attachment and continuity though they really suck at what they do and are not employable anywhere else. Because of this situation and the uneven quality of management across the company departments gems often leave so the turnover is pretty high. The company is NOT run by a foreign family. Everyone is American and has clearances, the main owner was born outside of the US, that's about it. Every department is as great as its leader, the COO is a bit intense and not often easy to work with, so some execs are able to stay and work with him, others don't. The family likes to have the headquarters in NY, however, they don't really have a business there as it is a government contractor. NY office is a huge financial  more... and operational burden because the payroll and finance is run out of NY while the rest of other corporate departments including PMOs and billing are in VA. There is often a disconnect when people work in the next cubicle, imagine the situation with the different states. Some execs are really old and complacent, others are lazy being hired for big name companies they used to work for. Unfortunately, often there is no punishment for a bad performance, people aren't held accountable for very big mistakes or procrastination and it's a real morale issue for lower level employees. The company has a lot of entry level low paid employees and senior high paid questionable quality execs, the lack of the 'middle class' costs the company money but somehow they don't see it. Overall, I loved my time with the company and my advice is to accept the job depending on your specific offer/department circumstances.  lessIf I could do it again, I would have never worked here. The company is run by a foreign family with dubious international ties, yet they do classified work for the Government. They are loose-lipped about classified information and are overall documented unethical. They are notorious about not paying you so if you're out in Iraq or somewhere and relying on your salary, just don't work here.Great work environment.  Very individualized (contract).  Great mid-level management.  Unfortunately I just do contract work.  Would work full time if the opportunity presented.•	Performed general administrative support•	Was present during interviews and served as a translator•	Translated both written and spoken word•	Interviewed and screened potential applicants and visitors•	Moved to and from various bases throughout Afghanistanno room for advancement, liked my co-workers a lot, not treated with respect at all, I learned a lot about sterile processing from this company.I enjoyed the employment, pay and benefits.

I hardest part was leavingDespite being away from home for months at a time, and waking up rolling into the office at 6am on Monday in North Phoenix not knowing where in God's hot South Western Mojave dessert my crew and I will be working that week, The comroderie and overall respect that was nutured in that envronment was amazing, We were all a team, and it was felt as soon as you steped in the door. I would still be climbing for Bechel if thay were in Grand Junction and were going to stay in Western Colorado.Projects in Bechtel pose a great opportunity to develop technical skills within a team environment. Types of project vary depending on the business unit of your employment.Working for Bechtel was a great experience. I learnt more things over there and it was my pleasure working for them. I do recommend that company and would to have chance to work for them again.A great place to work and learn. I was able to learn a lot of new skills while employed with this company as well as hone the skills I already had. Besides learning I enjoyed working with my co-workers where I gained more knowledge. This company believe in training and offered training in various aspect of your job.Great overall company, family oriented, good amount of PTO and family/work life balance.  Hardest part of the job is that everything is project based.  Bechtel tries very hard to keep employees, but sometimes relocation is the only way to stay on board.Great work place, the foremans they hire need more experience. I learned a lot more about my craft. They promised lay off  compensation but they did not come through.Lots of favortism going on at this site. Poor site supervisor that was rarely onsite. Work was very difficult and we were working nights with limited lighting which is dangerous when your going up and down scaffolds all night with heavy equipment. Very poor coordination for the nightly workloadI love working for Bechtel , lots of challenges but rewarding . I am waiting for a position now from them . I love their insurance and their benefitsThe people at this company are great. Peers are always willing to help out. I have learned a lot about engineering since college working here. The most enjoyable part of this job is the opportunity to move around and work on many different projects.people are great to work with. The only problem they have is upper management. they need to learn that the working man is what makes him what he is. They seem to think that if your not a supervisor out there then your nothing to them.A typical day at work would be completing daily task from creating and finishing up calculations packages, spot checking, reviewing vendor drawings, back checking isometric drawings, turing in calculations packages to document control after checking thoroughly, and other tasks that arises daily.On a typical day my crew and I will work as a team to make sure our day duties are done on time. I as a journey man made sure my duties where done on time as well as my co- workers. I will do it all over again in a heart beat.Good days working on 48""pipe.Most days look busy sweeping .good employees to work with .jobs not being done because of managementGreat company to work for! I really like it there. I would recommend that anyone work here. There are a lot of great benefits at Bechtel.enjoyable environment and would like to work with this company again. we were always busy which helped the day go by and we all enjoyed pay dayExcellent company except for small time politics will work for this company again I learned a lot.I can only say good things about BECHTEL you took my career to levels I never believed possible for that I say THANK YOU.Management was ok except for the politics.Co-workers were ok very good team spirit in all departments.Trying to keep the project schedule.At the end of the day accomplishing what I set out to do on that day or what my assignment called for on that day. Satisfying the requirements of the sub and seeing the project progress from stage to stage.A typical day at work every day was different and never a dull moment. I accomplished most times what was assigned. If the opportunity be given I will be happy to work for BECHTEL again. I will also be willing to relocate.My experienced at Bechtel was surreal in the sense that I could not believe the level of negativity towards hispanics and color individuals. 1. I was treated very unfair for been a latino as well as my Mexican co-workers. 2. I felt opressed and misguided from the very first day by management.  3. Our employee reviews were vague and meaningless. 4. Management did not take the time to get to know they're employees and the qualities they posses that could help the company be a better working environment.Worked here for 5 yrs plenty of work Alot at home time if and when you need they are very flexible. They have classes to futher your career. Enjoyed working with with companyAs a seasoned contract engineer, Bechtel, in particular the team at Bluegrass Chemical Agent Destruction Pilot Project, are some of best I have ever worked with.this company is run by spreadsheets. get laid off one month and hired back the next. you are treated like a number in all things. the management is unorganized and either doesn't know or lies. a lot of the people you work with are very knowledgeable and nice but stifled by poor corporate organization. the pay is well above average and the benefits are nice.","10,000+",Washington,Reston,VA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/2e108714-d49a-438c-ad18-7dc53b1b7482?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=26,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

126,3179.0,Statistician/Data Scientist,CACI International Inc,3.9,826.0,"I enjoy working in this position, . Working in the Facility Management office new challenges are always turning up.  My typical day consists of tracking and assigning work request  for maintenance that are documented on line. Dealing with internal customers to help with problem solving, or maintenance that may be required. Assist in documentation for projects that requires external contractors to be completed to help the facility run smoothly.I liked working here for the most part - the people were great and had lots of institutional support and even the benefits were above average. There is much to do within the company for someone who wants to learn new things. It is a major governmental contractor with 14,000 employees or thereabouts. However due the vagaries of the government-contract world most of the office was laid off or furloughed without any notice. We had been expecting years' worth of work but it did not come come to fruition. I do not blame CACI for this necessarily - it could very well have been the fault of another contractor - but in my particular realm of CACI jobs can be on the insecure side.I Typed documents such as correspondence, drafts, memos, and emails, and prepared 3 reports weekly for management. I Opened, sorted, and distributed incoming messages and correspondence. I Purchased and maintained office supply inventories, and being careful to adhere to budgeting practices. I Greeted visitors and determined to whom and when they could speak with specific individuals and I Recorded, transcribed and distributed minutes of meetingsManagement was good, no issues with benefits or the working conditions as a whole. Biggest issue is complacency among veteran employees. Enjoyed working there and saw opportunity for advancement when I went looking for it. Opportunity for overtime and to set yourself apart from others was pretty prominent while I was there although it comes in waves.Team members in my current project is great.They help to understand the complexity of the client systems.Management only provide need to know information.Hardest part is the uncertainty at the end of fiscal year, don't know if the contract is funded.  Raise of last 2 years is around 1% or 1.5%.Most enjoyable part of this project is the flexibility to work from home sometimes.You will find an extremely professional work environment with friendly people. They offer great benefits, and you can also have a life outside of work. The only negative thing is the lack of job security since most of the jobs or positions are based on contracts that can end at any moment.Working with CACI was a pleasure. Working there I learned how to properly input data information, how to check others work, and how to scan information into the system. After working there for 2yrs the hardest part was being under a new manager and instead of being praised/awarded for all the hard work you put in your fired instead. (however i doubt that manager is still there).The company took over the contract and immediately began removal of experience personnel - after flooding the environment with new people. Very inexperienced personnel.Good Education opportunities.Better compensation would be a good addition.Expatriation is a good addition to the contract.Greater opportunity to engage with management.CACI takes care of their employees.  Even as a contractor, they attempt to do all they can to retain good employees.  Work is always busy.  There is more than enough to go around working as a government contractor.  My management is excellent! Easy to work with, and expects you to take lead when necessary.Their benefits are goodGreat company to work for the only problem was that pay is low. But the benefits are good and the management was good. I would work for them again. Really enjoyed the balance of work and family there.First time working as a contractor after 30 years of military service.  Great experience.  Working alongside other employees who work for different contacting companies, it is clear that CACI is among the best.I started with CACI not that long ago. I love the environment. It  feels like everyone is trying to help you.  Great benefits and good healthcare. Overall one the best places I ever worked for.Excellent company with excellent benefits.  Everyone was willing to solve any issues within a timely manner.  Upper management:  "" Kudos "".CACI employs some great people, but the management at the corporate and business unit level is lacking. The performance-based raise system is an absolute joke.Caci was my first company to work for.They were an excellent organization and they took care of their personnel as well, great company.A good company and program to work for, overall good environment for warehouse and supply chain employees with great health insurance and company benefits.I had the great pleasure to work for this great company for 2 years. Excellent project managers, excellent HR, excellent directors, good play, good benefits.CACI is a great company, I actually love working here, the environment is peaceful and the people are really nice. They truly care about you having a life outside of work, They will work with you to take care of your family and personal needs.CACI is a big defense contractor in Virginia. They possess many contracts for the Navy. However, as a contractor, they tend not to do much new development work, at least at the location I am at. Most of my work has either been maintenance, making small changes to the system, or IA security. The only time I actually felt like I learned anything valuable was when I was loaned out to the Database team. In that situation I picked up on some PL-SQL. The management has very poor planning abilities and does not assign appropriate timeframes to complete assignments, usually overallocating very simple tasks, and assigning few hours for important ones, while pressing hard to follow the schedule for the sake of Earned Value.The workforce is a mix of retired military and civilian; so interaction and social environment is very favorable.  At the co-worker level you are practically family, which makes the work and life manageable.However, the company is growing at the time I'm writing this and is changing direction.The new mood of management is to promote young and headstrong types.  Those that are content with being on the low end are being weeded out slowly.Another note: Since this is a contract company, job security is not guaranteed unless you are lucky enough to still be around after the first 3-5 years.  It's not the company's fault, its just the budgets of the contracts.","10,000+",Washington,Springfield,VA,2016-10-31T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/d043dbe6-ba04-4065-8ac8-7d7833112462?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=31,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

129,3182.0,Data Scientist Principal Job,SAIC,4.1,1300.0,"Work for them for over 6 years, great company! Worked on a variety of Coast Guard support contracts. They care about their staff.It was my favourite place. The people, the contracts, the systems we worked on. Fascinating. But these are government contracts and those come with rules and the contracts are sometimes awarded as 1 year with 3 extra years optioned. So carefully charging correctly and staying in POP dates and not charging incorrectly is a big deal. Option years suck because that means your only guaranteed 1 year. They could go somewhere else for the next 3. Every year, your worried about the next option year being approved. It's like working on one year contracts and stressing every year that you might be laid off.Large Company tough to fit into management perspective, not a great situation when it comes to re-deployment, pretty much on your own to find new job.A place to help young people grow. Once you go through schooling and have degree, it's hard to advance. Then you have to look for work elsewhere.My fellow associates were all very responsible and professional enough to make sure we accomplished all of our testing requirements. Everybody pitched in to assist wherever help was needed.SAIC is prime on several contracts so it is easy to go to a different project if you wish, but for a company whose only product is it's people it really does not invest in its product. They cut benefits and then the following year sent out flyer bragging about record profits. That just has not sat well with many employees.nothing out of the ordinary, good work environment, fellow employees were friendly, helpful and professional, work location was close to the house and flexible.Great benefits and wonderful leadership. Enjoyed visits from managers taking us to lunch and spending the time to get to know us. Very forward looking company. Hands off management style.Destroyed chemical weapons while employed. Was a shift supervisor and the job was rewarding. Primarily I made sure that operators were safe while destroying the chemical weapons.boeing is fun you just work a ton of hours if your a contractorthey say that there is no prejudice towards contractors or Direct hires but that is false....they will treat you like dirtGood company to work for.  Managers take care of their people.  Great opportunities for networking within and outside of the company.  Lots of opportunities to change work locations to move around.I was lucky enough to  work for SAIC on the same contract for 5+ years.  The pay was excellent and the travel was exhaustive at times, but rewarding.  If I could, I would stay with SAIC but our contract was not renewed and the Company does not have any positions open for my skill set.SAIC is, in my opinion, primarily focused on getting the job done and protecting their resources - the people that work for them. Typically at work, people work with one another on complex problems and the atmosphere seems open to others asking questions.Really the only down side of the management is that they're intent on starting new initiatives to benefit employees, but there is often little follow through.The most enjoyable part of the job is when the customer expresses their gratitude and delight at the job we've done.Contact management mentality with personnel assigned and managed by assigned organization, in this case U.S. Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC).I was employed by SAIC but was contracted out for eleven years to SIMS and JRDC contract did not have much to do with SAIC except for one or two times a year. It was an ok place to work the benefits could be better.The SAIC team that I worked with in Charleston, SC took on projects in a team orientated manner.  Most work performed had input from other team members and project managers. This helped in preventing errors in projects and put more confidence behind the product. Also, management was good about being flexible when it came to needing time off for family, etc.. Overall my time at SAIC was a pleasant experience and I was able to learn, take on new tasks, and grow within the company.work Monday threw Friday 8 hours days start early A.M. when I'm home I typically test equipment an build the system up before we send them out on road before we install them into vehicle's. I travel all over united states to different military bases. Typically about five to seven guys who go on the road.  we  make sure after we install the system into vehicles we make sure it is operational then we train an teach military guys that the system is up an running an answer any question that they have.Working in a small dynamic engineering team, we have set product goals to meet quarterly. I work closely with a group of engineers that are motivated and innovative, like me. The culture of the company is very cohesive. I have enjoyed working here with much gratitude, and I hope to accrue the same with a new company in the mid-west where my parents reside.I was able to walk into a great paying job doing the same GIS tasks and further my professional career. I will never regret my decision to join SAIC.At SAIC I have learned a lot about working with customers and working as a team. There are many high quality people with a lot of skills which I work with.The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to work with a group of professional people and knowing I am performing work for the military.SAIC is a relatively large company in my program office.  The only gripe that I would state is that the HR is not extremely helpful when dealing with their employees.  Instead of typed emails they're much more likely to send a PDF which does not always assist.","10,000+",Washington,Reston,VA,2016-10-24T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/a5471939-1b84-4886-bc6a-27420d454122?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Outstanding HR and IT support with excellent managerial oversight that creates a productive and enjoyable environment for its employees.I have had no serious issues with the LMI management but there are small quirks to the company that can make some days frustrating.  I would definitely recommend to anybody that the could find a place here.Great company to work for. Job advancement is not as fast but in my eyes it is fair. Fairly new. CEO is very pleasant. I have nothing bad to say about the company. Nice people. Many have been here for a lifetime.Great company to work for with very good benefits. The best benefit is the ability to take part in a number of learning opportunities to develop professionally. The company also has a great new headquarters, however if you are not part of the few administrative staff or management you will probably have to work in a below satisfactory client facility.Productive workplace.Co-workers are great. Working conditions vary from department to department.From start of the day to the end I stay busy with data entering, invoice reconciliation, verification of client/vendor information.  My supervisors are great and I hate to leave but the company is going through a major change and I do not believe that there is a place for me anymore.  My co-workers are supportive and we like to get together once in a while outside of work.  The hardest part of my job is being able to get the PM's and PD""s to verify the work done and sign off in a timely manner for payment.You are constantly get harassed by your manager and they will harass the client as well-A lot of micromanagement-They don't let you advance in your career and their HR is a joke. Majority of the manager have been here for a long time and same as the HR and they back each others up. If you complaint, they will make sure that you are out the door fast.  The manager don't know how to manage people and they have been here for 20 years or 30 years. They also think that they own the company. If you are looking to retire here, come and join the group and their insanity. Also, there is favoritism. If the manager likes you, regardless of your education or your work experience, then you will become a superhero.LMI is a great company. The leadership from my program director is top notch.Great company, people, and projects. Government is main client. revent funding impcted by sequestration issues.I worked for LMI for nine years, and there are none better!  It has been consistently rated as one of the best companies in the DC area, and they deserve this recognition.  They have Great People - Great Professional Opportunities - Great Culture- Competitive Salaries.  None better!  I was verbally harassed numerous times and when I had gone to the Director, 2 days later was dishcarged.Good place to work. Associates care about their clients and thier misisons.Very challenging and interesting work. LMI is an excellent organization to work for, however, stressful when you are required to deploy to fight terrorism.Incredibly strong comapany with an excellent reputation among the Defense Community.","501 to 1,000",Washington,McLean,VA,2016-10-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/6fefa92f-2ac1-4159-8622-43b5d03fc232?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I enjoy working with different people daily ranging from young to old, disabled, etc. I just love the fact I can help at least one person everyday at work; even if that means being the bearer of bad news. I liked the challenges the work brought. I'm up for changes as long as it is delivered in a manner that doesn't cause chaos in the workplace and it seemed like GDIT did a terrible job of presenting changes...very unorganized. The good employees are overshadowed by the bad ones.I enjoyed having my breaks there. very relaxingnice environment to work at as well. everyone is very friendly especially my supervisor sheila.. very professional as wellFun, positive environment, Always ways to learn new things. The company always provide coaching to help employees improve and that's what I loved about being a customer service representative at general dynamicsGreat work place to work, great pay, warm environment, very easy to get the work, wonderful hours, I love helping customers, to know I'm doing something great for the communityAdvancement with GD is difficult in the contracting arena because you are billable to the customer the company often doesn't want you to change positions.I loved the job and pay. And it has a set work schedule. Offers loads of overtime. If you choose to work here you can pick part time or full time and you will get exactly those hours. Training was very easy as well.The lack of professionalism throughout this particular site can be witnessed on a daily basis. There are limitations to the amount help agents can offer the callers. The company promoted from within, witch is a good policy.I loved being able to make a difference in a person day, especially the elderly and children who really depended on me!! i learned a great deal about patience with this employer!!Laid back usually.I learned a lot from older workers. Management was good. The hardest part was waiting for all safety to be checked to start work. The most enjoyable part was getting off work.A great place to grow and expand your knowledge. You can go far in the company and you're always learning new skills. They care about their employees and are very professional. Extremely kind managers that are willing to help.i recieved phone calls with angry and happy consumers i also leared learned how to use diffrent programs and be patient with calls i recieved despite the attitudes given.I stayed stressed out the whole time I was employed with the company most people there was friendly its just you had to deal with a lot of stressful things with the consumersjob started out with a two week training course which went way too fast but ended up being ok. the real stress started when i was thrown on the phones without any real training of a very confusing software database for healthcare consumers.Hi stress and confusing scripts, poorly designed software and hard to navigate. if you like to work in a challenging environment, where all my supervisor was concerned about was her numbers and ranking for her team. you stay on a call too long, its counted against you, clock out late, counted against you, only 2 short breaks and a 30 minute lunch. i felt too confined to my desk, felt bad for going to bathroom because it would be counted against adherence. the benefits are good although i never got a chance to use them. i got sick and missed three days and went over my allowed days. i would still be there had i not got ill. i miss the money but not the job.i enjoyed this helping people with their healthcare needs but also had many calls from frustrated consumers who were unhappy with there health insuranceAll we did in this job was answer calls of costumers asking us for more information about helots insurance we help them apply for insurances and fin the one that next fits their income I really liked how we had to socialize with people I live helping people so I think that's why I liked my jobGreat people and nice policies. I had very good experiences at GD. The military people are great to work with and appreciate things you do! Very good place to work!Positive environment, learning place, and wonderful co-workers.

It is a great place to work for the time being.During my time at GT i was exposed to both public and private company financial statement audits. I was exposed to many different areas of the financial statement auditing process. This is a good place to start a career if you work under the right people.Many years since I left, so don't know what it is like now. At the time it was undergoing significant change and was searching for its identity. My colleagues were generally a smart and dedicated group.Too much travel for me and poor recognition for the non- client facing staff.The management was supportive but in many cases was pushed against the budget which limited learning opportunities. Overall, it is a great place to start your career and gain work experience.The people are great, and GT definitely relies pretty heavily upon your commitment to your coworker.  It's public accounting; you work crazy hours with a solid annual compensation....just never calculate your per hour rate.Grant Thornton is a great place for young professionals to gain experience in a variety of industries.  There is the long hours and heavily workload you would expect from public accounting, but overall a good place.Worked in the Property Tax Department. Helped prepare property tax returns for various states and depreciation calculations. Also helped prepare federal forms 1040 (Individual) and 1041 (Trusts) as well.I will forever be grateful for the opportunities and experiences I gained while working at GT. Working with clients from different industries doing a myriad of work was extremely valuable.Grant Thornton, Cleveland was a great place to work.  Unfortunately, there were changes within the IT department that has resulted in me having leave a great organization and group of people.Management is trying hard to make it a fun place to work. Perhaps they're are trying too hard, as it becomes a distraction with multiple ""feel good"" e-mails.This company works it's employees hard as is typical of public accounting firms (50-60 hours a week).  This company is a larger firm, so employees will be specialized into service areas (Audit, Tax, Services).  Audit will involve regional travel.In general there is high turnover due to the hours and travel.  This provides opportunities to move up in the company.Grant Thornton has been on a journey that focuses on its culture and people over the past fiscal year and it is making a positive difference to the firm overall. If they continue to make strides with this initiative and keep people engaged, GT will be phenomenally successful.Excellent experience,  This was a great experience.  I worked as a federal consultant.  I really enjoyed it.  My clients were highly satisfied with my work.Great place to work.  Employees are like family.  Great work life balance.  Great IT department.  I would highly recommend.I really enjoyed the time working for Grant Thornton. Thanks to Grant Thornton opportunity I have experience and a good knowledge in the cycle of business personal property tax, and business real property.Work/life balance is extremely important to Grant Thornton and they are very flexible with schedules.The company is going through many organizational changes so what is coming remains to be seen.I supported the CIO and his Executive Leaders. I worked side-by-side with his full leadership team. They drove a wonderful culture of collaboration, professionalism and understood well what work/life balance was all about. The atmosphere in the department was positive and I believe that was a huge contributor to their success. Good leadership is key to success.The company was built by a very hard working woman who values her staff and treats them as family.  As in most jobs that I have been given the opportunity to place my foot in the door, the sky was the limit with this company.  They valued my opinion and gave me free reign to submit my ideas for the betterment of the company.Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop.Resolving administrative issues by coordinating, preparation of reports, analyzing data, and identifying solutions.Pros: Lots of exposure to different types of clients, industries and accounting policies; typical to move from client to client every 2-5 weeks in the first year; friendly co-workers; lots of upper management change and company leadership people and culture changeCons: long hours, tedious/monotonous work, if you don't like accounting, it is a struggle; as an auditor, clients don't welcome your presence; high turnover and not enough training or supportOverall, GT was a good company to work for and is where I gained the most valuable experience in my field.

The test is only given a few times per year.Go thru emails every morning, check on job orders placed previously, handled members phone calls, assisted co-workers with conference/meeting preparation. Company provided classes on microsoft, etc.. (professional development). Conferences were fun, especially in another city, but hard if a speaker was late/no-show, sometimes a session had to be cancelled at the last minute.I loved the company. Management was great. The people in the department that I worked with were great. Typical day for me would be logging into my computer and reviewing our SS. This would set a focus for the day. Next I would review emails and voicemails left by customers. I would then prioritize callbacks and the urgent cases from the SS.I've learned to face my fears and not to allow fear get in the way of success.This is a nice stable environment if you are at the point of your career where you want to take it easy and predictable. If you are young and hungry and trying to get ahead and get significant experience this is not the place for you. I would avoid non profits until I am further ahead in my career.grey cubicle kind of officegreat initiatives, slow movingI worked directly with my director in department. I worked with students who had disabilities who were seeking accommodation on college entrance exams and work with their school counselor or special education department or parents in this process as every case was different. My manager traveled a lot so he kept me in charge and I was responsible for our two vendors, ETS and Xerox, and traveled at times to train them on our systems and go over new policies and procedures and making sure they were up to bare and answer any inquires they may have. If I didn't travel, then I would train via WebEx and prepare training manuals and every two weeks or so, my manager and I work hold a conference call to keep an update on their department. After 2.5 years, my contact expired and unfortunately, I lost my job and have been unemployed since then with the exception of administrative assistant and receptionist work through various temp agency as well an Nanning for several years as I love kids, education and working in customer service as I am a people person, but with a shy personality.The College Board is an organization that cares deeply about the educational experience of students. This organization is concerned with improving academic rigor around the country and tries to be innovative in its approach to developing educational tools. A typical day consists of multiple meetings with executive level colleagues; we engage in planning different stages of a new program or product. I've learned a lot about the importance of communication and planning, structuring processes so that others can follow work plans effectively, and the importance and power of being proactive and taking initiatives.  I've enjoyed meeting academics from different disciplines and working closely with them to develop academic tools and programs.  I've also enjoyed meeting heads of educational organizations with whom we work collaboratively on developing various educational services. I'm proud of having put together a team of very talented and creative colleagues and working alongside them to develop new programs in the arts and in the global learning fields.The hardest part of the job is to develop new programs quickly and effectively, especially new programs have multiple internal and external dependencies. The most enjoyable part of the job is to work with talented and creative colleagues who care about the students and the teachers we serve. I also enjoy being innovative in my work and constantly learning new information and new skills.Since starting at the College Board I have noticed that happiness is based on your manager. Some managers are very flexible, ""family friendly"" and open minded while others are very by-the-book and firm. These inconsistencies make some departments favored by employees and set a negative tone in others.Limited development due to functional siloes in HR departmentIt was a short and great experience. I graduated in May and found this job in August. As College Board had  lag in Account receivable department. I was part of collection team and helped them in reducing Account Receivable (A/R).A great place to work.  Driven to the mission of equity and access.Great compensation and benefits with even a perk of payment for your kid's college.  Professional and dedicated to their people.I really enjoyed the people I worked with and they were very fair with me.CB is a great place to gain work experience. While although a non-profit, they pay well and offer excellent professional development opportunities.The best part of the job were the occasional perks and my co-workers.Manged team responsible for processing transactions for College Board products and services as well as registrations for professional development workshops. Learned how to navigate fine line between organization as a non-profit mission-driven institution and as a business. Management was professional, receptive to employee ideas and accommodating to reasonable employee needs and requests. Co-workers were very committed to organizations goal to connect students to college success. Hardest part of job: Aligning program policies with operational efficiencies. Most enjoyable part of job: Collaborating with co-workers/colleagues. Passionate intelligent people are abundant within the walls of the College Board.Learned an enormous amount of information regarding educational systems outside the US.  The work of the College Board expands to students who live outside the US but dream of studying at a US institution.  The College Board does thankless work to make that happen.  Good benefits and good people but the adaption of the 'Common Core' will deteriorate the future value of the companyCollege Board is a wonderful company with a great mission.The new leadership team is great. I expect a lot of good things to happen at The College Board in the next few years.As long as you do your job well it is a great place to work.

I enjoy working for Berico, and I know it will continue to do well.Company was fast-growing and innovative to provide solutions to the warfighter.",,Washington,Gaithersburg,MD,2016-08-16T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/9b4d9cc6-abc7-4f11-b8b5-67f353de85f3?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=15,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

150,3203.0,Data Scientist - Mid,Praxis Engineering,4.8,9.0,"Company with integrity, respect for their people, and as they continue to grow, they try to maintain a small company attitude and keep their employees feeling like 'they' are the company!Praxis Engineering is a collection of talented minds that like to have fun. Very collaborative and productive culture. Management is available and approachable. Corporate goals are clearly defined and the vision is engrained into the daily routine. Solutions driven (not just butts in seats).My time with Praxis has been truly enjoyable. Company is built upon and driven by its core values, which translates into a balance between productivity and fun. Full of great people that are customer driven.I would still be there if government funding had not run out on funding.A small company with wonderful benefits.  Very hard work, but refreshing to be heard by management.I had a great experience working with Praxis. Relaxing and kind environment to work within.I've only been with Praxis for about 6 months but I love the group here. It's hard to find a company that genuinely encourages a good work/life balance; most companies say they do but rarely follow through. Just about everyone I know here is involved in something outside of work: charities, running clubs, theater, etc..., and whatever you want to participate in, the company will almost always provide some kind of support.As for the work environment, it's the little things that I've been impressed with here. In this industry it's often the case that the contracts you work on don't vary all that much regardless of who you're working for, but how the company supports you on those contracts does. My initial set up here was quick and seamless, from HR and the whole hiring practice to IT and getting my workstations running. I've seen enough incompetence in those areas in other companies that I notice when it's done well.Bottom line: In my career I've worked for very large defense companies, an extremely small one, and even a gaming studio, and I can say without reservation that Praxis has the best mix of interesting work, well-rounded employees, and great ownership.Praxis has more legit work than I am used to. Previous employers had never given me an opportunity to pick the type of work I wanted to do. I don't feel that the good work is a mystery here, it's shared with everyone and I can be in charge of pursuing my own interests and have the support of my management, seemingly profit coming 2nd. I've been encouraged to pursue training in areas of emerging technology, and cost hasn't been a concern. When I had a surgery, my family received a very thoughtful care package, and I have noticed an overall commitment to employees being a priority. It's the first place I've worked where I've felt the company has a heart. The other engineers I work with are very good, consistently. I've not met one that made me wonder how they got hired and I've learned that I am given the benefit of the doubt by customers because I work at Praxis. Because this is confidential and I won't have to admit it publicly, I admit that I have grown professionally here in large part due to the people from Praxis I work/interact with. I've also started brewing at home thanks to a special interest group I am a part of at the office. Excited for my first creation. As long as my profit sharing, bonus, projects, and annual increases aren't cut, I can't currently see any reason to want to move on.The Praxis Management team is an outstanding group of knowledgeable technical and business professionals. They guide the company and the policies. They ensure that the employees and staff are provided the best training and opportunities. We, as employees, are encouraged to pursue training, certifications and additional degree programs that both interest us and benefit the company. What makes us better makes the company stronger. The dedication of management and employees to customer success drives all of us to do our best. When we exceed customer expectations and requirements we increase the opportunities for the company and employees to expand our base of satisfied customers. The hardest part is choosing what to study next. In a way the training opportunities are like being in a candy store and having to choose one treat at a time. Truly, the only limitation is how much you restrict yourself as an employee. The opportunity is there. My co-workers are great and it's always a relaxed learning environment. The most enjoyable part is the balanced approach. We work hard and the management recognizes that and holds activities to show appreciation for our efforts. What I've learned is that it is okay to speak up and share ideas. On any given day any one of us may come up with an idea that makes a difference to one or more customers. The job is always interesting, challenging and rewarding all at the same time.",201 to 500,Washington,Reston,VA,2016-02-22T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/31cb38c0-79de-4e8e-b79c-dcc18cabe162?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=20,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

Get a long and work well with my co-workers.Greet Customers I enjoyed working around military etcGood managementPersonally I worked at NSA for 2 years and it is not a recommended place of work by myself, due to the very short breaks, un-appreciation and lack of a health safe environment, if you do end up working here, ask for a RESPIRATOR! preserve your health.A very friendly atmosphere where I was able to perform at a high level due to the excellent training I received early on.Fast pace environment, Learned all mode of transportationLegally informed DOT rules and regsI  loved working at NSA, of course there were long days but it was fun and we were busy so that made the day go by fast. A typical work day i would go in pick up my order list and go to my desk separate them and pick the product from the floor then pack and ship the product. Everyday was usually a busy day. Because my father was part owner of the company the manager didn't really like me but i didn't let keep me from doing my job. I got along with most of my coworkers of course you know in every company theres always a trouble maker or someone who don't like you but other then that i got along with everybody. The hardest part of the job i would say some of my coworkers were very lazy and didn't do there job which made it hard for me to do mine. I loved going in everyday Because it was fun and i liked what i did. I i liked the security of the job and knowing that i would always have a job and benefits.I have played softball since I was a little girl so still staying connected with the sport is a dream!  Its only during the summer and only on weekend.  I try my best to umpire all that I can because i love being outside and working with these young ladies!Supervisor's unbearable- Verbally abusive and unprofessional.  A typical day was a major marathon.  Had to literally run to each work station all day and provide all the necessary materials.  However a part of me still loved all the different thing's I did.  Creatively it was stimulating.  I love to sew.We were not allowed to talk.  So getting to know people was hard.Arrive 15 minutes prior to clock in time  . A  brief talk with supervisor and obtain assignment for shift. This can mean quite a variety of assignments and types of machines I could be running for the shift. Report to job site and converse with co-workers/worker about job specifics. Clock in and start job with packet.The hardest part of the job is keeping a machine producing perfect parts with a human at the controls.The most enjoyable part of the job is that I learn something new everydayThere were no typical days, I would just assist with various projects. My mangers were very flexible with my school schedule.NSA is a great organization for those seeking to increase their abilities as a public speaker. Very insightful and valuable information is presented by established speakers from various parts of the United States.Clock in and start scanning finished product on single ship line 2 and 4. When order shipments are complete we build product according to inventory level.Learned how to read blueprints. Use micrometers, calipers, depth gauges, and set up machine's. My co-workers were fine to work with. The hardest part was standing all day with poor air ventilation. The best part was my co-workers.Although the owner was great, his management team lacked education and knowledge to run a once small company effectively in todays world. Therefore there was no room to grow because the management team were all ""friends"".No work dealing with Logistics, only Intel.

163,3216.0,Expert Data Analytics Engineer,"SRA International, Inc",3.7,293.0,"Excellent company. Good work environment. Good advancement opportunities.They supported their employees well. Got at least a cost of living raise each year.Good benefits.They really tried to find work for employees who lost contract coverage. They would continue to pay them for a short time and provided them with a contact to help search job opportunities in the company.We recently merged with CSC Gov about a year ago and the company has drastically reduced benefits as well as pay across the board. Annual reviews/raises have not been given for over a year and morale has appeared to have reduced due to thisUntil they were bought out by a larger company they were an amazing company with amazing employees. They knew how to get the job done and in the most efficient way and upper management was always supportive and willing to listen to as well as take on new ideas and concepts to make things better.Fortune 500 company for many years running.I loved going to work for SRA. Each morning I would greet everyone with a smile and a ""Good Morning"" every day. Hoping to put a smile going into their day. All of my co-workers were wonderful, we were a team. We worked and laughed together. The hardest part of my job was letting go of teams do to the loss of a contract. I learned a lot while working for SRA, they had wonder employees to mentor other employees, even management did the mentoring. Everyone was family. I did learn that the better a company treats its employees the better the employee will be for the company.SRA is a good workplace environment.  Management lacks experience in certain areas and compensation and pay is minimal compared to others in the industry.ProsGreat coworkers. Great IT support.ConsHard work, a great track record, and many years of service don't mean a thing. Management is spread so thin they barely have time to do their own job, much less worry about helping you stay employed within the company. While my supervisor swore he'd done everything he could to help find me a position within the company, it was somebody else who alerted me to a position I was qualified for. CSRA might talk a good game… Show MoreAdvice to ManagementStop treating employees solely as a means to profit. In eight years of working with CSRA, I never met my supervisor or anyone else in management. Why talk about the ""CSRA FAMILY"" when you don't even care enough to meet the employees? Or at least be honest. I was no more than a name and a number.Hours at the center are from 9:30a-6p, Monday through Saturday, except Tuesdays which closes at 8p. Great people to work with, but clients would often take out frustrations on employees and management is very menacing. You cannot bring up an issue about management without almost instant retaliation. Somewhat difficult to maintain 40 hrs per week.Suitable for a job but not career wise.  No room for growth.  Difficult to move on to new projects.  Internal hiring system needs improvement. Overall, company employee relations declined after it  was acquired by CSC.very friendly environment, supportive management, busy at work, very helpful team, very lucky to be in that team, challenging work.There is no room for growth. No bonuses, salary increase, employee recognition. HR wants you to work like a slave and not be compensated.  Only concern for them is to make the company look good so they can win contracts.Excellent company, super staff and managers, great benefits, and supportive management. They provide education training, mentoring, and job security. They are worldwide and make career moves easier than most.Worked at SRA for 17 years. ""Lived"" through the process of becoming a publicly traded company and then privatization, downsizing and reorganizing. Original corporate motto was ""Honesty, Integrity And Services"" then it changed to ""Honesty And Services."" Worked with many of the original staff who were recognized experts in their fields but who now have left as culture changed.The benefits were top of the average offerings before it returned to being a private company and corporation restructured. Perhaps SRA will be a great place again to work, discover one's talent and or become a subject matter expert.The Directors Document Records Management system was a project that supported over 400 customers and application users. My responsibility was to support, train, troubleshoot, enhance, issues tracking, requirements tracking, testing, documenting and enhance.  I loved serving our customers.safb location.  SRA appointed a strange micromanager who thinks she knows everything and rude to the point you couldnt work in peace, nobody likes her.  They are now CSRA and always have the same jobs open because nobddy wants to work with this micromanager.Not a very nice place to work.  Very low employee morale.   Terrible managers who are hands-off who routinely undermine and degrade their employees to the customer.  As a result employees have a very negative attitude.  Zero opportunities for advancement.The hours are amazing because management fit them around your schedule. The EAC site are neatly kept and work comfortable. As any other office setting, your co-workers are about the same. However, management will make it as comfortable as possible for everyone. Equipment is well kept and always accessible. When conducting outreach, you are required to use your personal transportation. However, there is mileage reimbursement. Overall SRA is an positive 9 out of 10. Lunch is 30 minutes but you do have two 15 minutes breaks as well. Only problem is dress code. The polo shirts could be a better quality. Bandages can be better quality. Other than that the company is amazing. You do have a gap in work, hopefully this year they can get a year around contract with CMS. Houston North Location always have a great center. The site supervisor is caring, hardworking, and very attentive. She goes over and beyond for her staff. If you do your work, then you can always come back to SRA for a second term or contract.Worked for SRA for more than 9 years and never regret having to work for this company. It allows you to grow and advance your career with a family work atmosphere rather than a stressful work environment.SRA seems like a good medium sized company but I have only been acquired from a different company during a contract rollover.  My experience has been tainted by a manager that does not have clearly articulated goals or expectations.  The corporate culture seems pretty good and the onsite training was great.  I think that if I was in a different environment within SRA, I would feel better but where I am now just seems like a pit that is getting deeper and deeper. I may change my review if I move to a different position/contract but for now I will say that SRA is no worse than any other larger government contractor.SRA used to claim that the company ""hired for a career, not for a contract"". That changed when the company was purchased by an investment firm, and the new dollar-driven management philosophy took hold. All that was good in the old SRA has been gutted by the new owners. The Cyber Practice, a core SRA capability, was disbanded in the name of cost cutting efficiencies. Highly trained, cleared cyber employees were released as contracts came to an end. The company has changed dramatically, with the sole focus being on the bottom line, no longer on the employees.This a great company to work for if you are starting your career. Management is pretty good, the work is challenging at times, and my co-workers are pretty good. However, salary and benifits are not competitive at all. Moving up or moving to a new career can become a bit of a hassle as well. They also do not compensate you will for moving to a new position. I went back to school to start a better career, and when I finally found a new opprotunity with more responsiblity, they did not offer me a raise to take the new position.Being on client site 100% of the time, I hardly ever hear from HQ except to sign the time cards. This company is all about the bottom line, which has become more and more evident in the few years I've been here (cutting benefits; merit increases based on HQ-determined numbers, not your actual performance). They have far too many mid-level managers at HQ that don't actually do...anything. Reward the people that represent the company.Work/life balance is good, but that has to do with site management/client and not the actual company.",,Washington,Herndon,VA,2016-07-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/9e14841b-16d1-4c14-b9b3-ce2ce2496e1b?mescoid=4300761001001&jobPosition=33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

165,3218.0,Program Specialist (Data Analyst/Statistician),Department Of Justice,4.0,329.0,"Most Exciting career in law enforcement.  No regrets, only fond memories knowing that our children slept soundly while we were arresting the most violent individuals in this country.Great co-workers and team environment. Lack of upward advancement and career opportunities as a contractor. Management is inexperienced. Salary and benefits of contractor company are incredibly low for the quality and quantity of work provided to the government.If your not hired directly as a federal employee and go through a contractor company,  expect people to treat you like garbage! You get paid way less and the health benefits are so bad there isn't a point to even purchase it.  I worked as a Financial Analyst in FLU and the Assistant US Attorney is smug, condescending and doesn't deserve his position. Other AUSA attorneys say he is unteachable and errogant. Keep in mind the U.S Attorney's office hires these people fresh out of law school with little knowledge of what they are doing. Half the time people sit at there desk and twiddle their thumbs all day. I was very disappointed and expected to learn and experience much more when I was working there. The women are very catty and quick to make up lies about you...the only good thing about this job is you can request a 4 or 5 day weekend almost on every federal holiday....again, showing u how much everyone wants to really work there. If you want a good job and a lasting job,  look somewhere else!Great benefits, plenty of room to advance and move within the company. Management could use some more training but overall great work/family balance.  Yearly raisesHigh stress correctional environment with increasingly acute and chronic medical and psychiatric patients. Law enforcement benefits are exceptional. Pay compensation lacking in comparison to hospitals.Have not received a raise in almost 8 years, not satisfied with working conditions. Very unsafe.

Dealing with the strict environment and some managersThe public and learning different work related materialDOJ's Asset Forfeiture Management Staff (AFMS) comprises of several departments including it's information security team. Forfeiture Systems's (FS) security team deals with continuous monitoring, incident response, vulnerability assessment, vulnerability remediation, working with various security tools, and analysis of vulnerable findings within AFMS networks. The essential part and the most challenging part of the job was to maintain a good security posture so management would be satisfied with overall security structure. The most enjoyable part of the team was the flexibility in work schedules and balance between professional and personal life.Workload is sufficent for pay. Some Managers are amazing and others not so much. I have learned many of skills that will assist me in my career. The hardest part of the job is when Managers do not provide training. I am not saying this is every Manager. I have experienced the lack of training from more than one Manager. The most enjoyable part of the job is the majority of coworkers are extremely friendly. DOJ fosters a positive work environment for the most part.Day normally starts with my initial paperwork then begin driving routes. Friendly environment and we all help each other, along with management. The best part is being on the road meeting people while completing the task at hand.My time with the Justice Department was enjoyable and exciting, as I have gain many years of experience as Paralegal Specialist. I was able to work with inter agencies and many agencies within the Justice Department, DEA, FBI, U.S. Marshals, Courts and Prison facilities. My daily work schedule was pretty busy setting up interview of witnesses in cases and organize documents and filing pleading and arrange conference calls closing case files.  I didn't find the job to hard. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the attorney win there cases because everything was done in a timely manner.This company dose not train new employees very well.  This company expect you to understand what was told you, they do not explained nor show you how to do the work.  This company has very bad communication skills as well as the management  team is very un-organized and un-appreciative of a good worker.  The management teams is extremely strict and some what bully's their workers in doing other duties that is not within their job description.As a language professional you perform a wide variety of translations and interpretations which makes the job challenging but fun and rewarding at the same time. Co-workers are very well educated and come from different backgrounds. Management sees you as family. The sky is the limit if you are willing to put in hard work. :)productive,fulfillment happy and enjoy challenging operation 24/7 on call securing vip attending hearing meeting escort reportingWorking for the Department of Justice brings around many advancement opportunities and paths. Where you end up is completely up to you.This is a typical government agency. The people I worked with were great. Sometimes the work became mundane, which is why I was always looking for a challenge. Being in the administrative field tends to get a little boring at times. However, you get out of a job what you put into it. I really enjoyed working for the federal government with the exception of the commute. The only reason that I left there was due to some extenuating medical issues that have now been taken care of to the best of my ability.While I believe the benefits could use some tweaking, CBH is an outstanding place to work.  By far the best place I have ever worked.  The nurses were treated with such respect from management staff and they were truly appreciative and rewarding for hard work!  Would highly recommend!Review loans that are in potential foreclosure status. outbound and inbound calls from customers to advise status of loan.A great government agency with a stellar reputation; however, I wish I had done my due diligence into my job title and overall duties and responsibilities because there is not a lot of leverage and career growth for non-attorney staff (unless you are an analyst or project manager). That said, I worked to gain a new position on my own with little guidance or mentorship and to date, has improved my standing considerably. Overall, management could be much better especially to assist employees interested in building a career at the DOJ on a non-attorney track. The work-life balance could not be better and the benefits packages are also quite excellent. There are trade-offs to any job, but the DOJ does provide its employees with an alternative to private sector work that most find attractive.",,Washington,Washington,DC,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/acdbf272-b6c3-4820-bbe4-73c9f3135159?mescoid=1300093001001&jobPosition=35,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Managers tend to care about your needs.You are still a scumbag contractor.","1,001 to 5,000",Washington,Washington,DC,2016-11-18T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/c78e0cda-ff38-40e2-b725-2b9e2cb8dd61?mescoid=1300087001001&jobPosition=5,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
171,3224.0,Expert Data Analytics Engineer,CSRA,3.4,66.0,"CSRA has been very good to me. My coworkers are great and management keeps you informed of everything. Great place to get your start in the IT Field. I love it here!A positive work environment without the typical stress of deadlines. I learned that a full Agile development lifestyle can be very effective with Government customers. Some of the best so-workers I've had the pleasure to be a part of. The hardest part of the job was keeping the communication open throughout the team and having higher management support a decision\solution until the end. With an Agile approach there was no direction or an individual to make the difficult technical decisions when needed causing re-work.*	Ensure that all HIPAA and Government security requirements with regards to sharing and storage of Personal Health information are meet at all times.*	Maintain the timelines on enrollment/credentialing schedules, communicate with providers and other departments to update as needed, clarify carrier information requirements, and maintain a strict level of confidentiality for all matters pertaining to provider credentialsI have only worked for CSRA for just over a year now and it appears to be the right fit for me.  The management team are good, hard working people who seem to genuinely care for the workers.  My co-workers and peers are great to work with.  They work as a team and extended family.  So far, this has been a great transition from Active Duty Military.Morale is poor.  People seem very unhappy.  There is high employee turnover.  Senior management is very uncaring and disorganized.  In the quest to cut costs they have made it very frustrating for people to do their jobs. Worst place I ever worked.CSRA has a smaller budget than most Defense Contracting companies, and therefore, they pay their employees far less than bigger contractors, such as Raytheon for example.  If any employees want any On-the-Job Training (OJT), you LITERALLY have to break an arm and a leg to get CSRA to fund any training related to your career field.If you wish to work for a company that will provide you with job security and advancement; this is not the one.  Compensation is horrible espeically with the amount of work you will be given.  It is rare that they back fill positions when others leave, so that means triple the work for you and no additional pay.Worked at CSRA. The compensation is very competitive. The culture for my project really depends on the federal client. Had to be in the office no later than 8:30. The Agile Sprints were 10 days and very fast pace. Lots of work.If you are looking for short term employment working in a call centertalking to rude immigrants all day. Supervisors cheat you outof you PTO time. If you have a family member pass away you will be forced to use sick or vacation time. All though the company states they cover bereavement..Some days were more stressful then others. Everyday I learned something new which in my case was a good thing. Coworkers are great. Management staff was there to assist.The company used to be CSC.  We merged with SJA in October of 2015. Though they are trying be a a more ""hip"" place, its still has a  way to go.  Not all of the offices are on board with things that make coming to work fun and exciting.Most people I worked with have very poor skill sets and are lazy, Management are very unprofessional. Most will only speak to you if your a certain rank... many haven't transitioned to civilian life. No raises, Never recognized for work.. not what you know its who likes you. If you need a job go for it.I enjoy the individual and group training of the soldiers. I like to make sure they are properly trained to survive. This job allows me some freedoms to change how things are taught and find different ways to teach the same thing.  Some are visual learners but most are hands on.  I like the variety of individuals and groups.In the two years I was there, the company decided not to give anyone raises one year, because a merger wasn't working out the way they'd planned. They hadn't given managers a raise in five years. They also transitioned two weeks of sick leave and two weeks of vacation into three weeks of paid time off for me. I only had two weeks of vacation as a new hire, but some were getting four weeks of vacation, and they also got three weeks of PTO. Those who had accrued up to six months of vacation had six weeks to use it or lose it. Nobody took six weeks of vacation; the company saved a fortune. Asked, in a conference call, to justify significant cuts in the vacation accruals of their most veteran employees, the company president responded, ""I'm sorry that impacted you that way. Next question.""Lots of pressure to produce good work, but no recognition when you did, and with no raises, absolutely nothing but your salary for compensation.Company is not really caring for it employees.. There is no benefit to be a employee of CSRA over being a consultant here.. THEY treat you as temporary employees and never cross train of place you elsewhere if one project ends.. AVOID itAmid restructures a whole lot of turnover has occurred and salaries have been affected drastically. New requirements have been placed for roles with no salary adjustments to match certifications.The Company continues to experience new management changes and most likely will continue until next year.  Excellent employees who have great skills and knowledge of consulting.CSRA has a great work life balance. A great deal of the employees, subcontractor and military personnel are friendly and good to work with.I would just like to thank CSRA for the opportunity to work for a great company. The communication with management to subordinates and other workers is awesome. The pay is also great for the hours work. Great leadership and well experienced personnel on ground to help operation continue in a smooth process.Originally started as CSC working on the Army Material Command Logistics Modernization Project. Last year the Federal segment of the company merged with SRA to become CSRAI've been with CSRA for a few months and I enjoy the company and the colleagues who I work with. There is a huge opportunity for growth. My work schedule was fit to coincide with my personal life and that a plus for me.","10,000+",Washington,Herndon,VA,2016-06-30T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/d53c2054-ffc2-4c2a-b369-8d83ba43fef2?mescoid=4300761001001&jobPosition=6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Once down there you immediately start sorting the dirty laundry to start washing and drying them. While doing that process for a long time co-workers always will talk and play around alot,their main language is spanish so they would mix between talking english and spanish.Around 7 pm the managers all leave so it would just be me and my co-workers finishing up all of the daily task until the end of all of our shifts at 11:30 pmResponsible for all end of day reports, accounts closures, and accurate audit of the days transactions.Monitor and maintain all area of the hotel including rooms, pools, and all common area to ensure property meets andexceeds guest expectations and safety.Responsible for checking in as well as checking out quest.Served as the main liaison between customers, management and sales team.Monitored cash drawers in multiple checkout stations to ensure adequate cash supply.Replenished supplies, bags and other materials at each cash wrapUpper management including HR doesn't listen to the people. HR forgets everything and lose everything.  They are not supportive of their employees.  They only take the word of the manager without doing a thorough investigation.  This job has its favorites, no matter how much of a good worker you are.  The employees work well with each other (we were like family).  This company including upper management used to be so caring: they went from sweet to sour with the change of upper managers.Embassy Suites was always fast paced, fun, and lots of room to move up within the company. There was always something taking place in different rooms, whether it be booked for parties, business trips, or just family reunions. I learned a lot about the culture and origin of Embassy Suites, from who founded it to the history of how long its been around. Management was always so great, they always made you feel special and part of the family. The hardest part of my job was learning how to bartend, this is where I learned most my bartending skills. Overall I would say the most enjoyable part of my job was to laugh and go about everyday duties within such a positive environment.We worked together like family but, as a employee working based off of gratuity I feel like the company is cheating us. There is no way that I am busting my butt working 12 to 15 hours a day and only making $12 an hour for a party an hour for a party that cost well over $40,000.  someone has some explaining to do .Working in the food department we were always slammed whether it was someone dining in to eat, or ordering to go or ordering room service we did it all, if the bar needed to refill on one of their beverages I had to go and get it for them. There is always something different that you are doing, its routine its just you will never have the same day.I worked the overnight shift which was a self managed shift. It was great and allowed me plenty of time to spend with family.  This job didn't come between anything other thing that went on in my life. i.e., church, family outings, birthdays etc.This place makes you want to never go home, I really loved working there. The work is very fast paced, but it makes your work day go by faster. You can learn different criteria's and earn different job experience. That's definitely one of the pros of working there.the company does not care about their employees, in fact the banquet department, which included a sales team, RARELY attended any banquet events; they only saw the individuals when it came to selling a banquet event and when it was time to pay for their eventI had served in the past, but working as a banquet/cocktail server offers the opportunity to meet and experience many different cultures. I would definitely do it again. It is a fairly easy job and I enjoyed being a part of the hustle and bustle.I have out look with appiontments but some days do not go as plan, Guest issues or employee concerns has to be taken care of...Check on previous day revenues, balance all accounts. Check on food and beverage, Embassy suites breakfast is always busy and I am always happy to help. Daily Huddle at 10am ...update all department on what's going on for the day and very near future. The hardest part of the job is the are a few days that I wish we have more than 24 hours in one day. The most enjoyable part is certainly seeing the team grow..... that moment when they gets it. Teaching is fun but when that student is transitioning to become a teacher himself/ herself is the joy and it's all worth it.Working at the Embassy was an great experience for me it was nice and clean with OK benefits. Sometimes we were short hand and it caused me to work harder but I love been in a good work environment so I didn't have a problem with it.It's been a pleasure working for such a great company. They truly believe in promoting from within. I have learned alot from all my managers over the years but since I currently moved to the eact bay the commute is not what it used to be, and thats why I am now looking for other opportunities.I use to enjoy my job here but things have changed do to management.  They judge you on your past and hold that over your head but I work with some good people that like me for me.  I work hard and Im always there I never call off unless I'm very sick which is not a lot.Checking in guests and providing customer service was a typical day at work. I learned how to work with the public and deal with complaints in a fair and personable way. I loved my co-workers and we had a great time every day. There really was no hard part, except that in down times our hours would have to be cut. Also, our salaries were very low for the caliber of the hotel.my experience with embassy suites I would describe it as a growing experience, a typical day at work started with a quick meeting with the chef or supervisor and get informed of people in house, specials of the day including soups and entrée, in my  time working for embassy suites I learned how to work under pressure, manage it and get the work done with a smile on my face , management was good, I personally had a great experience whit my co-workers, I had the pleasure to work with people from different parts of the world and learned about others cultures and use that experience to give the guests a better service, like any job involving food production the hardest part would be getting everything ready on time and keep the work and food flow, but at the same time the most enjoyable part of it its when the guests congratulate us for the good job and having the satisfaction of knowing that you did your best!!My typical workday was very busy from start to finish. I learned a lot at the Embassy suites Hotel. Management was great and my co workers were very hard workers indeed. The hardest part about the job was my feet hurting and that's it. I know the rules of life, no pain no gain.I learned a lot while working here. The training was one of the best I have ever had. The work was easy going. The people were great to work with. The hours were long but the coworkers made it worth it.","10,000+",Washington,McLean,VA,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/2d038e57-ff89-49a0-8513-2892b98b4c05?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=10,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

This has been one of the easiest jobs I have ever worked and they make this job seem ideal because it is a government positionWorking for the DoD was wonderful. They took care of me when I showed initiative and hard work. I was able to work from the bottom of the bottom to be in charge of some really awesome programs.Served for almost 10 years of active duty and had it not been for injury I would still be serving. Travel is amazing and if you don't mind paid vacations to the middle east then this is the job for you.Working environment is good. Being a Quality Auditor, involved in Defence Budegeting process. Attended meetings at Pentagon as well as at Fort Belvoir for various QA process.The Department of Defense Media department is a wonderful and fun  place to work.

The atmosphere around the company is great and they always show employ appreciation.I work at a Navy base that serves active duty and retired personell.I love working among military members and promoting a positive work environment.

199,3252.0,Post Doctoral Scientist,George Washington University,4.0,262.0,"While at The George Washington University Hospital I was an intern in the Medical Records Department.  My time there was very well spent.  I went to almost every department in the hospital to see  how it's medical records were handled, scanned into into the main computer, and stored before they made it to the medical records department.Loved working here. It is a university atmosphere and there is always something new to learn. There are many doctors and a ton of work. The management is very strict, however.Very helpful Staff and all middle management worked together in tandem to ensure we got things done. However Upper unnecessary was often disorganized and lead to some disorganized problem that could have been avoided.The typical day at work is supporting fantastic faculties, staff, and students on any Information Technology issues. I have learned more about new tricks in trouble shooting network, printers, computers, and software applications.This was an exciting and interesting place to work, always learning new programs, new methods in medicine and there was never a dull moment.GWU is a good place to work a job. Co-workers are generally friendly and management is (for the most part) competent. It can be hard dealing with entitled students and unfriendly parents. It can be frustrating dealing with bureaucratic red tape. Efficiency does not happen. Budget cuts do happen - and they often hit lowest level employees. If you can get entrenched, your job is secure for life.Leadership focused on stopping the financial bleeding so no focus on employee development. Terrible communication between leadership/management/staff.The managers at George Washington University Hospital are very nice, kind and flexible with staff.The employees are truly team players and support staff are patient with the nurses.It was a college walking  distance from building to building, rode elevators. cleaning, dumping trash I was off on weekend and no holidays. The job was very plain and simple to follow.A very diverse community, great place to work enjoyed the student body as well as employees and staff. Office staff was lots of fun enjoyed every minute, my first Director was a joy.It is a nice location in DC, I have had a lot experiences and peoples working over there friendly, Good place to working, and enjoy my workMy day started at 5am, and I look forward to coming to work everyday. I really enjoyed working with my co-workers, we all were team players and we all work together. As a member of Information Technology server team at George Washington University Hospital, complete overseeing of the VMWare virtual environment, Citrix, and EMC storage area network.GWU is a very organized and communicative work environment. Its faculty and staff are very friendly and welcoming. Everyone is always happy to help each other. Every day working here has been a positive experience.comfortable working environment and satisfied salary.operation manager is kind to help to solve any problems during workrelatively less competitiveflexible working duration**Please note this eval is for the Medical Faculty AssociatesPoorly organized Extremely high volume Antiquated software and computer systems No transparency Poor communication from senior managementUnreasonable expectationsNo employment incentivesMy day starts around 6 am, throughout the day I am on the phones assisting my staff with posting of cases and reviewing the schedule for preparation of the next day schedule.I have worked with GWU for almost 11 years and the first 9 or 10 were challenging but I felt secure and fairly well compensated.  Unfortunately due to recent budget cuts, the security has been diminished significantly and is no longer a great place to work for IT professionals.Could be improved because continueing education should be encouraged. exprienced Excuses not to award student school reimbursment.The IVF department is one of the worst departments of them all at GWU/MFA! They have inexperienced leaders, very unorganized, disrespectful, and too many cliches! Management is very unprofessional, and spends too much time on gossip, personal and intimate relationships with employees, and not focused on daily issues that are important to the growth and success of the department as a whole!If you're honest, and speaks the truth, then management will have a problem with you! You will be considered the problem for your truthfulness!Management is extremely insensitive to the personal needs of their staff, as it relates to having to take off from work! Those intimately involved with management was always authorized to take off at anytime, leaving the department in chaos, due to the lack of adequate staffing in their absence, and management would act as though everything was fine and peachy!!Working with doctors who were very easy to accommodate  Work for the Medical Director who was not demanding.

Happy to have filed approx. $60,000 of Income Tax returns in a short span and saving Tax preparation fees worth $4,800.This was a great volunteering experience with Foundation Communities that is doing an impactful work year-after-year helping local communities with their finances and improving there quality of life in general.Excellent quality control by IRS by making sure all volunteers go through an entrance exam before they can get registered as a Tax Preparer.Had an excellent learning experience!The internal revenue is a great place to grow. Everyday you have a work leader who gives you the run down on how to be succesfull at the task at hand. About 1000 tax documents need to be edited and reviewed a day. The Hardest part about the job is knowing when to take breaks throughout the day. The most enjoyable part of the day is the end when everyones about finished with their documents. Its a pretty bland and boring day. But very easyI learned how to effectively deal with upset customers. I learned and took pleasure in helping customers be able to manage their finances so they are able to take care of all responsibility including paying taxes. I enjoyed helping identity theft victims feel secure n knowing the action i took internally would not effect their tax liability or refund in the future.The duty is to service taxpayers & that is what will occur. Typically there is a mix of telephone calls and paper cases. Many systems and skills will be learned. Workout because we love to eat there. The people are nice and most will help you in any way possible. There are organizations and other outlets for training and skills development.Earnings and benefits may be good, but atmosphere is only good for advancement in larger work centers.  Small call sites are stifling, and ridiculously rigid.  Lots of backstabbing and miserable employees.  Only work in larger sites, if you dare.loved working for the IRS i was a filing clerk and a mail clerk handle and sort documents. management was awesome great work environment fellow co workers were amazing and friendly and helpfulExcellent  highly recommend working for the Internal Revenue Service.  I worked for the Internal Revenue Service for twenty years.  In each and every day enjoyed looking forward to benefit my clients.Good place to work and climb up the ladder.Worked well with co-workers.  Managers listen to your opinions of how to distribute work between co workers to get done in time.Professional work environment. Many opportunities to learn and advance.  Job stability with flexible work hours.  Satisfying pay.  Work fairly easy.My typical work day started at 6:00 am where I managed a caseload of 150 plus tax cases.  I learned a great deal about analyzing tax accounts, procedures and systems.  As far as management there is definitely room for improvement.  I enjoyed all of my coworkers there were many people from different nationalities, backgrounds, ages cultures.  The hardest part of the job lack of moral, encouragement and support from management.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being recognized for a job well done and helping tax payers.Nothing to really say, it's your typical government agency. Wouldn't go back. Taught me a lot professional though. Great time off.AM shift is 5:30 am - 2 pm and PM shift is 3 - 11:30 pm.  Management needs a lot of improvement and training.  Not all are bad but most still need adequate training.  Best part of the job are the people you work with.  Hardest part of this job is finding out the correct answers on how to solve certain issues.  Not everyone is on the same page and are given different solutions to one problem.As a Taxpayer representative and being able to handle different people from all backgrounds, this was an very interesting position that I loved to do.  This position was one of the best positions to have that was directly related in my field of an Accounting degree.  My co-workers had made it an easy place to work, because they were enjoyable to be around while we processed and answered questions related to filing, preparing, and adjustments related to individual and business taxes.My day was productive and busy. I have learn how things worked in the corporate world. I enjoyed working with the people I encountered. hardest part of my job was staying focused, I worked at a different pace that what I normally worked at. I enjoyed the people and the work experience I that I got to have at such an early age.When I worked at the IRS, it was my very first office job.  I had no expectations of office work in general.  It was a lot more wacky and fun-loving than I thought the IRS would be.Defined job responsibilites - training provided to perform various jobs that you may be required to perform on an as-needed basis.  Defined career path structureLearned several new things on a weekly basis.  The job at times was very stressful.  Enjoyed the people that I worked with and got to know them on personally.Ok place to work, the majority of the job is on the phone helping customers. depending on your manager, management can be a blessing or not. Co-workers are fun to work with.After a training of basic tax knowledge, we would be able to help tax payers to prepare their tax returns. It is a great chance for accounting students to have a general overview of how the taxation system works.Great place to work. The learning environment was amazing.

Not a lot of room for advancement unless you move over to the contract side. Several recent acquisitions.excellent place to work. worked there from Feb 2012 to Jul 2016.They treat the ex military very well there. Apply if you enjoy contract type work for Naval aircraft.Wyle Laboratories as a research group in acoustic no longer exists.  The company is out of business it was sold to a bunch of thieves that destroyed a great R&D group dedicated to acoustics.Wyle Labs is a hard working, get stuff done kind of contracting business. The department I worked in was fundamental and encouraging to see that places do shine in what they do!Wyle is overall a good company.  It's a typical contracting company.  With that being said, you're always dispensable.  The pay is so-so.Great Employer, Good benefits, Had fun working there. Had a great boss who made the job. All kinds of different products and testing.A typical day began with analyzing working aids and schedules to determine IT project deliverables due. This included managing and creating contracted IT deliverable reports due weekly, monthly, and quarterly; standard operating procedures (SOPs); and metrics. Overall, these documents numbered nearly 200 separate items which routinely needed editorial and formatting assistance. The position required coordination with other team members in person or through email communication. Company management was kept informed of progress and risk levels associated with late submission of documents/data from team members.To meet 508 compliance for documentation, Microsoft Word's Accessibility feature was studied and implemented.Strict organizational methodologies were necessary to ensure documentation successes for the customer.Unfortunately, I didn't feel like a part of a team. Management were sometimes unprofessional and non communication caused a delay with productivity.Very similar to my military experience. I served in the Marines with many of the people that I worked with at Wyle. Very flexible with military deployments and monthly military reserve requirements.Always trying to give their employees opportunities for growth and training. Paid very well and the culture was so much fun. I enjoyed coming to work each dayI was a part of a start-up operation and learned a lot about private industry following many years as a civil servant.  My skill set carried directly over from my govt service to this position and allowed me to be an asset to the management team.No direction and business process is non-existent. They do not provide work for you when your contract is up. Typical work day is not consistent and changes on an hourly basis.A typical day involved review of standardized documentation, so that didn't interest me anymore after awhile. I learned a lot about technology, which was great. Being a communications major, that wasn't something I was familiar with. Hardest part of the job was the management due to entire team being newly formed; however, it was good we were all hired around the same time. Most of my co-workers were the same age as me, so we made it a fun environment and socialized outside of work.Solid company to work for. Very professional work environment.  Flexible work hours. Weak benefits package.Enjoyed working on a new adventure for Wylie with  the Air Force.Lots of competitionMgrs hired friends and kept them safeNo training Co workers were not helpful at all to new hiresThe hardest part of the job was sharing an office with a disgruntled employeeThe best part of the job was the job itself and the Mgr before she retiredThe new Mgr took care of her ownLong days,coworkers were get to work with.Firing a 7 stage rocket held down by 4 inch diameter cables was awesome.Some folks with no HR, Supervisory Skills incharge, stressful supervisors, things going on against ethics- employee relations, etc rampant.  Supervisors engaged in coveringeach others backs.  Unprofessional.  HR not professional.   Alot of whether you were in the "" clicks"" or not.    Very unlike the larger companies who have an HR Departmentnot mingling and socializing outside work.In three years this company went from growth and multiple contracts to one contract from a customer whom they ignored. They followed that up with poor performance on the contract. On its way down.Some of the people are great and there are many interesting projects to become a part of.A typical day consisted of supporting manufacturing with test issues, improving existing test programs and writing new test programs.  This Wyle facility consisted of the merger of two companies and I learned that obtaining cooperation between the employees was no easy task.  Since I was new and my co-workers consisted of a blend of two companies, I was viewed as an outsider.  The hardest part of the job was getting employees to cooperate with one another.  Slowly, the employees began to work together, as a result of my efforts.",,Washington,Silver Spring,MD,2016-10-19T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/258e4e92-6c48-4d9b-bcc7-1295d4cece64?mescoid=1500140001001&jobPosition=34,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

With that said the environment was great and the people there were amazing and helpful.The market knows about Novavax's unsuccessful phase 3 RSV trial. Novavax is a great place, where there should still be reason to believe in their programs. It is a great place to work, with a very personable culture. I love the company, and the employees and management. However, they are in a bit of a struggle right now due to lost value after the trial. They did just go through layoffs, and are unlikely to be hiring in the immediate future. I would go back to work there, but right now (Nov'16) would not be the time to start a new position with them.Novavax is a good place to work. They provide relatively good work environment  and benefits. In general, employees get good training and job/life balance is just right.It was a good experience to work there, however, due to the failure of phase II trail, the company is in trouble now and laid off more than 1/3 of their work force.one can typically easily finsh tasks with in the work day. There are lots of chances to improve your skill set and knowledge base. everyone is very supportive and friendly. management are open and willing to talk about how progress is going and ways that you can improve yourself. The only downside to working here is that there are some long days and long nights, but it is very fulfilling when you get a final product.I enjoyed the short time I was at Novavax. Everyone was very helpful, I learned a lot, and gained some great experience. I worked at a comfortable pace everyday and was in control of my hours and when I could break for lunch.I saw people fabricate data to please managment.  Backdating and making paperwork disappear is a daily occupance.   This place is so driven to get sponsorship they are willing to bend basic scientific ethics to get there.Like any Business, the lower management culture was very catty.As a seasoned biotech and PM professional, I can honestly say this company was the biggest disappointment of my career. Please beware!This is a public trade company relocated from North Carolina. Working at the company’s Finance department was very challenging due to SEC reporting and SOX compliance deadlines. I have worked at all tasks of SEC reporting, SOX compliance, month end close, FAS123R, Fixed Assets, Audit and etc. which significantly enhanced my professional skills and knowledge.The hardest part of the job was to meet job responsibilities and deadlines with limited resource.

304,3357.0,Geospatial Intelligence Analyst,Intergraph,4.0,29.0,"Great place to work. Fun environment with lots of learning and daily challenges. The work experience i have ever worked for. Paid vacation and Holidays. Very responsive to my requests and answers in a timely fashion. Work is very easy and challenging at the same time. Very stress free environment. Great co-workers and overall teamWent through several lean years only to watch the company pour millions into a new building in order to attract younger, cheaper employees.  Existing employees get little to no advancement opportunities and about the only thing to look forward to is a cost of living raise. There is little upward or even lateral mobility in the company.There is little real long term direction in the company with not much to look forward to except meetings, meetings and more meetings.The benefits package has also consistently gotten worse year over year.Intergraph is not custom to change and new challenges.  The tier 1 analyst are use to custom ways of operations, and management allows it.  No one is held accountable for his/her actions, and management does not step up to manage responsibility or change.  The most enjoyable part of the job is building rapport with the analyst and enforcing change and better business practices however, it takes a team to accomplish these actions and not just one person.  I learned if everyone is not on the same page of new challenges/change, it can be a hostile environment which turns into  what is and not capable of accomplishing its goals.Sales driven culture.  Project Managers have limited chances of success.  Work from home is a positive.  The professional services organization is immature.  Cumbersome back office processes.Enjoyed my last position at Intergraph because it provided exposure to a number of customers each with their own challenges.have was very hard during my inception of my job career and it was also much knowledge growing process and I got time to learn new technology like salesforce, HTML .Interesting place to work. New building is nice and very open. There's not much room for lateral movement/advancement. Company is willing to pay for you to complete you masters program (with some restrictions). People overall are quite friendly. Upper management are personable for the most part and easy to talk to. Has a cafeteria and barista on the terrace level along with a pool table, ping pong tables and foosball tables.Great place to work and a supportive management.I enjoyed the environment and had a fantastic boss who was supportive cared for her team. I would recommend working for Intergraph.I am glad that I am a part of Intergraph. Friendly environment with supportive management . A good place to start career with.Decent Company to work for. Not much room for advancement. Great for entry level positions. You will wear several hats.I enjoy working here for the most part, but there is a lot of politics and bad management decisions based on politics. The pay is also much lower than most companies.Good place to work.  Management needs to do better in keeping moral up at job.  More classes are needed to keep you abreast on ever changing work structure.Shift started worked on collecting and entry the data from my part of a nautical chart. I learned how to read nautical charts. The management was hard to approach the cartographer where easy to talk to if you had a problem with the chart you where working or could not identify something. My fella co-workers where easy to talk to and helpfully if they had a section of the same chart you where working on to see if you could read off there's.The hardest part is you have no access to help from the cartographer at night then getting trained for the next step of the job and begin dropped in to it with no help.learning how read nautical charts was fun.This was a great company to work for. I had several opportunities to grow early on in my career. I learned alot about Professional Services Management and working with external customers.Shipping and receiving, check in material, duplicate discs, assembled material for kits, labeled and boxed material for shipping, received material for computers.Great people, frequent food days and activities. Good location in Madison is easy drive from Huntsville. Management goes above and beyond for those in need, and keeping employees happy.  Insurance premiums are keep low.Very good place to learn when new things come up, Helpful team when an issue you struggle with. Nice people in office complex.I take inbound calls from hospitals, care centers or rehab centers and i assist them with our program if they have issues with working in it. I learn that everyone is different. The hardest part of my job is trying to figure out what the issue is that they are having if I can't fix the issue I escalate it to my Tier 2's. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I speak with all kinds of people and I get to help them in assisting them with their issues.Really enjoyed working with a great team of people.  I worked in the DC area with strong support from the software developers located in Huntsville, AL.  Great people in both DC area and Huntsville area.I only worked at intergraph as a temporary employee on a temporary assignment. It was an excellent experience.I used Intergraph for several years I find it to be a very user friendly","1,001 to 5,000",Washington,McLean,VA,2016-07-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/4ee13d57-85aa-4b8f-971a-8dc51d3e3e5f?mescoid=1500140001001&jobPosition=34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

374,3427.0,GIS Analyst,Tesla Government,3.6,320.0,"Great Company to work for. They take good care of their employees. Everyday seems to go buy very fast, it's a fast paced work place. Many of people enjoy the atmosphere.First off , it is not Tesla Motors, It's Tesla Electric : Tesla Electric is a very young company in Sulphur , La. which has had it's growing pains but is coming into it's own. The work place is very friendly , yet professional, one of teaching and learning while putting out very high quality work in the residential and commercial electrical arena. I would reccomend Tesla to anyone wanting a high quality electrical finished product. Tesla Electric performs much bigger than it is.Great opportunity learning variety of skills. working here was a great experience and you get to meet different people everyday and the majority of people are all very nice, although you gain many skills and definitely have good income working there, if you want a job as well as a social life and be able to have time for outside of work activities or such especially if you are not a local to the area this would not be able to mix well together since the majority of people working here are required to work a maximum of 70 hours a week, about 12 hours a day.Great place to work with a nice balance of work and home. I worked four twelve hour shifts with three days off a week. Starting pay was $17.00 an hour with a raise every six months of about a dollar. However you are on your feet for just about your whole shift and some of the management can be hard to work with at times, but definitely a great job to be at.The best work ethics I have ever seen. Most people would push for getting things done and are not very political. Work-life balance is poor (in Body in White at least), management would push for quick return but undermine sustainability of employees. Burned out employees will only stay for a year or two max. Great learning opportunity for employees, but because of the non-sustainable attitude, most employees would not last long.Geat place to work, the people are very experienced there talents. Helps you grow into a better, more reliable person. The hardest part is being there for 12 hrs and only get a 15 minute break but you get used to it. The work was very easy when you leaned it. The pack line was the easiest to work. The assembly line was tough but when you do it a lot it comes easier.• Consistent high monthly performer within the top 4% of worldwide influenced orders among Product Specialists. Influenced over $4.6 million of annual revenue. • Assist in the launch of the Tesla Stanford location by training new Product Specialists, Owner Advisors and Store Manager.• Assigned as the liaison for group presentations and marketing campaigns regarding Tesla product knowledge• Help to develop a new way to market and sell electric vehicles to the community. A part of the first Pop-Up launch in San Francisco• Qualify inbound and outbound lead generation through dashboard KPI's and opportunity tracking within SalesforceAt tesla you had no life, and politics play a big roll. Moving up in the company you had to bend and always break rules to be considered as someone who wants to move up in the company. Living while working for tesla is like being in jail, your life, relationship life and family values they all go down. Tesla don't give a penny about your health, they love to take advantage of you to the most they can as for as money and paychecks go. And if you don't do what they say even if it's the law you be breaking then they will threat your job to get you scared. Overall tesla and there management is ugly, they don't know how to manage things well. That's why there stocks go up and down.Tesla motors is a good company. if you don't mind working 12 hour days 6 days a week. keep in mind you will have no time to do anything else, friends,family,wife,husband you will have to sacrifice a lot. if your a single person and have no significant other then this is perfect job. they pay very well and have lots of benefits.you even get stocks if you stay the full 4 years. management is good.very fast past working job with a lot of over time. Employees were very respectful, the management was excellent and everyone worked as a team.  As far as the hardest part, i would say nothing about the job was difficult. Everything was very organized and well managed. My most enjoyable part of the job was the money that was coming in from all those 12 hour shifts.Working for Tesla was an opportunity of a life time and I miss it every day. It was awesome being part of something great to help improve our environment. However I was promised a lot when i took the job, but Tesla's management never followed through with there word. I also was injured off the job and Tesla would not modify my position temporarily until I healed and was just let go.Warehouse/ manufacturing                                     My job was to assemble the spine of the battery pack and making sure all parts are in their proper places so it can move forward in the assembly line process with no defaults. Had worked in a team to get our job done in a safe and timely manner ●	production worker Keeping count of all ship outs ●	Safety first wearing all protective gear in workplace●	Battery pack assembler ●	Prepare and complete orders for delivery or pickup according to schedule ( load, pack, wrap, label, ship)5am start time meeting every morning for Electricians and Data team members. we leave about 540am to collect equipment that we will need for the days job. Then take a cart to the level job is and once we would find our pillar and IDF and Jboxes and Racks and servers working with switches labeling correctly and running CAT5 liines from the IDF up 60 feet into the ceiling and along side the beams  using ladders or scissor lifts even booms. We would run between 2 to 14 lines from one point to another before that we were installing and hanging security cameras.Work varied on a weekly basis, between  building and testing newly designed test equipment for the Tesla Powers Electric Drive Systems, Installing Test equipment, Building wiring harnesses, trouble shooting and repair of equipment.  Worked with an outstanding manager and several seasoned engineers.  Loved the challenge of developing new equipment.  Hardest part was working with new engineers just out of college with no real life experience in electronic circuitry and wiring.Tesla is a company with a great direction but is striken by poor managerial decisions.  Most of my coworkers are incredibly passionate about what they do and supporting Tesla's mission.  Tesla pushes all of its employees to strive for greatness and do more than they think they're capable of.  However, the upper-lower level management does not communicate directives well, and does not take feedback from employees.I really liked working at Tesla, the people were cool and really helped out , management was great the leads and managers actually know what they're doing and the free cereal and snacks and fountain drinks really are a plus, only thing is that my lunch breaks were only 35 minutes, i can't go out and buy something because i won't make it back on time, and terribly they're really strict on the background checks thats the reason why i got let go.This company is FAR from honest with their customers. Rude trainers who don't believe that people should be able to make emergency phone calls, and if you don't fit their fold, they'll kick you out. If you have a strength in Data Entry, but was hired as Production, which is a weaker strength, they'll fire you instead of putting you where your strengths are. That's precisely what happened to me. Extremely discriminatory regarding people who have pain syndromes. I waited 2 months for this job, forsaking other employers, despite being hired back in June, I couldn't start until August 18th, and lasted for nearly 2 weeks. Terrible company, there is no love for their employees, and no love for their customers. All they care about is image. I wish I could say more, but I'd end up breaking my NDA.Great place to work at for a while with a very fast paced and dynamic environment, good advancement, with lots of learning opportunities if you are willing to jump in and get your hands dirty figuratively and practically speaking. Management although often best in their fields is also often inexperienced managing people, sometimes lacking leadership and good management skills. It is often very demanding and not very forgiving with poor work-life balance and high expectations. Sometimes lacks processes, clear direction and constructive feedback. Resources are sometimes missing or stretched thin. It can however be very rewording and self revealing on a personal level when you do meet expectations and overcome challenges. It has good health insurance, and some small perks.Regular 8 hour shifts with optional overtime. Management not the brightest but also not the worst. Overall you are given the tasks and are expected to complete them before the days end.A typical day is doing audit, inspection and engineering trials. Learned different hand tools and mechanical tools as well.Learning the processes of building a car. Learning different parts of the car and it's function. Seeing our CEO most of the time brings a smile to my face.I learned many valuable skills about working in a production environment by spending three years at the Tesla factory. The most enjoyable part of working there was being part of a growing company, and having a chance to see some cutting edge technology.","1,001 to 5,000",Washington,Vienna,VA,2016-11-03T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/64e605f9-47d0-4e29-93fc-f5ea047d6e71?mescoid=1500140001001&jobPosition=34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

410,3463.0,Senior Biologist - Advanced Human Cancer Models,ATCC,2.8,10.0,"Stability, low pay, not so great management and co-workers were not very cooperative either.  It was a good experience as a first time job.Be very careful before you sign up here. Lots of politics (particularly from HR and upper management) lead to high turnover. Lots of people unhappy with the place; with a smaller group of people who have been at ATCC since the beginning of time. These folks will never leave, but they're not interested in doing much work. The new people have high turnover because they're not as tied to the vacation benefits that increase over time.Pay scale is low and a 'bell curve' to give year end bonuses and raises makes for a ""zero sum gain"" culture- if you get a good review, it means it's not likely I could get a good review too, because the manager only has a few of them to give. This makes people unhappy; they feel like they have to wait until next year to get the higher bonus or good review. Or they look for another job. HR says ""like it or leave"" and many people have left. If you are interviewing ask about the turnover of the newer people- HR talks about how the ""average"" person stays X years. But they're averaging in those lifers who have been there 25 + years.They keep hiring more senior directors and senior VPs; they need people who get the work done. It's kind of a mess. This is a temporary stop for me, and for many others.I have worked 4 years at ATCC and since that time I've seen 3 company heads and 3 department heads. If you think that is bad, the turnover rate for lower level employees is worse. Management from senior to supervisor level are either incompetent or in a state of fear. Since I started, 2 lab supervisors out of the 4 in our department have been removed due to abusive behavior toward their charges. The lab equipment is horrible and older then my teenage son. There are no promotions, no advancement. The pay is on the extreme low end for Northern Va (the CEO's is an exception of course).  I've been in the Biotech business for over 20 years and this place is the worst place I've ever worked.ATCC is a good place to start your career, but it's very hard to advance.  They're willing to hire new grads and career changers, and you will get a solid foundation in laboratory work.  Upper management is almost continually churning and they prefer to hire middle management from outside the company. Morale seems to be low with many employees.ATCC provided all student employees with everything needed to complete their job. Including an outline on how to work while being a student. The most enjoyable part of work was hearing the praises given by all the teachers who were more than happy to strike up conversations even if you weren't their direct student.Before working at ATCC I was a Food Service Manager for fifteen years,  I suddenly became divorced and needed more of a work/life balance because of my two small boys so I left food service and started working for ATCC in a entry level position as an invoicing clerk.  This was my first real office job so I have learned a lot and also brought a lot of skills with me from the food service industry. My co-workers are great people very helpful.  The hardest part of the job is Tuesdays and days after a holiday because that is when the check volume is the highest.Bullied by long time e'ees. Micro-management. Mandatory OT at straight time pay.  My way or the highway co-workersManagement does not support its employees. Decent hours and low pay.my department IRR was not the best department to work for at ATCC  high turnover and inconsistant manangement",,Washington,Gaithersburg,MD,2016-10-27T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/85afbf8d-f2ed-4320-a4a5-2da8107d83c7?mescoid=1900240001001&jobPosition=35,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

439,3492.0,SAS Programmer,NETE,3.0,3.0,"I was given many opportunities at NETE that I otherwise might not have had access to.  Everyone was very friendly, collaborative, and willing to work together (sometimes long hours) to complete projects.  I am lucky to have been exposed and trusted with taking on new projects.- The management is highly unorganized and has no flexibility whatsoever. - They ""ask"" you to come on weekends to help out with work. It is not ""required"" but everyone is worried that it is not a ""good look."" - Stingy and greedy. They only care about making more money as a company and gives no attention to their employees. HR is supposed to be in charge of a lot of these things, but turn-over rate just within HR is crazy. Employees don't know the HR people and HR people don't take the time to know the employees. So, it's very awkward and unproductive.- No structure/philosophy/corporate value. Anything and everything that will bring in money, they will do. They don't care about your values/work-life balance.- No structured performance review system. This may be good for some people, but for those who are rockstars, there is no motivation. Apparently you have to work your butt off to just get CEO's attention and then you will get promoted...after years.DO NOT WORK HERE.I used job as my step stone. Never planed to continue as a carrier.

441,3494.0,Physical Scientist,Ensco Inc,4.2,87.0,"While I was at ENSCO the corporate culture was all about fair play with the employees. I enjoyed my time, but our contract ended with the Government and we were not offered additional employment.One of the better positioned companies to ride out the offshore energy slump.  Clear expectations and a safety focused culture make it more safe than the ""old"" oilfield.Responsibility is the name of the game on an offshore drilling rig and platform, safety is key and when it is used properly it can make for a great workplace, I learned a lot about permitted jobs and how to work with a great team. The management is well versed in company policies and it shows by their safety records.Some days are okay, some days we get so busy that we only have little time to rest. Which is just normal in the industry. Being a Driller for more than 10 years but still learned more when I joined Ensco.The working environment is highly dependent upon the local rig/ship management, therefore, you can have a great team and poor management or vice-versa.Enjoyable work place , day by day challenge due client requirements Good place to learn and adapt to the fastest program change Satisfaction on goal achievmentsThe most enjoyable part of the job is working with a knowledgeable team and sharing new skills and ideas.   Typical days on the rig consist of scheduled preventative maintenance and repair in a safety oriented atmosphere, including pre job safety meetings and minimizing downtime on various diesel engines, hydraulics, pneumatics, pumps, gearboxes, reverse osmosis water purification systems, sewage treatment systems, air compressors and heat exchangers.   I have learned a lot from my supervisors and we are encouraged to do our part at improving industry safety standards by doing one task at a time and empowering everyone with stop working authority.I loved working offshore with but with the market down I must find something that's more reliable for my family! It was good money and good benefits. So with all that said I will stay with what ever I can get!I am a hard worker and strive to do my very best at obtaining the max potential and output at whatever I indulge in.  Very punctual and trustworthy. Company strived to provide workers with most and best knowledge to perform tasks at a very high level.This job required 12 hr days, 7 days a week for 21 days straight.Once aboard you were basically on the vessel for the required time of your hitch. There was always an under lying worry that should something happen at your home, or to a family member, your ability to get home should your presence be required.AMEC Paragon is a great place to work at, with great leadership.  Pros:Proven leadershipOpportunities to advance and learnCons: NoneWasnt a bad place to work, lack of communications, We built gear to gu under trucks for the purpose to test tarck layout and find problems and in-perfectionsworking 90 hour weeks paid off when i was working. being off for 14 days straight was nice. cooking for 200 men. Learned how to multitask.Roustabouts are usually responsible for cleaning, working basic machinery, scraping paint and repainting, loading and unloading heavy shipments and helping with any miscellaneous tasks that arise.The hardest part of the job is safety as well as the heat but everything must be triple check because in the blink of an eye anything can happen if equipment is not check right or loads or not rigged right.Management is the crane operator as well as the deck foreman they're my boss and any job tasks that we take on they must approve of it and see if need a (JSA) Job Safety Analysis.The most enjoyable part about offshore is they make it feel like home off the clock with the physical activities and social parts.Installed, maintained, and repaired electronic controls for robotic drilling equipment, diesel engines, automated Voyage Management System, and internal/external communications equipment.Ensco is not a bad company to work for, but due the current market situation they have had to stack ships and lay off a large amount of employees.Wonderful place to work with nice employees and tons of resources for training and assistance.  Management is very approachable and tries hard to interact with all employees with occasional town halls, ""pipeline to President"" forums etc.I enjoyed my time at ENSCO very much so. It was on a 14\14 day schedule. I would give anything to go back to this job. but with the slow down in the oil industry I cant.Enjoyed working rotational shift. After spending a long period of time working hard, the quality time off to spend at home or travel is rewarding.Great motivating supervisors to work for. The company provides some of the best training for my career. The hardest part of the job for me was being away from family weeks at a time.They merged with Pegasus and is now UniversalPegasus. and is now a different company. Before the merger it was a good place to work. I learned lot about pipeline mapping and went from board draftsman to AutoCAD designer.",,Washington,Springfield,VA,2016-10-19T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/281b118a-a0a6-44b0-b912-123eb41ddcee?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=31,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

444,3497.0,Geospatial Analyst,Cubic,3.9,36.0,"CUBIC is a good company to work for with the understanding that they a a bare bones type company willing to make any cut necessary to maintain or win the next contract. An example being cutting full time positions and making them part time on call. CUBIC also has a long history of hiring and promoting those they feel are loyal over those that are the best qualified. This leads to a mid level management tier that does not fully understand the Army requirements and forces lower level part timers to pick up the slack created.Job security is unfortunate with this company. Never plan buying a home if you depend solely on your own salary. You may start tomorrow and the next day you may be looking elsewhere. As for the rest, it is fun to work for. Many company/employee events.Prepared PCs and laptops in accordance with corporate standards for use in various business and engineering environments.  Installed various hardware(client and server) and software(OS and apps). Network setup for both LAN and WAN. Performed authorized custom installs when appropriate and assisted in conversions and updates. Performed workstation and LAN analytics to trouble-shoot and repair systems. Answered helpdesk phone to directly assist users with hardware/software requests and/or problems. Maintained and controlled the PC/laptop inventory.Scheduled and organized work load between first and third shifts. Assisted and supported other operators, team of two Data Center Operators. Established operator procedures and maintained/updated documentation. Served as the direct contact/laison for in-house and contracted support groups.Whole day workNo enjoymentOld style school.No Job security, boss always watches over your shoulders and very micro management.Very cutomer focused.  They believe in a good work/life balance. The management is in touch with the employees on a regular basis.A typical day at work included a lot of typing and paper work. We reviewed soldier's benefits and life insurance policy for soldier readiness processing, reintegration, and whenever they felt like coming in to update information. I made dog tags, I tried my hardest to make sure that one guys ex wife was off of his paperwork and that was probably the most difficult to deal with...angry people. But it was easy to calm them down. I really loved everyone I worked with.The Service desk offers a great environment and I am blessed to be part of such a great team that really takes care of each other. One of the down sides of the IT department is the advancement, most of the members of the service desk have been there for about 3-4 years, and the common trend is that employees have to move out to move up professionally. Since working with the company I have only seen the department hire out rather that promote within.I train US Army Soldiers in Military Vehicle Maintenance where we teach them what it's like to learn simple maintenance in the US Army.Seems like a good company, however, after running out of funds after only 5 months on a ""2-year"" contract, I can't make a fair assessment.A typical day was training soldiers in scenario's they man encounter when deploying. I learned some different languages, worked with people from other countries.Great place to work with high energy, extremely talented work force that strives for Customer Service. Goal oriented organization that allows employees the freedom to develop the programs they are responsible for in a positive environment. Challenging environment that develops employee abilities and strengths.Great company for advancement and learning experience. I enjoyed my work experience with this company. The most enjoyable part of the job was the learning experience.This is a good place to transition to if you are leaving the Army and are looking to supplement your retirementso it is a good fit.Worked outside everyday had very little office time just took care of what needed to be done mowing the grass using a variety of tools provided to me.I enjoyed my time with CUBIC and I felt that the management took very good care of their employees. The work I did was 9 to 5 and the vacation time was very fair. My coworkers were competent and reliable for the most part.The defined work hours are changed and there is no set, Day shift, mid shift or night shift however, at the end of every rotation your overtime hours convert to a 7 consecutive days off every month. The promotions are not always available unless you have a degree and even then there is not a whole lot of room for advancement. The work is good, the pay is decent, and if you are competent then the work environment is ideal. This is a great job for a recently retired from military or a starter job for someone that just got out of the military.Company management okay.  Challenging position. Workload very heavy for one person.These jobs were government contracts and throughout my whole resume' are basically the sameOutstanding working environment.  Leadership went extra mile to take care of subordinates.I enjoyed the job very much. It made me feel good helping evaluate and analyzing soldiers getting ready to deploy to a combat zone. Knowing what we were doing might save there life. Most of us in the office were retired Army so we all got along well. We all had that sense of urgency, for mission accomplishment. We had and met high standers every rotation. The hardest part of the job, it was considered part time only 58 hours every two weeks. At times during a rotation we would work 115 pulse hours per week. We would not get paid for the over time but were given short work week (days off) in lieu of. No body wanted to leave there full time positions so advancement was not happening. Being able to help soldiers was the most enjoyable part of the job.Trained soldiers in the use of weapons, communication equipment and tactical driving in milkitary vehicle. With the use of powerpoint I gave classes on the above mentioned. Ran and supervised the weapons ranges. The most enjoyable part of my job was training troops and making sure they had all the tools to make back home safe.",,Washington,Herndon,VA,2016-10-05T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/4d3a35e4-67bf-4468-b09a-a325bdc71802?mescoid=1500140001001&jobPosition=34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Good benefits and perks.  Limited flexibility to work from home.  Undeveloped unix department.

I lean an extensive about of information pertaining to clinical trials and contract management concerning subject enrollment and patient study contractual costs. The management is relatively laid back. My co-workers are great; very helpful and resourceful. The hardest part of my job is how to deal with managers that do not know how to manage and provide managerial expertise when necessary. The most enjoyable part of the job is coming to an employer where you know (for the mostpart) that you are valued.While I loved and strongly believed in the government study that I worked on there, the supervision team consists of long-term employees who do not take pride in their work nor do they value the study or employees who value such. Knowledgable diligent workers who exceed managements expectations and would otherwise be congratulated and used for their skills are targeted for personal harassment (NC State laws do not protect employees from unfair or unethical employment practicies) and end up seeking other employment due to contingency and inconsistencies among supervision which results in high stress levels.Was making sure staff was equipped with the right devices before departing on travel.Had great co worker who worked as a teamWorked on Agriculture and eviromental study, outbound calls, inputing data while speaking with client, high call volume, intense study, assisted with training of new-hires, assisted supervisor with additional duties as assigned.I learned a great deal about government studies, protocols, health and medical terms.

Professional environment and great co workers.  I highly recommend Sotera.This was a good place to work before budget cuts and sequestration affected jobs. Mid sized government contractors all suffered and Sotera was no exception.The story of a job placement company trying to be a defense contractor.  All staff meetings were to tell employees about acquisitions and plans for company revenue growth.  Only discussion of employee success was due to a project team's efforts prior to their previous company being acquired.There appears to be some financial issues since everything discussed centers around money and how the company can make more, or at least enough to meet debt obligations.There is not any job security.  Every day is questionable whether there will be a tomorrow.Coworkers are nice but above that becomes less than satisfying and supportive.Pros:Excellent ManagementGood PayFlexible work scheduleIf contract was lost, company would work with you to find a new contract.ConsContract workIt was fun and enjoyable working at Sotera Defense Solutions.  I only left after being laid off due to the absence in government contracts.  I was fortunate enough to work there for almost four (4) years.I enjoyed being the Travel Coordinator for the senior software engineers and corporate employees.Wonderful experience due to supervisor, she was willing to mentor those who wanted to learn.Great leadership, many opportunities for advancement. Highly cleared positions and encourages independent work.I enjoyed the team I have worked with and the atmosphere of work which allowed for thought and innovation and encourage team participation and a since of family. The contract ended due to government cuts.This was a temporary project that I really enjoyed working on.  The work environment was very layed back, which brought an ease of concentration.BusyValuable knowledgeExcellentgreat co-workersJob easyGoing to work everydaySotera is owned by another investment group who has no history in this field and it shows. Administration where I worked was stressed and understaffed. Speed was the number one objective and the word ""quality"" always took a back seat. That may be the normal at most places of work however. This appears to be a very stressed company financially at this point. Please keep that in mind before you accept a job there. The employees that I worked with were very nice people but they had been asked to give up too much family life to be happy.I enjoyed working for the company. I received respectable pay, and enjoyed some company perks (ie. box seats at the Verizon Center). I would have loved to have continued working for the company, however major contract adjustments were made, thus not allowing me, and many others to continue to do so.Sotera Defense Solutions has afforded me several advancement opputunities since I started with them in 2007. They are a very personable company where you don't feel like just a number, but you are part of a team and a large family.Familiar with IT Infastructure. Learned VMWare Sphere Client 5.0   and other Web-based  Tools Productive, Dedicated  and Motivated.Sotera Defense Solutions has a lot of good people to work with.  Mainly a DoD subcontractor for most projects, which means defense cuts really hurt the company.Culture depends on which sector you are in.Good mid-sized Defense Contractor.  Started with Signature, aquired by Global and then re-named to Sotera.The impression that I got from this company is that they do not care about their employees. I felt more like a number than I did an employee. It's been my experience that smaller companies go the extra mile to make sure they let their employees know they care and that they are more than just a timecard or employee number. They strive to let them know that they want their employees to make a ""career"" with the company instead of just work a job. But I did not feel this way with Sotera at all. I do not see myself ever working for this company again. I had a very enjoyable experience working for Sotera. The Human Resource Department is very efficient and being able to talk to management is even easier.They are professional and very responsible for their staff as well as to their staff.Co-workers are very hard working but I looked forward to working with them since they came to work with the best attitude and professionalism. You work hard during the day but you go home feeling that you have accomplished the duties that have been put before you and they praise you for it.Sotera is by far the best company I have ever worked for.Great company to work for.

469,3522.0,Associate Scientist,Emergent BioSolutions,3.3,37.0,"This is a vey reputable company. Some jobs operate on a shift schedule. The company however offers amenties tat allows the employee to be comfortable while working late and weekend shifts.Lack of trust and dishonesty abound.  Due to their reliance on government funding they are blocked by red tape and can't get out of their way.  More political than strategicHave enjoyed my time here.  Wish I could continue working with such a great work force.  Have learned a lot and would love to continue to learn.Emergent Biosolutions is a great place to work. Excellent environment and I learned a lot throughout my time working there. Quick career advancement if you are a hard working employee. Only reason I am looking for other employment is because they are downsizing and I was a part of an employee severance.24-7/365 manufacturing of Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed (AVA). I learned how to use SAP software. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the monotony of executing the same procedures everyday with minimal variance.Nice place to work, they really care about their products and employees.  They just opened a work out center and a cafe at our headquarters.never worked here before. i worked for emergent professional services which is a staffing agency. indded selected the wrong employers name for my employment.I almost always worked over my scheduled 12 hour shift. Upper management was not honest when they hired me as a temporary employee, knowing that they were making a transition within a couple years  that I would likely not be a part of. My co-workers were great, many of them were in the same boat I was. I learned to operate with great attention to detail, but few functional skills that will translate to other jobs in my future.As a manufacturing technician the job itself was repetitive but enjoyable because of the team environment.  Over the years, however, Emergent has become more and more dysfunctional.  This is mostly due to a few rotten eggs in site leadership.  One or two bullies and sycophants in the upper echelons really create a trickle down effect of unhappiness.Good place to go to get experience but the management can be terrible.... Not a lot of room for growth. They claim you can successfully move up the ladder but it turns out its very difficult unless you know someone....Benefits are great especially PTO.We worked two shifts, nice place to work. People are nice and I gained a lot of experienced. The most enjoyable part of the job is we travel.Emergent is similar to other companies of its size in that some dept are well managed while others are a nightmare.  Be sure to vet the managers you'll be working with prior to joining.Growing and in some ways exciting company to work for.  A lot of positives - good corporate culture etc, but a lot of politics in getting promotions.Difficult product space orphan disease state, large territories.  New division to the larger entity still ironing out the details.I've had the ability to learn a lot about a wide array of company systems and processes.  My co-workers are great and make the job enjoyable.  Management holds all of the decision making power and even then, only senior management is allowed to make any decisions.  There is definitely room for growth for those without advanced degrees and those with advanced degrees aren't given much room to exercise their expertise and problem solving skills.  The hardest part of the job is the rate at which work is expected to be completed as there is not much time between a decision being made and completion of that task.The people are at the heart of this company.  Colleagues were outstanding.  As the company grew, management lost site of staff and instead of truly working on the culture they resorted to a façade.Working for Centric Parts through Emergent was ok, not the best as they tend to have a very poor choice of employment rights although they say they are equal and are willing to help the growth of the company has always been more important than the safety and health of their employees. It is great knowing you will always have work Monday-Friday plus overtime when needed.The company has grown significantly.  Lots of opportunities and lots of positive changes over the past years but growth pains too just like any company going through significant growth and change.  Ehtical company with a strong CEO. Work along side many talented people.The company did more for me in terms of personal growth and benefits than I thought any company ever would. The work/life balance left something to be desired and compensation was a little lacking for my position.Long hours are always encouraged without the recognition or compensationManagement does not embrace the values of the organization but forces the staff to use themManagement always seemed unprepared for audits when lower level personnel pulled the majority of the weightWould never recommend them as a good place to work.Management is run by two peopleNot a good place to workI was treated very badly and constantly humiliated by the employees relations person in HR.

474,3527.0,Associate Scientist - Clinical/Microbiology Lab,"Microbac Laboratories, Inc.",2.7,23.0,"Laboratory position with faced pace work environment perfect for just out of school hire. Management positions require several years of experience.It is a good job to get your feet wet, I have learned all I can, but there is no room for advancement.  We have a huge turn over rate, I have been there the longest at 5 years.I was employed at Microbac for almost 15 yrs. A typical work day consisted of finding the samples to test that day. Calculate media needed to complete the days samples. Writing up your analysis for the day. I learned a great deal in my time at Microbac such as aseptic technique, method suitability / validation. While I was working in the Food chemistry lab I learned how to work with HPLC and GC. The Managment at Microbac are good smart people but most lack personnel management skills. I had many friends that I enjoyed working with in the Food Chemistry lab as well as the Microbiology lab. The hardest part of the job was the inconsistent hours. Being a contract lab there would be slow times and sometimes we would have more work then the amount of people employed could handle in a reasonable amount of time. The most enjoyable part was always the people I worked with.High speed environment that is detailed oriented. Communication between clients and managers are a must to get work done in a timely manner. Multitasking and time management are important to meet the clients needs.Fun work place with very nick coworker. But lots of time very busywork, need very good organized time schedule. I have been working as a chemist in several companies and have a great chance to get lot of hand-on working experienceThis place is a good place to learn laboratory skills, but is a place that will destroy you if you stay with it to long.  There are some good people and some horrible managementMicrobac is a great place to start fresh out of college when you don't know any better. After gaining experience, I suggest looking to improve yourself. Microbac is a good resume builder, but they don't demonstrate that they care about their employees. Tactics used by management are often demoralizing.Good hours and great group of individuals to work with. The job was not very stressful, management was easy to talk to, I learned how to run the samples and how to mix the solutions for the samples.Must adapt to changing requirement quickly. Gained experience in a wide range of responsibilities.One of the few benefits of working at Microbac is gaining experience to enhance your resume and... get a different job. Another benefit is that you may very well like people you work with, as I met many friendly individuals during my time here. Now on to the drawbacks. You will probably be hired with empty promises of quick advancement, pay raises, reasonable compensation, and steady work hours. Kiss that goodbye. A new hire should expect to be kept at the same pay rate for as long as possible, while amassing more responsibility, and maintaining poor employee benefits. The company in general, and most specific locations are managed poorly. The emphasis throughout the company is profit. Morale be damned. Stay here long enough, and half (or more) of the people you work with will quit or be fired and replaced with someone grossly under-experienced. The work is challenging at first, like any new task, but quickly becomes very monotonous. You will most likely master most of the assigned tasks within a month or two, but will be expected to continually increase efficiency and fidelity. While working there, I did the same set of about 15 tasks every day. Over and over. After working in two divisions over the course of three years, I hated it most of the time from about 1 month onward. I worked with a few great people, but I also dealt with a lot of idiots (from bench level up to President level). If you have another option of employment, TAKE IT. If not, I pity you. Hopefully your hellish existence working here will serve as a catalyst to better yourself.No communication between management and staff.  Staff roles are not properly identified.Microbac is a privately held laboratory services organization where each location has complete autonomy to operate.   The lean nature and independence of the locations creates an environment where the fire-fighting that is normal to a services organization is unsupported by intra-company resources.  This also leaves the organization without the ability to capitalize on operational synergies in an effective manner and struggling to leverage its size to a more profitable and rewarding outcome.  With a relatively young and dynamic workforce the environment is typically upbeat and positive tempered against a high turnover rate.  As a career start, Microbac provides excellent learning to be leveraged to the next career opportunity.On a typical day, I was responsible for testing many dairy samples for customers that regulatory bodies required them to test.  Each day I was also required to test all media that came into the lab that we used for testing to guaranteed sterility, productivity, and selectivity if required.  Probably the hardest part of the job would be remembering all the different tests that the job required us to run.  The best part of the day would probably be when all the analysts in the department would bounce ideas off each other to figure out the best and most efficient way to accomplish something.  My co-workers were all highly educated and fun to work with.  Every one of them were easy to get along with and willing to help you as much as they possibly could every day.This is a good company to start your career however the longer you stay the less appreciated you feel as an employee. I've learned several different test methods however very few of those are utilized. There seems to be a disconnect between management and lab staff often leaving the lab staff in the dark on new projects.It was a great place to work for a while. They are understaffed in some areas and over staffed in others. Gossip central if that is what you like. There is a lot of favoritism that goes on in this company. ""Management"" likes to tell employees that they are all expendable. This brings the moral down. They do not lead from the front and the lab director and assistant manager run from their duties.Very busy everyday. Always had overtime due to constant jobs coming in and very little time to break. Co-workers were great and helped me a lot with the time at work. The best part of the job was having the support of the co-workers. The hardest part was the constant jobs rolling in and no way to finish them all with not enough equipment. The management was fine.When I started at this job it was a great place to work. Everyone worked together for the good of the company and the clients we serviced. As more employees left or where let go and not replaced this made for difficult work environment.If you interview there, look into the eyes of the people who work there and understand that those people were just like just you only about 2-3 years before.You will work 50-60 hours a week just to keep up with what is expected of you. Management is fine with that until they realize the OT is going to kill their bonuses. Then you will only be allowed to work 40 hrs /week causing you to get further and further behind. When you are so far behind that clients call in to complain ( which makes management look bad) you will be back to working 50-60 hours/week.Enjoy.Work starts when I gather all the sample info I need to run for that day. I then gather supplies and start to plug away at data and sample start up. I then repot data by a computer data program and work with my project managers as needed to help keep our customers in the loop. This is a job I enjoy because it is a high pressure environment where customers need results in a fast and timely manor and I feel I do my best work when I now people are counting on me to give a 110%.I really enjoyed working for Microbac Laboratories. The company had at that time GREAT ideas of growth and took care of their employees as well.The Microbac organization has over 20 labs in the US. The Wilson division is a good place to get a job straight out of school to learn a variety of skills.",,Washington,Sterling,VA,2016-12-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/cba1cd24-d001-4746-8376-68da22bf06f5?mescoid=2900515001001&jobPosition=29,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

They were always supportive of my education goals.No review needed this is the same company and place of work. this is a great place to work the daily challenges keep things fresh and the people are great to work with.none available - great atmosphere, I really do not have a lot to say it is a good place to work, I enjoyed my Vice President and Manager the most.I have been at STG for 10 years and it has been a pleasure.  I typically work alone and conduct all things security but when I need managements assistance they are always there to help.I am a contractor so there is no real job security.  The team that I work for is nice but not very close knit.  The team at our HQ that I have worked with is a lot more happy and outgoing and regularly do things for lunch or team building events.Things change quickly.  You may be part of that change.  The rank and file are good people.  Management is very fluid and changes often.  May be better with private equity investment... but not likely.STG Inc is a great company to work for.

Also, no real supervisor on site to direct everyone focus toward a common goal.STG had great benefits.  Though being a medium sized company paying attention to politics was important.  I enjoyed my time at STG.STG, Inc. was a great place to work until the recent years. It was a government service company that was constantly changing. Low employee morale.Leadership is out of touch and losing business faster than ever.  Employees are treated poorly and tossed out capriciously.  In many areas, everyone over the age of 50 and all of the African Americans have been forced out or laid off.  In an attempt to keep existing business, salaries are being cut while overhead costs are skyrocketing.- A typical work day is working 8 hours a with zero over time.- I've learn leadership and how leadership plays a very important part in being a team player.- respecting your co-workers and valuing their opinion, -the hardest part of the job  was leaving-the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting different members of the military staff their families and culturesGreat place to work. Great management and coworkers. Flexible schedule. Good benefitsI manage day to day activities of each program assigned to me within my portfolio as determined by the Sector VP for Civil Agencies.

I continue to provide and  bring new work to the company and pride myself in providing excellent service delivery to federal and private sector clients. My current employer has assembled a wonderful team, that are warm, welcoming, humble, honest, trustworthy, and dedicated to be brief. They are a wonderful group of individuals to work with and for. The most difficult part of this function are contractual terminations. Its always difficult informing letting good people go due to a project being completed. The most enjoyable part of this job are the networking and customer / client / professional relationships developed.  However, the best part of the job is playing a role in the economic growth of small to medium sized business within the DC metro area.Managed team of engineers:Critiqued engineering work, managed schedules, managed sub-contractors, attended coordination meetings.I greatly enjoyed working at Best Western.

Extremely kind managers that are willing to help.i recieved phone calls with angry and happy consumers i also leared learned how to use diffrent programs and be patient with calls i recieved despite the attitudes given.I stayed stressed out the whole time I was employed with the company most people there was friendly its just you had to deal with a lot of stressful things with the consumersjob started out with a two week training course which went way too fast but ended up being ok. the real stress started when i was thrown on the phones without any real training of a very confusing software database for healthcare consumers.Hi stress and confusing scripts, poorly designed software and hard to navigate. if you like to work in a challenging environment, where all my supervisor was concerned about was her numbers and ranking for her team. you stay on a call too long, its counted against you, clock out late, counted against you, only 2 short breaks and a 30 minute lunch. i felt too confined to my desk, felt bad for going to bathroom because it would be counted against adherence. the benefits are good although i never got a chance to use them. i got sick and missed three days and went over my allowed days. i would still be there had i not got ill. i miss the money but not the job.i enjoyed this helping people with their healthcare needs but also had many calls from frustrated consumers who were unhappy with there health insuranceAll we did in this job was answer calls of costumers asking us for more information about helots insurance we help them apply for insurances and fin the one that next fits their income I really liked how we had to socialize with people I live helping people so I think that's why I liked my jobGreat people and nice policies. I had very good experiences at GD. The military people are great to work with and appreciate things you do! Very good place to work!Positive environment, learning place, and wonderful co-workers. There is a lot of flexibility and everyone is very understanding. If you want to exceed expectations you need to ask and out in the effort to get there.Great entry level company for beginners looking for IT positions or supply chain warehouse jobs. Excellent healthcare benefits and flexible work hours.","10,000+",Washington,Springfield,VA,2016-10-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/0d008df6-b72e-4ca0-ba0b-dd6b77dab667?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=32,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
478,3531.0,Statistician,Department Of Labor,4.0,272.0,"Enjoyed every moment of this position. Everything was paced perfectly, and my co-workers respected  my time.My professional and sub-professional work history has spanned a period exceeding 30 years.  I am in reasonable good health and love outdoor activities.  Management in the companies that I have worked for varied as the work environment demanded.  I enjoyed underground mining and stability monitoring of mine works.  The hardest and most challenging work in underground production was longwall and continuous miner continuity of operations and complying with state and federal regulations.I would get to work and put on my coveralls, gloves, hairnet, and hat, and start to assemble the machinery to be used for the day, as well as using the power jack to bring in the product of the day for cooking and packaging.  Then after assembly my team and I would continue to work until break.  My co-workers and I would all have designated jobs and activities to do, and some of the workers would excel in certain areas as opposed to others.  Creating a relaxed but diligent environment was necessary to finish the day's work on time so we could get a head start on the next day's preparations.I was a student trainee for the black lung office. Within this job I had several duties. This included making sure all documents processed within that day got mailed out to the client, the lawyer, the judge, and/or the survivor. I was responsible for tracking the large documents that have been mailed out. Overseen the file room and mail room. Overseeing the large file room and keeping that in order helped me gain valuable operations management skills. I also met all requests gave by claims examiners and senior claims examiners.This was a very enjoyable job. It was only for students so when I graduated I had to quit.A typical day at work shows high demand from the clientele we have either over the phone or in person. The work provided to us is consistent and we always learn something new everyday. With the change in daily instructions, sometimes there is an issue with lack of communication which can make the job difficult at times. But the best part of the job is always being able to satisfy the client.Working in this department is a difficult prospect. The salary is good and competitive, but the job is a perfect representation of the metaphor ""a cog in the machine."" Processing the same amount of work day in and day out and being mandated on a metric basis is very demoralizing, add in the lack of advancement and this job has a clear turnover.Greeted patients and provided triage depending on need, such as appointment schedules and records.  Managed office supplies, vendors, organization and upkeep.  Prepared treatment rooms for patient examinations, keeping the rooms neat and  Maintained a clean reception area, including lounge and associated areasMaintained a case management for at 20 veterans, conducted workshops such as resume writing, interviewing skills, dress for success, stress release and more. I learned how to conduct case management and a new software. The hardest part of the job was not being able to find suitable employment for a veteran. The most enjoyable part of the job was going beyond my job description and see the veteran get medical benefits due to my refer. The technology for this local government was great and training also.On a typical day, I would go to a local bakery to be picked up by the people in charge of the internship program I was in. The program was held at a house, belonging to a local entrepreneur. The least enjoyable part of the job was working with people unprofessional, and ignorant. The most enjoyable part of the job was making homemade goods and selling them to the public. This job also gave me an opportunity to make friends with co-workers.I was tasked to implement safety features and render audits to  center staff. I also supervised a security staff of 45 around the clock. Working closely with staff and trainees in making there campus life safe and without concern. Implemented active shooter drills.At DOL Job at work and family life of employees are balances. Compensation at DOL is competitive while benefits are exceptional. Job security and advancement are guaranteed as long as the employee performs right. Management is always pro employees, while job culture is based on the mission of the agency.I enjoyed my last two positions with Goodwill and when my time was up and no longer eligible to work for them due to a four year limit I continued working as a volunteer at Foxwood because I enjoyed the job and the work I was doing.Management at this job was really, really good.  Lower-level employees, especially the older employees, were unqualified and routinely obstructed work from being done.  Once I got access to the systems that I needed access to (6 weeks) the lower level employees were suddenly really hostile.  Files disappeared. I got yelled at for retrieving files that I was supposed to have to do my job.  It's not a professional environment on the lower levels. People spent hours (say noon to 3) at lunch and worked through one or two cases per day when the cases only take 15 minutes at maximum to enter into the system. Trying to squeeze promotions out of management and eliminate rivals were my co-workers' main goals.The best part of the job was getting paid.  It was easy, light work and the pay seemed phenomenal for how little I was doing.A typical day was helping the clients as needed on the computer,It was very easy talking to the management team.  Good relationship with my co-workers.  The hardest part was having the clients wait for their turns for a computer.  The most enjoyable time was when we all spent time together.Worked with finance and accounting management to audit internal controls.  Worked on a variety of audits.  Prepared budgets, audit reports.  Management and trained audit staff members.Good company to work for with many benefits and chances for job advancement. Typical day on Second shift; Clock in and get report from 1st Shift, Start patrolling 30 acre grounds, Mentor and Monitor trainee behavior and report all problems to shift supervisor.Excellent place to work. very supportive people and very good management group.employee benefits also very good. career growth also very good as always more opportunities to explore on different tasks.Enjoyed training new employees on the technical nature of telecommunications and customer service.  Felt I was very good at customer relations, trouble shooting issues and communication.A typical day at work is just coming in 8am in the morning and continue working on the most recent task assigned to us by our boss. I have learned so much working for this department, from gaining more customer service skills to gaining more experience working in the Office field. The management and co-workers are very friendly, understanding and flexible. The hardest part of this job is when we get assigned a last minute assignment that needs to be done right away. The most enjoyable part of this job is having the opportunity to meet successful people on a daily basis and having the opportunity to gain more knowledge and experience working in the office field.The Department of Labor, Job Corps Division, gives youth ages 16-24 the opportunity and ability to continue growth and development in life through vocational and academic pursuits.  Many are able to correct mistakes of the past or enhance their education and skill development through disciplined training.  The residential setting is a huge adjustment for the trainees and only 2 of the 125 centers nationwide are non-residential.  Just as anything else in life, you get out what you put in!Co-Workers are energetic eager to go set health and safety inspections.  Management is easy and understanding, My enjoyable part of my job is going out in the field to translate.",,Washington,Washington,DC,2016-12-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/a13b7b4f-c8f6-42c9-ab92-385076e56f0e?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

515,3568.0,Satellite Sensor Calibration Scientist,ERT,4.0,23.0,"ERT is a very good company to work as a Software Engineer. My manager was one of the coolest person to work with.He provided me with all kinds of work during my internship including development, automation & unit testing.Amazing place to work. Very challenging but worth it. I've learned a very lot from working here. Never a dull moment. High volume when it comes to work. Very high pace.Reserve SWAT officer assigned to support the US Marshals office in serving warrants on violent, drug, domestic abuse and many others. Outstanding working environment, it is great to work on the entry team with the best this nation has to offer.ERT just purchased PHT Crop. in May 2015. The transition is still going on so it is hard to judge how it will turn out. So far things look good. Although they only strive to provide average compensation.  Aside from better pay and questionable job growth potential I think things are going well.I came to work for ERT, when my previous company PHT was merged with ERT in 2015. ERT and PHT work both in the ePRO industry, and the management of clinical trial data for pharmaceutical companies. When I started at PHT in 2012, the company was doing roughly. Lots of data mismanagement, and clients whom were not happy with the management of the clinical trail data. After an intense 2 weeks at the company, the CEO at the time and the Client were very pleased with the expediency in which we resolved the issues. I went full time after 5 months at the company, something I was working hard towards.As the company PHT began to rise from the issues of 2012 , so did my responsibilities. I became more knowledgeable in clinical trial matters. Not just the management of data, but the development process of the studies prior to being active. I was continually in demand by our international project teams, for the work I was putting out. It became more challenging as the years progressed, but I dived into every situation open minded. I made myself available for my colleagues from Project teams to Support staff. I guided Junior team members in the Data Quality Specialist department, in the understanding of studies and their approach to cases and task management.When the PHT merged with ERT, I felt as if things in the company changed, not all for the good. Staff were leaving at a enormous rate prior to the merger, review process was completely changed, with no opportunity for a one on one with my manager. The environment did not feel the same to me any longer; I hardly worked  more... with my immediate team members, communications seemed to have been less through phone calls and more through massive email chains(which caused confusion for many team members), and my growth and progression in the company felt stunted.  lessExperience with emergent counseling for clients struggling with severe psychosis, suicidality, substance abuse, attempted suicide and family crises. Working as an Emergency Response Therapist brought experience in the process of hospitalization (for high risk clients), diversions and outpatient care. Emphasize on lest restrictive level of care needed based on 27-65 statute training in Colorado.Wish they didnt take work from home away. I was more productive in a more closed environment. Also shouldnt have sole to third party company.It is a very responsive company and their HR/admins sincerely serves their employees with in the boundaries of the resources made available to them. They have a very flexible training program. What more can an employee ask for!The job was a regular job, but the employees made it fun to work there. We would attend social functions together and Phillies games.A typical day is touching base with an employee that I am responsible for in regards to his training.  We interact with one another throughout the day and work well together to make sure all deliverables for the quality team is in order.  As a Quality Assurance Auditor I have learned allot about how very important it is to maintain certain standard operating procedures and for each and every person within the organization to abide by them.  If these SOPs are not followed the productivity and effectiveness to to our tasks on a day to day basis may be at risk.  The outcome, may even affect the client in some cases and this is something we strive to avoid.  The hardest part of the job, is actually trying to explain that individuals cannot and should not deviate from their own written processes.  The enjoyable part of the job is making the end result, making the clients happy as well as knowing the tasks assigned was done accurately without any risks along the way.ERT is passionate and committed about transforming the way you conduct the drug development and healthcare efforts.

570,3623.0,Senior Research Scientist,CEB,3.3,74.0,"THose with masters or PHDs treated those working towards a graduate degree and just had a BA as if they were not smart enough or qualified to interact with clients.There was one individual who was the reason for 2 people leaving the company and management promoted him because of his knowledge even though his colleagues and CLIENTS were unhappy with the way he interacted with clients.I went in with high hopes & came out nothing but disappointed- specifically with management. The culture is super inmature & management lacked any leadership.Typical day for me would involve attending many meetings and working long hours to ensure all work was completedMy manager was great but was also stretched very thin.  My team was wonderful and I could always rely on them to get their work doneMy work life balance was not great and working while on vacation was the norm.  This does not happen everywhere within CEB though.8:30- 5:30 Job. Great working atmosphere, with great colleagues to help you out if you ever have a problem or question. Management is good, closely work with either an Account management or Sales Executive.  Work life balance is the most enjoyable aspect of the job.It is a great place to start your career I the sales environment. It has continually pushed me out of my boundaries and has allowed me to become a more productive and efficient worker. Having said that, the management there is as all high pressure sales environment. It is an all right position if you don't mind dialing 100 times a day and pitching all day over the phone.The work in the CEB project is amazing, challenging and gives opportunities to be focused but creative every day. From having barely any people we grew to 15 members in the team in three years and completed work volume normally handled by twice as many peopleThe one thing that I have never understood is the lack of possibility to arrange work hours more flexibly and integrate suitable technology. If we would have been allowed to work at least part time from home (50/50) it would be the most ideal project ever.I am glad to have been a part of it and will always cherish itIt's a cool career startup for a recent college graduate. Nice company culture and learning experience. Not for everyone but the right candidate or employee can be successful doing what is expected.Lots of office politics here. Highly dysfunctional. Everything takes lightyears to get done. Processes they use are archaic. Overall, the charity does make a difference in a lot of people's lives. They just need to fix themselves and they will make an even bigger impact.CEB is an ok company. I started there almost a  year ago. Not a lot of room for advancement. Especially after earning my CISSP.Really loved the culture and people at CEB. It's such a great place to learn and grow - you can really do a lot! Management is great, and if you are a hard worker, you can go far.Overall CEB is a great company to work for and to get professional work experience.  They pride themselves on hiring the best of the best, including extremely smart and innovative individuals.The environment is friendly and they offer a great benefits package that is very competitive, however in many departments they lack career advancement.Great company to work for. Salary could be a bit better but the benefits and Paid-time-off are second to none. Positive work environment and great training system. Positive managers and supervisors and everyone is helpful.There are so many brilliant and kind people working at CEB who support organizations around the world with research and best practices yet CEB does not follow its own guidance.  Horrible career pathing, low pay and poor management at the top.Work in my division often consisted of doing the same thing each day but that might have changed since then. The rah-rah culture was not my favorite.Fun but unorganized.  Good leadership in some sections but in other departments there is a lot of confusion.  Work hours are pretty good except they micro manage a lot.I really enjoyed my time at CEB.  However, the travel was over the top and advancement opportunities in the Chicago area are limited or non-existent with corporate headquarters being in Virginia.  Daily activity included cold calling, presenting to C-level executives, managing team.  The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting and talking with executives across all industries.CEB has a great company culture that promotes work life balance. It's a wonderful place to get your bearings, build a foundation, and network. Networking is a must because promotions are clearly based on who you know. Some teams play favorites more then others.Are you (or someone you know) looking for a new career opportunity in the Washington, DC area? If so, I would highly recommend investigating CEB. I have the pleasure of working at CEB and believe it is a great fit for me during this portion of my career. CEB has great benefits and career development opportunities, is true to its values and is committed to its employees.CEB has a young atmosphere. The majority of the employment population are recent graduates. The offices are modern, and if you are willing to ""play politics"", there's room for advancement.You'll learn a lot at CEB and work with some very smart people and even sharper clients. The work life balance is also pretty good. The problem is that the work tends to become extremely repetitive after about a year or two and upward mobility is extremely limited. Furthermore, upper management is still treating CEB as if it were a 200 person firm. Growing pains abound including antiquated performance metrics that handicap the company and stale, groupthink from upper management.Fun place to work for young professionals.  CEB has good training, but the career path is not as clear as they make it out to be.  High turnover.","1,001 to 5,000",Washington,Washington,DC,2016-09-08T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/e554a572-0a97-43ad-8907-ce0ede383310?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=20,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

581,3634.0,Statistician Consulting Manager,Pricewaterhouse Coopers,4.0,2700.0,"great place to work - I enjoy working with smart people and the talented network at PwC.  Limited career growth in Marketing and Sales.As an intern I was able to participate in multiple audits for various companies. I gained hands on experience in the auditing field. The people there are great to work for.PwC is a great company. It provides great benefits and career opportunity to any staff level. It's great to be part of one of the most prestigious public accounting firm in the world.In the financial services market, there is constant pressure to meet short deadlines with an intense amount of work. Among other groups, there is a flexible work environment.Overall a great place to work! It was as an early place in my career, it was definitely a learning experience. Overall, I would recommend this location to anyone who is looking for a great job experience!- Work on requests with time limits - Laid back environment - Workload varies - Lots of benefits - Great experience- make friends with everyone - Managers are good people -Overtime pay - Must stay overtime if work at hand is due and not completedGood work environment, challenging but satisfying, not much work/life balance but they are working on it. I great place to start working and understanding the corporate world.PwC allows you to learn and grow. Great projects are mixed with miserable ones. A lot of really good people work in the company with excellent experience and expertise, but some are far from being perfect.There was no work/life balance and employees were expected to give up their weekends for about 9 months out of the year. Management was very appoachable however and had an open door policyGreat opportunity for recent graduates. Exposure to a lot responsibilities and different types of jobs. Team work required, long busy seasons.Working at Pwc as a contractor at the moment, I'm lucky to be surrounded by a team of professionals with great attitude and personality. we provide help to the employees on daily basis on their laptops mostly but we also make sure everything else is working perfectly, things like printers, video conference equipments, phones, TVs and more..Co-workers are extremely smart and talented. They help you to grow your personal brand and establish your unique value to the firm through diverse experiences.Great people, great work mostly, and excellent support. Need to remember that it is a business driven by revenues. Long-term, one needs to align what they do with how the firm makes money.I was part of a small close-knit group of consultants with good access to my management. I truly enjoyed the minimum 2-week mandatory learning opportunities.I landed on the wrong team that over hired in anticipation for some big wins that unfortunately did not come.  The culture and people that work here are great however; you really need to find a great project/teamPwC provides a good opportunity to expand your understanding of auditing and accounting principles. PwC has very high expectations of its employees. Employees are expected to learn on their feet and to keep up with long hours and high stress deadlines.I loved this job. I worked there for about 8 years. Management team was great. All the tellers were great. I have no problems with this bank. It was the best working experience of my life.Great company, depends on your group, obviously a global company with similar opportunities.  Beautiful office and locations, great benefitsCareer is propelled forward through combination hours over standard and networking in addition to performance. Although the work alone won't guarantee you the promotion, management is always willing to speak with you and help you be as well rounded as you would like. It's a great place to start your career.This office is a great opportunity for recent college graduates seeking experience to build their marketability.  There is little opportunity for advancement for individuals with years of financial industry experience. This is not the core practice which causes limitations in growth.Good training program and a lot of projects to learn and growGood work environment and locationHours is long Coworkers are awesome","10,000+",Washington,Washington,DC,2016-11-21T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/0da46a2d-6c20-4550-95a8-5a61ae4e4de0?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

611,3664.0,"Senior Scientist, Microbiology","Canon U.S.A., Inc.",3.7,437.0,"canon was a great place to work at wish i could have worked longer. I love my department the warehouse was clean. the food was amazing i just loved everything about it.- Great work atmosphere- Great career opportunity- Great benefits- Great people to work with- Competitive salary- Enjoy working with global customersGood environment Great place to work, excellent benefits. Lot's of opportunities to move to different areas. Indoors.A typical day included confirmation of prior pending sales. Approval of pending credit claims and marketing program claims. Review of specialty area items. Verify emails regarding orders. Correcting or verifying status of order. Respond to dealer, sales or management inquiries. Work on processing returns and documenting conditions and response for approval or denial. Forecasting current sales with potential for meeting designated goals. Submitting trending reports. Completing presentations. Participating in team meetings.This is a great place to work if in need of a job.  Good schedules to choose from, great benefits, laid back culture. The customers called in for ""technical assistance"".  Most were nice. Company goals are very attainable.My only complaint is lack of advancement opportunities which is common with call centers & starting pay is a little low.outstanding, learned a lot, there was a repetition of taking pictures all the time. enjoy with the pay raise was great and the people.Great company, too bad they are moving. I love working here and love the hours and the people. I would recommend this company to anyone who is looking for a career in a different state.Excellent company to work for, professional environment, good benefits. Logistics operations were relocated to their headquarters in New York.Great Canon. Tell you what you need to do to achieve goals. Pay is the only reason why I am wanting to leave but benefits such as health are very good. Atmosphere is nice. Everyone is nice.Do not apply unless you ""NEED"" a job. There is no room for advancement. They do not pay well. Their vacation is horrible. Management does not communicate with employees. The benefits are not good either stay away from this company.there are opportunities to advance quickly with this company and the employees are a little spoiled with a cafe and gym in the building plus a masseuse that comes every other month. management and co-workers were easy to get along with. the biggest con for me is the work, I didn't perform well in a call center environment and there's a lot of phrases that the company wants employees to use on a call and will penalize employees who does not use them. also few bathroom breaks allowed.Good people to work with. You answer incoming calls from customers all day, so of course you will face the basic downsides of working at a call center.  Other than that, they will train you, have good benefits, and it is very hard to get hired from there.  Sometimes it feels good to help customers out, other times it is hard to deal with them.  Management is good. The raises are not that much, but they do give them to you every year.If your desperate and need the job then go for it. Plenty good people there.If you have a family to support then the wage is under the family goal. Unless managers get way more but I dont think its all that much. A lot have stayed and a lot have gone that I knew. This is either family or dont have. Dont forget floor compliance's as with every other call center your gauged more on a minute than how well you kept a customer. If your day consist of you having to do family doctor visits, or lets just say important rolls outside the job. If you explain it to HR they give you some room to do so with good cause. A + for Canon there. Everyone is great to work with and management are not really to blame. They are hovered everyday about someone or changing something.Canon is a great company with a household name in the technology industry.  Good compensation package.  Salary and Commission.Instructed employee's and temp staff of daily needs. Worked with NY for required work and completion dates. Processed all reports including all contact with temp agencies time keeping and payroll information. Worked with packaging venders to create new packaging when needed for projects. Created a Rebox Department and this saves millions of dollars each year as this process is now in the VA facility. Hardest part of job was getting enough temps to complete job requirements to meet all required completion and ship dates. Fun part was designing my own floor plans and stations to run projects.Over all great but top management direction not always clear and decision making can take a long time. Mixed culture environment great but at times causes conflict in the way of business processes.Working at Canon USA is working for a Japanese company.  The culture is evident and it is difficult to navigate.  80% of the work is done by 20% of the employees.  If you work hard and do good, your reward is more work.  If you do nothing and make mistakes, you will just be given less responsibility but these people remain at the company.  I have had friends ask for referrals and I pushed them in the opposite direction.Not a very progressive corporate culture for a company with technology at its core.Canon is a place where you will meet a great number of people from different cultures.  They are a strong technology company but could improve on how their management mentor's people in developing to become successful.- 9-5 job- I have learned a lot of useful skill with Exel and PowerPoint. I have learned to corporate with disatified customers. Pro multitasker. - Overall corporate management is poor. I got along well with my supervisor and boss.- Co-workers are friendly.- The hardest part of my job are the busy season (during the gov't fiscal year)- The most enjoyable part of my job is completeing a task that I could file away and move on from.The job was great.  My favorite job I have ever had as far as the work day goes.  Your day is busy but you they make sure you take your breaks and the day goes by so fast because of it being busy.  A typical day consists of processing lots of packages to deliver to VISA employees as you work at a Visa office that has thousands of VISA employees.

618,3671.0,Image Scientist–Modeling & Simulation,Harris Corporation,3.7,244.0,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Harris Corporation. The management and overall environment are fantastic. My favorite part of the job is the people with which I work.Harris has some of the best technology going. Great for engineers.In my dept the older workers were not considered when applying for positions.Jobs were given to younger candidates and young females. Thought it was a fluke at first but after five positions were slanted to much younger less experienced candidates, contractors and Coops.  Frequently the requisition would be changed to fit the younger candidate.Focus is on education and not on experience.  Only the chosen ones are given opportunities for promotion (pre-selected by management).  Environment is cold and distant.  There is a lack of focus on a team culture.  Job security is non-existent.  Management continues to reduce employee benefits and increase individuals personal expenses for healthcare and other benefits.In a nutshell, that's it - good pay, great people (the best) but absolutely no loyalty or job security. The hiring swells followed by hiring freezes and layoffs, followed by more swells, it's all pretty unnerving and disruptive. It's nice to know my team appreciates the hard work and overtime, if only upper management could do the same - their decisions to outsource key pieces of our product make it sometimes impossible to deliver quality.I enjoyed working for Harris for the time that I did, but I was unfortunately laid off due to a contract being cancelled on the government side. Therefore everyone who was working on that project was let go. This was also during the recession so I feel that contributed to it. I would still work there again if I got the chance, they are very good.A typical day starts with a good cup of coffee, logging in to the system to get to work. I learned that using email to communicate with internal and external customers is a great tool in getting resolutions.   My manager relied on my ability as a fast learner, to work independent. Good friends with co-workers.From my experience, the company seems to care about keeping their employees happy. The work culture is very friendly and open, they encourage new hires to contribute from the start. Managements was willing to listen to any suggestions people had on making improvements. Overall, I would recommend working for this companyThe company is very well establish in few market niches such as Weather Satellites, Air-Traffic systems, and moderate IT systems.IT was challenging to innovate due to the long time retention of certain cultured management, who they were set in their own way.Very good place to begin your career. There are numerous opportunities for personal grown and good benefits. Typical work week is a 9/80, 4/10, or 5/40 schedule and usually have the weekends and nights off. Its an engineering company so to get in the door, usually a degree is required.Facilities  does not have a typical day, everything is different  everyday. My managers were awesome and they made you feel like a member of the team.I loved my time working for Harris Corporation.  I was giving the opportunity to succeed through hard work.  In my last role, I managed 20+ government networks security compliance.  I enjoyed interpreting government policies and implementing that guidance to the network configuration.I truly enjoyed my position at Harris.  I enjoyed the interaction and providing immediate support to the quality assurance group, supervisors, mechanical/electrical engineering, procurement, scheduling, product analysis lab, production floor associates, assemblers, testers, and troubleshooters.Overall, the job was perfect except the relocation to New York was not a preferred choice.I met so many good people at Harris corp. different learning opportunities are provided. great team and leadership. I would recommend it to other people.They are the better paying companies in the area, but short lived when they downsize.  They treat managment with high regards and do not respect the lower paying employees.Used to be a decent place to work.  What they lacked in pay scale they made up for in benefits.  Since they switched insurance companies they no long can justify the poor pay scale.This was my first job on the East Coast of the US (which I took a big pay-cut for, but was told it was worth it)... I nearly moved right back out West. I stayed for 8 or 9 months, tried to give it the ""benefit of the doubt"", but management was entirely incompetent. Having been in this field for over ten years, I have picked up a few tips and tricks... Made some suggestions to management that would help the whole of Harris, resolving issues before people even called in, and I was SCOLDED for this. Their reasoning was that ""we need those phone calls""... that's right-- they are more interested in job security than they are resolving issues.Tip for management-- if your entire job can be replaced by a batch file and a spreadsheet, you are IRRELEVANT. Go back to school.ProsMost of the employees are highly talented and dedicated and work to meet the needs of the customer. Harris provides an environment where people can see the impact of the work they do as most projects are small-medium sized programs and each team member plays an important role. For the employees that have not yet lost their 9/80 work week, this provides a nice work/life balance.ConsThe corporate focus has shifted away from the customer and is overwhelmingly fixated on cost cutting. The and the primary means for achieving this objective is reducing labor costs through layoffs of senior personnel, cutting salaries and reducing benefits. Benefits have declined sharply in recent years. There is a great distrust of executive management and morale is very low.Never hire people fully on and the projects never last as expected always trying find work pay is ok this not a job or a careerEven as a full time employee i didn't start with benefit's because i was considered a ""job shopper"" which i was hired and paid by an another company where they were paid say 20 an hour for me and only paid me 15 an hour. once a spot opened in Harris itself i could be accepted or not which normally takes a year.Harris is a great place to work. It re-introduced unlimited paid time off program, which is one of the most coveted employee benefits. The rest is fairly standard with the corporate culture.if you find yourself employed in this company don't let this job go! you can actually support your family with these wages!","10,000+",Washington,Herndon,VA,2016-11-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/eb80943d-74f3-4f3c-b57b-41bc50549497?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=33,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

687,3740.0,Mathematician / Statistician,ECS Federal,3.9,15.0,"The company is good but you do not receive a raise and the only way to receive a higher salary is to get a higher paying position....only theres no room for advancement to a higher paying position...pretty much stuck.Great location, great group of people to work with. Continuous opportunities for growth. Excellent pay and benefits.m Management is very knowledgeable and friendly.ECS is a great company to work for. Management is very understanding of balancing your personal and work life. Only cons with ECS is the compensation and job advancement. The salary is not adequate to your job responsibilities.Management is supportive while we work off site with the Goverment client. Upper management makes everyone feel like they are part of the team.The company is a great company to work for they are really understanding and it is a very open environment. Great coworkers for the most part. My supervisor was great just wish it was a little more money.Working with ECS provides us the ability to provide real-time support to ongoing military operations around the globe. By supporting U.S. Army efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, or training and validating Field Support Teams prior to deployment, our work is relevant and necessary.I have been working with ECS for around 1 year now and feel they are a great company to work for. ECS Federal is a good company to work for, very diverse both in employees they hire and in job opportunities.ECS is your typical mid-sized consulting firm. Unless you work at the main office, you will more than likely be one amongst the many faceless minions. There's not much room for advancement, and the benefits are pretty lacking. The latter wasn't always the case, but beware: health insurance is now based on a defined benefit structure rather than a defined contribution, and to get a decent plan, you will have to shell out $$$$The helpdesk is a great entry level job into the IT world. Starting with tier 1, employees deal with different applications and work to help the customer solve their issues or escalate the ticket up for further assistance.Working as a government contractor I get to see the other side of the federal work coin. Where the brunt of the effort is focused and needed. As a contractor I do nearly all the same tasks as my government counterparts, but with the added incentive of knowing inaction or complacency can get me removed. The change of pace, the pressure to perform, has done more for me in terms of desire to improve than my years in government service. Best part is I am allowed to work with whomever I choose on the contract. I can surround myself with equally motivated co-workers from both the contract and our government peers. Allowing me to surround myself with the best people on both sides.On par with other contracting/consulting firms; not better or worse than others for which I've worked. Compensation and benefits similar to competitors.The constant churning of responsibilities and management expectations make this a difficult place to be. Add to the fact that you never know if/when a restructuring will take place and leave you unemployed!ECS is a great place work. The company management are involved in work and personal aspects of the employees. The work is interesting and they encourage employee growth.Daily challenges understand priority and workflow. Managers not empowered to set or establish priority and timelines. Constantly changing priorities. Do it because I said to attitude. Limited appreciation for individual experience and input.",,Washington,Arlington,VA,2016-09-27T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/765a1546-4d00-480e-8b6e-1f7e88e67096?mescoid=1500150001001&jobPosition=32,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

792,3845.0,Statistician,Serco Inc.,3.6,1700.0,"A typical day is starting out with a team meeting. Then we get our priorities for the day. Sometimes the priorities change throughout the day. We setup our computers for the work stream we are working and then we start. Our days consist of processing applications for the Affordable Care Act. During the process we call consumers for information so that we can successfully process their applications. What we learn is customer service and problem solving. The goal is to help the consumer. I like working with my co-workers. We help each other with questions and where to look for guidance in our work instructions. We get along very well and we treat each other like family. The management team is easy to work for. They are easy to approach and discuss the tasks we are working and they listen. The hardest part of the job is all the changes that take place. Most enjoyable is helping the consumer and the team I work on.I don't have a long review about this company at the moment.I ask that you do your research before you work for this company.Be upfront about what you want as far working there and be prepared for changes every 2 minutes and is forced to adapt to those changes without error in the work.If you are working on a contract for Serco providing good services, the organization truly does not care about your efforts or contributions. They truly only cared about the profits you were working for.not something to be able to advance opportunities, unfair management, hours were not something i agreed to. was a good experience in data entry. overall an ok jobworked with serco in the Colorado springs area for some time and after what ive seen there I would not recommend this company at all, the management that oversees that locations project is very unfair and biased. the project manager will smile in your face then stab you in the back - very spineless. if you do choose to work there negotiate your pay prior to hiring on because that is all the pay you will get. they post job openings for higher mechanics solely because they have to and you can apply and talk to them till your blue in the face but they normally already have their mind made up. keep in mind that this is contract work and they have already peaked. they are on the downhill now and wouldn't be surprised if the didn't get the chance to bid again due to the ruffling of feathers with the city. BEWARE!!!The job was a piece of cake, anyone could do it.  The pay is solid, with your insurance being paid for by the company (as a single person, family costs more).  The hardest part of the job is trying to not pull your hair out at the amount of archaic procedures being used.  It's like the higher-ups (on-site, and off-site) have no idea how to utilize modern technology. The reporting is atrocious, using something called ProgramVision to get pre-made reports created by people that have clearly never worked with data before.  No standardization on anything.  You have different rules and procedures for tasks that are essentially the same.  Too many jack of all trades, masters of none.If you can make yourself numb and sit for 8 hours, this job is not terrible.The upper management never seemed to care about what was going on in your life outside of work. There was one time a girl had a seizure while AT work and the time counted against her when they were the ones that called the ambulance and she was taken to the hospital and admitted. It used to be, if you had a doctors note the time would not count against you. Then it changed to even with a doctors note, they counted the time against you if you didn't have the PTO to cover.work hard stay motivated meet your goals. show up on time. stay sharp and focused to reduce errors. I loved the hours coworkers and management. Attendance and quality is the overall kicker.Lots of favoritism. Personal life is no concern of leads. And management. No encouragement. Demoralizing attitude of leads and PM.Working as an analyst at Serco is not a tedious job, the work load expected is highly achievable. Guidance is minimal which works well if you're a problem solver or like puzzles.  Environment is friendly and clean.The people are fun to work with but health benefits cost way to much. There is always place to move up in the company. Work life and personal life is sometimes hard to balance. I enjoy all of my job no matter if the consumer may yell at me or updates on the systems don't happen as fast as you think they should.A typical day was going through DMI's and I learned a lot about data entry. Great place to work. Management and the co workers are absolutely great.Great program to support soldiers and their families.Disgruntled co-workers due to poor compensation. Position requires a Masters degree but pays like a high school dropout. Contractor gets the money not the employees that work for them.The job was easy and the pay was decent. It would have been nice to get a raise though but same pay after almost three years. Insurance was decent. Time off after one year but management could care less if you take a day off without pay here and there. Trouble was, there was only two of us so taking off work was a hassle especially when the office was swamped with customers. Our direct manager was decently available to contact but his boss was a nightmare. She came out for a visit and let's just say 2 weeks later I put in my notice. Horrible manager. It's sad that she's been with the company for so long and openly jokes about how many she's scared away. Also I might add that the ""part-time"" position was a complete waste and they didn't seem to be able to hire anyone competent to do the job. I was the ""Site Representative"" which basically meant the office tattletale. I would say supervisor but they made it clear I had no authority but they wanted me to rat the others out for being late, etc. Not the worst job I've had, but definitely not a company you can build a career with.Passionate and well-qualified Professional Career Counselor experienced in briefing and counseling Soldiers in all stages of their transition. Excels in implementing professional development plans for transitioning Soldiers who aim to enter the workforce upon separation. Adept at coaching Soldiers through roadblocks in their transition identifying opportunities for training and professional development.Workedd as a General Clerk 11, job was okay training has improved, enjoyed co workers and learned how Health insurance works. You have to be able to sit for extended periods of time. Its a Nice place to work.I have worked for three years at Serco. I have enjoyed it very much. The managers are wonderful to work with and will do anything to help you succeed.  The co-workers are pleasant and work great together. We work daily with each other and there is never a day you wont need them. The people I have worked with have been the most enjoyable part of the job.Work life balance was not very good, management was excellent, and supervisors were very understanding. People are great. Loved it just hated sitting for 8hrs not doing anything on daysEnjoyed the aspect of helping out members of the community in need of employment.  Allowed freedom to create the employer base needed to find appropriate job opportunities.  Great manager and co-workers.Serco had numerous contracts and was always looking to move professionals around if they were unsatisfied with their current position.  Strong in program management and acquisition of products and services for the governmentNo work or hardly any... the management cares very little if at all for the employees ..cant have a personal life or prodfessinal one here at the wentzville location.","10,000+",Washington,Springfield,VA,2016-09-13T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/b9eba0b2-d097-4d90-9968-8640abdc9954?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=32,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I was getting a steady workflow and received praise several times for the work that I was doing.  Then, things started to slow down and I was asked to help with documentation.  During this time morale started to sink within the company as many people were finding work elsewhere.  Once the documents were finished, I was once again place on my original assignment, but the workflow and praise had changed.  There were several times that no work was available.  During my last 2 months, I was once again moved to another project.  I took over for an engineer that left the company, and was handed a project that had very little information associated with it.  I then had to figure out what was going on, as the time went along, I received no direction or feedback from the project manager.I really enjoyed working for Cubic.  The Senior Management Team was very receptive to 'thinking out-of-the box' always encouraging new ideas and productive ways to change or streamline various business practices.The call center has a great Manager, but lower management is stuck in Junior High School.

Was promised to have weekends off during the hiring process and interview, but was told that I had to choose a weekend day to work, as ""It's a requirement"" for the position. And there is very, very little room for advancement in this office.There is a call time limit (approx 5 mins per call) and that is nearly impossible due to the systems that are provided. The computers are not PCs, but simply one giant connected system that runs so slow, that the first 3 minutes of the call is just waiting for the customer's information to pull up.Unless you are desperate for a job, I would not recommend this call center.This company is not a good company. Instead of interviewing the workers for work, it feels as tho you are being interrogated by an FBI agent. This company really needs to find someone better to represent them. I feel as tho the guy in charge has ran off or scared off potentially good workers.This is a great company to work for. Excellent benefits, decent pay, and they do a lot for the employees (free company picnic and Christmas party). But there is little room for advancement and some of the management is questionable.Great company as a whole that has a definite grasp on what a customer wants and needs when it comes to a system that can benefit the public in their travels using public transportation.Cubic is a great place to work.  People are friendly, things run fairly smoothly, and the work in itself is very stress free.  The work environment is clean and quiet, with no need for any safety equipment other than ESD protection.Cubic also abuses the temporary staffing services more than any company I've ever known of.  In my time working for Cubic I was promoted two times and given very high marks on my reviews for workmanship.  Setup stations and trained workers on various tasks which I also created training materials for them to follow.  I applied for every full time position available at Cubic for 2.5 years and never once received even an interview.  If you aren't on a personal level with management here you will never get hired.  During my time working here and getting to know most of the long time employees, they all informed me on several occasions that the job postings are solely for show.  Some workers have been at this facility for 5-6 years as temporary workers.  I have several certifications and many years IT experience, yet was never considered for jobs I was more qualified to do than what I was doing.In short, unless you're going to work in the offices or know the upper management personally I wouldn't recommend working for Cubic.  This is not a place to start a career as you will most likely be a temporary worker for the rest of your life.  I was hoping to make a career at Cubic as I loved working for the company for a long time, but eventually being abused and underpaid as a temporary worker gets old.  If you want a throw-away job work here, otherwise  more... move on.  lessGreat job for veterans/retirees from the military with experience with working at NTC. For non-salary positions its typically an 8 hour work day and management is willing to work with you if you need time off.Co-workers were fantastic, a great place to be if you really want to work and get things done. It has a great environment, a great building, and a great learning experience as an intern.Currently, I am working for Cubic Transportation Systems in the area of Financial and Transaction Processing Management for Clipper Card. We manage the day-to-day operations of the clearing and settlement functions, as well as reconciliation of ACH daily transfers between financial institutions, participating operators, and other vendors. Typical day at work consists of cross-training, majority of reconciling and clearing our GL accounts and research. A lot of our process are manual and very tedious due to system enhancements and reports currently not being automated. I have built strong relationships with my colleagues and are always helpful as we consider ourselves ONE TEAM. When we are not hectic with schedules, we set up fun events for everyone to enjoy.Interesting business domain.Opportunity to work with embedded development, if you're into it.Too many non-technical managers.This is a good place to work. I worked with a lot of great people. I did learn a lot working  here but the travel in the department I was in was very extensive.I worked with the company for about 3 years in the call center. Management had their favorites. My manager had her bulldog that would watch your every move. If you didn't bring food or dress up for the monthly potlucks you were an outsider. Training was lacking and the systems that we worked on was very slow. They wanted us on and off the phone in 5 mins but you done good to get the customers account researched in 5 mins.Your bathroom breaks were timed and you will be talked to if you go to the bathroom to much. It is very micromanaged.Cubic was a good place to have worked.  Management expects a lot from the employee, but they gave a sufficient amount of time for one to learn and hone their skills. At Cubic, I wore several different hats of responsibility and I was afforded both time and training to succeed in each of my roles.  Cubic manufactures revenue collection systems geared at mass transit systems throughout the world.  No two systems are the same as the customers requirements vary from location to location.  This creates individualized requirements for each product built and shipped which leads to multiple customer requirement profiles.  In my opinion, this is both the hardest and most enjoyable part of the job as every item has specific needs, whether it be packaging, documentation, specialized transportation or a chain of advanced notifications/authorizations prior to shipment.  Along with good communication between departments, the employees at Cubic were great to work with.  There was a real team atmosphere among all departments.If you are getting out of the military and looking for a slow transition back into the civilian world this is a great job! Unfortunately there is no room for growth and job security is very low. With that being said, Cubic Defense Applications is a great company with great benefits.Upper management is nowhere to be seen, ever. My program manager is great, but above that it's a crapshoot. Benefits are terrible, and got worse with ObamaCare. Health insurance costs are ridiculous. Good pay, good pto.No room for growth.Worked  as  interpreter, adviser, for US Army ( Special Forces )for overseas culture.  ..............Enjoyed my time there. Would go back in a second. Free coffee.I think this company was a great company to work for. I really hated when it moved all the jobs to Mexico. My co worker was helpful and nice to work with. Management doors was always open no matter what the problem.Great company to work for. The people are what make the company.A fulfilling position, adding real time training with the army units, before they deploy.My position is to have contact with the rotational units, presenting a series of problems for them to resolve, using the training and protocols they have already used.Most recently, I have portrayed a Charity Relief Organisation, my dealings with the unit produce a conflict of interest for them between the mission and their own humanitarian relief.My position requires a lot of research in order to produce informed and coherent arguments and reports when meeting the civil affairs teams.Most of what I do is free play, not scripted. I find this interesting as often I have to keep my wits about me and think on my feet as the meetings progress, for better or worse.I take a lot of pride and job satisfaction in creating the same problems that they are likely to face on deployment, so that the troops will not make the same mistakes and come home safely.","5,001 to 10,000",Washington,Herndon,VA,2016-09-12T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/2f3634d6-e599-45ea-8bcd-eba1eaf5ebd7?mescoid=1500140001001&jobPosition=33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

They start to fight and hit on you.At first i really thought this company was a wonderful company to work for and after being here for a year and learning the ropes of and moving on up i got fired with no evidence for something i did not do. A lawsuit makes sense for this company and the p&o manager at the victorville site has no clue in how to run the hiring and firing department! Terrible place to work forWalked through out the plant hourly checking product to make sure it was in safety and quality specifications. Insured that our product was tested every hour to give the customers and company a log of the product and every test performed on the product. Monitored other associates on safety and quality in the manufacturing process.The management needs a reboot. Yelling at your employees doesn't make them want to work, let alone work for you. They demand to be respected but don't respect their employees.At Mars I was shipping and packing. I liked the job due to its pay. I really want a warehouse Job again. It was a good experience to me and it showed me a lot.Mars is a fast paced business with plenty of opportunities. You can succeed if you need little direction, are a team player, hard worker, welcome the company values.The people and management was very nice and helpful. I learned everything about my tasks and ways to reach the production number in according time within a couple days on the job. I've worked in groups from 2-4 people and we were able to accomplish them as a team every day on the job. The most enjoyable part was getting the production done and getting a head start on the next shifts production. That allowed them to acknowledge how hard we worked the previous shift. There wasn't any hard part of the job, I got exactly what ii signed up for and learned a lot. I was satisfied in every aspect.Working at mars keeps you busy and on your feet never a down time you stand on an assembly line which ever one you are assigned to for that day and you handle all the candy for that lineA work day began by first working the current list of patients with outstanding medical fees. I would call all listed phone numbers associated with the patient and attempt to make contact with them. Once contact was made, I would interview the patient and see if they qualified for any state or federal run assistance programs, such as Medicaid or SSI/SSDA. If they were found eligible and willing to accept my help, I would then either mail or hand-deliver our authorized representative packets to them and have them complete them. I would then take the information gathered and apply that patient for medicaid and/or SSI/SSDA (depending on eligibility). If the patient was approved I would then hand over the account to my supervisor, who would then bill the account to medicaid and the outstanding fees, or at least a portion of them, would be paid. If a patient was found ineligible or was denied coverage, the account would be given back to the hospital and a financial aid application was sent to the patient for completion. In this job I learned excellent customer service skills and developed confidence in talking to new people in a cold call scenario. I also learned how to utilize the hospital documentation program, EPIC. My direct supervisor was a dedicated woman, and was very diligent in her dealings with patients and the hospital alike. Our team was small (only 3 people towards the end of the contract) but she still managed to guide us to the goal of saving the hospital over one million dollars in derelict medical payments over the course of about 4 years. I found the hardest part  more... of the job to be fighting with the state agencies, such as Job and Family Services, for approval for the patient's medicaid cases. Often times the patient would not be able to provide all verification's in time and we would require more to get everything JFS needed to make a decision. I would say the best part of the job was the ability and necessity to  travel to patient's listed address, in order make contact or secure AR packets. This allowed me to meet a diverse mix of people, most of which were very kind and appreciative.  lessThe money is not worth the headache or never having time off, the feeling of being disposable at any time. You are pretty much overworked and under appreciated. Management is despicable. Workers are lazy and if you are a good worker, you are the 1st to be reprimanded. No set schedule because something is always changing. Very inconvenient for anybody to deal with especially if you have a family or other events. Do not waste your time applying. Save yourself the trouble and headache.What I like about Mars, Inc. is that it is a family-owned company and the family is very involved in the growth of the business.A typical day at work is giving your all and management not doing anything, ESPECIALLY TOP MANAGEMENT. No support at all and that's when certain leaders decide to show up! Good employees are looked down upon when pointing out issues with the stores/company and if you reach out to higher ups that are not in your store, you can guarantee your name is at the top of the ""hit list"". Instead of fixing issues management, even P&O, does whatever they can to sweep the problem under the rug, even if that means getting rid of you. Good managers there are afraid to speak up about issues because they fear for their jobs. The retail side of this company is untrustworthy and should NOT be considered for employment. Associates on the floor just get looked at for mistakes.The amount of BS you endure at this job for the amount of pay is NOT WORTH IT. STAY AWAY FROM MARS RETAIL!! For your own health and sanity!After working in the public sector, it has been so REFRESHING to work for Mars where decisions are made driven by the 5 principles: Quality, Responsibility, Efficiency,Mutuality, Freedom.  I honestly didn't believe this when I first joined and thought it was just HR talk but I have seen this come to life on a daily basis.  Our management team is accessible and the broader team respects one another. We make recommendations based on the long term as opposed to short term earnings, and in the Pet division the mantra is ""Dog and Cat first.""  We make great products that improve the pets lives.I love being able to bring my dog to work with me and love being surrounded by others with a passion for their pets.  We also have several therapy puppies that are being trained by colleagues- what is better than having a constant stream of puppies at the office to make you feel good about coming in?If you're an individual looking for a challenge and want to grow within a short period of time and enjoys multitasking, stop looking elsewhere, this is the right place for you!good place to work. long drive for me. good people to work with. good management. great product everyone loves gum. recommended place to work.Help desk environment with responsibilities ranging from hardware resets, to maintaining an inbound call queue, while also supporting walk-up assistance.Management full of BS and need more training, disappointing and Georgia laws sucks, the job easy, not hard, pay very good. Enjoy my coworkers!Mar's as a company may be a good place to work on the whole,But the Retail division is totally disfunctional and a horrible place to work.Management is primarily through intimidation and dictation. The Bosses are Bullies!   People are treated as drones and not appreciated.  Talent is ignored and not rewardedThe management, from the Corporate Office in New Jersey all the way down to the store level gives lip service to the principals of the company but do not uphold or live those principals.There is no opportunity for advancement.  Mar's prefers to recruit from outside the company rather than promote valuable talented people from the inside.Mar's is a private company and thereby writes their own rules.I would NOT recommend Mar's Retail as a place to work at ANY level.Overall they are a good company with good work life balance.  Excellent work facilities and collaborative.  fast paced environmentOverall it is a great place to work. Sometimes it can get demanding, but I suppose that can occur anywhere you work. I would recommend anyone to go and work for Mars. You can bring your dog to work with you. Fitness center in the building.The position was really good I had a great time working for this company.

Left in dark concerning direction of the company and future growth. Experiencing extreme growing pains as the company moves from small to large. Corporate staff is more focused on the bureaucratic ways of the olden times instead of setting DEI apart and developing talent. Micromanagement runs rampant. Was once run as a family oriented business but those at the helm are choking the organizational culture, there is little left. There is no advocate for the employee.  Work-life balance non-existent.The company has serious issues with compensating employees for work done outside of your job description. You are constantly being asked to perform duties that don't pertain to your job description and when you inquire about compensation, you are continuously given the runaround. They are quickly developing a negative image in the contracting world because of their lack of structure and knowledge. I understand that companies go through growing pains, but there is a point in which things become ridiculous. Also some individuals are underpaid, while others are overpaid.The culture of this company is antiquated with inflated egos poorly managing the staff. I question their ability to obtain or maintain government contracts. There is poor knowledge of the contracting world among management and compensation and business etiquette is poor. This is a horrible place to work and I strongly advise anyone applying for a job here to find a more established business.They took good care of me and the benefits were awesome.  They went to bat for me when negotiating my pay.  They offer a really competitive 401K plan and were willing to pay for me to attend Cisco Live in San Diego, CA.

Development included the utilization of a wide range of development tools including the integration of the Telelogic Tau UML modeling tool, DOORS requirements management tool and the DocExpress automated documentation toolA typical day at Telephonics Corporation is very high paced from the moment you walk in the door. I have learned how to complete projects with team work. They are big on working with teams and having representation from all departments.  Management has changed recently so, I cannot comment. My coworkers were wonderful, I have gained family working there.  Hardest part of the job was a new operating system that was set up, they were still working out the bugs.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the many programs we completed successfully for the military.co-workers great. engineers top notch. job work/life balance stressfulThis is a company under great change.  The future is promising with the right management team.  Job security must improve for the best to be attracted to their team.I worked for Telephonics for less than 6 months and was relieved when I left. My management in subcontracts procurement was abusive to vendors, fellow employees and other members of the teams when we visited suppliers. The lack of ethical trealment of suppliers and the use of them as ""red herrings"" and ""stalking horses"" during proposal preparation was astonishing in its arrogance.I have a strong procurement background but had been away from aerospace for a while before working for Telephonics and was treated like a rank beginner. I was also treated as if if everything I said was a lie that had to be challenged. They told me they thought I lied during the app. process because after starting I could not travel due to their requirement that employees pay for their own travel and then seek reimbursement; I had had credit problems and did not have credit cards to be able to travel with.All in all, when compared to other world class aerospace companies like the former Grumman Aerospace, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Boeing, et al, Telephonics is a ""bush league"" third tier wannabe. Stay away, stay far, far away.Too much attention is spent on processes and procedures and insufficient time product/program success.Great manager and co-workers. I learned about the fabrication of printed circuit boards and their integration into electronic systems.Don't work here... H.R. and management don't care about anyone's feelings or needs. USELESS.I was fotunate to have worked with a great people and a wonderful staff while I was at Telephonics.High Workload, Rigorous Work Environment with short completion timelines & turn-around exectations, often combined with unexpected requirements & complications..I worked there four years and was given a good review in the first year.Then everything went down hill from there,You are always under extreme pressure.Their internal systems are difficult to work with due to certain constraints.Because of the type of industry it is,you are under the constant threat of layoff.The management I worked under was verbally abusive and did not want to understand the compexities of issues.The management violated the Company Code of Ethics,When this was brought to Human Resources it was basically blown off.Human Resources always supports Managements positions 99.9% of the time regarding employee performance.In my case and again this is my view,my management fabricated issuses against me in order to make it easier to be put in the layoff pool.I had 34 years experience in my field.In Nov 2011 I was let go along with 25 others in the company.16 of the 25 people were 55 and older.That tells you something,Telephonics has allowed me to grow professionally and personally",,Washington,Columbia,MD,2016-07-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/4f192a84-19a7-4f7e-a43e-f33d48dc353b?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=35,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
