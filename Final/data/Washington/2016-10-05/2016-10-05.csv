444,3497.0,Geospatial Analyst,Cubic,3.9,36.0,"CUBIC is a good company to work for with the understanding that they a a bare bones type company willing to make any cut necessary to maintain or win the next contract. An example being cutting full time positions and making them part time on call. CUBIC also has a long history of hiring and promoting those they feel are loyal over those that are the best qualified. This leads to a mid level management tier that does not fully understand the Army requirements and forces lower level part timers to pick up the slack created.Job security is unfortunate with this company. Never plan buying a home if you depend solely on your own salary. You may start tomorrow and the next day you may be looking elsewhere. As for the rest, it is fun to work for. Many company/employee events.Prepared PCs and laptops in accordance with corporate standards for use in various business and engineering environments.  Installed various hardware(client and server) and software(OS and apps). Network setup for both LAN and WAN. Performed authorized custom installs when appropriate and assisted in conversions and updates. Performed workstation and LAN analytics to trouble-shoot and repair systems. Answered helpdesk phone to directly assist users with hardware/software requests and/or problems. Maintained and controlled the PC/laptop inventory.Scheduled and organized work load between first and third shifts. Assisted and supported other operators, team of two Data Center Operators. Established operator procedures and maintained/updated documentation. Served as the direct contact/laison for in-house and contracted support groups.Whole day workNo enjoymentOld style school.No Job security, boss always watches over your shoulders and very micro management.Very cutomer focused.  They believe in a good work/life balance. The management is in touch with the employees on a regular basis.A typical day at work included a lot of typing and paper work. We reviewed soldier's benefits and life insurance policy for soldier readiness processing, reintegration, and whenever they felt like coming in to update information. I made dog tags, I tried my hardest to make sure that one guys ex wife was off of his paperwork and that was probably the most difficult to deal with...angry people. But it was easy to calm them down. I really loved everyone I worked with.The Service desk offers a great environment and I am blessed to be part of such a great team that really takes care of each other. One of the down sides of the IT department is the advancement, most of the members of the service desk have been there for about 3-4 years, and the common trend is that employees have to move out to move up professionally. Since working with the company I have only seen the department hire out rather that promote within.I train US Army Soldiers in Military Vehicle Maintenance where we teach them what it's like to learn simple maintenance in the US Army.Seems like a good company, however, after running out of funds after only 5 months on a ""2-year"" contract, I can't make a fair assessment.A typical day was training soldiers in scenario's they man encounter when deploying. I learned some different languages, worked with people from other countries.Great place to work with high energy, extremely talented work force that strives for Customer Service. Goal oriented organization that allows employees the freedom to develop the programs they are responsible for in a positive environment. Challenging environment that develops employee abilities and strengths.Great company for advancement and learning experience. I enjoyed my work experience with this company. The most enjoyable part of the job was the learning experience.This is a good place to transition to if you are leaving the Army and are looking to supplement your retirementso it is a good fit.Worked outside everyday had very little office time just took care of what needed to be done mowing the grass using a variety of tools provided to me.I enjoyed my time with CUBIC and I felt that the management took very good care of their employees. The work I did was 9 to 5 and the vacation time was very fair. My coworkers were competent and reliable for the most part.The defined work hours are changed and there is no set, Day shift, mid shift or night shift however, at the end of every rotation your overtime hours convert to a 7 consecutive days off every month. The promotions are not always available unless you have a degree and even then there is not a whole lot of room for advancement. The work is good, the pay is decent, and if you are competent then the work environment is ideal. This is a great job for a recently retired from military or a starter job for someone that just got out of the military.Company management okay.  Challenging position. Workload very heavy for one person.These jobs were government contracts and throughout my whole resume' are basically the sameOutstanding working environment.  Leadership went extra mile to take care of subordinates.I enjoyed the job very much. It made me feel good helping evaluate and analyzing soldiers getting ready to deploy to a combat zone. Knowing what we were doing might save there life. Most of us in the office were retired Army so we all got along well. We all had that sense of urgency, for mission accomplishment. We had and met high standers every rotation. The hardest part of the job, it was considered part time only 58 hours every two weeks. At times during a rotation we would work 115 pulse hours per week. We would not get paid for the over time but were given short work week (days off) in lieu of. No body wanted to leave there full time positions so advancement was not happening. Being able to help soldiers was the most enjoyable part of the job.Trained soldiers in the use of weapons, communication equipment and tactical driving in milkitary vehicle. With the use of powerpoint I gave classes on the above mentioned. Ran and supervised the weapons ranges. The most enjoyable part of my job was training troops and making sure they had all the tools to make back home safe.",,Washington,Herndon,VA,2016-10-05T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/4d3a35e4-67bf-4468-b09a-a325bdc71802?mescoid=1500140001001&jobPosition=34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
