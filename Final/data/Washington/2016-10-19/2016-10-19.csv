269,3322.0,"Software Developer - GIS (Silver Spring, MD)","Wyle Laboratories, Inc.",3.9,35.0,"Great work environment and great for entry level IT. Not a lot of room for advancement unless you move over to the contract side. Several recent acquisitions.excellent place to work. worked there from Feb 2012 to Jul 2016.They treat the ex military very well there. Apply if you enjoy contract type work for Naval aircraft.Wyle Laboratories as a research group in acoustic no longer exists.  The company is out of business it was sold to a bunch of thieves that destroyed a great R&D group dedicated to acoustics.Wyle Labs is a hard working, get stuff done kind of contracting business. The department I worked in was fundamental and encouraging to see that places do shine in what they do!Wyle is overall a good company.  It's a typical contracting company.  With that being said, you're always dispensable.  The pay is so-so.Great Employer, Good benefits, Had fun working there. Had a great boss who made the job. All kinds of different products and testing.A typical day began with analyzing working aids and schedules to determine IT project deliverables due. This included managing and creating contracted IT deliverable reports due weekly, monthly, and quarterly; standard operating procedures (SOPs); and metrics. Overall, these documents numbered nearly 200 separate items which routinely needed editorial and formatting assistance. The position required coordination with other team members in person or through email communication. Company management was kept informed of progress and risk levels associated with late submission of documents/data from team members.To meet 508 compliance for documentation, Microsoft Word's Accessibility feature was studied and implemented.Strict organizational methodologies were necessary to ensure documentation successes for the customer.Unfortunately, I didn't feel like a part of a team. Management were sometimes unprofessional and non communication caused a delay with productivity.Very similar to my military experience. I served in the Marines with many of the people that I worked with at Wyle. Very flexible with military deployments and monthly military reserve requirements.Always trying to give their employees opportunities for growth and training. Paid very well and the culture was so much fun. I enjoyed coming to work each dayI was a part of a start-up operation and learned a lot about private industry following many years as a civil servant.  My skill set carried directly over from my govt service to this position and allowed me to be an asset to the management team.No direction and business process is non-existent. They do not provide work for you when your contract is up. Typical work day is not consistent and changes on an hourly basis.A typical day involved review of standardized documentation, so that didn't interest me anymore after awhile. I learned a lot about technology, which was great. Being a communications major, that wasn't something I was familiar with. Hardest part of the job was the management due to entire team being newly formed; however, it was good we were all hired around the same time. Most of my co-workers were the same age as me, so we made it a fun environment and socialized outside of work.Solid company to work for. Very professional work environment.  Flexible work hours. Weak benefits package.Enjoyed working on a new adventure for Wylie with  the Air Force.Lots of competitionMgrs hired friends and kept them safeNo training Co workers were not helpful at all to new hiresThe hardest part of the job was sharing an office with a disgruntled employeeThe best part of the job was the job itself and the Mgr before she retiredThe new Mgr took care of her ownLong days,coworkers were get to work with.Firing a 7 stage rocket held down by 4 inch diameter cables was awesome.Some folks with no HR, Supervisory Skills incharge, stressful supervisors, things going on against ethics- employee relations, etc rampant.  Supervisors engaged in coveringeach others backs.  Unprofessional.  HR not professional.   Alot of whether you were in the "" clicks"" or not.    Very unlike the larger companies who have an HR Departmentnot mingling and socializing outside work.In three years this company went from growth and multiple contracts to one contract from a customer whom they ignored. They followed that up with poor performance on the contract. On its way down.Some of the people are great and there are many interesting projects to become a part of.A typical day consisted of supporting manufacturing with test issues, improving existing test programs and writing new test programs.  This Wyle facility consisted of the merger of two companies and I learned that obtaining cooperation between the employees was no easy task.  Since I was new and my co-workers consisted of a blend of two companies, I was viewed as an outsider.  The hardest part of the job was getting employees to cooperate with one another.  Slowly, the employees began to work together, as a result of my efforts.",,Washington,Silver Spring,MD,2016-10-19T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/258e4e92-6c48-4d9b-bcc7-1295d4cece64?mescoid=1500140001001&jobPosition=34,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

441,3494.0,Physical Scientist,Ensco Inc,4.2,87.0,"While I was at ENSCO the corporate culture was all about fair play with the employees. I enjoyed my time, but our contract ended with the Government and we were not offered additional employment.One of the better positioned companies to ride out the offshore energy slump.  Clear expectations and a safety focused culture make it more safe than the ""old"" oilfield.Responsibility is the name of the game on an offshore drilling rig and platform, safety is key and when it is used properly it can make for a great workplace, I learned a lot about permitted jobs and how to work with a great team. The management is well versed in company policies and it shows by their safety records.Some days are okay, some days we get so busy that we only have little time to rest. Which is just normal in the industry. Being a Driller for more than 10 years but still learned more when I joined Ensco.The working environment is highly dependent upon the local rig/ship management, therefore, you can have a great team and poor management or vice-versa.Enjoyable work place , day by day challenge due client requirements Good place to learn and adapt to the fastest program change Satisfaction on goal achievmentsThe most enjoyable part of the job is working with a knowledgeable team and sharing new skills and ideas.   Typical days on the rig consist of scheduled preventative maintenance and repair in a safety oriented atmosphere, including pre job safety meetings and minimizing downtime on various diesel engines, hydraulics, pneumatics, pumps, gearboxes, reverse osmosis water purification systems, sewage treatment systems, air compressors and heat exchangers.   I have learned a lot from my supervisors and we are encouraged to do our part at improving industry safety standards by doing one task at a time and empowering everyone with stop working authority.I loved working offshore with but with the market down I must find something that's more reliable for my family! It was good money and good benefits. So with all that said I will stay with what ever I can get!I am a hard worker and strive to do my very best at obtaining the max potential and output at whatever I indulge in.  Very punctual and trustworthy. Company strived to provide workers with most and best knowledge to perform tasks at a very high level.This job required 12 hr days, 7 days a week for 21 days straight.Once aboard you were basically on the vessel for the required time of your hitch. There was always an under lying worry that should something happen at your home, or to a family member, your ability to get home should your presence be required.AMEC Paragon is a great place to work at, with great leadership.  Pros:Proven leadershipOpportunities to advance and learnCons: NoneWasnt a bad place to work, lack of communications, We built gear to gu under trucks for the purpose to test tarck layout and find problems and in-perfectionsworking 90 hour weeks paid off when i was working. being off for 14 days straight was nice. cooking for 200 men. Learned how to multitask.Roustabouts are usually responsible for cleaning, working basic machinery, scraping paint and repainting, loading and unloading heavy shipments and helping with any miscellaneous tasks that arise.The hardest part of the job is safety as well as the heat but everything must be triple check because in the blink of an eye anything can happen if equipment is not check right or loads or not rigged right.Management is the crane operator as well as the deck foreman they're my boss and any job tasks that we take on they must approve of it and see if need a (JSA) Job Safety Analysis.The most enjoyable part about offshore is they make it feel like home off the clock with the physical activities and social parts.Installed, maintained, and repaired electronic controls for robotic drilling equipment, diesel engines, automated Voyage Management System, and internal/external communications equipment.Ensco is not a bad company to work for, but due the current market situation they have had to stack ships and lay off a large amount of employees.Wonderful place to work with nice employees and tons of resources for training and assistance.  Management is very approachable and tries hard to interact with all employees with occasional town halls, ""pipeline to President"" forums etc.I enjoyed my time at ENSCO very much so. It was on a 14\14 day schedule. I would give anything to go back to this job. but with the slow down in the oil industry I cant.Enjoyed working rotational shift. After spending a long period of time working hard, the quality time off to spend at home or travel is rewarding.Great motivating supervisors to work for. The company provides some of the best training for my career. The hardest part of the job for me was being away from family weeks at a time.They merged with Pegasus and is now UniversalPegasus. and is now a different company. Before the merger it was a good place to work. I learned lot about pipeline mapping and went from board draftsman to AutoCAD designer.",,Washington,Springfield,VA,2016-10-19T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/281b118a-a0a6-44b0-b912-123eb41ddcee?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=31,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
