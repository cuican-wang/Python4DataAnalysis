865,3918.0,Research Scientist,Telephonics Corporation,3.1,12.0,"Design of object-oriented embedded system software for a real-time communications system. Brought system from concept through initialrequirements and UML object oriented modeling, coding, unit test, integration and system test. Rehosted software from Jovial to C++ executing under VxWorks.  Development included the utilization of a wide range of development tools including the integration of the Telelogic Tau UML modeling tool, DOORS requirements management tool and the DocExpress automated documentation toolA typical day at Telephonics Corporation is very high paced from the moment you walk in the door. I have learned how to complete projects with team work. They are big on working with teams and having representation from all departments.  Management has changed recently so, I cannot comment. My coworkers were wonderful, I have gained family working there.  Hardest part of the job was a new operating system that was set up, they were still working out the bugs.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the many programs we completed successfully for the military.co-workers great. engineers top notch. job work/life balance stressfulThis is a company under great change.  The future is promising with the right management team.  Job security must improve for the best to be attracted to their team.I worked for Telephonics for less than 6 months and was relieved when I left. My management in subcontracts procurement was abusive to vendors, fellow employees and other members of the teams when we visited suppliers. The lack of ethical trealment of suppliers and the use of them as ""red herrings"" and ""stalking horses"" during proposal preparation was astonishing in its arrogance.I have a strong procurement background but had been away from aerospace for a while before working for Telephonics and was treated like a rank beginner. I was also treated as if if everything I said was a lie that had to be challenged. They told me they thought I lied during the app. process because after starting I could not travel due to their requirement that employees pay for their own travel and then seek reimbursement; I had had credit problems and did not have credit cards to be able to travel with.All in all, when compared to other world class aerospace companies like the former Grumman Aerospace, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Boeing, et al, Telephonics is a ""bush league"" third tier wannabe. Stay away, stay far, far away.Too much attention is spent on processes and procedures and insufficient time product/program success.Great manager and co-workers. I learned about the fabrication of printed circuit boards and their integration into electronic systems.Don't work here... H.R. and management don't care about anyone's feelings or needs. USELESS.I was fotunate to have worked with a great people and a wonderful staff while I was at Telephonics.High Workload, Rigorous Work Environment with short completion timelines & turn-around exectations, often combined with unexpected requirements & complications..I worked there four years and was given a good review in the first year.Then everything went down hill from there,You are always under extreme pressure.Their internal systems are difficult to work with due to certain constraints.Because of the type of industry it is,you are under the constant threat of layoff.The management I worked under was verbally abusive and did not want to understand the compexities of issues.The management violated the Company Code of Ethics,When this was brought to Human Resources it was basically blown off.Human Resources always supports Managements positions 99.9% of the time regarding employee performance.In my case and again this is my view,my management fabricated issuses against me in order to make it easier to be put in the layoff pool.I had 34 years experience in my field.In Nov 2011 I was let go along with 25 others in the company.16 of the 25 people were 55 and older.That tells you something,Telephonics has allowed me to grow professionally and personally",,Washington,Columbia,MD,2016-07-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/4f192a84-19a7-4f7e-a43e-f33d48dc353b?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=35,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
