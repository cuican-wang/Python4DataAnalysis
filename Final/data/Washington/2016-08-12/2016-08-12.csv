468,3521.0,"Research Scientist, Senior",Sotera Defense Solutions,3.6,30.0,"Sotera is a good company to work for and is winning a lot of good Govt contracts.  Professional environment and great co workers.  I highly recommend Sotera.This was a good place to work before budget cuts and sequestration affected jobs. Mid sized government contractors all suffered and Sotera was no exception.The story of a job placement company trying to be a defense contractor.  All staff meetings were to tell employees about acquisitions and plans for company revenue growth.  Only discussion of employee success was due to a project team's efforts prior to their previous company being acquired.There appears to be some financial issues since everything discussed centers around money and how the company can make more, or at least enough to meet debt obligations.There is not any job security.  Every day is questionable whether there will be a tomorrow.Coworkers are nice but above that becomes less than satisfying and supportive.Pros:Excellent ManagementGood PayFlexible work scheduleIf contract was lost, company would work with you to find a new contract.ConsContract workIt was fun and enjoyable working at Sotera Defense Solutions.  I only left after being laid off due to the absence in government contracts.  I was fortunate enough to work there for almost four (4) years.I enjoyed being the Travel Coordinator for the senior software engineers and corporate employees.Wonderful experience due to supervisor, she was willing to mentor those who wanted to learn.Great leadership, many opportunities for advancement. Highly cleared positions and encourages independent work.I enjoyed the team I have worked with and the atmosphere of work which allowed for thought and innovation and encourage team participation and a since of family. The contract ended due to government cuts.This was a temporary project that I really enjoyed working on.  The work environment was very layed back, which brought an ease of concentration.BusyValuable knowledgeExcellentgreat co-workersJob easyGoing to work everydaySotera is owned by another investment group who has no history in this field and it shows. Administration where I worked was stressed and understaffed. Speed was the number one objective and the word ""quality"" always took a back seat. That may be the normal at most places of work however. This appears to be a very stressed company financially at this point. Please keep that in mind before you accept a job there. The employees that I worked with were very nice people but they had been asked to give up too much family life to be happy.I enjoyed working for the company. I received respectable pay, and enjoyed some company perks (ie. box seats at the Verizon Center). I would have loved to have continued working for the company, however major contract adjustments were made, thus not allowing me, and many others to continue to do so.Sotera Defense Solutions has afforded me several advancement opputunities since I started with them in 2007. They are a very personable company where you don't feel like just a number, but you are part of a team and a large family.Familiar with IT Infastructure. Learned VMWare Sphere Client 5.0   and other Web-based  Tools Productive, Dedicated  and Motivated.Sotera Defense Solutions has a lot of good people to work with.  Mainly a DoD subcontractor for most projects, which means defense cuts really hurt the company.Culture depends on which sector you are in.Good mid-sized Defense Contractor.  Started with Signature, aquired by Global and then re-named to Sotera.The impression that I got from this company is that they do not care about their employees. I felt more like a number than I did an employee. It's been my experience that smaller companies go the extra mile to make sure they let their employees know they care and that they are more than just a timecard or employee number. They strive to let them know that they want their employees to make a ""career"" with the company instead of just work a job. But I did not feel this way with Sotera at all. I do not see myself ever working for this company again. I had a very enjoyable experience working for Sotera. The Human Resource Department is very efficient and being able to talk to management is even easier.They are professional and very responsible for their staff as well as to their staff.Co-workers are very hard working but I looked forward to working with them since they came to work with the best attitude and professionalism. You work hard during the day but you go home feeling that you have accomplished the duties that have been put before you and they praise you for it.Sotera is by far the best company I have ever worked for.Great company to work for. The management team is very personable and willing to listen to their employees.I currently lead a team of analysts for the Defense Intelligence Agency. I can provide more information upon request as the work can not be described in this forum.Sotera is a great company but doesn't offer enough advancement opportunities. I am looking to grow my career within the realm of management and proposal development.",,Washington,Washington DC,DC,2016-08-12T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/e6742791-6392-4392-999f-d879192a057e?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=23,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
