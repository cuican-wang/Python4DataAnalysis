102,3155.0,Data Scientist,Vox Media,4.3,4.0,"A wonderful workplace environment. Everyday is a new challenge, in a sense. My experience has forced me to become more diligent and resourceful with my time. The onus is entirely on you to get better. I learn from the people I work with because they, too, are writers. Which is maybe the hardest part of the job: finding the time to read everything. And I read more than anything else I do! I also enjoy working from home quite a bit, easily the best part of the job.I've only worked for Vox Media for a short time on a part-time basis as a news desk writer for SB Nation, but I like what I've seen from the company. They are clearly on the cutting edge of new technologies and innovations in the field. My work consists of writing news stories in four hour shifts. At time the work can be tedious, but it also provides me opportunities to be creative.A typical day included myself and my studio manager, creating lighting set ups for the first show and prepping our control room to capture it. During the run of the show I would get a list of tasks from my executive producer for the day. They would include anything from trouble-shooting new equipment, going on a run to meet one of our freelance editors, or even cleaning up our storage space. Our management was good, they were fair, understanding, and only pushy when they needed to be. My co-workers were all similar to me in age and we generally had a good deal of fun while working together. Hardest part of my job would be after lunch when I normally broke down both studios alone since my manager had to be in meetings with the higher ups. The most enjoyable part was just working in the studio, listening to music and telling funny stories from the night before.it's a great place to work! each day is a new adventure. Projects are great, people are great for the most part. Vox is a growing company with skys the limit opportunities.",,Washington,Washington,DC,2016-08-19T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/c284a35b-cf47-4f09-98a9-952cb3390a80?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
