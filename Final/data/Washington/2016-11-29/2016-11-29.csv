Just didn't have any job security because of lay offs and pay freezes all the time because of current president and leadership. Loved the people and the work.I'm a contractor to the DoD.   They are a government entity and my customer. I've had better customers and I've had worse customers.   Most of the Job satisfaction will come from the contracting company you work for.The people I met and worked with I wouldn't trade for the world. The training I received was excellent. I wanted to Persue college so that is the reason I left.A great place to work. There is always an opportunity for advancement. It provides a chance to serve the people of the United States of America and make a difference in the world.Great place to work, excellent job security.  Friendly co-workers in outlying clinics who are ready to help.  Very professional.Loved the army all 25 years and continue to enjoy it. Have been all around the world with the department of defense. Met thousands of wonderful people that I will never forget.Working at MWR (Morale, Welfare, and Recreation) was the best job I ever had. I received great compensation for my work as well as opportunities for job advancement, training, and benefits.I was an enlisted service member for my entire career and made my way up the ranks.  I would say that I would not be the person I am today had it not been for my training and character development that I learned while serving.A good job with good benefits and an outstanding group of people to work for and with for fifteen years. I have no regrets or complaints about this job. We are vital in the protection of this country by keeping our submarine fleet in excellent working condition.Very good place to work.Great co-workers and management.Outstanding benefits.Excellent training program.A typical day was very busy,A new challenge everyday. Worlds best personnel. Family time can be challenging... must have a strong family relationship.A typical cashier job at a grocery store but with more drama and less advancement career wise. This has been one of the easiest jobs I have ever worked and they make this job seem ideal because it is a government positionWorking for the DoD was wonderful. They took care of me when I showed initiative and hard work. I was able to work from the bottom of the bottom to be in charge of some really awesome programs.Served for almost 10 years of active duty and had it not been for injury I would still be serving. Travel is amazing and if you don't mind paid vacations to the middle east then this is the job for you.Working environment is good. Being a Quality Auditor, involved in Defence Budegeting process. Attended meetings at Pentagon as well as at Fort Belvoir for various QA process.The Department of Defense Media department is a wonderful and fun  place to work. Having knowledge of broadcast techniques helped out in my excitement of the opportunity.Each day is a different situation in work and how to handle a situation as it comes is very important to me and working with employees of different nationality it was good me moving to California it taught me  a lots with communicating with others and Management as well, hardest part of my job is when I retired cause after all you learned and people you work with at the end of day it all comes together.DECA is an awesome company where everyone is working together to accomplish ultimate customer satisfaction. The atmosphere around the company is great and they always show employ appreciation.I work at a Navy base that serves active duty and retired personell.I love working among military members and promoting a positive work environment. The hardest part of my job is when the active duty members rotate out, they become family and although this happens again and again you never get used to it.Cops like duties, Protecting the base, Patrolman Responsibilities. Learned to handle possible situations you might come in contact with.","10,000+",Washington,Bethesda,MD,2016-11-29T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/9c52418c-4e06-4ed2-9a2c-3823fd432f84?mescoid=1900240001001&jobPosition=33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
