792,3845.0,Statistician,Serco Inc.,3.6,1700.0,"A typical day is starting out with a team meeting. Then we get our priorities for the day. Sometimes the priorities change throughout the day. We setup our computers for the work stream we are working and then we start. Our days consist of processing applications for the Affordable Care Act. During the process we call consumers for information so that we can successfully process their applications. What we learn is customer service and problem solving. The goal is to help the consumer. I like working with my co-workers. We help each other with questions and where to look for guidance in our work instructions. We get along very well and we treat each other like family. The management team is easy to work for. They are easy to approach and discuss the tasks we are working and they listen. The hardest part of the job is all the changes that take place. Most enjoyable is helping the consumer and the team I work on.I don't have a long review about this company at the moment.I ask that you do your research before you work for this company.Be upfront about what you want as far working there and be prepared for changes every 2 minutes and is forced to adapt to those changes without error in the work.If you are working on a contract for Serco providing good services, the organization truly does not care about your efforts or contributions. They truly only cared about the profits you were working for.not something to be able to advance opportunities, unfair management, hours were not something i agreed to. was a good experience in data entry. overall an ok jobworked with serco in the Colorado springs area for some time and after what ive seen there I would not recommend this company at all, the management that oversees that locations project is very unfair and biased. the project manager will smile in your face then stab you in the back - very spineless. if you do choose to work there negotiate your pay prior to hiring on because that is all the pay you will get. they post job openings for higher mechanics solely because they have to and you can apply and talk to them till your blue in the face but they normally already have their mind made up. keep in mind that this is contract work and they have already peaked. they are on the downhill now and wouldn't be surprised if the didn't get the chance to bid again due to the ruffling of feathers with the city. BEWARE!!!The job was a piece of cake, anyone could do it.  The pay is solid, with your insurance being paid for by the company (as a single person, family costs more).  The hardest part of the job is trying to not pull your hair out at the amount of archaic procedures being used.  It's like the higher-ups (on-site, and off-site) have no idea how to utilize modern technology. The reporting is atrocious, using something called ProgramVision to get pre-made reports created by people that have clearly never worked with data before.  No standardization on anything.  You have different rules and procedures for tasks that are essentially the same.  Too many jack of all trades, masters of none.If you can make yourself numb and sit for 8 hours, this job is not terrible.The upper management never seemed to care about what was going on in your life outside of work. There was one time a girl had a seizure while AT work and the time counted against her when they were the ones that called the ambulance and she was taken to the hospital and admitted. It used to be, if you had a doctors note the time would not count against you. Then it changed to even with a doctors note, they counted the time against you if you didn't have the PTO to cover.work hard stay motivated meet your goals. show up on time. stay sharp and focused to reduce errors. I loved the hours coworkers and management. Attendance and quality is the overall kicker.Lots of favoritism. Personal life is no concern of leads. And management. No encouragement. Demoralizing attitude of leads and PM.Working as an analyst at Serco is not a tedious job, the work load expected is highly achievable. Guidance is minimal which works well if you're a problem solver or like puzzles.  Environment is friendly and clean.The people are fun to work with but health benefits cost way to much. There is always place to move up in the company. Work life and personal life is sometimes hard to balance. I enjoy all of my job no matter if the consumer may yell at me or updates on the systems don't happen as fast as you think they should.A typical day was going through DMI's and I learned a lot about data entry. Great place to work. Management and the co workers are absolutely great.Great program to support soldiers and their families.Disgruntled co-workers due to poor compensation. Position requires a Masters degree but pays like a high school dropout. Contractor gets the money not the employees that work for them.The job was easy and the pay was decent. It would have been nice to get a raise though but same pay after almost three years. Insurance was decent. Time off after one year but management could care less if you take a day off without pay here and there. Trouble was, there was only two of us so taking off work was a hassle especially when the office was swamped with customers. Our direct manager was decently available to contact but his boss was a nightmare. She came out for a visit and let's just say 2 weeks later I put in my notice. Horrible manager. It's sad that she's been with the company for so long and openly jokes about how many she's scared away. Also I might add that the ""part-time"" position was a complete waste and they didn't seem to be able to hire anyone competent to do the job. I was the ""Site Representative"" which basically meant the office tattletale. I would say supervisor but they made it clear I had no authority but they wanted me to rat the others out for being late, etc. Not the worst job I've had, but definitely not a company you can build a career with.Passionate and well-qualified Professional Career Counselor experienced in briefing and counseling Soldiers in all stages of their transition. Excels in implementing professional development plans for transitioning Soldiers who aim to enter the workforce upon separation. Adept at coaching Soldiers through roadblocks in their transition identifying opportunities for training and professional development.Workedd as a General Clerk 11, job was okay training has improved, enjoyed co workers and learned how Health insurance works. You have to be able to sit for extended periods of time. Its a Nice place to work.I have worked for three years at Serco. I have enjoyed it very much. The managers are wonderful to work with and will do anything to help you succeed.  The co-workers are pleasant and work great together. We work daily with each other and there is never a day you wont need them. The people I have worked with have been the most enjoyable part of the job.Work life balance was not very good, management was excellent, and supervisors were very understanding. People are great. Loved it just hated sitting for 8hrs not doing anything on daysEnjoyed the aspect of helping out members of the community in need of employment.  Allowed freedom to create the employer base needed to find appropriate job opportunities.  Great manager and co-workers.Serco had numerous contracts and was always looking to move professionals around if they were unsatisfied with their current position.  Strong in program management and acquisition of products and services for the governmentNo work or hardly any... the management cares very little if at all for the employees ..cant have a personal life or prodfessinal one here at the wentzville location.","10,000+",Washington,Springfield,VA,2016-09-13T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/b9eba0b2-d097-4d90-9968-8640abdc9954?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=32,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
