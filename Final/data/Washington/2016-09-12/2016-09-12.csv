469,3522.0,Associate Scientist,Emergent BioSolutions,3.3,37.0,"This is a vey reputable company. Some jobs operate on a shift schedule. The company however offers amenties tat allows the employee to be comfortable while working late and weekend shifts.Lack of trust and dishonesty abound.  Due to their reliance on government funding they are blocked by red tape and can't get out of their way.  More political than strategicHave enjoyed my time here.  Wish I could continue working with such a great work force.  Have learned a lot and would love to continue to learn.Emergent Biosolutions is a great place to work. Excellent environment and I learned a lot throughout my time working there. Quick career advancement if you are a hard working employee. Only reason I am looking for other employment is because they are downsizing and I was a part of an employee severance.24-7/365 manufacturing of Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed (AVA). I learned how to use SAP software. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the monotony of executing the same procedures everyday with minimal variance.Nice place to work, they really care about their products and employees.  They just opened a work out center and a cafe at our headquarters.never worked here before. i worked for emergent professional services which is a staffing agency. indded selected the wrong employers name for my employment.I almost always worked over my scheduled 12 hour shift. Upper management was not honest when they hired me as a temporary employee, knowing that they were making a transition within a couple years  that I would likely not be a part of. My co-workers were great, many of them were in the same boat I was. I learned to operate with great attention to detail, but few functional skills that will translate to other jobs in my future.As a manufacturing technician the job itself was repetitive but enjoyable because of the team environment.  Over the years, however, Emergent has become more and more dysfunctional.  This is mostly due to a few rotten eggs in site leadership.  One or two bullies and sycophants in the upper echelons really create a trickle down effect of unhappiness.Good place to go to get experience but the management can be terrible.... Not a lot of room for growth. They claim you can successfully move up the ladder but it turns out its very difficult unless you know someone....Benefits are great especially PTO.We worked two shifts, nice place to work. People are nice and I gained a lot of experienced. The most enjoyable part of the job is we travel.Emergent is similar to other companies of its size in that some dept are well managed while others are a nightmare.  Be sure to vet the managers you'll be working with prior to joining.Growing and in some ways exciting company to work for.  A lot of positives - good corporate culture etc, but a lot of politics in getting promotions.Difficult product space orphan disease state, large territories.  New division to the larger entity still ironing out the details.I've had the ability to learn a lot about a wide array of company systems and processes.  My co-workers are great and make the job enjoyable.  Management holds all of the decision making power and even then, only senior management is allowed to make any decisions.  There is definitely room for growth for those without advanced degrees and those with advanced degrees aren't given much room to exercise their expertise and problem solving skills.  The hardest part of the job is the rate at which work is expected to be completed as there is not much time between a decision being made and completion of that task.The people are at the heart of this company.  Colleagues were outstanding.  As the company grew, management lost site of staff and instead of truly working on the culture they resorted to a fa√ßade.Working for Centric Parts through Emergent was ok, not the best as they tend to have a very poor choice of employment rights although they say they are equal and are willing to help the growth of the company has always been more important than the safety and health of their employees. It is great knowing you will always have work Monday-Friday plus overtime when needed.The company has grown significantly.  Lots of opportunities and lots of positive changes over the past years but growth pains too just like any company going through significant growth and change.  Ehtical company with a strong CEO. Work along side many talented people.The company did more for me in terms of personal growth and benefits than I thought any company ever would. The work/life balance left something to be desired and compensation was a little lacking for my position.Long hours are always encouraged without the recognition or compensationManagement does not embrace the values of the organization but forces the staff to use themManagement always seemed unprepared for audits when lower level personnel pulled the majority of the weightWould never recommend them as a good place to work.Management is run by two peopleNot a good place to workI was treated very badly and constantly humiliated by the employees relations person in HR. Sr. Counsel can not be trusted.Bullied.",,Washington,Gaithersburg,MD,2016-09-12T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/4334c56e-cbe3-4586-bb23-e0cf72195854?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

793,3846.0,Geospatial Analyst,Cubic Corporation,3.7,68.0,"During the beginning 2 months of my time with Cubic, things were great.  I was getting a steady workflow and received praise several times for the work that I was doing.  Then, things started to slow down and I was asked to help with documentation.  During this time morale started to sink within the company as many people were finding work elsewhere.  Once the documents were finished, I was once again place on my original assignment, but the workflow and praise had changed.  There were several times that no work was available.  During my last 2 months, I was once again moved to another project.  I took over for an engineer that left the company, and was handed a project that had very little information associated with it.  I then had to figure out what was going on, as the time went along, I received no direction or feedback from the project manager.I really enjoyed working for Cubic.  The Senior Management Team was very receptive to 'thinking out-of-the box' always encouraging new ideas and productive ways to change or streamline various business practices.The call center has a great Manager, but lower management is stuck in Junior High School. There is poor training for lower management, as there is favoritism and extremely immature behavior among them.There is very little praise and will tell you what you did wrong or how bad you are at your job with a smile. Was promised to have weekends off during the hiring process and interview, but was told that I had to choose a weekend day to work, as ""It's a requirement"" for the position. And there is very, very little room for advancement in this office.There is a call time limit (approx 5 mins per call) and that is nearly impossible due to the systems that are provided. The computers are not PCs, but simply one giant connected system that runs so slow, that the first 3 minutes of the call is just waiting for the customer's information to pull up.Unless you are desperate for a job, I would not recommend this call center.This company is not a good company. Instead of interviewing the workers for work, it feels as tho you are being interrogated by an FBI agent. This company really needs to find someone better to represent them. I feel as tho the guy in charge has ran off or scared off potentially good workers.This is a great company to work for. Excellent benefits, decent pay, and they do a lot for the employees (free company picnic and Christmas party). But there is little room for advancement and some of the management is questionable.Great company as a whole that has a definite grasp on what a customer wants and needs when it comes to a system that can benefit the public in their travels using public transportation.Cubic is a great place to work.  People are friendly, things run fairly smoothly, and the work in itself is very stress free.  The work environment is clean and quiet, with no need for any safety equipment other than ESD protection.Cubic also abuses the temporary staffing services more than any company I've ever known of.  In my time working for Cubic I was promoted two times and given very high marks on my reviews for workmanship.  Setup stations and trained workers on various tasks which I also created training materials for them to follow.  I applied for every full time position available at Cubic for 2.5 years and never once received even an interview.  If you aren't on a personal level with management here you will never get hired.  During my time working here and getting to know most of the long time employees, they all informed me on several occasions that the job postings are solely for show.  Some workers have been at this facility for 5-6 years as temporary workers.  I have several certifications and many years IT experience, yet was never considered for jobs I was more qualified to do than what I was doing.In short, unless you're going to work in the offices or know the upper management personally I wouldn't recommend working for Cubic.  This is not a place to start a career as you will most likely be a temporary worker for the rest of your life.  I was hoping to make a career at Cubic as I loved working for the company for a long time, but eventually being abused and underpaid as a temporary worker gets old.  If you want a throw-away job work here, otherwise¬†¬†more... move on.¬†¬†lessGreat job for veterans/retirees from the military with experience with working at NTC. For non-salary positions its typically an 8 hour work day and management is willing to work with you if you need time off.Co-workers were fantastic, a great place to be if you really want to work and get things done. It has a great environment, a great building, and a great learning experience as an intern.Currently, I am working for Cubic Transportation Systems in the area of Financial and Transaction Processing Management for Clipper Card. We manage the day-to-day operations of the clearing and settlement functions, as well as reconciliation of ACH daily transfers between financial institutions, participating operators, and other vendors. Typical day at work consists of cross-training, majority of reconciling and clearing our GL accounts and research. A lot of our process are manual and very tedious due to system enhancements and reports currently not being automated. I have built strong relationships with my colleagues and are always helpful as we consider ourselves ONE TEAM. When we are not hectic with schedules, we set up fun events for everyone to enjoy.Interesting business domain.Opportunity to work with embedded development, if you're into it.Too many non-technical managers.This is a good place to work. I worked with a lot of great people. I did learn a lot working  here but the travel in the department I was in was very extensive.I worked with the company for about 3 years in the call center. Management had their favorites. My manager had her bulldog that would watch your every move. If you didn't bring food or dress up for the monthly potlucks you were an outsider. Training was lacking and the systems that we worked on was very slow. They wanted us on and off the phone in 5 mins but you done good to get the customers account researched in 5 mins.Your bathroom breaks were timed and you will be talked to if you go to the bathroom to much. It is very micromanaged.Cubic was a good place to have worked.  Management expects a lot from the employee, but they gave a sufficient amount of time for one to learn and hone their skills. At Cubic, I wore several different hats of responsibility and I was afforded both time and training to succeed in each of my roles.  Cubic manufactures revenue collection systems geared at mass transit systems throughout the world.  No two systems are the same as the customers requirements vary from location to location.  This creates individualized requirements for each product built and shipped which leads to multiple customer requirement profiles.  In my opinion, this is both the hardest and most enjoyable part of the job as every item has specific needs, whether it be packaging, documentation, specialized transportation or a chain of advanced notifications/authorizations prior to shipment.  Along with good communication between departments, the employees at Cubic were great to work with.  There was a real team atmosphere among all departments.If you are getting out of the military and looking for a slow transition back into the civilian world this is a great job! Unfortunately there is no room for growth and job security is very low. With that being said, Cubic Defense Applications is a great company with great benefits.Upper management is nowhere to be seen, ever. My program manager is great, but above that it's a crapshoot. Benefits are terrible, and got worse with ObamaCare. Health insurance costs are ridiculous. Good pay, good pto.No room for growth.Worked  as  interpreter, adviser, for US Army ( Special Forces )for overseas culture.  ..............Enjoyed my time there. Would go back in a second. Free coffee.I think this company was a great company to work for. I really hated when it moved all the jobs to Mexico. My co worker was helpful and nice to work with. Management doors was always open no matter what the problem.Great company to work for. The people are what make the company.A fulfilling position, adding real time training with the army units, before they deploy.My position is to have contact with the rotational units, presenting a series of problems for them to resolve, using the training and protocols they have already used.Most recently, I have portrayed a Charity Relief Organisation, my dealings with the unit produce a conflict of interest for them between the mission and their own humanitarian relief.My position requires a lot of research in order to produce informed and coherent arguments and reports when meeting the civil affairs teams.Most of what I do is free play, not scripted. I find this interesting as often I have to keep my wits about me and think on my feet as the meetings progress, for better or worse.I take a lot of pride and job satisfaction in creating the same problems that they are likely to face on deployment, so that the troops will not make the same mistakes and come home safely.","5,001 to 10,000",Washington,Herndon,VA,2016-09-12T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/2f3634d6-e599-45ea-8bcd-eba1eaf5ebd7?mescoid=1500140001001&jobPosition=33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
