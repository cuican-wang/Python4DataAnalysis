77,3130.0,Data Scientist,Collabera,3.6,348.0,"Good Company to work with. Management is also helpful and co operative. They helped me for initial relocation expenses.Office is also Good. Help me in getting a Good Project.I didn't want to stay in the Staffing industry but it was a great first resume builder. I still hold a good relationship with my boss and see him at Earls from time to time. I wanted to move up and got a promotion my first 3 months but after a while, I got sick of a desk job. I like the hustle an bustle of nightlife and want to be involved with marketing, promotions, and sales. Collabera was great management experience but I want more!Company did great with handling issues that arose during contract.  Great staff and very helpful getting me acclimated to the work environment as well as ensuring frequently that all needs were met.  Would recommend this company for any IT contractor.I've worked with Collabera twice on two different contracts. They establish effective relationships with their clients, their contractors and do a great job of making both stakeholders happy. They view contractors as strategic resources. Outstanding Professionals.Great people to work with. In all it is a really great company to work with.Just please try to help your customers more quickly. Keep up the good work.They tell that when your Temp Job ends they will have something else for you, but they don't. I did like the fact that while I was working there I was always able to get in contact with someone if necessary. They were very nice and would call you every so often to ask how everything was going at work.With Collabera, I worked at CAT in Denison, TX.  I enjoyed my position while working there because I knew exactly what my job requirements were and had the knowledge to achieve my duties.  I appreciated that the management team gave me direction and tools, and allowed me to come up with my own techniques/processes to complete the task at hand.My co-workers and I were very successful at dividing the workload and completing the tasks that were assigned to us.  We actually completed our project 6 months earlier than expected.  This was partially due to the reports that I created to show and changes within the system on a daily basis. This report prevented duplicate efforts since there were several departments working on the same project.The hardest part of the job was when a supplier didn't respond at all to a request that was sent to them. To tackle this obstacle, emails were sent with follow up reminders.  If we continued to receive no response, the supplier's lack of response was escalated to the management team for further action.I truly enjoyed working with a fun group of people at CAT.  The most enjoyable part of the job was creating a rapport with the suppliers and being able to reach and surpass goal expectations.Assured stock levels on the sales floor are maintained at all times. Assisted customers with the selection of product. Supervised Loading/Unloading of trucks and checked orders. Prepared inventory reports and matched them with the store records. Generated the invoices for the customers to send them with the trucks. Participated in store meetings and trainings.Assured stock levels on the sales floor are maintained at all times. Assisted customers with the selection of product. Supervised Loading/Unloading of trucks and checked orders. Prepared inventory reports and matched them with the store records. Generated the invoices for the customers to send them with the trucks. Participated in store meetings and trainings.I will never work for them again. They never respond to your requests or questions, but if you do anything wrong they will bother you about it. They suck, suck, suck.The company treats its contractors very poorly and under pays them. Contractors often complained to me that all of their support came from India and no one seemed to care. Contractors get no support from Collabera once they are placed in a job. Collabera employees do not have it any better. Management is too focused on the competition to focus on their own employees. Many regional managers are under-trained, do not respect their employees, and the turnover is very high. There is no training. The pay is mediocre and the commissions are, too.see previous review - Collabera is a very good Contract Agency.  I was able to work at IBM for 5 years without any issues with Collabera.  They are professional and everything was handled in a professional manner.Collabera is a good contracting firm to work for, pay and benefits are decent. Their representatives would contact and want to know how things were going. Also, after a contract was completed they made attempts to find the contractor a new contract.I will recommend Collabera to others,  They are a professional IT recruitment agency and has been responsive to all my inquiries. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI have been approached by this ""company"" on over a dozen occasions in the past few months, sometimes via email, sometimes via telephone.   All saying ""We have a postion in PA, Want it?""  (and that is hardly paraphrased).    Oh, and I live 3000 miles AWAY, which they would know if they read the resume of mine they supposedly have.   Today alone, I have had 3 phone calls, and 3 emails, all amounting to not much more than one-liners.    The first phone call was at 5am!.     Attempts to reach the local office to complain resulted in ""We are not accepting calls at this time"".   Seriously?   Based on this unprofessional conduct, I will never to business with them, and they are doing a huge disservice to any employer they represent.In my opinion, Collabera is a great place to work and really has great training for those looking for entry level type positions.The manager at BofA are great. They are very understanding and willing to assist in any way possible. The work experience there was okay. I mean Okay. I like to keep busy. So the majority of the time there. We were looking for something to do. I like to have job security to fill like I am earning an honest pay. The co-work were great to work with. The hardest part of the job was waiting for some grant us access to the different software applications we needed to complete the request.Collabera has provided multiple opportunities to me with its clients to provide consulting services for wireless, wireline and backbone internet solution opportunities.Great contract company always on time and upfront with news from client. in my opinion it could make the contract agency stronger if they could offer some type benefits as in PTO, Sick time. other then that its a great agencyOnce you get a job and or the assignment ends, they don't contact you for another position. Never got a call back after my first assignment ended.the point of contacts through this temp agency are awesome some of the nicest people I have ever had the pleasure of working with","5,001 to 10,000",Washington,McLean,VA,2016-11-23T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/8c6e62b0-419b-4361-8d11-f3103686bf1d?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
