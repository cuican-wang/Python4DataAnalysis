827,3880.0,"Supplier Quality Assurance Scientist (Germantown, MD, US)","Mars, Incorporated",4.0,427.0,"It was an easy job just doing home healthcare can be difficult when your inside someones home and they don't really want you there. They start to fight and hit on you.At first i really thought this company was a wonderful company to work for and after being here for a year and learning the ropes of and moving on up i got fired with no evidence for something i did not do. A lawsuit makes sense for this company and the p&o manager at the victorville site has no clue in how to run the hiring and firing department! Terrible place to work forWalked through out the plant hourly checking product to make sure it was in safety and quality specifications. Insured that our product was tested every hour to give the customers and company a log of the product and every test performed on the product. Monitored other associates on safety and quality in the manufacturing process.The management needs a reboot. Yelling at your employees doesn't make them want to work, let alone work for you. They demand to be respected but don't respect their employees.At Mars I was shipping and packing. I liked the job due to its pay. I really want a warehouse Job again. It was a good experience to me and it showed me a lot.Mars is a fast paced business with plenty of opportunities. You can succeed if you need little direction, are a team player, hard worker, welcome the company values.The people and management was very nice and helpful. I learned everything about my tasks and ways to reach the production number in according time within a couple days on the job. I've worked in groups from 2-4 people and we were able to accomplish them as a team every day on the job. The most enjoyable part was getting the production done and getting a head start on the next shifts production. That allowed them to acknowledge how hard we worked the previous shift. There wasn't any hard part of the job, I got exactly what ii signed up for and learned a lot. I was satisfied in every aspect.Working at mars keeps you busy and on your feet never a down time you stand on an assembly line which ever one you are assigned to for that day and you handle all the candy for that lineA work day began by first working the current list of patients with outstanding medical fees. I would call all listed phone numbers associated with the patient and attempt to make contact with them. Once contact was made, I would interview the patient and see if they qualified for any state or federal run assistance programs, such as Medicaid or SSI/SSDA. If they were found eligible and willing to accept my help, I would then either mail or hand-deliver our authorized representative packets to them and have them complete them. I would then take the information gathered and apply that patient for medicaid and/or SSI/SSDA (depending on eligibility). If the patient was approved I would then hand over the account to my supervisor, who would then bill the account to medicaid and the outstanding fees, or at least a portion of them, would be paid. If a patient was found ineligible or was denied coverage, the account would be given back to the hospital and a financial aid application was sent to the patient for completion. In this job I learned excellent customer service skills and developed confidence in talking to new people in a cold call scenario. I also learned how to utilize the hospital documentation program, EPIC. My direct supervisor was a dedicated woman, and was very diligent in her dealings with patients and the hospital alike. Our team was small (only 3 people towards the end of the contract) but she still managed to guide us to the goal of saving the hospital over one million dollars in derelict medical payments over the course of about 4 years. I found the hardest part  more... of the job to be fighting with the state agencies, such as Job and Family Services, for approval for the patient's medicaid cases. Often times the patient would not be able to provide all verification's in time and we would require more to get everything JFS needed to make a decision. I would say the best part of the job was the ability and necessity to  travel to patient's listed address, in order make contact or secure AR packets. This allowed me to meet a diverse mix of people, most of which were very kind and appreciative.  lessThe money is not worth the headache or never having time off, the feeling of being disposable at any time. You are pretty much overworked and under appreciated. Management is despicable. Workers are lazy and if you are a good worker, you are the 1st to be reprimanded. No set schedule because something is always changing. Very inconvenient for anybody to deal with especially if you have a family or other events. Do not waste your time applying. Save yourself the trouble and headache.What I like about Mars, Inc. is that it is a family-owned company and the family is very involved in the growth of the business.A typical day at work is giving your all and management not doing anything, ESPECIALLY TOP MANAGEMENT. No support at all and that's when certain leaders decide to show up! Good employees are looked down upon when pointing out issues with the stores/company and if you reach out to higher ups that are not in your store, you can guarantee your name is at the top of the ""hit list"". Instead of fixing issues management, even P&O, does whatever they can to sweep the problem under the rug, even if that means getting rid of you. Good managers there are afraid to speak up about issues because they fear for their jobs. The retail side of this company is untrustworthy and should NOT be considered for employment. Associates on the floor just get looked at for mistakes.The amount of BS you endure at this job for the amount of pay is NOT WORTH IT. STAY AWAY FROM MARS RETAIL!! For your own health and sanity!After working in the public sector, it has been so REFRESHING to work for Mars where decisions are made driven by the 5 principles: Quality, Responsibility, Efficiency,Mutuality, Freedom.  I honestly didn't believe this when I first joined and thought it was just HR talk but I have seen this come to life on a daily basis.  Our management team is accessible and the broader team respects one another. We make recommendations based on the long term as opposed to short term earnings, and in the Pet division the mantra is ""Dog and Cat first.""  We make great products that improve the pets lives.I love being able to bring my dog to work with me and love being surrounded by others with a passion for their pets.  We also have several therapy puppies that are being trained by colleagues- what is better than having a constant stream of puppies at the office to make you feel good about coming in?If you're an individual looking for a challenge and want to grow within a short period of time and enjoys multitasking, stop looking elsewhere, this is the right place for you!good place to work. long drive for me. good people to work with. good management. great product everyone loves gum. recommended place to work.Help desk environment with responsibilities ranging from hardware resets, to maintaining an inbound call queue, while also supporting walk-up assistance.Management full of BS and need more training, disappointing and Georgia laws sucks, the job easy, not hard, pay very good. Enjoy my coworkers!Mar's as a company may be a good place to work on the whole,But the Retail division is totally disfunctional and a horrible place to work.Management is primarily through intimidation and dictation. The Bosses are Bullies!   People are treated as drones and not appreciated.  Talent is ignored and not rewardedThe management, from the Corporate Office in New Jersey all the way down to the store level gives lip service to the principals of the company but do not uphold or live those principals.There is no opportunity for advancement.  Mar's prefers to recruit from outside the company rather than promote valuable talented people from the inside.Mar's is a private company and thereby writes their own rules.I would NOT recommend Mar's Retail as a place to work at ANY level.Overall they are a good company with good work life balance.  Excellent work facilities and collaborative.  fast paced environmentOverall it is a great place to work. Sometimes it can get demanding, but I suppose that can occur anywhere you work. I would recommend anyone to go and work for Mars. You can bring your dog to work with you. Fitness center in the building.The position was really good I had a great time working for this company. A typical day is going to work mon to fri from 8 to 4.","10,000+",Washington,Germantown,MD,2016-10-11T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/fad10e79-7be3-4f84-b775-23b918842d1f?mescoid=1900306001001&jobPosition=32,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
