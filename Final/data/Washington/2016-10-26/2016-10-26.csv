91,3144.0,Data Scientist,CIA,4.4,88.0,"Like any large bureaucracy, there are issues, but I found lots of advancement opportunities, interesting work, and even travel! Something for everyone there.The CIA offers unique experience, and predominantly train on the job for these positions, once professionals exceed the final cut for education, a battery of tests, and clearances.  Individuals are encouraged to think for themselves within the framework of regulations, and often travel alone worldwide to assist case officers abroad with technical help.Great equal opportunities for all sexes, races, and health handicaps (I even saw a blind man pushing the postal cart through the halls). One has to get used to paranoid behavior when working in this environment.I served as an Executive Assistant at the Agency for 23 years,  I had no typical day!  I woke up every morning wondering what new and exciting thing I was going to learn that day, and I was rarely disappointed,   I was fortunate to have excellent managers who truly appreciated and rewarded exceptional performance, both monetarily and with plum assignments,  I served at eight different Embassies and Consulates all over the world.  My spouse was an agency employee as well (a finance officer) and management made every effort to see that we had tandem assignments.Our co-workers were dedicated public servants who were there for the same reason we were - to serve our country,  There were the usual petty complaints but they were infrequent.The hardest part of my job was also the most enjoyable:  being away from my extended family for long periods of time, but living overseas and exposing my children to an international life was an experience I wouldn't trade for anything!Work at the Agency has been one of my best life experiences.  They work hard to breed a culture of trust, mentoring, and good management.  From the people, to the continuous learning opportunities, and diversity of work all under one employer.  There are few companies that can provide work that interests you no matter how your interests change, and with the flexibility that they do.  A very positive culture all together.A typical day in the office consisted of typing documents that were classified and handled according to the classification code that was given to it.  When the documents were completed, it was given to the appropriate supervisor for review.  The position also required that all files were locked at all times except when it was necessary to insert additional information in them.  Management was easy to work with and like most organizations, they rated your performance.  I was fortunate to have a good relationship with all of my co-workers.  The hardest part of my job was remembering to always destroy the burn bags when there was a fire drill.  If someone forgot to do this, they were reminded that this action was not acceptable.  Having a good working relationship with my co-workers (of all ages and backgrounds) was an enjoyable part of my job.Outstanding Career Opportunities. Over my 36 year career I advanced to the Senior level of Government Service. Although I was hired on as a Mechanical Engineer, I was able to choose other career paths as desired.I had a long and successful career with CIA for 39 years.  I changed job tracks 3 times during my career and served in several different support jobs.  Training opportunities were excellent.This is an HOA management company. Company is one of the best in their industry, but doesn't value it's employees. There is no motivation or supervisor support.The best part about my job is serving my country.  I've learned key leadership skills, as this company provides some of the best leadership courses available.This place developed my research skills and taught me to be a better analyst.  The hardest part of the job was finding the right fit for my skills and interests.  I wanted to maximize my potential and be in a position of leadership.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when I had the opportunity to travel, brief and manage projects.It's very different.  Basic / Flexible hours. Everything is discreet. Management is not that great. Co-workers are co-workers. If you would like an opportunity to serve your country, this is it.The agency is everything you wouldn't expect. The management style is severely lacking and it causes a lot of problems. People are reassigned constantly in positions they aren't qualified for which also causes havoc.The office politics are very charged and can effect you easily. Stay on your toes.Security is very tight and you will have a gun aimed at your face at least once during your time an as employee here. I did meet some very famous people during my 2 years here. No names of course, sorry.Work/life balance is excellent as you can't take any work home with you. But you probably figured that out by now.Exciting - moving - hectic. Loved it all - sorry I left! Family life was the reason I left.Excellent Benefits, great work/life balance. Very stable environmentWork was enjoyable do to the places lived and visited.  Like anywhere some people were fun to be around at work and some not.There is no better place to use your technical skills and talents to the benefit of our nation's security and no better place to have an impact on our nation's leadership.By law, I am not permitted to provide information on this subject.Great federal employer and provides challenges to today's global issues that need to be solved.  Would do it all over again.Working for the government is great if you like to travel.  The pay is not so great and living in the DC area is also not so great.  Lots of opportunity to move around and learn other things.It has it good and bad points, it has good benifits and good pay.A typical workday for a finance and operations support officer is a standard 8-5 work schedule.  This all depends on the particular job, operation and location as this could obviously increase from time to time.  It is all dependent on the particular set of goals at the time.You learn to work with a variety of personnel during the course of your career.  From staffers to briefings to senior management.Management, at least in the area of finance and support, is at times lacking.  Like any office, I have had great managers and at others absolutely horrible.The hardest part of the job is coming to grips that regulations basically outweigh common sense at times.  Hey, it's the government.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the opportunities that the Agency offers and the sense of duty it can provide. It has in some offices, flexible schedules which are family friendly.  You will also have the opportunity to travel abroad if that is one's goal.",,Washington,Washington,DC,2016-10-26T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/11d586be-405f-4a88-aad8-e4e3e4e81d42?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=31,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
