150,3203.0,Data Scientist - Mid,Praxis Engineering,4.8,9.0,"Company with integrity, respect for their people, and as they continue to grow, they try to maintain a small company attitude and keep their employees feeling like 'they' are the company!Praxis Engineering is a collection of talented minds that like to have fun. Very collaborative and productive culture. Management is available and approachable. Corporate goals are clearly defined and the vision is engrained into the daily routine. Solutions driven (not just butts in seats).My time with Praxis has been truly enjoyable. Company is built upon and driven by its core values, which translates into a balance between productivity and fun. Full of great people that are customer driven.I would still be there if government funding had not run out on funding.A small company with wonderful benefits.  Very hard work, but refreshing to be heard by management.I had a great experience working with Praxis. Relaxing and kind environment to work within.I've only been with Praxis for about 6 months but I love the group here. It's hard to find a company that genuinely encourages a good work/life balance; most companies say they do but rarely follow through. Just about everyone I know here is involved in something outside of work: charities, running clubs, theater, etc..., and whatever you want to participate in, the company will almost always provide some kind of support.As for the work environment, it's the little things that I've been impressed with here. In this industry it's often the case that the contracts you work on don't vary all that much regardless of who you're working for, but how the company supports you on those contracts does. My initial set up here was quick and seamless, from HR and the whole hiring practice to IT and getting my workstations running. I've seen enough incompetence in those areas in other companies that I notice when it's done well.Bottom line: In my career I've worked for very large defense companies, an extremely small one, and even a gaming studio, and I can say without reservation that Praxis has the best mix of interesting work, well-rounded employees, and great ownership.Praxis has more legit work than I am used to. Previous employers had never given me an opportunity to pick the type of work I wanted to do. I don't feel that the good work is a mystery here, it's shared with everyone and I can be in charge of pursuing my own interests and have the support of my management, seemingly profit coming 2nd. I've been encouraged to pursue training in areas of emerging technology, and cost hasn't been a concern. When I had a surgery, my family received a very thoughtful care package, and I have noticed an overall commitment to employees being a priority. It's the first place I've worked where I've felt the company has a heart. The other engineers I work with are very good, consistently. I've not met one that made me wonder how they got hired and I've learned that I am given the benefit of the doubt by customers because I work at Praxis. Because this is confidential and I won't have to admit it publicly, I admit that I have grown professionally here in large part due to the people from Praxis I work/interact with. I've also started brewing at home thanks to a special interest group I am a part of at the office. Excited for my first creation. As long as my profit sharing, bonus, projects, and annual increases aren't cut, I can't currently see any reason to want to move on.The Praxis Management team is an outstanding group of knowledgeable technical and business professionals. They guide the company and the policies. They ensure that the employees and staff are provided the best training and opportunities. We, as employees, are encouraged to pursue training, certifications and additional degree programs that both interest us and benefit the company. What makes us better makes the company stronger. The dedication of management and employees to customer success drives all of us to do our best. When we exceed customer expectations and requirements we increase the opportunities for the company and employees to expand our base of satisfied customers. The hardest part is choosing what to study next. In a way the training opportunities are like being in a candy store and having to choose one treat at a time. Truly, the only limitation is how much you restrict yourself as an employee. The opportunity is there. My co-workers are great and it's always a relaxed learning environment. The most enjoyable part is the balanced approach. We work hard and the management recognizes that and holds activities to show appreciation for our efforts. What I've learned is that it is okay to speak up and share ideas. On any given day any one of us may come up with an idea that makes a difference to one or more customers. The job is always interesting, challenging and rewarding all at the same time.",201 to 500,Washington,Reston,VA,2016-02-22T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/31cb38c0-79de-4e8e-b79c-dcc18cabe162?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=20,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
