4,3057.0,Data Scientist,CDI Corporation,3.7,262.0,"CDI Corp was an excellent company to work for. The hiring team was well versed in the HR process and the on boarding was fairly easy to complete.  Only bad experience was the exit process, no details given and when contract was about to expire very little communications from management. When trying to find additional employment there was absolutely no follow up and no new job prospects presented.CDI is a third party contract business. I actually worked as a contractor for IBM. CDI has a great system for payroll and communications. The management team there really cares about their employees and will make sure that they are gainfully employed.They are very good at negotiating with the customer and very good representing the employee to the customer.They do a decent job managing contract workers for clients but no job search. Their orientation does not seem to be a job house so much as a contractor wrangler.Great temporary employment agency. Who they vendor for is hit or miss. Some contrats are great and some are not. Some companies will keep you for multiple and exttended contracts. Chances of get fulltime employment.CDI is a small construction, development and investment company in east Tennessee that strives to do quality work for a fair price and improve the homes, land and lives of the people in east Tennessee.Subordinate to IBM work requirements,  so Little actual advancement opportunities. Mostly just a payroll administrator.IBM has a major initiative to move as much work offshore as possible. I have trained about 10 offshore groups & transferred work to them. I am about to do another one in the near future.CDI allows for my career to succeed and improve with current industry standards. Very competitive and a major turning point in the planning industry. CDI maintains and focuses on serving our clients with a combination of innovative technologies, increased efficiencies, and leading edge solutions with an end-goal of achieving client excellence.too small to grow or move up.  owners were flaky.  rainy days = panda express (free).  Fridays were very casual. I enjoyed my coworkers.Very pro family was able to work and do family events. Management was very good on making employees feel good about what they were doing. The cost of insurance was the only poor item.CDI gets the job done.  But I was looking for something a little more long term with upward mobility opportunities.  Such an opportunity cannot be had with CDI.With CDI, I have been doing Civil/Structural Engineering work.  It have been very fun and challenging.  Very large company, but a great group of people.I have an outstanding team to work with. It is a managers dream. The hardest part of the job is keeping a team of billable employees in a services industry busy whenever their is an economic down turn, or the client work load diminishes, considering the low overhead budgets that we have to work with to maintain shareholder profitability.Great company just wish previous owners did not run it into the ground as we have a lot of work to do to recover the profit margins we are comfortable with. Hours will always be long at a start up and compensation low. but the new leadership is outstanding and has given the company with a 39 year track record a real chance to recover.I've worked for several years for CDI Corp. I initially was placed as a web author for a large tech company (client) and over the years moved up through CDI to be a project manager, working on various contracts with the same client. My experience within the organization has varied a great deal based on changes within CDI management, contracts I worked on for the client, and the teams I worked with. By and large, I had the privilege of having excellent managers who advocated for my advancement and fantastic teams made up of intelligent, motivated people who were a pleasure to work with. For the last 3 years, I have also been able to work from home full time, and I have loved this flexibility.The downsides to working for CDI is that it is ultimately a staffing company. The pay and benefits are not great, and your long-term growth are limited by the contracts available. It is nearly impossible to continue advancing your career beyond a certain point, and for an ambitious person, this can be very frustrating. It can also be frustrating as a manager not to be able to see your employees advance to the levels they should because there simply is not opportunity. While local management is fantastic, corporate management, whom we rarely deal with on a regular basis, are out of touch with the local teams, and meaningful rewards for truly outstanding performance are few and far between. For instance, it's been 4 years since the company last had annual merit pay increases, and the last round of merit pay increases were so low, they didn't keep up with cost of living increases in the  more... area we were based. There is no loyalty from the corporate office, and excellent employees who have been loyal to the organization may be laid off with limited notice when their contract is up. Local management tries to mitigate this, but corporate has made it increasingly difficult to reward and retain top talent.  lessWorked in cubicles, very impersonal assignment, manager was good to work for, but limited access to SKM and power systems analysis.Coordinates and implements the established referral process for children and families, ensures the implementation of recruitment including the child find effort, implement the enrollment process, provide accure record keeping, assist in the parent committees.I learned that I was a case manager for 30-35 families and that together with the parents, teacher and core team, we can guide parents to coordinates efforts to ensure services for children including children with disabilities. Ensures that children are up to date on epsdt. The most enjoyable part of the job is work with children and families and help them.Working Remote was a plus, and  flexible schedule . Internally processes were unorganized, not easy to change, big disconnect between departments/process. there was a lack of communication and sales training.Daily tasks are spread out so you do you have some down time. Work environment is ok. Work long hours sometimes. Occasional saturday workThis is a good company that appreciates hard work and getting the job done right. Being a part of a team that knows how to work together to produce a great product was an honor.There are a million things wrong with this company, so where do I begin?1) Their on boarding system is a joke. I had no idea who my manager was and no idea what my job really entailed. 2) They try and do a horrible job covering up their mistakes. I saw a job posting for my same position with higher pay. When I confronted them about it, they took down the posting immediately and brushed it under the table. 3) Their entire internal software system is extremely antiquated. They need everything to be run on a PC and through Internet Explorer. I used to have to travel 3 miles every week so that I could input my timesheet on a brick of a laptop. I still have to use a totally outdated timesheet system that they just ""updated""4) There's little to no interaction with management or anyone higher ups5) Absolutely zero career growth and development. I tried for a year to try and get some momentum on growth opportunities... NOPE6) Benefits are a joke. The pay is already horrible, you really expect us to pay for benefits out of pocket?!?!Corporate restructuring underway, patience is needed while this is in progress.  It could be another year before progress is really seen externally.","10,000+",Washington,Washington,DC,2016-11-16T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/data-scientist-job-washington-dc-us-176192530.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
