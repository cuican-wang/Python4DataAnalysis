135,3188.0,Data Scientist,Logistics Management Institute,4.1,16.0,"The staff at LMI are a fantastic group of elite minds who provide meaningful and actionable consulting services to federal clients.One of the better service providing companies supporting both the public and private sectors.  Outstanding HR and IT support with excellent managerial oversight that creates a productive and enjoyable environment for its employees.I have had no serious issues with the LMI management but there are small quirks to the company that can make some days frustrating.  I would definitely recommend to anybody that the could find a place here.Great company to work for. Job advancement is not as fast but in my eyes it is fair. Fairly new. CEO is very pleasant. I have nothing bad to say about the company. Nice people. Many have been here for a lifetime.Great company to work for with very good benefits. The best benefit is the ability to take part in a number of learning opportunities to develop professionally. The company also has a great new headquarters, however if you are not part of the few administrative staff or management you will probably have to work in a below satisfactory client facility.Productive workplace.Co-workers are great. Working conditions vary from department to department.From start of the day to the end I stay busy with data entering, invoice reconciliation, verification of client/vendor information.  My supervisors are great and I hate to leave but the company is going through a major change and I do not believe that there is a place for me anymore.  My co-workers are supportive and we like to get together once in a while outside of work.  The hardest part of my job is being able to get the PM's and PD""s to verify the work done and sign off in a timely manner for payment.You are constantly get harassed by your manager and they will harass the client as well-A lot of micromanagement-They don't let you advance in your career and their HR is a joke. Majority of the manager have been here for a long time and same as the HR and they back each others up. If you complaint, they will make sure that you are out the door fast.  The manager don't know how to manage people and they have been here for 20 years or 30 years. They also think that they own the company. If you are looking to retire here, come and join the group and their insanity. Also, there is favoritism. If the manager likes you, regardless of your education or your work experience, then you will become a superhero.LMI is a great company. The leadership from my program director is top notch.Great company, people, and projects. Government is main client. revent funding impcted by sequestration issues.I worked for LMI for nine years, and there are none better!  It has been consistently rated as one of the best companies in the DC area, and they deserve this recognition.  They have Great People - Great Professional Opportunities - Great Culture- Competitive Salaries.  None better!  I was verbally harassed numerous times and when I had gone to the Director, 2 days later was dishcarged.Good place to work. Associates care about their clients and thier misisons.Very challenging and interesting work. LMI is an excellent organization to work for, however, stressful when you are required to deploy to fight terrorism.Incredibly strong comapany with an excellent reputation among the Defense Community.","501 to 1,000",Washington,McLean,VA,2016-10-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/6fefa92f-2ac1-4159-8622-43b5d03fc232?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Ovetime is offered. You have good benefits, pay raise when you work the weekends and nights. it is fulltime Employment. And im diabetic and i go som a room to take my medication.contract job only, well ran stayed busy.  good management and good benefits. couldn't keep enough contracts to stay busy though.  ended up letting staff go with no work.Present Pilot Workforce/ Insurance Specialist 	• Answer phone calls relating to state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Marketplace • Enter caller information into application database for processing• Research any issues that may arise and escalate or transfer to appropriate group as neededOverall, this is not a forever type of job. It is more of a job that you take to pay the bills untill something better comes along or you actually start you ideal career. I enjoy working with different people daily ranging from young to old, disabled, etc. I just love the fact I can help at least one person everyday at work; even if that means being the bearer of bad news. I liked the challenges the work brought. I'm up for changes as long as it is delivered in a manner that doesn't cause chaos in the workplace and it seemed like GDIT did a terrible job of presenting changes...very unorganized. The good employees are overshadowed by the bad ones.I enjoyed having my breaks there. very relaxingnice environment to work at as well. everyone is very friendly especially my supervisor sheila.. very professional as wellFun, positive environment, Always ways to learn new things. The company always provide coaching to help employees improve and that's what I loved about being a customer service representative at general dynamicsGreat work place to work, great pay, warm environment, very easy to get the work, wonderful hours, I love helping customers, to know I'm doing something great for the communityAdvancement with GD is difficult in the contracting arena because you are billable to the customer the company often doesn't want you to change positions.I loved the job and pay. And it has a set work schedule. Offers loads of overtime. If you choose to work here you can pick part time or full time and you will get exactly those hours. Training was very easy as well.The lack of professionalism throughout this particular site can be witnessed on a daily basis. There are limitations to the amount help agents can offer the callers. The company promoted from within, witch is a good policy.I loved being able to make a difference in a person day, especially the elderly and children who really depended on me!! i learned a great deal about patience with this employer!!Laid back usually.I learned a lot from older workers. Management was good. The hardest part was waiting for all safety to be checked to start work. The most enjoyable part was getting off work.A great place to grow and expand your knowledge. You can go far in the company and you're always learning new skills. They care about their employees and are very professional. Extremely kind managers that are willing to help.i recieved phone calls with angry and happy consumers i also leared learned how to use diffrent programs and be patient with calls i recieved despite the attitudes given.I stayed stressed out the whole time I was employed with the company most people there was friendly its just you had to deal with a lot of stressful things with the consumersjob started out with a two week training course which went way too fast but ended up being ok. the real stress started when i was thrown on the phones without any real training of a very confusing software database for healthcare consumers.Hi stress and confusing scripts, poorly designed software and hard to navigate. if you like to work in a challenging environment, where all my supervisor was concerned about was her numbers and ranking for her team. you stay on a call too long, its counted against you, clock out late, counted against you, only 2 short breaks and a 30 minute lunch. i felt too confined to my desk, felt bad for going to bathroom because it would be counted against adherence. the benefits are good although i never got a chance to use them. i got sick and missed three days and went over my allowed days. i would still be there had i not got ill. i miss the money but not the job.i enjoyed this helping people with their healthcare needs but also had many calls from frustrated consumers who were unhappy with there health insuranceAll we did in this job was answer calls of costumers asking us for more information about helots insurance we help them apply for insurances and fin the one that next fits their income I really liked how we had to socialize with people I live helping people so I think that's why I liked my jobGreat people and nice policies. I had very good experiences at GD. The military people are great to work with and appreciate things you do! Very good place to work!Positive environment, learning place, and wonderful co-workers. There is a lot of flexibility and everyone is very understanding. If you want to exceed expectations you need to ask and out in the effort to get there.Great entry level company for beginners looking for IT positions or supply chain warehouse jobs. Excellent healthcare benefits and flexible work hours.","10,000+",Washington,Springfield,VA,2016-10-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/0d008df6-b72e-4ca0-ba0b-dd6b77dab667?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=32,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
