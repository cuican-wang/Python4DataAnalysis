My manager is among the best, He does not micro-manage and lets you figure out the best solution to issues.We worked as a good team where all the ELT instructors were very well qualified for the job.  The management did their part and I enjoyed my work.  We were given all the help needed.Due to frequent acquisitions and work load, the work life balance is difficult. Management tends to stay put, leaving little room for others to grow into management roles.I work as a contractor so the environment is based on the customer, so far i've had a good experience in the workplace. As far as the company goes, it's based on the people which i've only met one which is my PM but he's cool. so its good representation.
