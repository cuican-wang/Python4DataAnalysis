92,3145.0,Data Scientist,The Advisory Board Company,3.6,71.0,"I was only an intern at the company for little over a month and a half last summer... but I had a great experience working for such a high end company for the first time.Working retail is like a surprise party, you never know what to expect but it will be wonderful When a customer enters the store I assist them with their every need, if it be a small gift for themselves, a gift for a special occasion, or a corporate gift. Personal service is key to customer service and it pleases me to provide it!I can honestly say that the people at the Advisory Board are the smartest I've ever worked with.  They're very technically savvy and interacting with them is pleasant (especially from my position in IT).  The business processes are somewhat outdated, but we're working to change them.  I'm very bullish on the future of ABC.I've loved working here. I would recommend anyone looking for place to start their career to look here. They are very fast, and systems oriented, and also offer great training. Very selective though.Company is filled with many bright and talented individuals. Training and onboarding are rapid and do not allow for an adjustment period. Management, unfortunately, likes to micro-manage. Benefits package is robust and more than generous. ""Work/Life Balance"" is touted often, but you are judged for not making your job part of your life.Fun place to work but definitely will have some growing pains. Need to work a lot of overtime for a very minimum salary. Will learn a lot and get support that you need but it is not the best place to work.great place to work for. lots of opportunity for someone with no experience in the work place. Lots of vacation, not enough time t take them.Over the 3 years I've worked at the company it has struggled to transition from a startup to a larger organization. Lot of the fun qualities that attracted top talent have left, along with the talent. The software is facing scaling issues and lacks the flexibility needed to stay competitive in the current market.Advisory Board is a great place to grow your career. You're going to be around highly motivated, and intelligent people, who are also there to see your succeed.A sincere company that earnestly wants to be as good as it can b, but is in conflict between product and service driven priorities.Great culture with brilliant employees, everyone is incredibly hard working but can make it difficult to maintain a reasonable workload.  Salaries are quite lowGreat culture and intelligent bunch of people to work with. Great opportunities for career advancement. Great benefits and paid time off. Only con that I can think of is that the compensation is a little low for entry level jobs.Great benefits, working with smart, great people. Can work from home, lots of PTO days. Management was chaotic, and they kept incompetent people around for way too long.I did not serve directly on this board as the contract that I was working under expired prior to a meeting being held.  The board was created to assess and recommend projects for the school.Difficult for career advancement for non-consulting positions. Transparency in communication of expectations across multiple areas is lacking. Collaborative working space. Benefits include typical health benefits, but also include gym memberships, healthy life hours, and community impact hours.Great work place to start right our of college.  Everyone is super young, including management.  Which is a draw-back.  Once you're no longer interested in an entry-level position, it is extremely difficult.Great people. Bad work/life balance. Decent managers that are transparent. A lot of work but good experience if you are a new graduate entering the workforce.Working for Crimson, the Austin-based subsidiary of the Advisory board, can be pretty rewarding. The office is modern, the people are smart, and there is potential to do exciting work. However, the company struggles with product acquisitions and working on one of those teams can be a nightmare. The company also struggles with its upper level management and strategies and during my time there I witnessed a lot of wasted money and effort because of meaningless corporate politics and misguided decisions. Finally, managers and directors talked a big game when it came to creating a solution for data analytics in the healthcare space but never showed or proved that they had even the slightest clue as to actually creating a marketable product in this category.The purpose of the one advisory board  was to improve communication, access to care and collaboration with other colleagues who were nurse educators to improve the MYO programABC is a fun place to work with great benefits and trips involved. They make it sound pretty glamorous as far as advancement, chanting that in 8-12 months with internal internship experience and great performance you are for sure going to get promoted and in turn make a high a salary... don't believe it.They find an ""excuse"" to deny almost every promotion, and hand out performance plans to ever entry level employeeA day in the concierge position is never Typical! anything can happen and anyone can come off of the elevator. You have to be aware of your surroundings and always one step ahead!","1,001 to 5,000",Washington,Washington,DC,2016-10-15T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/8f9c31d5-d25d-47da-99ac-dc98562d9a62?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=32,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
