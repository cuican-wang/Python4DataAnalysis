94,3147.0,"Sr. Data Scientist - Arlington, VA",Seneca Resources,4.0,7.0,"This company is more suitable for a skilled, younger person who is trying to start a career in the oil and gas industry and add this experience to his/her resume or a person who isn't highly interested in job advancement. I have not learned much because the options are very few for advancement at this company. I feel that the communication levels and people skills are below effective. In my case, there is no hardest or enjoyable part about the job.This job has always had me on my feet. I worked months straight. But at least I always had something to do. Although it was very productive, it would be hard at times. Mainly, because you have to find the appropriate person for the job.Seneca was a decent place to work but I was warned when I started by many of the employees that had been there for some time that they layoff frequently. One such employee told me she had survived 3 layoffs last year she was layed off. The company is very secretive about it and you won't know until it's too late. I enjoyed working here because it was an easy environment with good managers in my department. The layoff and the way they handled it made me feel very much betrayed by those that I had come to trust and regard as collegues.Great place to work. People were nice, and the environment was a nice office to work in. Always enjoyed the holiday parties and company picnics.Great place to learn the ins and out of the oil and gas industry. Co-workers where helpful and friendly in all aspects of work. Great overall working environment.I enjoyed my work experience here.  The variety was great, coming from a specialized focus in the oilfield, I was able to broaden my knowledge of all completions processes.nice place to work , all employes fun to work with, there is no hard parts about the job and i enjoyed leaning the ins and outs of the gas industry",,Washington,Arlington,VA,2016-10-03T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/623752bc-7b46-487e-bb0f-9fdd429faafb?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=34,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
