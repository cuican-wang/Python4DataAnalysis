124,2538.0,"Data Scientist - New York, NY",Brooks Brothers,4.0,199.0,"Needs to go public to fund growth. Allocation issues, but loyal following. Generations shop here. Quality is second to none, ties made in USA,With the retail climate it is not the time to reduce pay, take away 90% of the salesforce commission. Generally a very difficult place to work and many people leaving. I have stepped up my sales where I sell more than double the sales associate under me. I was named Senior Sales Associate due to my hourly rate was increased by eight dollars and hour.I work best when a company recognize and reward great employees and I am willing to give my best to do my job to the best of my ability.When I first was hired, BB was a great company to work for. Management changes and a poor retail environment resulted in no room for advancement, position wise as well as salary. Base salary is not based (at least for entry level) on skill/experience, but set at a specific value and isn't negotiable. Some co-workers became my best friends, other co-workers disliked me greatly and made it harder for me to do my work. No comp time for hours worked over 40, which I did often. Rarely took a lunch break- it was assumed you ate lunch at your desk. Employee discount was a huge perk.Brooks Brothers is a diversity company that gives every associate or member an opportunity to develop.You start above the minimum payment, and help to raise within your role, store and company.I enjoyed my time at Brooks Brothers I leaned business part of retail which is exciting.  Seeing product from inception to the store.Everyone needed to work well as a team in order to get goods on time.Typical day:  Answer emails, vendor questions, HK Team questions.Management: Was OK.  Co-Workers - GreatHardest part of my job- able to leave on-time.  Over-workedMost enjoyable part of my job - the people. Team envirementBrooks Brothers, has sadly, began the slow decline that so many retailers are now embracing. Associates, because they don't want salespeople anymore, are hourly, and not a very good hourly. Their seasoned staff, with books full of clients, are leaving. This is not a job to support a family, or to turn into a career. It used to be, but it just isn't that, and they're alright with that.The discount is very good, at 60% off. There is a built in client base, but that doesn't really matter, as you're not paid that way anymore. The stores are beautiful, and the product is luxurious, but the expectation of management, and the customer, of you, the associates, is no longer worth the money they're paying. If you want a good job, to make some money while in college, or to bridge yourself between jobs, no a bad gig, especially for the discount.Brooks Brothers is a company that continues to challenge its associates on a daily basis. A typical day in the assistant manager position involves ensuring day to day operations are met as well as surpassing sales goals. Through this company I've learned exceptional interpersonal skills and management styles that are imperative to running a successful business.The day usually begins with a meeting on Results, Execution, Performance, and Preparations (REPP). Over the years, I have learned how to provide excellent services to our diverse clients. Being reliable and efficient at all times. The management is very focused on building a ""great place to work"", putting smile on the face of all our clients, and meeting our targets. Co-workers are made up of people with diverse features but I enjoy working with them.Management is great. Easiest job I've ever had but is boring most of the time. Spend 90% of the time standing around with nothing to do.overall this is a great company and a great place to work, there are some things that need to be enhanced like every other job, but other then that management cares about their employees, and everyone is always willing to help each otherCompany has found ways to weed out associates who had been the backbone of the organization for years and kept generations coming through the door. Co-workers had their share of ups and downs including no more commission but try and work together for the most part.Like most warehouse work, the day is long and repetitive. The actual work isn't vert physically demanding though. I was trained in various duties, such as using scanners and operating forklifts. The management is very poor. Section Leaders are lazy and irritable, and upper management is very out of touch.Most co-workers are very friendly and helpful, but a large number speak little to no English. The hardest part of the day is the unrewarding work and low pay, but the people you work with might just make the day more enjoyable.The day to day workings of Brooks Brothers is just like any other retailer.  You help customers find what they are looking for; you process shipment; you help train any associates on areas that they might need a little help in; you work with the team to reach goal reach day.  What I have learned from here and from other retail jobs I have had it is about the people/team.  You need to find a good balance between a fun work place and a place where work comes first.  Part of that is knowing your team and knowing how to motivate them properly, however you need to set standards and expectations that are equal across the board. For me the hardest part of that balance is making sure the fun happens and that it is not just all work.  In the end the no matter how hard the work is or how difficult the customers might be, the people you work with make the job.  Our job really is people; how to motivate, personalize, sell too, or help out.  That is what I have learned as a manager and I think it has made me a better leader.Great owner, managment team and people,,associates are treated more like family than employees. I would recomend Brooks Brothers to anyone looking for a career in retailManagement and higher ups are used to doing things are certain way and are unwilling to change with the times. There is a lack of organization that needs to be worked on within departments.Brooks Brothers is a company that allows to interact and serve customers in an excellent manner.I truly enjoy selling, however with recent management chance and shrink rate, there has been alot of changes and with co-workers leaving the job and taking medical leaves and absences there has been toll on the remaining employees. With the amount of work and scheduled timing the pay rate isn't worth the effort.Overall, it is truly a great organization that hold amazing values, I love the clients and our products best.This place is ok because it can give you multi-task opportunity of working experience, and the shoppers from all over the world would make you see many aspect of personality in many people. Also, it would practice your skill of teamwork.this is a great company to work for except the general manager gets away with harassment and discrimination. no team work or upper mobility. you live on a island when you work for this company because they only see what they want to see....A typical day at work consists of keeping the store stocked and up to visual standards, shipping out any orders that have been placed, reaching out to customers, and above all providing exceptional customer service to everyone that walks in the door.  Management is fair, and willing to answer any questions.  They will not go out of their way to help you with everything---you are required to think for yourself.  Co-workers are someof the best friends I have.  We are a tight knit crowd.  The hardest part of the job is getting business in a mall that is failing.  The most enjoyable part is making a difference in a customers personal and professional life.Great company to work for. All of my coworkers are amazing people and fun to work with. Beautiful product to work with and the clients are usually pleasant to work with. Technology wise the company is pretty outdated.I enjoyed my time at Brooks Brothers I leaned business part of retail which is exciting. Seeing product from inception to the store.Everyone needed to work well as a team in order to get goods on time.","1,001 to 5,000",New-York,New York,NY,2016-10-24T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/74c7c914-afe6-419a-9584-b7e20f741208?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
