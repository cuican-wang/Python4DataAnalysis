It was a great environment to work in and if you worked hard the reward was great.I have watched the company deteriorate over the last 6 years. There doesn't seem to be a clear direction/vision. I am very dissatisfied with the current state of affairs.A strong company with excellent training program and support. If commission sales is your thing then i highly recommend working for the New Jersey General Office.High pace environment that was different each day. I enjoyed the people I worked with while there. The hardest part of the job was really short deadlines and changes mid job. I still made all my deadlines.Had a lot of fun and learned alot from everyone there.
