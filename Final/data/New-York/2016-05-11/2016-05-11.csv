514,2928.0,Scientist (Analytical Chemistry-Agilent GC-MS; Food Science; Flavor Chemistry),Mondelez International,4.0,1100.0,"Great place to work.  I love my job.  Little chance for advancement.  Co-workers treat you like famly, along with management.Open and inclusive company culture.Benefits and compensation for jobs are better than average for the local area.20 PTO days to start plus company holidays.Work/life balance is very good depending on department and immediate manager.Opportunities to learn via inter-company site as well as tuition reimbursement is available.Even though Mondelez is a better than average company to work for they are constantly changing by shifting jobs from one place to another. Cost cutting measures have resulted in jobs being shifted off shore and lots of layoffs or strict job cuts here in the US.Job roles and department responsibilities have changed as well. So if you get hired, don't plan on staying in one spot for too long.I've worked for this Co. for over 36 long years and I've seen many changes which I was able to adapt. The Co.has enjoyed many year of profitable success products that sold to the consumer good products. But then the formula changed and the consumers became aware of it. Management has changed there was a lack of communication between the labor force and management.  What was once a family affair it became just business. Overall the Co has endured so many obstacles and it's in business and making huge profits.Do a quick store review to check current display activity, sell in opportunities are competitive information.  Meet with decision makers to see if they have anything to cover are anything that i should be aware of.Discuss and sell against objectives,Merchandise delivery and write a shelf /display order.I learned how to build relations, listen and sell to the customers needs/and how to be a valued sales representative.Management was knowledgeable, informative ,and understanding.Co-workers were them players,Positive, and fun to be around.Hardest part of the job building  huge displays and merchandising large orders.The most enjoyable part of the job is selling and making your objective.Overall, Mondelez is a fair place to work.   The Sales and Marketing Organization is World Class.There is huge Financial pressures to deliver Quarterly Earnings Results which is consistent with a Publicly Traded CPG Company.  Senior Management is obsessed with cost cutting facilitated by broad workforce reductions.  Invariably, these Organizational Reductions come with promises of working simpler and more streamlined.  The Company is great at delivering cost reductions but has a very poor track record in alleviating what are at times unbearable workloads.  They have consistently reduced employee benefits cutting Pension, Health Benefits, Travel Expenses, downgraded salaries and have outsourced many positions overseas.  In the HQ Location in East Hanover, NJ, Sales, Marketing and Operations Management is top notch.  The Finance Leadership Team  are not very good at motivating their employees and collaborating with cross functional business partners. Finally, due to ongoing headcount reductions, there is very limited career opportunities for motivated professionals particularly in Finance, Marketing and Sales.A typical day as a Sales Rep for Mondelez International starts at around 7am. The rep goes from store to store to stock the shelves with Nabisco products and ensure the product is executed properly, then the rep writes an order for the next delivery and communicates any changes in the ad with store management. Sales Reps for Mondelez do not usually get to work with other employees, they are out on their own in the field on a daily basis. All company communication is made through emails and phone conferences.As with any large corporation there isn't any room for advancement if you do not have a 4 year college degree AND agree to re-locating.  This company is under going many changes especially within the DSD business.  Making many lay-offs and management changes.As long as you do your work ,they do not bother you. They respect your views and your work. My co-workers were fine. Management was great, Some of the work was back breaking but for the most part it was fine. The most enjoyable part of my work was knowing my job responsibilities and doing it well.A typical day at work is putting out fires caused by a culture afraid of change. I learned that most people want to just go with the flow. Management wasn't consistent in enforcement of change and discipline. Most of my co-workers wanted to do a good job, but didn't feel they had proper support. The hardest part of the job was getting the support need to make change. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning the process.Some of the best brands on the market that almost sell themselves. Still a lot of good people even though many good leaders and employees have left the organization through all the mergers, acquisitions, restructures and downsizes during recent years.  Top leaders are very focused on international growth and are implementing a lot of cost cutting measures in the US to get the business model more in-line with other countries.  The DSD sales force will continue to be be challenged as resources are increasingly leaned and it becomes more difficult to make the customers needs a top priority.  Company is a huge promoter of diversity.Great brands, good people, safe and clean work environment, great benefits, very strong senior management team, co workers distributed across the globe, work varies, based upon assignment.  Impressive commitment from the employees and a very innovative company with product lines, e-commerce and otherTerrible management,long hours,equals about 7 dollars an hours,customers only citizens and yell. no real schedule to plan things w/ family.The company really only cares about sales,do yourself a favor and look else where.Not your typical micro managed company if your self motivated, like fast paced work, and being around people.    My management is great to work with and for.  Nice being able to work and use your organizational skills.Mondelez International is a place of employment where an individual can provide a life for their family because of the great pay and benefit package. It is the type of employer that a person can retire from. The environment is helpful and management seems to be willing to listen to hourly input.Stable company, work independently, good benefits, dental,medicalvision and time off, short and long term disabilities, paid holidays. Minimum supervision, good management.MDLZ has a great corporate reputation and is an extremely ethical and responsible company. Like others in its industry, it's been under constant pressure to cut costs and streamline operations, and the ongoing restructuring over the past several years has taken a toll on people--but company has been delivering better performance in the past few years as a result, and it's clear there's some culture change happening.I enjoy my job and working for Mondelez International, but I need to have a more secure full time job with benefits.  Working independently and with stores and their managers is a rewarding experience.  The company is well established and growing and I wish I could receive full time employment only it is not being offered at this time.A typical day at work is going into big box retailers and grocery stores, doing deliveries, re-stocking, displays, etc.  Since Mondelez took over after they split, has not been that favorable.  Part time employees are treated like they do not matter, the hours are often cut without warning. We do not get bonuses like the full time merchandisers too.  You can be the best part time merchandiser with the best reviews from the company and stores and not move up the ladder.  It is a sad reality.  The raises are minimal at best. And the corporate culture needs to be overhauled.  There really is no hard part about this job, it is a no brainer. But one thing I would change is letting part time merchandisers know about products coming out.  Give us the same respect that the full time merchandisers get. We work just as hard, we deserve that too.The work  assignment are given, such as what line to work , what  job you are to perform at that line.  And how long to work there before going to another position on that line. I've learn to operate industrial machine / equipment. Stock machine with supplies, inspect product for defects  and verify code dates and labels are correct.Management did their job controlling the company, and making decision that they felt  was best for the company.The workers was great and we worked together as a team, helping out were needed and assisting. The most difficult part was remembering the loading ordering for each different cookies after learning that the and increase your speed for feeding the job became less complicated.The enjoyable  part of the job was working manually, and at your own speed or when working on the, line  every hour you switch to another job on that line  .This is a great company to work and grow with. They really care about their employee's. You can advance your position with the company based on skills not seniority. Their sales department train program is very detailed.As with any large corporation, there are many positives and negatives that go with a job in their Sales force.Positives include great benefits, opportunity to grow and advance within the company and bonuses and financial awards that compete with any company in its specialization area.One negative is that a work day is never done in Sales, depending on the region you work in the workload can be very heavy at times. Since I was in a densely populated area, I would spend all my time in the field dealing with shelf conditions and selling to managers. This would leave me having to do most of my extensive computer work at home after work which was not fully paid for. While these sacrifices are normal with any job, they were a little bit excessive.","10,000+",New-York,East Hanover,NJ,2016-05-11T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/61f6f53d-9e1a-421f-82a5-8044211c2f11?mescoid=1900245001001&jobPosition=14,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
