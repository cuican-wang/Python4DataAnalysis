130,2544.0,Data Scientist II,MediaMath,3.3,10.0,"Dynamic working environment, lots of communication. Good work-life balance. Free pantry, table tennis. Good place to get involved in online advertising industry.When I worked at MediaMath the place was going through many changes therefore it was very disorganized to the point it was not clear who I was reporting to.Very relaxed work environment, enjoyable, all colleagues are extremely friendly, one has the ability to work on many interesting projects!I was attracted to work at MediaMath because it had a fantastic reputation in its industry and the unique challenges that the company is taking on. I was pleasantly surprised and thrilled, however, to find that it is also an extremely friendly and fun place to work- your co-workers are brilliant, quirky people who come from all sorts of backgrounds (my colleagues worked previously as fashion designers, animators, non-profit workers...so there is always an interesting story). Most importantly, these brilliant people are excited and happy because they feel trusted by management to try new things and work in the manner in which the will be most successful. All in, I feel at home on my team and valued by everyone I interact with.Management and leadership are not great, they are extremely disorganized and not proactiveMy experience at MediaMath has been good, and I have experienced a good amount of growth from a professional stand-point. As is the case for most start-ups, the environment and structure is constantly changing, which for me has been the hardest part of the job. I have had 4 managers and been a part of 3 teams. That instability has caused me to want to seek out other opportunities that may fit my needs a little better. Dynamic team - Great offering -Fantastic culture - Empowering leaders - Busy working environment; MediaMath is a pioneer in digital media., you can learn a lot of digital advertising industry. People are smart and energetic .Generally speaking good people. Most part work is clear. Management could use some training.co-workers are very helpful. I learned a lot about the complex product that they have and various features of it.",201 to 500,New-York,New York,NY,2016-10-13T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/7aeeb840-6fb7-40d1-877b-05c2759189b3?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

317,2731.0,"Medical Science Liaison/Sr MSL, Pulmonology, Rheumatology, and Ophthalmology - New York City",Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals,3.5,51.0,"Radioactive pharmaceuticals is a very challenging job and can be very demanding.  There are a lot of good folks working at the site and  a lot of experience with radioactive materials and sterile manufacturing.Mallinckrodt is a decent place to work with collaborative management. Work life balance is good, but future is uncertain since company is changing directions.Working under a contract in IT & enjoy working here.  It's a nice campus & they have plenty of work to keep you busy in IT.I've been trying to take on additional technical work (my level), but have been doing a lot of what I'd previously used summer interns for.  Inventory, Asset Management, Decom, etc.I don't mind easy tedious work to help clear backlog, but would like to put my experience & skills to better use.I have been here for a year and love it! The people are great, very diverse, lots of god perks including tranquility room, concierge, great pay and benefits.My typical day at work involves a continuous flow of projects from Production Floor manufacturing issues to Product/R&D assistance. I typically have a list of priorities as well as being on call for any production floor issues that arise. I do everything from data collection for engineering projects to electrical and mechanical component design. I assist the technicians and quality inspectors to resolve any issue beyond their skill set.           I have learned a great deal about medical device design and verification. My current position enables me to work with a wide variety of employees with varying levels of knowledge and experience and participate in many cross functional team projects.      In most cases, management provides room to work. We are usually empowered to manage our own time and projects with management support or intervention when needed.      The hardest part of my job is the increasing workload. When I was hired into the Engineering Office, we had a nine engineers. The office has been streamlined to three engineers and a technical specialist. Additionally, I am constantly on loan to R&D for technical support and special design projects.      The most enjoyable part of my job is being constantly on the move. I have never went to work and couldn't find something to do.We were acquired by Mallinckrodt and therefore based on the merger it wasn't really enough time to make an accurate assessment however during the short time I worked for them it seemed good.  My manager was responsive and listened.This company has a very dysfunctional corporate culture.  Management does not care about employees and layoffs come at a rapid rate.Company is very knowledgeable of USP standards.  Very well kept.  Quality is very important to company.  Quick turn-around for testing compared to needing shipped,Mediocre management, poor culture and disappointing business results. Reversed all the best things about Questcor since the takeover.The R&D group that i worked with were incredibly knowledgable in their fields.  The group that I was involved with was like a family.  The senior management is currently changing focus and doing away with R&D.I loved my position at this company. However, the company had just recently acquired another pharmaceutical company and there were a lot of issues with the management, i.e. no training, behavioral issues, etc. I trained myself in my position, and I absolutely loved it. I wanted to have a stable, permanent job with benefits and longevity, so I voluntarily resigned.My job duties were as follows:Processing educational grant requests, ensuring that all paper work is submitted by grantee, and coordinating meetings with grant committee for approval or declines of submissions. Processing financial awards for educational grants, fellowship grants, and investigator initiated studies.Processing all expenses and invoices for medical affairs department and following up with checks.Tracking finances and making sure they are paid out in an orderly manner. Coordinating events for MSLs—-booking venues, arranging transportation, food, etc. Ensuring that training certificates for MSLs in certain therapeutic areas are up-to-date.Work assignments were given on a weekly basis.Testing was completed on a day to day basis ending with a notebook write up and final results were entered into a sample management system.  Project work was also included.Learning was a continual process at Mallinckrodt with training updates that where to be completed within 30 days.I also continued to perfect my use of the Chromeleon data acquisition software that was previously updated within the company.The management team I was associated with were extremely supportive and encouraging to their direct reports.My co-workers were very professional and supportive, as well as some of the best people that I have ever worked with.My career with Mallinckrodt was very enjoyable.  I have to say that the best part of my job was the type of work I performed as well as the people I worked with.It was an all around great place to work.Provides good training and fair management.  Advancement opportunities if you work hard.  Has been proactive in buying companies for more opportunities.A great place to work and advance your career.  A pay for performance culture focused on delivering results and increasing shareholder value.I great place to work if you work in pharmaceutical manufacturing and a good stepping stone to larger pharmaceutical companies.  Management is very helpful and supportive if you show initiative to grow within the company.  Unfortunately the imaging division is downsizing and morale is very low with a high stress level among staff not knowing if they will be laid off.  There is a true spirit of team work among workers and will do what needs to be done to get the job done well.It's a fun working place. One of the good pharma companies in Saint Louis area. Management and co-workers are also good. Nice place for someone to start a career.Provided educational environment with the possibility of advancement.  A challenging company that encourages innovative solutions to technical challenges.  Co-workers were fun and interesting and provided support and assistance when needed.Job provided the ability to pursue additional areas of interest such as .net programming and XML and encouraged advanced development techniques and approaches.Questcor Pharmaceuticals was acquired by Mallinckrodt and the chaos began: layoffs, downsizing etc. The base compensation package stayed the same but bonus potential was slashed.The company has terrible management and incredible turnover.  The flagship products: Exalgo and Pennsaid 2% are great.Acquisition intensive, growing company based in st louis with companies spread around the country and a few internationally.Great company with great compensation and benefits.  Very horizontal structure with management.",,New-York,New York,NY,2016-10-13T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/b5447956-480b-466e-a3ef-7982ce2d6de2?mescoid=1900254001001&jobPosition=27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
