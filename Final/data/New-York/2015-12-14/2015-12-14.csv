183,2597.0,Sr. Data Scientist - User & Product Analytics,Tumblr,4.3,6.0,"Tumblr has recently announced that they will start paying bloggers, however this is to come in the future. For now you need to seek third party businesses in order to monetize your site. Depending on your traffic, it is good passive income.Tumblr was honestly an amazing place to start working because it set the standards high for all my future work environments. My managers were supportive and effective and my coworkers were friendly. The company fostered a really open work environment were people were encouraged to mingle with other departments and understand how other people's work affected them. I think the free food and casual atmosphere helped people take breaks and socialize when they needed to and to get more work done without burning out.Most importantly, my job taught me how tech and social media companies work and how intellectual property laws affect them. It was a fascinating look into the way site policies were informed and reformed as well.Great culture and growing company. Fun place to work and think on your feet. Have the ability to make an impact on the company and bottom line.I joined Tumblr blogging web site in 2012, to share and contribute my love of the hit cable series, The Walking Dead.  The site is nicely outlined and formatted for experienced bloggers and writers to compose stories, fiction, media footage, quotes, and photos.  Many bloggers have thousands of followers, others have several hundred. Presently, Tumblr is the only media blog site I know of that is solely dedicated to Entertainment.  It also is a terrific avenue for newbies to practice and perfect their writing, designing, and blogging skills.Tumblr has trained me for this social media frenzy of a world we live in and has taught me the essentials. Trend-forecasting and fashion history research played a major part as well.",51 to 200,New-York,New York City,NY,2015-12-14T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/a99d17d3-7908-450d-80be-6c69981aeb57?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
