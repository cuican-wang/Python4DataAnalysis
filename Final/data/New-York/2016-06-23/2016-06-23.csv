161,2575.0,Sr. Data Scientist,PulsePoint,3.7,7.0,"Pulsepoint is awesome! I am seriously the biggest cheerleader for this company and regularly hit up my friends for recommendations/referrals.  Did I mention the company pays $10,000 for employee referrals??  Awesome perk. The culture is great - everyone is young and has a work hard, play hard mentality. The management here is also something to highlight. I respect and admire my managers and leaders so much. They are always giving me constructive criticism and are open to feedback. I can always go to them for help and I feel very comfortable with them. I truly enjoy coming to work everyday.I started here about 6 months ago and I can see myself here for years to come. So much growth potential and opportunity. If you put the effort in, it pays off in the end and will be recognized and acknowledged.The best job I've had to date yet. A typical day would be creating new users/ fixing things around the office. I would also be sent to the data center to fix servers if they went down. I've learned so much about systems administration at pulse point due to all my co-workers interest in seeing me grow intellectually.Very toxic place to work in, especially finance department. No work-life balanceI had my great internship at Pulsepoint this summer. It is a great place to learn, build-up your skills, and most importantly, have fun. As an intern, I was given a well-organized and planned intern plan on my day 1 and was assigned with a mentor. My mentor was very sharing, smart, patient, and responsive. They asked a lot ""what you have learned"" rather ""what you have done for them"". I felt I wasn't just an intern, but a part of the team and a part of the ""culture"". Little dreams matter and ""interns"" matter!The work days are very busy. Fast pace environment. I became proficient at Great Plains while working at this company. Mgmt is great and I get along great with y peers.Great company and management!  I learned how to be very flexible and wear many hats!This is a great company to work for. Management truly cares about their employees. Excellent work life balance and great benefits. Very fun atmosphere as wellCompensation can be a bit better.",51 to 200,New-York,New York,NY,2016-06-23T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/da2544fa-8fb6-4fb2-a62c-0f201a848102?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
