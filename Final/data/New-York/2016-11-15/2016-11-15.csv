94,2508.0,Data Scientist,VDart Inc,3.1,27.0,"VDart is an awesome place to work. People are very helpful, prompt, supportive and professional. My recruitment and on boarding was quite quick and seamless.They gave me an excellent opportunity and I have been hired by the client fulltime. I have referred my friend and he has been working with VDart for the last few weeks, they gave me a referral fee as well without asking :)This was one of the worst experiences ever. They are in India and you really cannot understand them. I had to send and resend my paperwork I don't know how many times. It's like it got lost in some black hole and it's personal information (which is a little scary.) There insurance is ridiculously expensive.  There management team is very young but my issue with them is they had no idea what you were doing on a day-to-day basis.  They were not trained for what we did. They came from other projects and were constantly stressed out. There was no consistency.The Best Company I have ever worked. Good work ethics and friendly environment.Well Qualified and experienced Staff.It was an immense pleasure to work with Vdart Inc.Fun and exciting company. You get to be involved in a lot of things you wouldn't experience in a large company. Get more knowledge on different skills as this organization spends more money on making the employee be cross skilled as well. Has good number of clients and well established technical expertise to kick-start your career. Leads are very cooperative and lots of opportunity to make money.This is the worst agency i ever worked for. They don't appreciate the business and it's not that easy to get paid. I have to fight for my money every month.VDart is an awesome place to work - great people, great technology, great challenges, great package and perks. Professional growth is encouraged. There's not a sense of clock-watching or micromanagement in the organization. You are trusted to perform. The culture encourages you to work above and beyond, and can help folks progress their careers. Smart, hardworking people, good managers, training is available, benefits are very good, work is interesting, culture is pretty goodThe company has a good management team. In the initial stages I had a few problems but the company took a great effort and initiative in solving them. They respond to emails in time. Some  people in the company lack communication which the company needs to overcome. Overall I suggest its a great company to work with.This is an excellent place to work with and it is still going great. They have an excellent team in India that were extremely nice and helpful. There were endless opportunities and an excellent environment over there. Everything was great except for one small thing: communication skills. Now, obviously since they worked in India, the employees over there could not speak perfect English, but it was not only that, they would sometimes not email me on time and not explain why. It was the only bad thing that i experienced, but it was still a great experience and i would definitely work with them again.These people say they are in Georgia, but their workers are in India.  They barely understand English.  And here's the big thing.  They lose your paperwork on purpose so they won't have to pay you!  That is beyond stupid!  I've literally been waiting for my first paycheck for three months all because they keep claiming: ""We don't have your paperwork.""  Despite the fact that they give me the address that I put on the envelope, somehow it still gets lost in the mail.After promising a rate, they went back on it and offered a lower rate. Their attitude sounds unprofessional. They call at inappropriate times. They do not provide their real names and go around using fake names.Everything started off so good....nice people, great pay, even benefit coverage for consultant at a reasonable amount.The problem: no pay day!  I have adjusted my lifestyle to a once a month payday and now you tell me that youre sorry about this oversight?  This is not acceptable! I have been a contractor for over 20 years and this has ""never"" happened.  Even worse...there is no one locally to help resolve, only the guy overseas who never resolves anything...constant swirl and fake promises.  Management needs to really, really get this together as this type of behavior lacks integrity and breeds total mistrust.The recruiter scheduled a fake interview apparently as a joke.  I waited for a response as to why the client never showed up for the interview and never heard from vDart.  Very professional !!!VDart is a great company to work for. I never had to call the company for any issues while working as a contractor for 6 months. With their good efforts I was also able to get a full time opportunity in the company I worked as a contractor. Thank you VDart.Been with VDart for over 5 years now, incredible learning experience so far, fun place to work, creativity at its best, provides adequate growth opportunities. Strong mentoring program delivered by industry leaders in which employees get to participate. Uses latest tools for employee engagement.I have worked with this company as a contractor almost for 3 Years till now. Very good management and the employers pay in time. They answered all my calls with patience and helped me during my immigration . I am very glad to work with them.I have been calling these folks for days after being told I was supposed to begin my assignment on July 1, 2014.  I put in a notice for this job.  I cannot get anyone to return my call...not even the second party client (HCL America).  I am supposed to start working through HCL America and TIAA-CREF since the three interviews I had produced a job offer but no one will return my calls.  Do I start tomorrow and if so...where?  Hey, this is affecting my livelihood.  This isn't India..this is the US and we have laws against this type of action, don't we?Got to learn a new tool and new technology.Working environment was friendly.This is the worse contracting agency I've worked for.  After contracting for the last 9 yrs, I have to say this particular contract is a mistake. They say they have an office in Atlanta, but they never want to talk on the phone.  They always ask for an email but do not respond to the email.  You end up calling them back.  45 days to get your paycheck?  That's not an industry standard.  Want it earlier?  Sure.  They'll work with you for a price.  1.5% of your pay to get it 30 days after invoice (which is actually the standard), and 3% if you want it two (2) weeks after invoicing.  But they will not guarantee you'll get it on time, even though you are paying them to get it to you on time.They will push you to do corp to corp.  No support structure.  Their only interest in you is that they get a paycheck from you.  They have no idea what's taking place on-sight.  When you explain it to them, they ask for an email but never respond.  I've turned in my notice and I'm moving on.  Take my advice, don't make the mistake like I did and take a job with this company.Prior to the contracting job, VDart handled the paperwork and was able to clearly and professionally answer all my questions.  During the contracting job, VDart answered completely any questions or concerns.  The first payment was missing, but it was quickly resolved.  Future payments onwards were on time with advance email communication that payment was issued.  Overall a positive experience.  Would work with VDart again in the future.Great pay..provide you the required documentation on time...good marketing  team...i dint had a any issue with themFor the year and a half I worked through VDart I have to say that it was a positive experience. Everytime I had an issue with the customer, my VDart rep worked hard and fast to resolve the issue. Most of the time this involved going to bat for me to get me more money. By the time I left my ending rate was 20% higher than my starting. I've never had a company get me raises without even asking for it.","501 to 1,000",New-York,New York,NY,2016-11-15T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/4b1c2dbb-8e4d-4b4d-9960-700e4f8e1aed?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
