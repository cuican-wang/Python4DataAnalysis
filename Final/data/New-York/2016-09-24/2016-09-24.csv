10,2424.0,Senior Data Scientist & Quantitative Trading Analyst,ICE,3.7,72.0,"Great Work environment with positive attitude you will succeed and make great pay and enjoy the friendly staff and customers free food and lots of room for growthI worked shift work with a team. I would stock shelves, food items and assist cleaning crew to help out. I was always told that I was a good team player. My most enjoyable was seeing that the work I had done was done right and others benefitted from it.They didn't tell me when they hired me that it was only going to be for three weeks while the manager was visiting family in Chicago. So I came to get my pay check and they told me they no longer needed me.I enjoyed my coworkers, and there was potential to make a good salary through bonus and daily spiffs. I'd recommend it to someone looking for a sales job.Everyday is always busy.  There is always something to do.I learned how to use great plain (another accounting software).I enjoyed working with my coworkers and they are easy to get along with. I live and learn alot during my employment there with Ice.Overall, the established system provides a good sense of job security; allowing for expectation of long term employment. A very dynamic operation with lots of moving parts allowing for significant multitasking and obtaining solid results...more accomplishments than the general public knows or understand.  However, at times not enough time in the day to accomplish all that is desired.Typical day is good .I learned who to trust yourself.Management is good.My co-workers are good persons.No hardest par of the job.My co- workers are the most enjoyable part of the the job.All sales and you are just a number. If you have family issues like a death in the family. They put work first. I would not go back thereEnjoyable work environment with hard-working, reliable coworkers. Management was laid back but dependable. Owners are very good people and are extremely involved in their business. Most enjoyable part of the job was bartending and meeting new people. The hardest part of the job was being short-staffed, sometimes management approved other servers/kitchen staff to leave early.My GM was not a nice person. he was very rude to his employees and never gave any hours to anyone but just one person that he was having a relationship with. I am happy they are no longer a businesswork is routine and atmosphere is very dry. Management fears lawsuits so they keep allowing bad employees to stay around. Hard to promote or get a permanent position due to veterans preference.* Constant ongoing training* Good Management* Talented people to work with.* Cafeteria on site* Public transportation close byThis is a dead end job with no opportunity for growth. It was completely unprofessional. They are not timely with shift bids, coaching's or year end reviews. The job requirements and expectations certainly surpass the pay with new job requirements being added on weekly and your pay staying the same.CONS: Must absorb OT on lunch hour. no sick days. lack of communication between management and employees. no concern for non-sales positions. PTO is not handled in a timely manner and the logic behind it makes no sense.Typical day consitst of managing contracts, initiating case investigations, participating in outreach efforts, participating in operation shield, auiditing, creating presentations for managment meetings, ectI learned both physical and personnel security rules, regulations, and requirementsManagement was awsome, everything was structured and very organizedMy coworkers were very supportive, knowledgeable, team playersThe hardest part about this job was actually leaving, even though it was for a promotion. The people wer the most enjoyable part about the job, being about to do outreach activities with those who were really passionate about the support in the community.This was a home based position. I loved every minute of it. My team was amazing, our management team was always available to help and assist us. The pay structure was great. I learned more than I could of ever thought about the travel industry and got the opportunity to  take advantage of many gifts that were available to the employees. Â Worked with a very difficult colleague and the leadership team did nothing to improve the work environment. Legacy mindset company and needs a evolve into the 21st century.A typical workday consisted of me coming in around 10:45 and getting ready to answer calls and then getting on the inbound que.I would selling vacation membership packages for sears vacations or government vacation rewards. Typically customers have a very specific vacation at a specific time and I try to convince them to be flexible to save money and even do it on a payment plan.Job was good, stressful at times and very busy. Management was lax in some areas and too stringent in others.  Co-workers were often unreliable and tried to make others do their work.The most enjoyable part of the job is working with numbers and people.Dealing with human resources and payroll.I loved payroll.Ready to retire from the governmentVery competitive & a lot of favoritism. Difficult to advance do to culture.The typical work day is manageable. However advancement for non-law enforcement employees continues to be a barrier for those who have experience, education and or military status.",,New-York,New York,NY,2016-09-24T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/303db0bd-dc55-44be-bb88-d4655c21f451?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
