275,2689.0,Tech Svc Scientist (I),NBTY,3.5,134.0,"The employees didn't help as often. Some of the employers were self motivated in getting a group effort job done. But overall I enjoyed working for the company I'm a self starter so even though I didn't get as much help as I was suppose to there were other individuals on different lines that did come help outGreat place to work,learned very quick most of the jobs on the packaging floor.Only problem is the hiring process.I literally have 2 supervisors pushing to get me hired because i already know almost every position and am just a great worker overall but still nothing.Not to mention alot of perm employees limit themselves to one position.This is a company with a lot of potential but due to unfit senior Mgt the company has gone downhill for some time. Unlikely that the brands will get back to their old glory anytime soon with current leadership team.NBTY has not only been a place of work it has been my second home. The experienced and knowledge acquired in in the years working for NBTY is incredible. Definitely a great place to work!Management plays a huge role in an associate not being able to balance work and home.  Very stressful and demanding.  Limited resources for the associates to do the task at hand.  Outdated equipment with difficulty retaining parts.  Limited amount of staff to complete projects as scheduled.I really never knew what I was going into on any day.  I've learned various differences between pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals which were very interesting to me.The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the associates and getting to know them on a more personal level.  I've always had a hands on in all that I do.  I can personally relate to the typical associate because I started my career the same way.Is a nice place to work, good enviroment and clean. People are friendly. The job is easy and the management care about associates. Its a safety place to work.NBTY was a great company to work for a few years ago. It was full of optimism, creativity and growth. Typical day was productive and efficient. It is best suited for recent graduates or entry level positions looking to get your feet wet. It now has become top heavy by made up CO positions and they keep trying to reinvent the wheel making all parts of the company work less efficiently and productively. I truly did love this company and was happy to go there. Now myself and coworkers dread each day that goes by and the company continues to drag us down. There is so much speculation that the company is going to be sold and slowly the brands are breaking down. Who knows what the future holds for this company but as of right now it is incredibly unstable. I wish there was better outlook but I have yet to see a positive change.I have worked for this company for 8 years. I have done lots of things. It is a bit crazy at  times where you do not know what is going ot hit you from one day to the nextin  my years at nbty I learned a lot I can run a line set up the line and also take lead of that line. my co workers respected  me when I was lead.. shift change over was very hard had to get ready for my own shiftvery unhealthy working enviorment the job status is not very secure constantly switching departments not to many workers in each departmentA typical day at work consist of me going into a morning meeting, then going into the office and releasing products or evaluating products.Good company good hours, my coworkers show a lot of teamwork . I learned how to run the machine, how to read work orders  I think is a great company  good benefits  and  and I'm looking for something to match itbest company to work, professional management, international acclaimed company,diversity of products - vitamins, minerals, herbs,supplements.good working environment. moderated benefitsManagement can try to keep a better eye on the supervisors for those of who are not favored cause the threats are getting a little old.I've been trained in sop's, Gmp's, and  Oshawa certified for sit down, stand up, and PE lifts, nice environment to work good coworkers and great management teamWas a great job 10 years agoHas gotten worse after new investment firm came in and took over Every building was different on how good it was or wasn't to work inAfter the sale of one of their main buildings there is no sure thing there. people are giving added responsablities without any promotion or pay raise. Not so bad except some of them are forced into managemnet roles, but kept as regular workers. Mandatory can be called at the end of shift the day before, giving you very little notice to change plans. There is a lot of internal fighting going on.Good place to work; recommended, you ll have a lot of fun there, I think is a good experience that will help you to develop new skills.Hard working, enjoyableCommunicate well with public & employeeesI was very punctual & always willing to work on call. Employee of the monthEnjoyed working as a three man team. The hardest part of the job is continuously monitoring equipment throughout day with minimal downtime. Enjoyable part of the job was making improvments.Not a good place to work. Management is very poor. They tell you lies and false promises. They have a lot of temp people. They tell temp people they going to make them permanent and they don't. They like to use people. Many people have quit. Management has bad communication with its employees. They have had many great people work there but they end up leaving for better jobs. If you have experience this is not the place for you. There is much better out there.","10,000+",New-York,Leonia,NJ,2016-11-14T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/8ad6011f-1070-4607-827b-838f02ab8130?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
