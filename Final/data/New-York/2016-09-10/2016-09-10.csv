148,2562.0,"Data Scientist, FinTech",Citigroup Inc.,3.9,8100.0,"Good place to work . Good Opportunity to learn new things.Diverse opportunity, helpful co-workers.If you can get a manager that is understanding and realistic in regard to work/life balance then you will be very happy.There are managers who play politics very seriously and have unrealistic expectations for their employees, even if it requires you being on conference calls until 1AM and another at 7AM. They make it seem like that is a requirement to further your career, if you can manage to keep up that schedule for an extending period of time without losing your sanity.There are some great managers that are understanding, so you have to proceed with caution and understand that it might require you making a lateral job change if you end up with one who is not understanding.The benefits of this position in my opinion was the opportunity to utilize my knowledge of the mortgage and real estate markets.  This allowed me to ascend into management fairly quickly.  The work load in a typical day was enough to keep you focused for 8 hours and longer.  I was able to learn a great deal more about corporate America and how the market collapse had impacted that industry and the subsequent effects on consumers of mortgage products.  The relationships developed with co-workers and management were invaluable and made the job enjoyable each day. Were it not for the demise of the default department I would still be with this company.It's usually pretty busy and dynamic environment. There are lots of opportunities for learning and improving the system. Part of our tasks is to perform regression tests after implementations of improvements in the systems. The hardest part of the job is to find time to work in production and also with testing which requires time to evaluate, participate in conference calls and also do many tests. The most enjoyable part of the job is that if you are a sociable person, you may interact with different departments to get your job done and improve it. But you may not find collaboration from all departments and communication may be difficult sometimes.The big picture at Citi is that they care TREMENDOUSLY about their employees, and they do make a very concerted effort to make everyone feel like a piece of the whole. The truth of the matter is, at it's core, very different. The truth of the matter is that this is a big bank and employees are a number, nothing more. When it comes time to start cutting costs, the first place they go is to the employment pool. When it comes to investments, they do not spend money on the people that are already there. They instead, will waste thousands of dollars on systems that aren't tested or bring in outside agencies to evaluate the current state of affairs and spend a dime just to save a nickel. People are not the most important part of the organization.This job was a learning experience in the sense that it gave me a taste of corporate America. I learned a lot about banking and it's laws, regulations and policies. After one month of working the branch made me Head Teller. With that my responsibilities became counting the vault with an officer, count the ATM's with an officer, receive the incoming money from Brinks with an officer. I also processed daily transactions while giving exceptional customer service. Management was difficult to deal with sometimes. Co-workers were nice and they were great at training. The hardest part about this job was dealing with management. Most enjoyable part was meeting the customers of the bank.I worked for Citi almost 20 years, only regret was that I did not apply there sooner. Thoroughly enjoyed going to work there, each day was the same but at the same time each day was different - you never knew what type of calls you would receive, but all were interesting and sometimes a challenge. I always had support from managers and the options for advancement were varied and offered frequently. The bank was always exploring new and exciting programs and offered new positions often. I enjoyed working with a diverse group of people and felt like I benefitted from that experience.its a good place to work with great benefits and a competitive salary with job security.Good work/life balance for employeesFlexible hoursFrequent breaksGreat benefits. Company cares for its employees. Cross-training is encouraged. Management is compassionate and understandingColleagues are willing to work together to assist one anotherGood amount of time allowed for holidays and vacation timeCiti is a great company to work for if you're starting out. They pay well and have great benefits. The main issue I had working at Citi was that I felt a little Harassed by my managers and ultimately the managers harassing me fired me after i went to their boss. Overall not a terrible place if you don't mind sitting around waiting for work and getting discouraged for it.A typical work day at Citi consists of various projects related to HR, Java or data quality.  Citi provides many avenues to learn new technologies.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the various projects that need to be delivered.  My co-workers and management are easy to get along with and very helpful.  I've learned much about Java, HTML, XML, SQL and HR Data Quality.Citi offers excellent online training every year, good pay, benefits, matching 401k. Great people with professional and friendly atmosphere. Citi strives to value the importance of the employees and maintains activities of events for employee appreciation. Citi constantly wants to improve employee workforce conditions to inprove working procedures that benefits the employees. Management with Citi are very friendly and always willing to go that extra mile to help you learn to your full potential.This company was the best company I have had the pleasure to work with. The training was exceptional and lengthy to get all of the information we needed to learn the job perfectly and quickly. It was a complicated and confusing job at first, but with the correct and easily explained training we received, we excelled perfectly and I was very satisfied by the results and knowledge I gained. The company in itself is a very positive one. My coworkers and superiors were very kind and helpful. I could not think of a better company to work for.I worked at Citibank as a Teller for about 2-3 year. I had few manager changing there compare to my other job. The only thing I like about working there is the co-worker I met; Hate the last manager I worked with. The job is a kind of stressful, I hate the ""Sales and referrals"" pressure from the managers, especially the last manager I worked with before leaving the job (That manager was the worst, if a teller doesn't meet the sale or referral goal she give so much attitude and bullsh*t to the employees) The Last manager wasn't flexible with the work schedule due to shortage of employee and force employee to work even when they can't.I learned a lot working with Citi Bank, they have good training for employees. Great Compensation and Benefits.Great opportunity to grow and advancement, Management always helps employees to grow. My experience with Citi from Analyst to supervisor was outstanding, they provide me lots of training classes.Job culture is very friendly and supportive.Citi was a great experience.  I was lucky to meet a lot of great people along the way.  There was a lot of areas for improvement within management and who's running the departments.  Needs a complete overall to get the company to run effectively again. All in all I learned a lot and was able to expand my career while working for citi.Its a good place to work with great benefits and a competitive salary with job security but what I do is highly stressful as we handle many escalated calls everyday with extremely angry people and have to calm them down if possible and retain them with the bank. This is not easy. The co-workers are great and diverse and I get to help people.I do not mind working at citibank, you do have to be a fit for the job. I don't think I could work sitting at a desk staring at checks all day for the rest of my life, but it is not a bad or very stressful job by any means. It can be hard to advance once you've reached a certain point.  It also can be frustrating with all the change going on but you do just learn to go with the flow.Fast paced environment until you get the hang of working cases then everything slows down dramatically.Management is all about the numbers and not so much about developing future talent and leaders.Biggest perk to working for Citi would be the benefits package and work/life balance depending on the department.Well recognized company with great benefits and opportunity for it employees. I enjoyed working at Citi after more than 23 years I consider Citi my home. I enjoy working with everyone and I learned from management that clients is always comes first. Citi is consider one of the best company since they are in more than 100 countries.I manage a team of four that maintains our Citicards.com (pre-login) and Citi Online (post-login) sites.I work directly with my team, developers, testers and Business requestors to ensure updates are made correctly and in a timely manner.  I directly manage any escalations and process improvements for our channel. I work with my team on their goals and support them on any career paths.Hardest part of my job is managing differently personalities.  Being able to do so has made a stronger leader. The most enjoyable part of my job is working as a team. We work with a large group of developers and testers and seeing how everything comes together for a release can be petty rewarding.The work environment at Citi Group is absolutely top notch in its professionalism and attention to detail. The corporation and its businesses are run in such a way that quality and morality exist hand-in-hand. Attention to detail and simply doing the right thing runs through the core of everything.","10,000+",New-York,Long Island City,NY,2016-09-10T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/17f92ba2-5481-45eb-a91f-c98ca14bc90b?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=31,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
