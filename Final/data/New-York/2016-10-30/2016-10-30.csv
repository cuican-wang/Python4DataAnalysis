314,2728.0,Engineer Analytics and Optimization,JetBlue Airways,4.3,407.0,"A company that takes care of both inside and outside customers and has a lot of values caring safety passion intrgrity It is a 13 times in row a JD power winner Adding more flights and growing fastI absolutely love the company and management. It's the super low hourly wages that has me disappointed with the company. Yes you get the perks of flying for free but that means little to nothing if you aren't making enough to take care of your family. The company is growing wildly so for big stations (JFK, MCO, BOS, FLL) hours are plentiful HOWEVER if you are in a small station like BNA with only 3 flights you are only going to get 20 hours a week MAX is you work mornings and 25 hours if you work afternoons.This is a very flexible work environment once you are able to work from homeFor the first few months one needs to travel to the facility, but once one is over the initial training working from home is a great experienceThe travel benefits are alright, but trying to get a flight could be stressful when one has to fly standbyAt work on a daily basis you were met with challenges due to the lack of support because of staffing.  To be a supervisor you had to know how to multi-task. My colleagues were very supportive at all times team work was a day to day practice with our team of leaders.  However there were times that upper management could have been more supportive. Hardest part of the job was when you couldn't get support from your upper Management. So I learned  to be confident in my decisions based on my knowledge and experience.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the flight benefits, the crewmembers and profit sharing.One of the best jobs I've ever held. I enjoyed my 13 years at JetBlue and although I never try to look back, I must admit I miss this one tremendously. Management at all levels always made sure that all crewmembers were empowered by ensuring constant training and support was always available. Opportunities to grow within the company was supported with mentorship and shadowing programs for those with a vision and the desire to succeed.Excellent place to work, staff is amazing. Travel is available for all qualified staff.  The Pilots are very supportive and helpful to Inflight Crew Members.  Training was grueling but necessary and the Trainers were exceptional.  If you have never experienced anything as it relates to Aviation, you must be prepared for an in depth training curriculum.This is a great company to work for. The culture is relaxed , open, and fun. Innovation and willingness to try new things is the norm here. My only critique would be the lack of a clear career trajectory. It is not consistent across departments. Some departments have very clear paths for career growth, while others have employees that seem to be stuck in some sort of purgatory. Also, the process for reviews has changed several times.Management was horrible, definitely picked and choosed favorites, which made work life very difficult. Management never let you know how you were doing, or how you can improve. Only talked to you when did something wrong. Then wouldnt tell you how you can do it right the next timeJetBlue is a good place to work. However, I am looking to leave the airline industry and pursue a new career in a different customer service field. I have grown tired of all the traveling, living out of a suitcase, staying at hotels and the overall environment of the airline industry. On the upside, I have made many great friends, seen a lot of places and adapted to the fast past lifestyle. The one thing that I really dislike about the job is that I live in Charlotte but I am based out of Boston. My job requires me to commute by plane weekly. My life, family and friends are all here in Charlotte and this is where I want to be. Thank you!Has its moment, it can be really busy and really slow however the most excitement comes when things are busy because it the time everyone meaning customers are angry. I-rate customers are sometimes upset for something that has nothing to do with the airline but its still exciting dealing with themWorking at Jetblue is a wonderful experience and allows an avid traveler or adventurous explorer to be able to explore and see the world while working or enjoying the perks while off work at incredible discounts and rates.The people are great and are very passionate about what they do. Days and people are difficult and challenging. Delays affect not just the airline and passengers but you as well, so making sure you have a good balanced diet and food prepared and brought with you for those times you don't have the option to grab food anywhere really comes in handy and gives you that needed energy boost. However, meeting people from all walks of life and all around the world is wonderful and truly makes you realize the world is so big and there are so many people trying to live their day to day lives as best as possible with what they are given.Jetblue is a great company to work for.  They have a heart of gold in which they show to their employees and customers.  The pay is great and competitive which is a plus.  Some times the hours get to you but thats part of the job.  Senior leadership is great, very supportive of their employees.My typical day at work is very easy because of my past work experience and solid years of experience in Customer service,Management,Sales,Budget control,supervision,Time and Leadership.What I have learn while working at Jet Blue for the past 3 years is multiplying many daily flights, while leading ground crew to have a smooth operation. My co workers are super wonderful and like our company motto "" Caring""The hardest part of my jobs is a delays of flights where sometimes customer have to wait for a while.The most enjoyable and wonderful thing about my is I get to travel the world.I love working for JetBlue. I am trully blessed to be a part of this great company. I enjoy going to work everyday. This is the first job i am happy about and proud to consider myself a part of this growing company. I trully am very grateful for this opportunity.JetBlue was my last job. It was productive and fun work place. I worked from home, that was the best, that was the most enjoyable part of the job. Typical day at work, woke up, had breakfast and work in my PJs sometimes. I have learned a lot, how to deal with customers, learned new systems. Managements are excellent, but supervisor are not typical I like her to be. I liked most of my co workers, but I don't get to see them because we all worked at home. The hardest part about my job is the expectations. We have to stay focus and keep working all the time, no inactivity what so ever and we have to meet the criteria and goals. They monitored us all the time, watched and listen to us work. Worst part is lack of training. I enjoyed the most was my flight benefits and able to stay home and enjoy my family.Outstanding organization to work for. Great Health care  benefits for part time employees as well as full time employees, and free flying privileges.Stock options etc.Great place to work, caring management, options to learn more, educated and move on!JetBlue has a proud tradition of supporting dedicated community organizations through partnerships, donations and crew member volunteering.Very exciting company to work for. Not only does it take care of it's customers and openly takes excellent care of it employees. Upper leadership is very in tune with employees and also very willing and able to help when needed. Excellent choice to work for.I have been with the organization for over 6 years and at times it has been great at other times very challenging.  Direction can be unclear and lacking. Work life balance is a challenge, expectations are you should be available all day every day.  But if you enjoy being in a team environment and working hard than it is a magical placeIt was a stay at home job.  It was difficult because you were constantly on the phone, call after call.  We had Co-workers who were above us and helped us with any questions or concerns.  The hardest part of the job was when customers would get upset with you when you had no control over it.  I loved being a part of JetBlue but had a hard time using the benefits because of the schedule.Jetful is an amazing place to work. CEO and higher management really care about employees and are always finding ways to compensate for hard work and effort. Everyone is friendly and always willing to help. Growth options are achievable and promotions are always encouraged.","10,000+",New-York,New York,NY,2016-10-30T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/9eb97849-8810-40b6-979b-9b87cc5e9f49?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=24,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
