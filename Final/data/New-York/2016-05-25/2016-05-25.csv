325,2739.0,Geologist,Golder Associates,3.6,103.0,"Golder is a genuinely good place to work. However, the company recently tried to grow too quickly while not maintaining their original ideals. More specifically, they're management structure became more linear and top heavy.The people or friendly, and you can really work toward your professional goals. The location is in an expensive location, so it's hard to live close enough to not have a bad commute.Growing company and a great place to develop technical skills. Golder has a reputation of producing high quality technical consultants spread across the globe. The company is setup in a way that allows all employees to share expertise and advice across the globe, truly making it a world of capabilities delivered locally.Golder Associates is a global Geotechical/Environmental Company. The company's core values has an in depth emphasis on Health and Safety management,Manpower Training and Development to help attain success on employees career and lastly is the Customer Satisfaction through a Total Quality Management of the organization.Working relationship with my peers is an exiting and enjoyable one especially when everybody is doing their job diligently. A full coordination and cooperation by everyone shall be  expected and a quality product can be delivered in due time.Golder Associates was a place that I would work again in an instant, the work environment was busy and always changing.  If you are looking for advancement you must have an engineering degree,Fascinating work. Good collegian atmosphere in some groups and offices. Opportunities to do most anything anywhere in the world. Long leash given to hang yourself or achieve great things. Very pleasant work environment, despite all of the layoffs and turmoil.Work/Life balance working at Golder is very good. The last year has seen a decline is management personal. Junior to mid-level employees will be in a great position moving towards the future.I liked working for this company but the management is way off. They do not promote those who deserver it only those they like and then do very little work. I just left and heard the SW ops manager was let go so it looks like they are heading in the right direction.Company is employee owned and has an excellent culture that can proved a good work/life balance (most of the time) and a very relaxed casual office setting.  However, 2014 was a very poor financial year, and after numerous layoffs and compensation/benefits cuts this company often will not meet the standard for compensation or benefits.  Job security has dwindled and advancement opportunities have shrunk drastically as well.This was a fun company to work for with supportive management that want their employees to grow and develop within. I was the first point of contact for all employees and felt that we all worked well together on a variety of tasks.Unfortunately due to global economic issues my position was eliminated. Would definitely work there again if the opportunity arose.Golders website indicates they are big on training their employees. They believe if you have done it once, you are an expert and can do it on your own. I was constantly promised training and no training ever was done. In addition to that, I felt blacklisted from doing field work due to the older associates biased opinion I wasn't cut out for it. Simply untrue. Management is awful. The PMs do not come by and talk and ever check if you need work. If you have it great, but if not, you will be wasting a lot of time. There is a lot of false promises on incoming work. The company did not turn a profit last year and has really started to decline (How does an environmental company with mining as its' largest group, not see the decline occurring and not plan for it?? Same thing with oil, and yet no one did anything or prepared for the crashes.). I was told by multiple people Golder is not the company it used to be.  I should have seen the trend ahead of time, but was blind. A guy left because of the poor quality of work my first week. 3 months later, they laid off another person for not having work, and an engineer a month after being hired quit. They make promises but do not make good on them. There is major favoritism in the environmental group and some of the people are team players at all. Watch out. Oh and if you are an engineer, you better love landfills as that is all you will do.Good day at work, remediation stuff, managed personnel and projects, had co-workers, work was hardest part of job and technical aspects were the most employable aspectsGreat place to gain experience in materials testing, drafting, reading reports, preparing engineering graphs, preparing quantity takeoffs for landfill liner systems.I have learned so much about geotechnical data and geosynthetics just from working here a year now. There is so much room to grow if this is your field of study. A great environment to work in and great co-workers. The company is international and amazing to work for.Some talented professionals to learn from.    Lacks management direction for business growthGood company but compensation lower than competitors. Work can be interesting but sometimes slow.Golder Associates is a great company to work for.  A typical work day is 8 hours.  The co- workers are great to work with and very knowledgeable.Productive organization coupled with efficient processes to produce a product with quality and accuracy.A typical day at work is 8:00am to 5:00pm, good co-workers, good management.I was able to work on a variety of projects around the U.S. and around the World.Management is severely lacking in knowledge of proper Project Management practices/processes.  Engineers are regularly appointed PMs and have no education on how to do the work, how to make a schedule or do any sort of cost control.  This leads to no one knowing where anyone is on a project, what comes next, or where the budget is...until a month or two down the line.Flat structure is great, but it leads to management by committee.  On any day, the person in charge can change depending on who thinks their work must be done NOW.",,New-York,Newark,NJ,2016-05-25T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/07cfc12f-67dd-41b6-8585-bfaaa16937d6?mescoid=1900265001001&jobPosition=35,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
