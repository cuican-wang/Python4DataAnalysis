Overall great work environment where everyone truly cares about their jobs.During my externship in the legal department at Nomura, I learned how to effectively communicate with others in an investment bank setting by juggling the various needs of different departments from trading to credit to operations.  Additionally as an extern, I prepared various memos relating to derivatives rules from Title VII of Dodd-Frank, CFTC and SEC.  I also analyzed and summarized Confidential, Disclosure, and Customer Agreements. Lastly drafted operational e-mails based on various No-Action letters issued by regulators so that the banks different departments knew the most up to date regulationsEnjoyed working with Nomura. People are smart and helpful.Work culture is great.Nomura's intern program involves several opportunities for interns to network with fellow interns and senior executives. The firm also uses a junior and senior mentor program to help interns become acclimated with Nomura's culture.people are nice, including the management team, HR and co-workers.
