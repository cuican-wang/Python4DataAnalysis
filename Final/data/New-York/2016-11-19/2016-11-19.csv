89,2503.0,Marketing Data Scientist Sr. Associate-160117280,JP Morgan,3.9,10900.0,"JPMC is a great company but the opportunities outside of fund services operations in Boston are limited. Within Ops, there are plenty of opportunities for advancement/role change, and the pay is good compared to similar roles at other firms.My job is a great, I get to work at 7:45am everyday and leave at 3pm-6pm some days. It is a convenient location, and is a helpful job to have. However, moving up in the company is a lot more difficult than it should be. I am also a over qualified part time worker.The employees at Chase like most large companies are what make you stay for as long as you do. That and for me knowing that you could make a positive impact on not only a customers life but potentially a manager, employee, or peers life.Great Company. Been a teller for 5yrs just looking for a change & a better future. Willing to make more money & aim higher than ever.-Maintain a cash drawer within set limits and services atms.-Identify and submit product referral opportunities to appropriate sources.-Maintain a foreign currency cash box.-Provide exceptional customer service.-Balance vaults daily.The hardest part of the job was cooperation from the owner of the home to get completed documents and financial information into get an approval for a new mortgage.This company is an amazing place to be employed they really take care of their customers. The company makes sure if not all most of the employees needs are met at and away from the work place.I enjoy working at Chase lots of different opportunities here. Another thing i like about Chase the diversity in ths workplace.The atmosphere is laid back.I truly enjoyed my time with Chase bank and met great people.  I learned so much about leadership and associate development.This job is so laid back. I enjoyed working there and meeting the people that work there.... It's really hard to get on permanently there and their benefits suck before hired on.Typical day consisted of logging in to all systems and phone lines.Taking multiple calls from customers and directing them on needed documents missing to complete underwriter review.  Perfecting documents and submitting file to underwriter.Calling customers and going over additional documents needed and getting commitment as to return of documents.Calling and going over underwriter decision with customers.Maintaining 200 plus pipeline.Skills learned on job was how to show compassion for customers who were in a very dark place.  Motivate them into providing needed information in order to complete review to determine if home could be modified or if Foreclosure was unavoidable.Co workers were amazing.  Management was productive and fair.  Unable to provide career path.Hardest part of this job was getting customers who had lost all hope to put faith in program.Most enjoyable part of my job was opening a customers mind on what truly was in there best interest.A typical day at work is doing 5-6 alerts per day.  I've learned to take my time with cases and eventually the production will go up as time goes on.  The team leads and co-workers were very helpful and always provided help and information when needed.  The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with co-workers and their production.  The most enjoyable part of the job was was working in a group and fun people.I worked in different chase branches. The managers are the one who either suck the life out of you, or help you advance. I was lucky to have 2 great managers! Some busy locations can be stressful for tellers, but bankers can really profit from sales. Slower branches are better for tellers, and bad for bankers, due to sales.Great place for career minded people, room for mobility and advancement.  Great team atmosphere and partnership across functions and businessesEveryone is very helpful put they do not have the best mgmt in place. they have to many layers and things get stuck in the system.need to become more streamline.A great company to work and have met some good people working there including the CEO, who is one of the most down to earth guy you can meet because his head is not in the clouds and he knows how to use the power.However, the subculture of poor managers needs to be better!A typical day at work consisted of compiling numbers for various reports due to numerous legal entities across the globe. This was challenging work but rewarding.If you like a fast pace environment, this is it. I liked the culture, the people, the activities and the most important, I was really happy with my day to day duties and my team.Great atmosphere at work, professional and friendly co-workers, fast paced environment with lot of networking and customer service.I love working for Chase they have great benefits I just want to do something different. Will love to experience something different been in the banking business for 16 years.JP Morgan Chase was a great company and I would recommend anyone that is thinking about getting into the banking profession to consider this company as a perfect place to start.You meet a new person everyday at Chase. I've learned so much from cash handling to dealing with fraudulent customers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with irate customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know your customers and building lasting relationships with them.","10,000+",New-York,New York,NY,2016-11-19T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/80da4999-85e8-4210-bcf8-1403249ae1d3?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=7,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
