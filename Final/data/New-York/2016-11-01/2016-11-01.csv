109,2523.0,Data Scientist,Gilt,3.8,13.0,"GIlt is a young company with a lot of great people. My only complaint is the work life balance. There is no work life balance, specifically in merchandising. Due to the nature of the business (ecommerce) there is work to be done in office and at home such a site and sale maintenance. As a merchandising assistant it is not rare to stay in office for 12 hours a day without taking a break for lunch. There is so much to do which keeps you productive but it can become overwhelming.Gilt is an incredible place to work. Co-workers are inspiring, innovative, smart. One of the best professional experiences working among them. Fantastic managers.I loved working for Gilt! I learned so many new things and have strengthened my technical skills. Everyone who I worked with invested a lot of time in me and they were very helpful. Everyone is super friendly. The work environment is awesome! You can dress however you want as long as it is fashionable and presentable. Lots of free food available in the kitchen area! One thing you need to know - everyone works extremely hard. Get ready to put in a lot of hours. You have to be willing to have your hands dipped into various functions. There is a lot of ambiguity at times so get ready to asking a lot of questions and finding answers on your own at the same time.It was always a team effort. GILT would have fun pep rallies to keep us informed and ready to work. I found this job most fun on the Cherry picker.Underpaying, favoritism, little chance for advancement, unless you make friends with someone higher up. It seems the harder you work, the more they want to add to it, but if you come in, and be lazy they wont ask for anything.managers have ""favorites"" and will do anything in their power to get you fired if they dont like you. discrimination against all people. low pay. no fun to work at.Great workplace to learn about all positions from entry all the up the ladder. Hard work always pays off, and is always recognized,fun place to work and i went from having no friends when i started to having over 20 new friends..it was really a fun place to work....The best of Gilt is its people.  Smart, nice, hard workers.  The best job I ever had! There was opportunity to learn, build, train, test, and enjoy the success of the work well done.I really enjoyed working at Gilt. I got converted to the company after four months of working there as a temp. A typical day at Gilt went by fast because there was always work to do but the temperature inside was worst then the temperature outside. I loved all of my co - workers and got along with all of my supervisors and mangers pretty well.I just love this job the people was very friends and i love getting the change to meet new people.I loved working for this company! What a talented group to work with and the pay is great! they treat their staff well, and I have no complaints at all.

111,2525.0,SENIOR DATA SCIENTIST,Viacom,4.2,207.0,"Viacom has the greatest employees.  I was blessed with the greatest co-workers.  We all worked together, helped each other, and always taught each other new technologies each week.  We supported each other goals and accomplishments..  The people make it a great place to work.During my time a Viacom there were pros and cons .My experience at Viacom with my co-workers was very positive. The work environment was great, the projects I worked on were very exciting and challenging. My team pushed me to really grow professionally. Management typically has a difficult time making decisions on just about everything. Expect little value on work/life balance.If management put more into their employees they would have better retention. A single ticket here or there does not make up for time lost while in the office.The benefits were good but the salaries are usually lower.  Great place to start your career in media but you must be willing to work very long hours and be flexible with constantly changing priorities.  I loved working at BET, many cool people and a fun working environment.  The people were extremely nice and I enjoyed going to work.  Always areas for growth and the managers were always helpful.  Very talent group of people, dedicated to creative work.  I learned so much and would do it again in a heartbeat! I think one of the best companies to work for to learn and grow.Viacom is a dynamic company with so many brands that appeal to different generations of people. Get work life balance, relaxed work culture and open door policy. The people here are great! However, they do not pay their entry level employees well at all. Competitors are openly paying employees of the same role at least $10-15k more and sometimes even more. It can be disheartening that a company this large and successful focuses so much on compensating the big whigs, but then forget about the work horses that are keeping the company a float.The culture of the company is great but the senior C-level management is extremely oblivious to the issues the employees have.  Also, if you prove yourself and get promoted internally, you get screwed over with compensation.  They pay more if you leave the company and come back instead of rewarding you for being a loyal employee.Large company with a lot of room for advancement, I personally did not work with the company culture. I enjoyed my coworkers, but had a frustrating time working as a permalance employee.It used to be a great place to work but the creative culture has changed and lost some of its appeal lately. The benefits are still great but the salaries are usually lower.Working at Viacom used to be super fun but there has been so much restructuring over the last 2 years and there is a huge lack of communication and proper management.Great place to start your career in media.  Must be willing to work very long hours and be flexible with constantly changing priorities.This is a great company to work for however the pay is always less that what it should be for the position. It is very hard for employees to move up as the managing positions are usually hired from outside of the company.Check emails, check the queue, data entry, amend records, setup orders for pickups.I have learned how to write emails and improve customer service management is a little flaky a lot of nepotism and bad ethics as far as moving up within the department/company. My co-workers are friendly and nice and fun to talk and work with. There is really nothing difficult or challenging about this job anyone can do this job. The enjoyable part about this job is when my shift ends.I truly enjoyed working at Viacom...  Great culture that allows their employees to be innovative and successful.  Viacom offers great work and personal environment.The glitz and glamour of Viacom's shows and markets are fun and energizing, and there can be some fun perquisites, but at senior management levels it is serious business.Difficult to navigate internal politics if direct upper management not at same location. Frequent recent layoffs lead to no sense of job security.Working at Viacom was a fun experience.  I interned for my whole senior year a Comedy Central and Logo.  There were no entry level opportunities when I graduated college.  I worked with some great supervisors that cared about teaching the ins and outs of the business.Organization is filled with lots of great talented people, but overall most brands could stand to overhaul and improve their senior management. See the recent article about the culture shift at Google....I love working here - such cool work environment. People are extremely nice and I crave to come to work everyday. Sky is the limit to growth and your managers are always helpful to help you grow. I think one of the best companies to work for to learn and growMy time at Viacom was great. I would recommend it if you're looking to beef up your resume. The staff was great as well as the culture of the company.You can still get a free cup of coffee if you're ok with not having Starbucks.  Most people work here for years.  Some people grow while some stay in the same roles for years.  This place is what you make it but it's not as fun as it used to be I hear.the most enjoyable part of this job is being creative. i love the dynamic of my core team. however, we're poorly managed and poorly compensated for what we do. no space to grow.Great dedication to creative work. Great environment. Loved my time working with MTV2 Team! I learned so much as an intern here and would do it again in a heartbeat! I hope I get to freelance here sometime soon.","5,001 to 10,000",New-York,New York,NY,2016-11-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/54ce8823-2c27-41ca-8e16-bf2198139889?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=29,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
