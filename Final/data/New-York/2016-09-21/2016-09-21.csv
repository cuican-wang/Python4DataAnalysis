142,2556.0,GILT- Machine Learning Data Scientist,Hudson's Bay Company,3.8,951.0,"A typical day at work is interacting with the truck drivers, I've learned to gain more patience than required when dealing with different backgrounds.  My co workers and manager make my day and job less stressful.  I enjoy networking and meeting different kinds of people from different ethnicity.Poor senior leadership and upper management. Lots of waste, due to poor project planning at the senior level. Every day is filled with chaos because internal resources are limited and enterprise projects are not well-planned, let alone executed with any process controls. Our data center is closing in 2017, and it's not a surprise for any of us who are still here. Many of us were looking for other jobs before the facility closure was announced. Some staff bolted as soon as they heard the news. Those of us who have been here for a year or more were offered a reasonable severance and retention bonus; so, I'm staying until my end date. I know I will have a job offer before my end date because the market is so hot....I work at Lord & Taylor.  I have not made a salary this low since just after college.  Granted, I love the line I work for but the pay is abismal.  And to make matters worse, bullying is tolerated at my store, even when reported.  The ""bullyer"" is a high money producer who gets away with murder.  This person has threatened to have other employees fired, makes others cry, and when it was finally reported to management, instead of feel protected by the General Manager, he became buddy buddy with the bullyer and now people are even more afraid to report it.  The one nice thing I can say about my store is that they are somewhat flexible with day off requests.Typical day at work would consist of Loading, Unloading, interacting with vendors, inventory checklist, Staging outbound shipments, daily stockroom activities.No job security, management shifts faster than fashion. They try to build a family like culture, but terminate without warning due to constant reorgs.Constant Management turn over. Four CIO changes in two years. Each CIO replaced all middle managers to match their 'Vision'. When I left had no first line manager to resign to. HR had me reporting to a co-worker. Was stood up for my exit interview by HR. They did not show up for the interview. Had to leave my laptop, keys, and badge on my desk and just leave the building on my own.Horrible place to work. Very hypocritical and lots of drugs in the workplace. Tested their employees badly but favored a couple people. Unfair wages and lots of missing moneyThere's an interesting dynamic between the Lord and Taylor/HBC side and the Saks side of the house.  It's a East Cost thing.Very fast paced environment.  Not many realize how big the company is and how it spans multiple cities and countries.  Not really in a position to say anything good or bad about the company.  A lot of good people work there.most negative place i ever worked everything is broken from the management team to the website. You have 3 or 4 managers who do their best and the rest just kinda wing it.Enjoyed assisting customers with placing orders, receiving wrong merchandise, sales price adjustments, returns, damaged merchandise and defective merchandise.This position has given me many skills as I'm involved throughout the entire SDLC within every release.  I gather and write business requirements; risk assess all requirements with impacted cross-functional teams/vendors, review requirements (business and technical) weekly with the business, write test scripts, conduct SIT and UAT testing, review any all defects with the business and technical teams, provide implementation plans/status and conduct maintenance/key learning's status meetings.  This position has tweaked all skill sets.A typical day at work includes working reported problems from opened tickets.  I've learned how to be calm in pressure situations.  Management allows myself and co-workers to make decisions without being micro-managed.  My co-workers are all a wonderful bunch of guys.  We are all team players.  The hardest part of the job is trying to complete tasks when given strict deadlines beyond our control.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to make our own decisions as to how we're going to get things done.Benefits need improvement and work atmosphere isn't great. On call sucks because they don't have an adequate help desk (yet) to triage calls. They have some nice percs like half day Fridays during summer and ability to work from home. They are laid back and seem to be trying to improve things. Cafe is above average and decently priced.Its a great team to work with, that moved from waterfall model to a fully agile workplace. There is a lot more potential for the company to grow its culture / tech processes. The tech leadership is great (same as GILT leadership), but senior leadership across the company does not understand tech culture, and has difficulty in managing the workload or the processes in software delivery.Good company, flexible schedule, friendly environment, very good and knowledgeable team. I learn a lot about retail business.Resolve production issue in different area such as user interface , business logic, and  data in the database. Enhance application by user request.It's ok but i just got laid off after being on call 24/7 for a year. They have unrealistic expectations for projects and don't seem to care much for the end product, they just want to 'get it done'. They are all about the profits really.I work with great people. That said, the company has created a toxic relationship with it's employees. They are not transparent about the direction of the company. I was offered a promotion, but it required relocating and the compensation was not on par with national averages for that position, so I ultimately opted to move closer to my family instead of remaining with the company.get to learn alot and try out different products.. meet a lot of great people and best of all be the face of a skincare line.. has been a pleasure working for them but unfortunately they do not have any job security whatssoevergood working environment, friendly people, mangement is fine, Job Culture is good, Compensation/Benefits not so good",,New-York,New York,NY,2016-09-21T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/aa2738af-cf72-48de-a986-7f5d824935f9?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
