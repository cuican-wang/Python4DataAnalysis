88,2502.0,Senior Data Scientist – Strategic Analytics Services,Arch,4.4,23.0,"ARCH is a non-profit organization. I work at the homeless shelter known as the TRUST House. It's a dual recovery environment that deals with mental illness and substance abuse. I work closely with veterans. There is a daily message of hope that every resident receives.The reason why i did this job is because it was flexible to my school schedule, theres not need for clocking in or out. The only time i would come and work would be when there had a patient for me. I would always come after class and maybe have one or two clients.ARCH was a great learning experience. It allowed me to help those who were in need. A typical day at work varied because each day was different. Most days were booked meeting with clients to assist them in their needs. Other days I would have to travel to different locations to do walk throughs for housing. Management was great gave me the freedom to do what I loved the most and that was help people. We were a family at ARCH. The hardest part of the job was not being able to help everyone who walked through the doors. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing families get a second chance to be independent.Greeted and conducted students and staff members arrived at Arch Center.*Answered multiple phone lines, data entry, sorted incoming/ outgoing mail, faxes and mailing materials.*Assisted with special projects, job fairs, talent shows, activities.*Also photocopied students’ documentation, Birth Certificates, SSC, and ID.*Transferred incoming phone calls to the appropriate staff members.Offer mentoring services 30 to 40 freshman, sophomore, and junior summer school studentsCoordinate teacher aide services for summer school classesCoordinate healthy activities such as basketball, football, volleyball, tennisChaperone trips to the local YMCA, bowling alley, art museum, and other activitiesThis place is a home to its staff and participants.

The supervisors were both helpful and patient with the teaching process.Great arrangement for the time in which I was employed there, however my needs since I started have dramatically changed.The shift lasted for 24 hours, the management was good but they seem to ignore any issues with the residentsThe most enjoyable part about the job was when we played bingo and exercising, and to know I was making them feel goodabout there self.",,New-York,Jersey CIty,NJ,2016-11-20T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/5e784541-efbd-4d06-a01f-99bf06efdf52?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
