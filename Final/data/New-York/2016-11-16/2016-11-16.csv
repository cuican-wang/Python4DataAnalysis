6,2420.0,Data Scientist,Bed Bath and Beyond,3.7,2300.0,"Its not a difficult job. Retail in general is not really difficult. Customer service values are top priority. This is a great job for friendly motivated sociable people.My general impression of most of my coworkers is either young and lazy or old and stuck.My oppinion of managers is that most of my managers are alright.The hardest part of the job is dealing with the occasional rude customers. Honestly it's no big deal in general but no one likes to be disrespected.The most enjoyable part... I can't say i particularly enjoy any part of the job in all honesty. I do enjoy a handful of my coworkers though.Job was good. However limited opportunities for increase.  Hard worker and results are obvious but not able to see results through pay.  Thanks in advance for your consideration.Working at Bed Bath & Beyond was a positive experience. Besides them not being able to work with my school schedule, it contained a positive group of people along with a good system of management.A typical day at Bed Bath & Beyond was busy. the Management was great a very skilled. My coworkers were definitely team players. The hardest part was stocking. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people.Great managers that will fight for you and help you out when you need it. Always a fun day at work. They are your managers yet treat you like you are a person and not a number.This job was very accommodating with your schedule and management was very positive. Bed Bath and Beyond puts the customer first and managers insisted we help customers over doing freight and stocking the shelves. Typically I would answer phone calls, help customers find products, and in most cases we would help customers compare product descriptions and prices to help them make a purchase. When we weren't busy helping customers we worked on stocking shelves, and organizing inventory. A big part of this job was to make online sales, also known as ""Beyonds"". In order to do this, approaching customers was key, and from there you had to identify their needs and if it wasn't available in the store you could influence them to order it in store. This helped the stores numbers and it also put you in a sales scenario, in which you could develop your sales strategy. The job didn't offer commission, but it did help you when you received your performance review. This job has a great environment and I also liked that it had holidays off and the company would often buy food from local restaurants for the employees.nice place to work positive environment good learning experience systems are old but they make it work management is nice co workers are great peopleIts a good company to be with. People will love the company when they join. People are good and cooperative. You wont be disappointed after joining.The typical day involved a lot of stocking and facing mingled with helping customers learn to read the back of product boxes.Everyone was relaxed and seems to enjoy the daily toil.The day that I be working it's usually fast paced dayCustomers always rightThey willing to help you outThe co-worker are awesomeBe there on time all the timeThe customersThis is a very friendly place to work. I have enjoyed helping customers find what they are looking for. The hours are flexible and as long as you show effort, the managers will work with you for any requests you have of them.Tight knit group of employees focused on service, great place to work, always something to do, great place for newlyweds to shop, reasonable expectations.Morning Shifts - Clock in, Head to the front grab the reports for the department, head to the stock room check to see if we have the product if so grab it and add it to your cart to put onto the floor before the store opens, Finish reports and then fill up the store with what you found inside the stock room, Store Opens finish putting away your reports and help and greet customers when you see them. Continue this until your shift is over, Clock Out.Night Shifts - Clock in, Look on the schedule to see which department you are in for the night, head to the department clean up the department and help customers when you see them, Store Closes, Head to the back room and grab the freight to put out for the night in your department until your shift is over, Clock OutI loved working in the office and having the option to also interact with customers and help them as well.  The company fosters a great culture, unfortunately the management at each location doesn't always follow through with that.Can be a great place to work. It is very hard to advance within the company. Yearly raises on excellent reviews are 20 to 30 cents. I have worked at three different stores with very different ways of doing things. It can be very high drama or very relaxed depending all on management. The customers for the most part are great, but also very needy because that is how we've trained them to be. It's nice to able to take care of customers and we bend over backwards for them. That said, the corporation does not go out of its way to help employees. The company is very frugal and raises are ridiculous; people will often get hired that make more than I do, and I'm a keyholder. There is a lot to do and its hard to get bored if you have a good work ethic.I liked this job but the pay is at a stand still to long. You was able to wear several titles and no pay raise for what  person was worth. The job was very interested and there was a lot to be learned. The feeling to be able to tell a customer about an item and the customer is very satisfied and happy while making their purchase was a joy.became an opener every single weekend since i started and enjoyed it. lunch parties sometimes. great people to work with. not too hard, but not to light either.Personally I could not wait to switch jobs out of this particular line of work. I could not enjoy myself or put myself fully into this job because it was a terrible working environment. After the managerial change within the store it all went down hill.This store has great training that is ongoing as the newer product comes in. Having product knowledge makes it fun to interact with customers.I spent most of my time training cashiers. These reviews are getting ridiculous. All I want to do is place my resume on here. I really don't understand the importance of this.Typical work day at BBB is attending to customers and providing them with great customer service skills, management is great and easy going, hardest part is informing the customer we do not have a product in stock when it shows in stock in store, and my most enjoyable part of the day is the rush throughout the day.","10,000+",New-York,Union,NJ,2016-11-16T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/data-scientist-job-union-nj-us-174259346.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

I was part of management and was often told I was fun and easy to work with by my guides. The hardest part of the job was sometimes getting the customer comfortable with the process. It was a little different concept than other retailers. There were times that I faced very difficult obstacles which would make the overall work experience not so great. I found the other managers excluded and withheld information making it very challenging to do my job.Build an achievable sales plan for the day.Take on projects single handedly.Built an amazing team with precise coaching and involvement.Had a great team of associates I could rely on.I was brought into Bonobos over a year ago to start the Bonobos Guides program.
