155,2569.0,Data Scientist,Birchbox,4.5,6.0,"A typical day while interning at Birchbox included working with the content team to help brainstorm ideas for future online magazine articles as well as future video concepts. I also attended various team meetings and created props for upcoming monthly video shoots. On shoot days, I would attend and assist on set with any tasks. I absolutely adored every single co-worker and they were all a pleasure to work with. Everyone is friendly and outgoing. The hardest part of the job was mastering the Birchbox voice through my writing. The most enjoyable part of the job was the office in itself, which is an upbeat environment filled with treats and surprises everyday. I really enjoyed being there everyday.When I first got hired, they made Birchbox SoHo (before it even opened) out to be an AMAZING environment with a great teamwork ethic and a place for advancement....HAHA!Management was very bad, and the only good ones they had they fired due to them not having the ""looks"" Birchbox wanted (aka discriminated against their body types, etc). Management also chose favorites and conducted things as if it was a middle school cafeteria lunch table... only certain people got praise and perks, whereas others who worked even harder got treated horrible.This place needs to get their act together. Stop making employees who are NOT PAID COMMISSION get in trouble for not having met ridiculous and unreasonable sales goals. There is no need to make them compete against each other if it is not commission-basedA lot of different events and things for employees to look forward toI learned a lot of different ways to do things Co workers are hard working and very knowledgable",201 to 500,New-York,New York,NY,2016-08-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/b149099d-3a4e-4770-b970-fdded44fd990?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
