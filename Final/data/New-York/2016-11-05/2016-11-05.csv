101,2515.0,Data Scientist,Discovery Communications,4.2,114.0,"Never a typical day at Discovery! We process, route and resolved issues reported via phone, email , voicemail and chat. Also had a technical bar ,where we would meet with end users to resolve issues. Great place to work as long as you are ready to learn and go to work everyday with a clean slate. Best part of the job is your team! Very lax environment workload is distributed amongst , everyone is always willing to assist as long as you don't ask the same question constantly.This was once a great and fun company to work for. Times in the Miami office were wonderful and relatively smooth. Management had its faults but was overall great to work with. Coworkers felt like family. But once CEO ZAZLAV came around. The company went in to the toilet. While he gave himself huge raises every year. The company brand took a dive. Final straw was the move of broadcast operations to Sterling VA on June 2015. Worst mistake of my life to move up there for a year. Management in Virginia were and still are in over there heads. Wish they left our Miami office alone. We had a good thing going here.I worked at Discovery for 3 years and watched at least three rounds of layoffs. The co-workers, benefits, work environment, and pay are great. However it is clear that the greed of higher ups has effected the way they do business and the corporate culture. Management is back stabbing and looking out for themselves, as they have to be when no ones job is secure.I worked at Discovery Communications for 3 years. Discovery as many other companies offers great benefits: Salary, 401K, Legal Service, Fitness Reimbursement, tuition reimbursements, Health & Dental plans (Extra: On Site- Wellness Center & Health fairs) However, most companies offer some or all of these benefits to stay competitive.Discovery is going through a huge change in direction, less creative, innovative and exploratory to a more public corporate culture. Focus more on short-term results rather than long term growth to make quarterly and yearly earnings expectations. Let's don't forget that this is likely to get worse since Discovery has been cutting and shifting away positions towards Latin America and Europe.As a working mother, I struggle with being a good mom and being good at what I do.  I can honestly say Discovery has been an amazing place to really enforce work life balance.  With on-site day care, wellness, fitness and options to telework, I've been able to juggle my career and shuttle kids to girl scouts, sports, doctors, and talent shows.  Although my salary could be improved, I think Discovery makes up  for it with other benefits.I am grateful for the opportunity that Discovery has given me these passed 2 years. This organization has been a wonderful launch pad for my career and allowed for both tremendous personal and professional growth. I am fortunate enough to be under an amazing management team that really nourishes professional growth. I have demonstrated the compromise of my role as a Programming Manager, developing working tools that have allowed me to get a better overview of the objectives and have helped me to make the best strategic decisions.  I have demonstrated my competency in the business process, creating competitive programming strategies aligned with the region needs, monitoring broadcast ratings and competitive landscape regularly and developing initiatives to support content strategies.They run a professional operation there.  It's obvious you're working for an industry leader with a high standard of excellence. (Although, standards have dropped a little and a dropping.) Management has made some dubious choices as to whom they promote. Publicly traded company; money is ultimately the bottom line, don't expect life-long loyalty.Discovery has been a good place to work. It offers good work-life balance and good benefits including on-site day care, doctor/nurse offices, and parental leave.Loved working for Discovery. Great culture, great benefits including maternity leave. A lot of women in leadership roles. Great HR staff.Great place work. Management works closely with the staff.  Lots of room to grow in the with many locations if you are willing to relocate.  always away of the status of the company.Great place to  work. Value is found in share price as is executive compensation. Recent layoffs do not help the majority of the company.Very political. They don't really care about your career growth. Upper management is very condescending and don't want to help others grow.The company is an excellent place to work for. Excellent place to start from fresh out of school. Good people to work with.  Good benefit. Good location and safe place to work.The relationship between management and staff is very lose. There is constant communication both formal and informal. A typical workday is the open discussions held to discuss how to better serve the clients. Management is open minded and spend a lot of time on the floor among the workers. Co-workers got along very well and shared mutual respect. They were also supportive of each other and very team oriented.The hardest part of the job is implementing new ideas that are recommended by the staff.And the most enjoyable part was making lasting friendshipLove the upbeat attitude of the workers. Close-knit group. After hours get togethers allowed us to get to know each other on a new level, which ultimately helped be successful on the job.Fun workplace with great people and a very balanced work / life atmosphere.  A great place to start your career and grow.  Lots of movement with a clear career path.Domestically, Discovery Communications is in transition, moving from a strictly cable media company. For example, a stronger focus has been but on digital media.* In Cost Center Accounting, created cost centers, activity types, statistical key figures, Cost Center Standard Hierarchy, cost center categories, document numbers, maintained default account assignments and automatic account assignments, validations and substitutions, distribution and assessment.* In Profit Center Accounting, configured Profit center structure, Standard Hierarchy, Configured Profit center Master Data, assigned different Controlling Objects to Profit Center Accounting.* Responsible for identifying and documenting all CCA and PCA test cases.* Generated reports using Report Painter and Report Writer.* Documented the configurations and prepared functional/ technical specifications.It was a very gratifying experience working for a great company like this. This place has good energy and people are very friendly. In addition to this, most of the people are very professional.I would say overall the company is great. However, there is not much movement or growth. It is also somewhat political. If your boss doesn't like you, you will not do well.Very helpful team of managers, supervisors, and editors.many times a month the company would hold classes for editors to learn programs such as photoshop and After Effects.","1,001 to 5,000",New-York,New York,NY,2016-11-05T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/a3484e55-d251-4c0f-bab6-4ee70305f805?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=19,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

313,2727.0,Senior Statistician,Jet,4.0,75.0,"a typical day at work was grabbing a scanner and a cart full of boxes, scan each box and find the items through out the warehouse to pack into the orders. once all order were filled you returned the cart to be packaged properly and shipped. the hardest part of the job was walking for 10 hours a day but the fixed hours and pay were well worth it. all of my coworkers were very friendly and would help you with any questions you had. the company was very fun and very relaxed when all your hard work was done.Hard work pays off. Good things happen to good people and bad people go to work too work be a positive person at all times .Why complain about your job or doing it when its easy as a light exercise. I myself was the top preformer.Day at Jet Starts off first with getting to work you come in and you immediately get started. Employees are great people. One of the most enjoyable aspects is the atmosphere.It's a great place to work ...has a good family work ethic.they make it a fun environment to work in. Alot of fun.anyone would enjoy working for jet. Apply to them.Work was great at first. They are a new company that doesn't have it together yet. My coworkers were amazing, but the management was iffy to say the least. The hardest part of the job, was how much I didn't like it. I wanted to advance faster than they would allow me. I had all the qualifications to be a lead, but wasn't given the position.A typical day at work is entering work with a positive, going to either pick up the money for my cash register or the folder for inventory or either both. Also, i set my stand up in a timely matter and stating that means counting for inventory, putting money in the register, making lemonade and popcorn...etc, I also greet my customers and begin the day for the came, when its time to leave just recount for inventory clean up my stand and count the money i have made for today and turn everything in,really nice place to work but they pay was not good enough to keep me working there, i had to move on to a better paying companypretty good and easy joblots and lots of walking. very hard on the body after 2 days of working. pay is pretty decent and theres room for growth. all types of people and races working thereWorking for Jet has been a very enjoyable experience. You get to meet and work with different people from different backgrounds.The scheduling is extremely flexible and the job is only hard if you make it hard.Good place to gain experience and further your skills in Welding/Fabricating. Can further skills in laser/water jet cutting and machining.Pros:Great people, easy to move up and to different places. They definitely show their appreciation by catering, and offering advancements to other positions. Cons: A lot of management is clueless. They have strict time policies which make you think they are trying to push people out. They are such a new company that they are still finding their way so there is constant changes.New company just starting up and they're not organized yet. Communication was sporatic & didn't get paid for a month. Hopefully they'll get this worked out over time.Taking phone calls, managing a queue, problem solving, placing orders for clients. I have learned many new systems, procedures, company is constantly changing.Management doesn't communicate with employees or supervisors, there is a big lack.I have some very great coworkers that I work with on my team.The hardest part is how drastic and frequent changes are with no communication.I love working with and being apart of a growing and developing teamHe went out of  business due too lack of funds.. I did like the experience and working with client and the warranty companiesShifts were PRNAttended to medical injuries for young athletesSolo medic for football, soccer, volleyball games and trackAssisted management with sport physicalsI was able to get hands on work where I learned a lot coming out of school.  They let you explore new ideas to help improve products and expand markets.Good work environment with friendly employees but it is a small company with limited resource so you may not be able to implement your project even if there is a good opportunitynot a bad place to work, however, it seems that not everyone is treated fairly based upon the work completed.Great job for extra income. This job has proved to be a great part time job that i have been grateful to have three different cities to work in. It is a great experience because i get to work sporting events, concerts, and other cool events.i would usually be in avert buggy welding the verist all day intill it was time to add another ring. i learned pulse welding is way better and easier to weld with.hardest part was jumping the scaffold boards. easiest part was welding the floor. most enjoyable part was finishing the tank.Wonderful room for advancement and career growth.
