71,2485.0,"Data Scientist, Digital Strategy",Morgan Stanley,3.9,1600.0,"First big job out of college.  Thought is was my dream job, however, found out it is pretty cut throat within the office and very high stress.  Was a good learning experience for me, just wasn't for me as a career.Work consumed your personal life. Constant pressure from management teams to push products that weren't right for the client. You're salary would decrease as your production increased unless you were apart of a ""larger team"". The Management teams were only willing to support advisors when it benefited them for their quarterly bonus. Management was very political in regards to helping certain individuals succeed in the organization. They promote and sell a training program with coaches that had little to no experience whatsoever. In my opinion was a waste of time and money. Can not stress the negative taste I received from the local management team.Typical Day of Work is quite intense. Requires you to use your intellectual abilities and most roles require you to work in collaboration with others. I've learned many different things but due to the focused nature of each role at such a large firm it is probably less than you would encounter at a smaller financial firm.Management is very focused and goal oriented. Generally a good amount of focus is placed on leadership.Coworkers are intelligent and personable. Occasionally, some make it into the firm due to relations with management, however those are fewer now then before.Pay was reasonable, however for such a large firm that has had continued success due to it's people, not enough is paid in comparison to other firms.Working here all depends on your manager and your department. It can vastly vary from one team to the next. You can have a manager that's flexible with work/life and others that are very rigid. I personally think the compensation is not aligned across the board properly and hasn't recovered since the 2008 crash. It claims to be a total reward company yet above base compensation can vary greatly from one year to the next leaving you to be under compensated. Base salaries need an adjustment. How can new associates make the same as veteran officers at the firm.I typically worked eight or nine hours a day.  I learned many things about prime brokerage, and the financial services industry as a whole.  I also learned a lot about operations in general.  Morgan Stanley is a great company because it gives you many opportunities that other firms do not, such as being able to interact freely with upper management (VPs and above).  Middle managers are not that great.  It appears that they may be sandwiched, or pulled in too many directions, and therefore lack focus.  The hardest part of the job is the turnover / attrition.  The most enjoyable part of the job is processing / production, as it does not carry over into the next day.MS has good points and bad points. In the last couple of years they haven't really compensated their employees well. A good point is MS is all about community involvement and volunteering. They dedicated 2 months to giving back and encourages every employee to participate.The CAC is where I work and have worked from day one. The culture /moral is poor. Management is unwilling to listen or support anyone but their own. They will even block anyone from moving to another dept. The pay is reasonable until you want a pay increase. They will say no raises department wide and then give them to management.A typical day  at work can be starting off with a case load of 4 patients and  having to discharge 2-4 and  ending up with all new patient. Management can be helpful at times on a floor level. MY coworkers are my second family. we work together as a team to get the work done in a timely and effective manner. The hardest part of this job at time is working under short staff. The most rewarding part of this job is having to go home  and knowing that i gave it all my best and i actually made a difference in my patient's lives.The business culture did not meet my high standard of work ethics.  Lack of transparency.  There was an extreme lack of communication between staff and management.  When tax reporting issues came up that would result in clients being audited, my concern were left ignored.The work life balance is the best out of any company I've ever worked for! MS really cares that you're able to have a life outside of work. The compensation was okay, but the benefits were great. Management has an open door policy and they take great pride in that. The job culture was wonderful and diverse...leaving so many people to learn from.review daily mismatch report, training offshore team in Guadalajarareporting of CMO securitized items to FINRA.  Daily communication makes work easier and productiveManagement allowed me to work independentlyNothing too hard with proper training.Enjoying my co-workers and being able to help each otherGreat place to work.  Salary and Benefits were also Great. I got alone with my co-workers and helped to meet Company goals and objectives. Enjoyable part of the job was, I never did the same thing everyday. Many assigned tasks were different everyday and a great challenge to meet them. I was disappointed and sad when the Company got out of the Defined Contribution Business.Very supportive management however compensation could be better and ever since they went to the branch complex model, opportunities for advancement are limited.Management has total lack of regard for leadership staff development and recognition. No true track of productivity or path for advancement.Speaking from a Registered Associate (CSA) role, the firm and the branch I worked in valued the employees.  The managers, compliance, operations and reception staff were very respectful and trusted you until you couldn't be trusted. The hardest part of the job was getting accustomed to constant changes in operations and things beyond one's control (i.e. market fluctuation, handling multiple client requests) and the most enjoyable is fulfilling a client's request with ease, having assistance from the managers when you really need it. It's vital that the CSA has a good working ""chemistry"" with their FA's, it makes all the difference especially during stressful times as in any relationship.The management needed to be changed.  They hire you as a temp with no benefits such as holiday pay, sick leave or vacation.  There is no given time frame as to how long you will be on temp status.Very easy to get stuck within a team. Bonuses and raises are becoming less frequent. It is a good place to get some good experience to put on your resume as a young person.The firm is acutely focused on keeping headcount low and budgets thin. The firm provides some nice benefits that come with a big company, but is not competitive with non-bank financial institutions.Compensation is great how ever leadership and management needs to be more diverse. and FAA could use more guidance.. instead of just throwing you out there to fend for your selfNice and friendly staffRight in the middle of midtown Manhattanfast paced work environment Great work ethicsGreat management staff great compensationPeople are nice and understanding and accommodating of any personal issues.

Your fellow employees are kind and very helpful. The most enjoyable part of this job is actually my co-workers.

73,2487.0,Data Scientist - Entry Level,Verizon Wireless,4.0,11400.0,"Constant tracking of percent to goals to ensure you hit your quotas. Fluctuating targets and metrics skew commission month to month. Fantastic benefits.Verizon is an employer of high standards. Employees must be committed to attaining and maintaining these standards, and are well compensated for it.There was amazing people and management that made working at Verizon a fun and enjoyable place to be.  The job was fast paced, and excellence driven but was very rewarding.They brainwash you that they are not a bureaucracy, but that's exactly who they are!  If you dont become buddy buddy with your managers, you get no where!  Not a good company to work for,Work life balance is a weakness with the company. Not much room for growth. A lot of managers are inadequate when it comes to helping the reps become better.talking to customer and selling products to them. I learned how to talk to a customer the right way.

( Morale is awful) The Director is smug and insulting (deliberate ). Especially when you have more call center experience then he. Not worth the money offered.Up to the business decision to sell Verizon Business  West I thought Verizon was the best company to possibly work  for. I will continue to look for opportunities to once again be employed by Verizon. If you ever get a chance to work for Verizon DO NOT HESITATE.Great benefits competitive pay . Great work environment!. Room for advancement.Constant change great employee discountsThis job can be very difficult to do if you want to have a life outside of it. There will be alot of times where you will have to stay past the time you have to leave no matter what.I worked with some of the best people who shared my work ethics. We were family oriented, looking out for one another. Help was always just a matter of asking. It was pure enjoyment coming to work everyday.The company is decent overall but does not protect their employees rights as well as I would like in a place of business. Overall they provided great products.The problem is no matter what this will always be a sales job. The cellphone industry is hurting badly while at the same time your goals increase. Your schedule will always fluctuate. Unless you are the top dog than your job is never safe. If you are a manager than you will really be putting in all the work.independent environment that allows employees to be self sufficient. however, management is very knowledgeable and always willing to help. The benefit are also great especially for new parents.Environment in the stores can be very fun and productive.  However, there are strict goals set which can lead to a stressful environment.  When working in retail it is very hard to have a solid work life balance.The Hardest Part was working just for comission.Manager is the most amazing person in the world. A typical day our office would be making about 30 to 40 sales.Responsibilities included producing revenue through sales and service, handling outstanding customer service, opening/closing the store, inventory checks, stocking, and understanding the products. Consistently generated the most revenue per employee for the store each month while attending evening college classes.While being an Uber Partner and driving commuters around the DC Metropolitan Area, this job has given me the opportunity to meet people of all ethnicity and disabilities. One challenges on the job shows how diverse the world is. I must adapt and be able to communicate with a variety of people when it comes to getting them to there destination.  Another example would be me working as a Lead Sales Associate for Finish Line. At times on the job I would have to remain patient while attending costumers needs. Each Customer should be treated with respect until they are satisfied. I consume products of all sorts, so as a consumer I try to use that advantage to sell merchandise and treat the consumer as a equal individual.The most enjoyable part of both jobs was gaining experience and confidence in retail, management, and communication over the years while I use for future endeavorsYou are micromanaged from day one. The culture is not bad , if someone looking over your shoulder at all time do not bother you. I enjoyed working there.Verizon offers competitive pay and benefits, and provides an ever changing work environment with lots of opportunity for advancement. The quotas can be challenging, and the expectations unrealistic, but lower management was usually someone who recently was in the same position, so they were always willing to help and team sell. The hours are normal retail hours, which mean you are drained dry during holiday season, or at any special release (iPhone release for example). Customers are terrible and demanding, and there isn't much in place where employees can defend themselves from harassment or unfair treatment by customers.Overall, the job is pretty good and the pay is higher than similar positions, but if you don't like working weekends, holidays and never having a set schedule, look somewhere else.","10,000+",New-York,New York,NY,2016-11-30T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/3aa15715-a32c-4d58-acf6-905c73213d8e?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=20,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

495,2909.0,Advanced Analytics – Sr. Statistician,Merkle Inc,3.4,16.0,"Merkle is a place where you can learn a lot in a short time period, so it is a great place for new graduates to build up experience.  However, it is very challenging to find work life balance here.Took this role on when no one else would.  Good company, good co workers but manager was an ego maniac.  Different rules for different folks.  Hiring was at a high while there, mostly young people making good money however long hours.The role wore a lot of hats!  Very fast paced, sometimes not always appreciated the extra mile that was given.  Great location!!  Near Columbus Circle, pay was decent.What makes this job enjoyable is the compassion and fun natured people who worked there. Even though we have set work to do, with information technology, each day presents new challenges. The people I work with at this job were awesome and my direct management was also awesome. What this company is missing is a connection between the people doing the work and the upper management chain. They seem to make decisions without thinking about the ramifications. The company is also offshoring to China, so IT people watch out.Good working environment, close to home, friendly coworkers.  Got along with management extremely well.  Nearly all operational work transferred to offshore.Merkle Inc. is a mail processing plant that deals with monies from around the country. Most deal with donations that have to be counted, re-counted, then sent to the bank for confirmation. As a Check 21 clerk, I was able to work with some of the hardest clients that Merkle Inc. had to offer. The co-workers were friendly enough, however, there was a lot of drama that went on, and reminded me a lot of high school. Management was horrible, they never told you anything positive. If you messed up, you got told about it. The hardest part of the job was making sure the monies went to the bank at a certain time every day. Honestly, the best thing: they're closed on weekends, which gave me time to spend with family and friends.This is a fast pace company with no training; upper management does not have a clue on what is going on day to day. There is no work life balance in the company. The job expectations are unrealistic.Hectic and busy day working with executives and candidates to schedule phone or onsite interviewsManagement is amazingMerkle is a fine place to work with many good attributes such as hosting team building events, etc. One of its downfalls is its work-life balance. This is because it can be overly demanding at times.Merkle is not a great place to work.  The company is very focused on the bottom line at the expense of their employees.  They do not invest in developing their employees at all.  They understaff every account and expect employees to wear 3 to 4 hats and work more than 50 hours a week.  It is definitely not a family friendly environment.Get into work and start working. I am on  the computer either researching client's names or address for other people in other departments through email or phone.  Print out certain letters or reports which are needed for that day.  Help out other people on your team with their work when you run out. The hardest part of the job is when you have to get certain reports or letters and either the computer is not being cooperative or the printer stops working in the middle of the print job.•	Managed new client on-boardings through Merkle’s eight step process•	Planned and ran meetings dealing with new client on-boardings, existing clients, or solving IT problems •	Developed spreadsheets of company and client data, for easy department analysis•	Assisted in the development of Virtual Machines for clientsThis company has smartest people I've ever worked with - not to mention great culture and blue chip clients - great opp to grow and develop next generation marketing skillsPeople in Merkle are nice to each other. Willing to help and committed to work. Need improvement on work life balance though.They terminate people right to left for unknown policies that were not mentioned in the training. Literally my second week at Merkle my manager was fired. The training was immediately getting pushed into the job field, I am guessing it was meant to be a hands on experience. The only issue with that is errors can also get you terminated which was ridiculous. I learned that factor through training later in my employment for Quality Control analysis. Some employees love the place some had a very hard time with working at Merkle. This review is specifically for the Merkle in Hagerstown Maryland. If you could not stay the mandatory 10 hours you were getting marked up. Some people there had emergencies and children and still were marked up for leaving. They had a system called "" seven occurrences""  you only can get seven mark-ups and you were terminated. the bad thing is they do not tell you when they were giving you occurrences and if they did it was normally when you had two left. The system would have worked out well if occurrences were for reasons that were insubordinate toward the policy. However it was not, you came in a minute late , half a occurrence, came in a minute late from lunch which was only 30 minutes you were eligible to receive a full occurrence. Had to leave early no matter how severe the complications were you would receive an occurrence. You get too many errors when typing in data you got an occurrence, you were not allowed to get errors and if you did it literally could only be one or two mistakes. In that case I did not understand the job of the Quality Control  more... if errors could not be corrected. Merkle literally did not have any empathy for their employees whatsoever. I watched a man who worked for Merkle over 12 years get terminated. I worked there almost a year and was training for a higher position and they still terminated me over occurrences. In my opinion and this is not because I was terminated this place was terrible! and at worst unjust. I pray that the standards and policy has changed for the sake of the employees.  lessProductive company with great employeesA lot of learning possibilitiesHelpful coworkersSome communication issues between departmentsStartup company feel, with ping pong tables, in office gym, dogs at work, no rules vacation policy. Lots of clever people to work with.",,New-York,New York,NY,2016-11-30T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/92040311-0184-4fbe-a61e-4d4656053bef?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=30,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
