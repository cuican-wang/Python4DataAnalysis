492,2906.0,Sr. Applications Scientist - Beverage (67607),Givaudan SA,4.0,61.0,"to much buddy system for advancement. if your in the 5 oclock club your in. if you disagree with decisions of management you are blackballed and put on watch.highly recommend it as a place to work for. friendly people great benefits, work day works flow very fast. great management team in place for the employees.Put raw materials in racks to be picked for orders, took garbage out. learned about the operating system called SAP. learned difference between flammable and combustible. management was very production oriented. co workers were friendly and helpful. the hardest part of the job was lifting alot of weight frequently. the most enjoyable part of the job was cleaning up.I had taken this job, with the expectation of advancing within the company. Within 9 months, it became clear that this was not going to happen. Daily responsibilities include responding to customer emails and requesting standard FDA documents for flavor production. The atmosphere within my department is pleasant, however I would like to advance.Very wasteful environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you are allowed to come up with ideas independently and be a part of the driving success for the future of the firm. The hardest part of the job is just seeing the waste of product, talent(s) are not being put to good use and waste of resources.On a typical day I work with colleagues in nearly every department on site to understand our needs and any limitations (warehouse space, labor, etc.).  I work with vendors worldwide and colleagues outside the facility to ensure materials arrive in a cost affective way just in time (JIT) for production.  I enjoy the fact that, although I run the same reports on a daily basis, I never know what is going to happen or who I need to work with to reach my daily objectives.  I like that Givaudan is a large international company and that I can work with people from all over the world on a daily basis.  I also enjoy working with SAP, and appreciated the extensive training Givaudan provided.  Givaudan is a very innovative company and they value the input of their employees regardless of their role.  Givaudan also offers a great benefits package for its employees.My on site managers are receptive to my communications with them and work to implement requests that my coworkers and I make.Great organization to work for overall. They really strive to understand how their employees feel and make their work life a positive environment. I enjoyed working for Givaudan as they are a robust and stable organization.Givaudan is a great company to work for. It offers great benefits, job security and stability. Management is friendly and competent and the industry is very fascinating.A very matrixed organization with wonderful benefits. In terms of pace, the organization moved very slowly. However, every day could be spent doing productive work.This was a great place with wonderful medical and dental benefits.  However you will spend many hours due to demand and workloadnot bad enjoy what i do just looking for more pay and better opportunity for growthforklift operation/chemical experienceIn cincnnati they backstab and fight to get to the top only there is no top and florence the management makes so much money they can be on there cell phones texting all of the time and asking their rats hows everything going their safety is terrible and they pay you 14.75 an hour and expects you to do more work than people getting 26.00 an hour yes slavery is not dead its working at givaudan.Great strong firm with  a great reputation in the industry.  Room for creativity, ideas and growth.  Long hours, hard work but, if you are committed to the field, you will love it.It was wonderful working with the residents and getting to spend time with them.  Sad to see some residents had no family or friends as visitors.  Sometimes the staff wasn't the kindest to the patients.Be careful, East Hanover has lab Supervisors and Managers that play favorites. And the Manager keeps nothing confidential.Company is very employee and customer focused.  I learned a lot about the fragrance industry as well as learning development.Prepared orders for shipments , followed purchased orders and pick list , Followed regulations to ship orders by air, ocean and truck freight.Coordinated freight pick up, Inspected all deliveries for completeness ,quality and accuracy. Sampled and inspected goods entering warehouse by logging and scanning into system .Very face-paced, high fashion and high production. Loved working there.Seeking a challenging position in the field of Production in a multinational company with a challenging environment where I can apply my training, studies, interpersonal and communication skills.I created life long friendships with some I worked with. It is a fast pace environment that required hours of overtime.Givaudan, is my first permanent job as a lab tech.. I enjoyed it and learned alot about the products we work with, and the company.","5,001 to 10,000",New-York,East Hanover,NJ,2016-11-22T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/2708faca-ca9c-42ee-bdac-46171358a89b?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
