Constantly changing directions on a whim and have little loyalty to employees.  Benefits look good on paper until you learn little truths like the $5k Training Allowance is not a guaranteed benefit.  Most requests for training are denied.I currently work with Praescient Analytics as an analyst consultant, but I would like to move forward with my career in ways that my current company cannot fulfill.  I love the family atmosphere that the executive team cultivates as well as their excellent benefits package they offer.

240,2654.0,"Entry Level Geologist I, Environmental",Aecom Technology Corporation,3.7,1900.0,"Work with analyzing data, writing reports, developing monitoring plans, and managing technicians in the field. Co-workers are all very friendly.The environment is pleasant, friendly and professional. I learned a vast amount of skill sets which helped me towards my management career. My co-workers were very efficient and diligent in working as a team. The most difficult part of the job was the internal politics, lack of planning, limited knowledge in managment from a production standpoint. Unfortunatly, there wasn't clear/consice descision making inwhich affected the direction of projects. There was 2 sets of 'laws' and alot of internal turmoil between groups. The most enjoyable part of the job was being sucessful reaching deadlines enlight of the time constraints/challenges.AECOM is a great place to work and learn Construction Management.  As a Construction Superintendent, I was able to interact with different contractors on a ""work order"" basis"" and learned more about RFP procedures and contract timelines to complete projects to final closeout.Friendly atmosphere and good team experience. Good work culture and enjoyed working with management and friendly co-workers. Enjoyed extra-curricular events and celebrations.The job has a lot of room for improvement. I was told that there would be sufficient training. That wasn't the case. The procedures are all reliant on who is in the room, if the manager is in the room all t's are crossed and I's are dotted. When the supervisor was in the room, incidents were deliberately ignored on their order. If this was ever caught the supervisor would place the blame on the operators. The pay is ok for what the job involves. The benefits were very expensive. Overall this job would be much better if the management were replaced, and better benefits were includedThis is a company so filled with red tape and beauracracy that it can't get out from its own way.  The culture and day to day work environment is horrible unless you enjoy fulfilling non-engineering related tasks that are tied to meeting accounting requirements imposed from a corporate management that has no knowledge of day-to-day operations performed by the engineering staff of professionals.The company has been focusing on Employee development and satisfaction in recent months. benefits could be better. not very competitive. Management can also be improvedBenefits are a thing of the past for this company. Health insurance benefits are doubling in price and the coverage is going down. Look to spend 20-30% of your salary for health coverage. In 2017 you will be penalized for having a working spouse on your insurance plan.Would be a great place to work if there were any hope for pay increases.  The job itself is very satisfying working along side with various  government officials,  There is no room for advancement, but much training is provided to ensure that everyone is the best that  they can be at their own jobs.The company offer a variety of benefits and paid above average compensation.  The costs were average in the industry.  There is constant change coming from Corporate leadership which resulted in a stressful work environment.  No work/life balance due to long hours.Collaborative. Forward-thinking. Dynamic. Our culture mirrors our work product. With a diverse practice and projects that span the globe, AECOM is an ideal place to build your career and develop skills in entrepreneurship, project delivery, leadership, and life.Good company and people,nice atmosphere, flexible on start and end times. There are many online training platforms, just need more practical application and direction for the long term. Benefits are decent, just raised rates.great co workers, really made me feel like part of the team. Very knowledgeable and eager to help and new grad/hire like myself. Inconsistency from top down management. Furlough and layoff cycles made for very stressful situation visa v job security.Working with AECOM is a great company for advancement. Great working environment with co works. Good Team work within the company. Management gets back to you in a timely manner.Excellent employer with great benefits and management.  A team approach to construction projects is beneficial for all and is followed very well by co-workers and management alike.Tried to do the best I could with little training. Management was puppet to the host company and would throw us under the bus to make themselves look better.No raises, no weekends, no room for advancement, high turn around rate, poor corporate managers, and micromanaging. Not to mention the horrible benefits!Ive been with the company for eight years and overall they are a great company but there is no advancement within the company. Management needs to improve.Most people seem to get hired because they are friends with management or related to them in some way. There is no room for advancement. You never get recognized for the hard work you put in. Management is horrible, way too much favortism on this contract. Benefit are a joke!!! Overpriced health insurance with an over inflated deductible. Sick days and jury duty days you pay for out of your Health and Welfare Benefit. They change the way you receive your Sick days and Vacation going back and forth from accrual to front loading different times through out year. This is the contractor to avoid whilst looking for a job at Fort Bliss.I prefer not to answer this as the last 4 years has been the worst I've ever gone through. To begin with the job was fun and I learned a lot.  But 4 years ago, we became a service center with a new manager who changed the entire atmosphere of the office and our jobs. And then 2 years ago we went under a different division of the company and URS was bought by a company named AECOM and things just got worse.  People were being laid-off until it got to my position and then 10 of us lost our jobs.  In the last 4 years I went from 9% raises to 1% and 0%A typical day of work as a Logistics  Analyst at AECOM were both challenging and rewarding.  The challenging were to remain flexible and engaged in the procurement and tracking of product. I learned that the Integrated Logistics Support documents requires constant update and your co-workers/team member must be supportive of each other to include management to meet both the customer and company needs.  The most rewarding part of the job were delivering  the end product to the customer and properly trained.",201 to 500,New-York,New York,NY,2016-10-23T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/6428c107-0b5d-471c-a5ca-13a659cf97e6?mescoid=1900265001001&jobPosition=18,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
