98,2512.0,Senior Investments Data Scientist,AIG,3.8,915.0,"The company has had turnover in senior management over the last decade.  This unfortunately has created an environment of chaos with regards to having effective management in place.  Many managers typically stay in their office and it is up to the employee to approach the manager vs. the manager actually setting clear and direct communications.  This leads to the overspending of funds for system enhancements and/or projects.  A number of the Project Managers hired recently don't seem to know how to manage a project as those project managers from years ago.  It is unfortunate this company gone from being a great company (with some issues, needless to say) and many, many dedicated employees to a company of counting $$$, which it is wasting on an immense basis.Good work life balance and great benefits. Shift differential for over night shift and benefits for the weekend. International company that has many other offices for international opportunities.There was no room for advancement unless you wanted to move to the technical side of the house and then that wasn't guaranteed. Lots of lay offs with the administrative staff.Really depends on the department you work. During my time there, the company was going through a lot of restructuring which involved a lot of lay offs. So as you can imagine, that environment wasn't really the greatest to work in as many people were worried about Job security. My favorite part about working there though were my managers. Their open door policy, honesty, among many other things made working there quite pleasantI learned a lot at AIG and the management is generally easy to work with.  The hardest part of the job was the way systems were sometime implemented.  The people were the best part of the job.Productive Workplace. I have worked with AIG for eight years and I am currently looking for a Customer Service or Administrative position.They were a great company to work for. They were supportive of all the employees and their job goals. Management and co-workers were very helpful and friendly.Good place to work for a big company, but you only learn a small piece of the company. The people are fun and the environment is okay. Lots of overtime during quarter end, but overall was okayAllowed myself to have creative freedom in a relaxed atmosphere, with great management. AIG did the best to accommodate me for the high costs of living in the San Francisco Bay Area. Only downfall was being laid-off during company cutbacks from a job I truly enjoyed.Overall, I enjoyed my 10 years with AIG.  AIG chose to exit the Employer and Voluntary Group Benefits business and in doing so allowed them to align more closely with the company's organizational goals and vision.  As part of this strategic reorganization, my position as an Account Service Rep, along with hundreds of others, no longer fit in with the new direction AIG is currently undertaking.I enjoy working at AIG.  Awesome teamwork environment.  The work life balance is great.  The management style is very open and laid back.  The most enjoyable part of the job is finding great talent to join the organization.I really enjoyed my time at this company.  I was given the opportunity to learn many areas and had the chance to do all aspects of different positions from data entry, processing, scanning , mail sorting to applications.This was a good job for me to bridge my job loss from AT&T to retirement. I would recomment this company for other job applicants.Overall my experience at AIG was not good. Not clear who your reporting to. 3 changes in management in a 6 month period. Overwhelming tasks, Work/Life balance almost non existent.Head of Department resigned 3 months after I resigned. Good for a single person who is a workaholic.The management is very engaged with their staff and everyone works towards one goal...the customer.  This is a very professional environment with skilled individuals.Handled workers comp claims from beginning to end.  Was allowed to work from home 4 days a week.  Co-workers are very helpful.A typical day at work is a stressful one wondering when you are going to be laid off.  AIG is not a bad company and there is a lot to learn but Management has been concentrating more on the layoff of employees instead of making the employees happy and give them an incentive to stay with AIG.No raises are given.  Benefits are good but moral is not.  The day is like a sword hanging over your head wondering what time it will fall on your head.Could be a great company but it fails.  Different departments doing the same work in different fashions,  why not stream line and handle calls, disbursements and other transaction the say way among all department.  AIG does not value it's employees.enjoyed working as a scheduler but was working 3 jobs and could work the hours. It was too much to handle the hours. I called clients that had a retirement fund with the company and scheduled meetings with their adviser to go over their retirement goalsVery political , high turnover, employee gets burned. there's not too much advancement. stay there not long, can't comment on too much. Can this sight not force people to write review ?Great opportunity to meet people from all walks of life and different parts of the world.  Continued learning and sharing outlooks and outcomes of life experiences.","10,000+",New-York,New York,NY,2016-11-09T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/f4b4105b-3a04-4f97-82da-f96fe2e7efe1?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=16,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
99,2513.0,Data Scientist,Sapient Corporation,3.9,132.0,"Sometimes it is more show business than actual hands on. Management usually care for those who show more and they don't care to find out who actually is working hard.Good company and good work culture.Good compensation benefits and work life balance.Company offers good growth and has good clients. Good perks and 401k benefits.Great culture as an old entity, but lack of leadership after merged with a french company.  lack of innovations and commitment to growth as a company and employees.After working there for so many years I was hoping to grow in my role; however, I was stuck doing the same thing over and over and got bored.  Culture is fun but as a loyal employee one wants to grow and feel appreciated by the company.  Some of the managers are a bit unexperienced (not all) and very young.  The lack of experience can create difficult situations.  The company has great clients and brands but you will not be assigned to a role because of your skills.  If they need a body, they will trow you into the fire.  To survive in this culture you need to constantly be kissing arses.  You will work hard but that's given.Good place to work in sapient environment.Financial growth as well as skill enhancement..Decent pay master and work life balance is very good for recruiters when compared to other similar consulting environmentSapient is an employee friendly place and compensation is good  too. Leadership is approachable.Work culture is fun and they do lot of activities and parties too.Hardest part of the job is time management sometimes.People are friendly and socializingIn my experience, there are 2 types of people who work here.1. Who identify themselves very strongly with the Sapient culture. They work hard, party harder. Dont hesistate to take responsibilities, risk-takers and cool people to hang out with.2. Who are content leading easy lives. Work just so much as needed. Nothing more, nothing less.The career path, compensation etc. is driven by whioch category you belong to.Overall, the company is good. Encourages you to come up with creative solutions. A sincere effort is more often than not acknowledged!The real talent at Sapient lies in the mid-career stage workers. These are the architects, the designers, the developers, and the PMs who tirelessly work to successfully deliver projects for clients.You can expect a culture of hard work with limited reward and work/life balance. On the up side, there are really smart people working on interesting things for high profile clients.Sapient is a company that truly values their workforce where they value you as a PERSON first, and then utilize your skill second.  A strong job culture that, when you're the right fit, you harmonize with your peers and create and complete amazing projects.  I call it ""Google Consulting"".  If you're looking to be inspired by the work you do, and the people you work with, I highly advise you to find your place in this company.i enjoyed each and every minute in the company i really had a good experience with them.And the co-workers where really very good and i was really comfortable working with themTeam are global so you often work outside of NA timezones. Good overall culture and flexibility is offered.Overall it is fun with lots of activities and work going on. Office design is awesome.Good working environment, fun place.Most enjoyable part: Bagels on Wednesdays and Fridays.Nice place to work for Business  Consulting in the midstream industry. People who want to work on the area of Business devlopement & Long Term Client relationship, strategic Partnering with Clients...this is the place to go to. Also recently taken over by a french company Publicis which also has Digitas and Razonfish under the same umbrella, so the possibilities are boundless in future. Sapient also imparts and encourages lot of trainings to grow their people in the area they want to. The houston office is limited to Global Markets business unit, mostly deals with oil and gas pipeline systems automation and TRM.Productive fun place to work with a foozball table.  Work life balance is important here.  Flat organizational structure helps approachability with leadership.Company is good for college pass out with wide spectrum of project to gain experience. Very slow progress for Manager and above. You need to watch your own back when on you go on Bench.The work and atmosphere entirely depend on the project that you are on. Most of the company is at the site of the client, half of Government Services is at NIH in Bethesda so there is not a lot of visibility among leadership there.OnPoint/Sapient has terrific people.  The company supported many of my change management initiatives.  It was rewarding to know I made a contribution through education and training.	Verifying the functionality of the Insurance portal. 	Developed Test plan based on testing requirements and created Test cases. 	Responsible for creating quotes and policies, calculate ITV and endorsements in  	Main Frame environment	Actively participated in enhancement meetings focused at making the application more stable for real time usage. 	Reviewed the bug reports in bug meetings with developers. 	Involved in various levels of testing including Smoke test between various builds and patches. 	Involved in UAT (User Acceptance Testing). 	Worked with agents to develop user UAT (User Acceptance Testing) for Internet-based busi-ness applications. 	SAP CRM GUI testingSapient is a great Company to work for.
