65,2479.0,Data Scientist II,Comcast,3.8,6500.0,"Great company & great people, great benefits as well. I have learned many things while working at Comcast- I have done an overall training of our department to grow within the companyHuddles are conducted each morning to review performance and address anything necessary for the day or week.  Consistent rotation for greeting and helping customers with an easy Queue system to track who is in the store.  Management and upper management always actively looking for your opinion of workplace, opportunities, as well as customer feedback. Hardest part of the job is getting to know the system and working for a company which does not have the best track record for customer service.  It's hard to work with people who do not like this company, which is often, but it is worth it when you are able to change the perspective of the company with your store and your own customer service.The best thing about this job is the co workers. The benefits are okay. Alot of time off. But work/life balance isnt that great. Supervisors are always on you about metrics. Numbers numbers numbers. Your numbers can be great for a couple of months with no issues until you have a bad month then your integrity as a technician is put into question.  And then all of a sudden you start receiving corrective actions for little things so they can get you out the door. Its not about the customer its about metrics. The pay is terrible for the type of work you do (climbing poles, getting into attics, rewiring houses, correcting mistakes that contractors didnt correct, angry customers, faulty equiptment and management on your behind. At&t deals with the same amount of issues but atleast they get paid well for it and they have union.A typical day at work usually is not so routine.  I can either climb a ladder, enter a crawl space, or simply install inside a customer's home.  I have learned quite a bit working for Comcast.  I have learned the basics of cable installation, also how to communicate with customers and troubleshoot their problems.  The management is very helpful and supportive.  My coworkers are very friendly and funny.  The hardest part of the job would have to be working out in all of the weather. The best part of the job is interacting with customers and learning more and more about my job.This was by far, the worst company I've ever worked for.  Management fostered a snitch culture among the employees, encouraging them to inform on one another, driving down morale.  In addition to informing on one another, employees constantly watch for 'weakest link' tickets and pounce, not for the edification of the employee, but for the sole purpose of making themselves look good at the expense of that employee.  In addition, management had its favorites and its designated 'red-headed stepchildren', often deliberately embarrassing other reps in front of their peers.My advice - do your career a favor - AVOID COMCAST!!!!this company could be a great one to work for if they could get all departments on the same page with the same ethical standards. As a customer facing employee, the majority of the job was being screamed at for misinformation, lies, or unwanted products being given to customers by phone representatives, all while trying to upsell those angry customers into more services, then begging for a 5 on the satisfaction survey. In the ever-complex technical world that Comcast inhabits, amazingly the only two fixes offered to any issue are a new TV box, or a new modem regardless of the actual issue(s) affecting service.Normal working day. Job training with new software. Super Management Team, benefits and excellent working environment.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customer issues which was not a problem really, especially when we had to apply what we learned during the training on how to deal with these types of situations. The most enjoyable part is the rewards. Comcast knows how to shower its employees with gifts, stipends and also the quarterly pay granted every individual employee sales percentage. This is what to expect while working at Comcast Cable Communications.I would worked 11 hour shifts. I would take customers calls to help them with their TV, Internet and phone service. I learned different ways to help meet customers. The management was great with helping you learn to be a better agent. I was part of a team of 14 so we would have have weekly meetings to discuss problems and new options coming out. The supervisor would also do one on one meetings to share with you your strengths and weakness. The hardest part of my job was always trying to find away to make all of the customers happy. The most rewarding part of my job was when I was able to lower a customer's bill or make customers day better.This is secure job and some of the benefits are good, but overall a difficult place to work. Customer service, although on the surface seems decent, is severely lacking. Technicians can do anything and everything to support the customer and provide great customer service, but every other line of customer service is defective in many ways. Pay is very low in comparison to other communications companies and requirements for promotion are only getting more absurd.I was able to do my work without supervision.  If I needed to work with my team, we were allowed to collaborate on issues. I learned a lot of new technical skills. Management was awesome, until they changed directors.  I loved my co-workers.  They were always willing to help, when I was new. Hardest part of my job at the end was dealing with the time restraints that were put on us once the director changed everything about our job.  I love talking to people, and giving good customer service, as well as resolving the customers issues.I worked at Comcast for many years. Moved up through several positions and enjoyed each position that I took on. It is more difficult to maintain a position in the customer service and sales departments due to the ever changing stats that must be adhered to but it is possible to get the job done. Management, for the most part, was always helpful and friendly. Once I moved into a less customer facing position and worked from the back office, I started to really enjoy my Comcast life. Office team was much smaller than the call center teams and the full team including management were able to actually get to know one another. I definitely wouldn't mind going back. I would like more money, though.Typical day at work would consist of taking calls from people who wanted to switch companies or add or remove services, or people who had service problems or billing problems, etc....  Some days would consist of team meetings in which we went over our team's numbers and other days consisted of coaching where we went over our individual performances.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the people I worked with and the feeling of appreciation from customers who believed I did everything in my power to help them.  The hardest part of the job was when I wasn't able to help people to their satisfaction for one reason or another despite my efforts to do so.Spent 13 years working for them in various capacities. Worked in the field at two locations as a technician for first year and a half then eleven + in two call centers. During that time I saw a lot of changes. Some good and some not. High turnover. Toughest thing was providing good quality customer service because of lack of training and enough tools at your disposal to assist customers. Company had a perception that they were providing great service. Comcast management realized based on responses from employees that it was frustrating and possessed limited abilities to succeed. They have since changed their policies, procedures and expectations for call center representatives.After 1.5 years of working for Comcast Xfinity, I can honestly say that I learned a lot about problem solving, great customer service delivery, and enhanced my computer skills. I have learned to address technical equipment issues as well as interpreting complex code errors from customers' accounts, turning them into basic explanation. Management hasn't been always on top of their game, this year due to short-staffing, employees quitting, but at the end of the day management still pulls through. Overall, Comcast has a lot of opportunity for different positions to apply for and also brings out the best in you. The sales environment can be quite stressful with customer complaints and coworker/new hire ambitions. However, adapting to that kind of environment will only make you stronger.In 16 years, 20 total in all with the company and different owners.  I had always been respected and worked well in the company Instead of having opportunities past your grade is tough after your at the top.  To move to management or headend is impossible unless your willing to relocate.  The Northwestern supervisors were very professional and helpful.  The Midwestern supervisors had no clue to the extent of the experience differences there is to the other areas.  I was farther into fiber than coax in the NW.  It was a night and day experience in the two areas. No matter what, always work hard.Great company, good benefits and a nice people. I started in 1984 and worked as a construction tech, moved into Installation, service and on to Head End operations.This was followed by deployment of an enterprise network, An all fiber network under the name of cell back haul.Routing cellular traffic and metro Ethernet traffic through our facilities and into local points of contact throughout our region.Deploying DWDM transport equipment, active and passive.Monitoring equipment daily, maintaining, servicing and organizing and repairing as needed.Testing, installing new routers, switches, installing circuits on a daily basis.Testing and turning up of 1g,10g, and 100g optical links.I will always value this expearance with Comcast as I endeavor to seek new opportunities.Working in cable you have to be ready and willing to adapt to changes very quickly. With almost everything being done over high speed internet the customers needs often dictate how your day will go. Overall this is an excellent company to work for with great benefits and room for advancement. The crew of technicians work hard to provide quality service to the customers as does the management team. Thought the years I've learned how to adapt quickly and change directions at a moments notice. Dealing with customers can be the hardest part of the job at times, but also the most satisfying when you can resolve an issue for a truly thankful customer.I was putting in 60 hour weeks steadily and they were billing techs as part time employees ontop of contractor per job compensation which ended in a class action lawsuit for unpaid overtime. I did not participate in this lawsuit but it caused this installation to go under.We were required to complete 10-15 jobs per day some days working up to 15 hours at a time, 6 days a week. Customers were often very irritated and angry before I even met them due to previous technicians sub par work. When you work with a large group of individuals the work reflects on everyone involved. I was able to relax customers and eliminate repeat service calls by educating them on the services properly.PROS: Good Pay, Good Health Benefits, 401k, Quarterly Bonuses,  40hrs vacation (yearly), employees who know what they're doing help you out.CONS: Forced to make sales in any position, Supervisors/Management never available, Information provided in training not acurate, Customers you handle constantly screaming, cussing, degrading you while you have to keep professional demeanor, can still get in trouble even while following policy, No job security.If you can handle not having any support or any form of leadership and can handle overly irate customers while biting your tongue and have your job dependent on metrics that you truly have no control over and constantly being given misinformation then penalized for utilizing the misinformation then this is the job for you oh also they won't mention this until after your hired but be sure to sharpen up on your sales pitches because this is definitely a large portion of your job requirement.The hours are long, expectations a bit unrealistic due to varying skill levels. You have your workers who aren't that great but can knock out a lot of jobs, or the truly knowledgeable workers who don't have enough time to get everything done properly and up-to-code.  Corporate environment can be a bit shady, people get fired for bringing up the word union or making too much noise on issues. Management are just pawns of the corporate system here. However compared to a lot of companies, they're not all bad.   Pay is average for low voltage; however, benefits really are great as well as quarterly bonuses. You will deal with a lot of cleaning up Comcasts mess so besides hands-on experience you better have customer service skills as well.    I give it 3 stars due to there being so much room for improvement and they put the almighty dollar over anything else even customer or employee experience.Never in all my years of work have I had the pleasure of working with a group that cared so much about the customer. So much so that I now worry about every interaction and find ways to better myself, all on behalf of supporting our departments that ultimately support our customers, the ones that I work for and pay my paycheck. The people I am surrounded by are intimately aware of their impact on the customer, and every decision is scrutinized for ways in which we can better serve them. I am proud to work with such dedicated people.","10,000+",New-York,New York,NY,2016-12-03T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/d4816b55-5c24-4d7b-ad22-4bcb52546a86?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The rest of the company based out of MA and out of the United States provides better management and a bitter work environment.Very good company to work for. The work load is very reasonable. Management do change usually, however it is just titles, the people stay the same. Great coworkers, the environment is not at all toxic.most enjoyable part of the job is the team is very good at being international, a global company feels much smaller due to weekly meetings.Horrible experience interviewing......manager from PA wanted to prove something and was visciously trying to degrade me during our meeting.  Asked such irrelevant questions should have reported her....this place not worth the culture.....very bad wrap.  Manager wasn't even professionally dressed.  Glad I ended the interview abruptly...lolA world class pharmaceutical, with no sight of slowing down. There is an emphasis on the Opex (Operational Excellence) initiative. All employees are encouraged to put forward and initiate projects to enhance the overall experience at TEVA. From my hire date till present the site is almost unrecognizable. Love working Here.I work from 8:30-5pm at my current position at Teva, Mon-Friday.   I have learned how to use Oracle, Image Now systems in the almost 7 years here.   I am a team player and value my job and have a strong worth ethic.    The most enjoyable part of my job is working on resolving issues that arise from internal and external customers.I have enjoyed working in the Procurement industry for 20 years, however we are nearing site closure by year end. When the site closes I look forward to opening new doors to experience new opportunities.Great people, culture, compensation. The dual business model of generics and branded products has provided stability during the industries ups and downs.very quick paced environment, great people, great opportunities and great pay. They offer great benefits and compensation depending on what shift you work. Great leadership as well. The company has a bright future.I learned a lot working here.  I had a great supervisor which to this day I am still friends with.  I really developed an interest in quality control after working at this specific temp job.Teva Pharmaceuticals is a great company to work for..The benefits are great, vacation time is generous, and work/life balance is pretty solid. However, advancement opportunities are available seemingly only in specific departments.Ten hr day,  where I had to mix large bins of chemicals.  I was only there for a short period because the chemicals affected my breathing.  However, there are other departments.Not a good place for bluecollar workers. Always under pressure to perform and always worried about losing your job. Management is too concerned about their own survival to be concerned about their direct reports. However there are quite a few nice people there, but as the saying goes, ""nice people finish last"".No advancement opportunities or employee mentoring. The leadership is always afloat when it comes to everyday activities and makes decisions without thinking ahead. Only to satisfy immediate need and not consider the long term effects.Employees are the given the impression of been involved but its far from the truth.It is a place where the people are awesome and the environment is motivating. The days fly by at work and you get paid well. the company performs well and is in a great industry.Love the company it's amazing all around and they do everything the way it should be done and have the best management and go by there own values to keep the environment welcomignTeva is an excellent company with hard working dedicated employees.  The work days are long and fast paced, but the teamwork makes it all worth while.  The hardest part of the job was the downsizing required after each of our multiple acquisitions.I am an independent contractor and have the ability to create my own work schedule. Within this position I have had the opportunity to strengthen my interpersonal skills. I am able to in interact with different patients on a daily basis and train them on their therapy. It can be challenging to at times to enter patient's homes although, it not only has strengthened my skills as a nurse but in turn has strengthened my communications skills.Very good work environment. Not sure about job everyday. Family environment.Overall very good work place. Management very good and good benefits. Co-workers very helpful.Pay is good. Not a secure place to work if you don't want to worry about your job every two months. If you want to find out more try and work there I guess.I love my job there. Always some thing new to learn and share with my colleagues. I have learnt a great deal of knowledge. Management is pretty flexible and cooperative.Very good and nice company .
