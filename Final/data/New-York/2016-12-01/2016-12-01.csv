I finished my project and they had no place for me to go, though I'd have liked to continue with them. However, I do staff augmentation contracting and this is not unusual.Went on an approved vacation only to find out when I came back that they can no longer have me on active payroll. Dysfunctional senior management; nepotism throughout the company; never worked anywhere with worse upper management than this. Zero job security.Advice to ManagementThey need a clean sweep of upper management and some middle management. Respect your hard working employeesGreat Place to work. I learned Great Plains accounting Software.The management is very nice and flexible. my co-workers were very friendly and helpful, The hardest part of the job was when the work load would slow down.The most enjoyable part was learning knew accounting techniques.Was told travel was 20% to 40% and it ended up being 100%.

9,2423.0,Data Scientist,Randstad Technologies,3.8,7200.0,"very effiecient in getting in contact regarding job openings, don't work within the company as I am an agent they send out for various jobs if i fit the criterialaoding and unloading store products. Dusty warehouse conditions. Also worked certied forklift. Hard working labor for a minimum quick pay check.overall good place to work, great friendly environment good management. happy place to be if you make it that way. I enjoyed going to work everydayI went thru this company as Siemens called me back after lay off. They were very professional and helped me go thru the process very quickly.I like company because it has lot of opportunity to work with and get lots of experience but they are slow with they employees and sometime I cant understand them because they send u different places to work but I like that at sametime I want to stable schedule.scheduling staff, talking with guests, managing servers, bartenders and chefs.  lots of customer service and talent development.This position started as a dream job for me; seemingly great compensation, almost immediate benefits, promise of bonuses!  However, things quickly went south.  Mostly this was due to the lack of support; my manager moved away and was communicating remotely once a week or so, my partner went on maternity leave and there was no replacement that was knowledgeable enough to keep from making extra work, much less helping with the work load, etc.  There was no ""typical day at work,"" which isn't so bad unless your boss demands perfection at a constantly variable position.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting the two bonuses I received during my four months there; the least being the constant verbal lashings and lack of praise I received from my area vice president over things as trivial as post-its.The ratings depend on the manager who oversees the Randstad office that the talent works with. As of today, I have an excellent manager.  She listens.  She is helpful.  She is attentive, makes sure we are treated fairly, makes effort to match us with departments that would be a ""good fit"" for both parties.  She keeps open communication and good relations between both the talent and the contractors.The manager before her was not good.  She was not on our side.  She would advocate for the contractor over her talent (employees).Its a good place to get into, just for experience. there is no advancement. A raise a very difficult to get in this company.I enjoy my job and like being on the move. My co-workers are great people and ive learned I can excel myself now that I have the experience!Just an overall poor performance for a staffing agency. I did all the leg work and there was little to no communication after I had the position. Not a place that I would stay.At first it was a good place but then everthing change they be came mean people so i just left. But i use to love it. They pack pills and make traysI love working for this agency. I've learned how to operate different medical systems for different states.The management team is very enthusiastic and outgoing and likes to communicate with their employees.My job was great I really enjoyed my co-workers and I learned a-lot about urethane mold making and pouring the job was very hot and was only as hard as you made itManagement should really learn to listen to the associates that are out on the floor.Co-workers are great.Hardest part of the job is the long hours however it does feel great when a team reaches one goal togetherI work with good people and the management did not no what they was doing we had to put up and take down the same thing 3 to 4 time everyday because the management did no what was going on the pay was not no goodRandstad is a very professional organization to work for.  I spent 16 years with the organization and was involved with multiple clients.  I enjoyed with the clients and the employees.  It can be a challenge to balance the needs of the client and the employees.  This challenge can be very rewarding.Helpful for job hunting. Not much contact other than hiring process and online portal. They come across as professional and well organized.We load and unload trucks. We load the material take it to where it needs to go then we unload the material. After we unload it we go back to warehouse to load more material.When there are assignments available they will get you to work. They can be rude at times when they are busy. They hire just about anybody which was a problem for me because I don't like to work in just any type of environment.I have no complaints about Randstad. They have assisted me with my job search many times and have always been successful. Good pay and good hours, as well as the opportunities.",,New-York,New York,NY,2016-12-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/f33ba3c4-af5e-461f-8274-70466d5223e1?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
