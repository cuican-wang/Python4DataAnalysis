143,2557.0,"Data Scientist/Sr. Data Scientist, Analytical Insights - Marketing Analytics",MarketShare,3.4,7.0,"It's a good place to work for the benefits as well as the perks (free food and regular catered breakfasts), but the pay's on the low-side with comparable positions at other companies. The biggest problem this place has is that it doesn't have a CTO directing the technology used across the board or giving an overall technology leadership across the organization.People tend to use siloed tools and those pushing for standardizing the tools don't tend to be in sync with the users they're pushing them on. There's a lot of communication problems across departments and every project is completely different from every other project. Many departments are under-staffed and overworked, and the company's always hiring, but it takes so long to onboard people to the disorganized process that it just winds up adding more work to the already overburdened departments.To make this worse documentation initiatives tend to fizzle or get deprioritized compared with project work, which is the reason why onboarding is so labor intensive. At the same time process improvement is expected to be performed while also working on projects, which is a serious problem when you don't even have time to finish project work. In other words, the process is so slow, that it inhibits having time to increase the efficiency of the process.The chief goal of the company owners is to sell the company, but they prioritize flashy names and branding rather than focusing on having a well-designed product. The engineering team is offsite (India) and often out of communication with the rest of the departments,  more... a lot of times bug reports are ignored or argued against and the relationship with the engineers feels hostile. A lot of processes that should be automated or done with tools purpose-built to handle them are done inefficiently, and the inertia of siloed users paired with the lack of coordinated adoption of effective tools renders every project a slow, grinding, manual process.This company has a lot of potential, but right now it's a quagmire and the longer people work here the more likely they are to seek other employment when they realize that fixing the problems requires a lot more work with respect to coordinating and motivating other people than just participating in the inefficient process.The food in the kitchen's nice, the HR staff are on top of their game, the events tend to be frequent and fun, and it's nice to have a pool/ping pong table as well as a number of other games available to play on breaks. It is nice to be able to work from home and have unlimited vacation, but often times people are so busy that these perks are rendered completely impossible.A lot of things about this place work well, but there's serious issues that need to be addressed or this place won't be able to scale or maintain momentum.  lessWork is pretty adhocNothing new to learnManagement is clueless about their jobco workers are not team playersHardest part is to find some good work. People work mostly on SAS, a stone age frameworkBeing a living sign for Marketshare Inc, has been a great source of supplimentary income.  I have been working for this company almost 3 years, and they are a great company. They pay well, and have a good open door policy (over the phone, of course).Because of the limited job advancment, I would have to overall rate this job, 4 stars...Its a nice place to work but job security is low. Training or Learning curve is bad. Hence Self-dependent  attitude can help.working out in all types of weather, holding a sign and waving to traffic.",,New-York,New York,NY,2016-09-15T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/adf24782-da15-496b-9d0d-b9cbc11f70da?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=26,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
144,2558.0,Data Scientist,Koch Nitrogen Company,3.7,36.0,"Not a bad place to work. There are a lot of smart people who work for Koch. Management was good. Would work for them again if I had the chance.Koch's core values are undeniably the right path for an employee base.  Integrity and compliance have always aligned with my common sense.  Market Based Management is also a mental model that is very natural to me, and provides an exceptional common vocabulary and mental model.  For the most part, there are a lot of great people and a lot of great managers at Koch Industries.  I cherished my time there.On the opportunities side, Koch Business Solutions unit needs an overhaul.  Their Applications Group is not competitive with external providers in cost, quality, nor competency, and their arrogance and cronyism are against MBM core principles.I worked with many talented people here, and generally the work was gratifying.  The Market Based philosophy was great as a way to run a business, however there were occasions where it did not seem to be applied consistently.Koch Industries was the best employer I ever worked for... The people and co-workers were nice enough. The management was good and the benefits were good. I learned a lot on this job because I was working with some knowledgeable contractors. Just a great company.Take care of long term employees, strong retirement benefits, entrepreneurial.  Work hard and you will be rewarded.  Follow the MBM if implemented in your department, really helps stretch your ability to be a team player.Koch Industries is a great place to work. They live out the guiding principals day by day. They are very professional and respectful and full of vision.I have loved working here for the better part of a decade, the company really knows how to take care of it's employees. If you are looking for stability I highly recommend this company.I worked at OSU during my time at school there. It is a great job because you get to study and be close to your teachers when you have any questions. I recommend.Professional environment with nice people to work with.  Sometimes fast paced, which I like.  Great hours 7:00 to 3:00.  Receiving invoices from vendors.Not a bad place to work just needs to full fill  promises made to people. I worked as a NH3 tech in the refrigeration department . My bosses were very good to me If it wasnt for the trouble maker on third shift I would still be there. Guy had allnight to install new water pump in the boiler i took it out on first shift and had it set to go back in well 16hrs later when i came back in it still wasnt installed, made me so mad i had to install it took me about an hour, just lazy tail people that had know clue of the work they claimed they knew.Koch Ind. was a wonderful place to work.  Huge company, broken into small companies run by wonderful management.  Positive daily feedback and stress free environment.During my temporary work at Koch industries I felt like I was part of the team and contributed to its success. It was a highly rewarding job. the co-workers were all very loyal, supportive and positive. The hardest part part of the job was to challenge myself daily and to always strive to be the best I can, and that is a great work ethic.Koch Industries utilize a management methodology called MBM.  In theroy this methodology fosters a healthy culture, however after working with two separate companies with in Koch industries I have found that the methodology is not practiced.  Upper management does not promote free thinking nor do they allow alignment with industry standards.6:00am tour facility. 7:30am review production results with staff covering all safety and quality concerns. Set goalls with team. 8:00am send out daily production email to president and vice president. 8:30am daily conference call with corporate. 9:00am safety walk through with an on shift hourly team member. 10:00am reviewed on hand raw materials.10:30am meet with the purchasing department to discuss materials. 11:00 am conference call with marketing team to discuss material sales and shipments.12:00pm meet with maintence team to discuss maintenance plan. 1:00pm avaliable to meet with vendors or outside personal. 1:00 pm to 3:00pm 1 to 1's with team members to cover growth oppportunities. 3:00pm conference call with corporate compliance team. 4:00pm conference call with Operations Manager to discuss days results. 5:00pm safety walk through with an on shift hourly team member.6:00pm review days acitivities.Great Culture to work at. Market Based Management. Value creation promoted. Ability to grow within the company is promoted and encouragedworked as a network and desktop support engineer for multiple companies within the Koch umbrella.Original manager was great, then got a new one when mine was promoted to a new role.  The new manager and I did not get along as I was not a suck up and just did my job.shortly after that change he hired two new engineers right out of college, had me train them both and then laid me off as both of them did the same job I did for less money as they were brand new and no experience.Since KS is a right to work state they can let you go without any reason, excuse or explanation.  Koch does this ALL the time.  They do not value their employee's or the experience they bring just the bottom line and where you fit in on that value.I currently work for KBS service desk.  I am very happy with my job, I love what I do, and the people that I work with are great.  Management at times seems lost though, and it almost seems to be a black hole working here.  I have been here for 1 year and still have not met the requirements that they have set to move forward in the company.Management at this company speak out of both sides of their mouth and they definitely don't know how to lead by example. They place strong emphasis on results and forget about caring for their employees. It is not a nurturing working environment.Management spend a lot of time behind closed door instead of out in the open to lead the team. Email and IM are closely monitored. You can forget about HR. They are there to protect the managers not you. Every thing you say will flow directly back to the managers.Watch for bait and switch.answered calls, re-mote to customer's PC's and fixed whatever issues they had. Every call is timed and some calls are screened and monitored for the scorecard. There were 27 different goals to meet with each call. Every day is a busy day. I learned a lot from working in the IT department.The company has grown tremendously, but it is not the easiest place to work.  So you get the stability, but will not see a level of compensation, management openness (despite the MBM culture), and mobility like in other companies.I learned abundantly oilfield skills. I greatly respected their Safety program; lectures on Hazmat. Gain experience on working with Hazmat resource.","10,000+",New-York,NEW YORK,NY,2016-09-15T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/8bc5371f-43eb-462f-ae89-66827b89d61d?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=27,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I am able to communicate with staff and very good customer service  and very helpfulOverall, it is usually, fun, challenging, pleasant and busy.  The management was very informational, the staff was a pleasure to work with and the company always provided employment with companies that I was able to learn from yet provided what was needed to the team.They offered good compensation for contract work and good benefits, but were of little assistance with finding a position when this contract was finished.I worked for them just over a month and from day one of my assignment everything was a mess! My original start date got delayed 2 days because of my cubicle and computer not being ready, and when I do finally start it still wasn't ready because of a ""mix-up"". I also had to meet with security to get an additional background check and drug test completed for the client I was working for and they didn't even have any idea that I was coming! Training was horrible and inconsistent and didn't even have any work to do for weeks when I started! Then finally I was let go with a few other people with no reason given at all! The only thing that was good was the hourly rate. I would never work for this company or their client again!Mitchell/Martin was a great contract company to work for!!  I had difficulty securing employment when I was moving to NYC.  MMI was recommended by an Occupational Therapist who had positive experiences with them.  MMI placed me at a great hospital in the Bronx with a full time position that started as soon as I moved.  In addition, my contact at MMI was always quick to respond to questions and I always got paid on time!!The best Health Recruiting Company in New YorkI learn good experience to work many different nationality!My co-workers like me and we like to work together without any gapsA typical day at work would be checking patients in & out of the health center via EMR, Performing 20-80 phlebotomy procedures.By working with MItchell Martin I learned that patience is in fact a virtue when dealing / working with others. Management in my opinion from a scale of 1-10(10 being the highest) will be a 7, As far as my co-workers I would have to give them a 5. I honestly can not pin point a ""hard part"" of the job I would say that every part of the job was just a learning experience. The most enjoyable part of the job for me would have to be actually working with the patients hands on I really enjoyed that part. Overall I would consider MItchell Martin to be a well organized & productive environment!Good place to work.Friendly people.    a typical day at work    what you learned    management    your co-workers    the hardest part of the job    the most enjoyable part of the jobI like working with therm .. they have upscale clients ,and the keeps me busy. the pay on time, good communications. their pay rate is average.Unprofessional people. I was told about the placement and resigned from my job. I have submitted all the requirements and forms needed, even the physical exam that I have to shoulder. Suddenly, they became so quiet and didn't bother to follow up on what's going on. Until such time that I didn't hear from them completely.MMI is making the attempt at starting a new office in Dallas. There is a lot of opportunity with the organization as they are an up an coming IT staffing firm. There is a lot of growing pains that are going to come with this process. I have nothing bad to say about the organization. I feel that I would be better suited in a different environment.Formatted resumes for recruiters. Entered jobs into inhouse database. Prepared contracts for new consultants. Handled all paperwork for background checks and drug testing. In charge of all new hire packages.good place for new grad to add to their resume, friendly reliable recruiters....great work experience, everyone is well organized and effective in their task. dealing with people from all ethnic background all with one common goal patient care that is effective and within your scope.Like working for this company its really nice  been to different locations and I honestly love working with themthe delay of ICD-10 has resulted in the client not having enough work for me.Friendly and supportive staff, driven to help their clients. Fantastic work environment if you live in the NYC metro area. Their branches are not as reliable.A typical day at work consist of project meetings sponsor updates on high profile projects.Over all good relationship. 8:30-5:30 pm weekdays.
