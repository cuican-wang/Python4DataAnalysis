174,2588.0,Mid-level Data Scientist,Bachrach,3.9,14.0,"Great Clothing at great prices, Custom Suit program from 2008 to 2009 was amazing. Great shoe selection.Employ of mixture of some experienced Sales team to brand new kids.Too much pressure to follow corporate sales pitches which vs Very experienced qualified Sales techniques.Unlike most corporate recruiting agencies, The Bachrach Group is about growing and succeeding as a family.  Everyone comes in with a great opportunity to make money for themselves without being micro-managed in regards to call numbers and metrics.  The upper management will go to bat for any and all employees and they are truly a great company to work for in this field. If you do well you will be rewarded and promoted as the company continues to expand on their nationwide reach. I would recommend TBG 10 out of 10 times to anyone interested in a staffing and recruiting career.This is more of a calm cool and collected work environment. Meeting monthly goals or even weekly goals can be a struggle but when you work with a team who loves to help one another grow and sell, not only does it make work easier but a lot more enjoyable.I worked at BachRach over the summer and it is by far one of my favorite jobs I've ever had. The management was friendly and easy to get along with, and they were extremely flexible when it came to the hours. They train you fluently and prepare you to work with customers, they patiently work with you in any areas you may need help in, and although the job is designed to be competitive, they do not, in any way treat the job like a competition. The hardest part of the job is developing your own technique of making sales, because making sales is an important part of the job. The most enjoyable part is establishing your own list of regular customers.Bachrach was a steeping stone to having good customer service skills. I learned how to treat customers with the right balance of attention and direction. Management was a great plus. I worked with employees who had been there since I was born. Their experience and wit taught me a lot. Co-workers were easy to get along with because we helped each other out. The hardest part of the job was also the most enjoyable part of the job. That was maintaining a client database. Working at improving my skills and following up with clients gave me the experience to run my own business (music producing).Everyone was so nice and lovable. Very helpful and reliable . When i needed help they was there .A typical day included sales, client tracking, visuals, and to oversee tailor shop.met people from all over the world, tour guide was a fun job .. The experience took me afar..A typical day at work in Bachrach included organizing the store to make sure merchandise was neatly displayed, helping customers find what they were looking for, offer customer suggestions, process customer transactions and returns and providing excellent customer service.  The manager kept the store environment very relaxed and let the staff know the importance of making the customer feel welcomed and respected.  This was my first job in retail and I definitely learned how to speak to customers in a personable, effective way and how to sell merchandise.  The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the satisfied face of a customer after dealing with them and knowing that I did my job well.Good work place but poor management and job security. Company not sure of proper direction and attempts at success.My experience was that the store was very slow and on commission its hard to make a good living. The draw was almost never met. The products sold were of good quality and the co workers made it fun at times. The management was not very good at keeping control of the store and driving business. The fun part was customer interaction and being in the mall. The cons are low pay and benefits, long hours at times, not much flexibility with having to work holidays.There was really a lack of leadership. The store manager that hired me quit a week later. There was no structure. People in cluding managers would leave the store for an extended period of time. There was no sense of job security. Even if 2 people would come in the store for an entire 8 hour shift you were still responsible for selling. I felt like the volume that was done in the store I was in did not merit such a high quota. There was not a fair structure to evenly distribure sales. It was every man for himself, which led to infighting. I loved servicing the customers. That was my favorite part. For me however, Bachrach was not a good fit.Nice place to work when retail quotas are met. Reason that I stopped working there is because of store closing prospect.Upscale mens clothinjg store with quality clothing. Small staff, located in a good mall.",,New-York,Brooklyn,NY,2016-02-24T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/efc2b6e8-a48c-47ea-adcb-9c539f98ff29?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=22,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
