I was a packer so i would go to the packing station area, there items would come down the belt to be packaged, labeled and put on a different belt to be shipped out for customers. Some orders would be very tedious but patience is the key. Everyone would have one break depending on how many hours we were working that day. Most days we would get done work late but that was always a good thing. At the end of the day we would clean up our areas, and wait for the Ok to go home.

Great team atmosphere and partnership across functions and businessesGood Place To Work.... good balance of work life..good mobility. management is ok but the culture is not great. Co-workers are ok, but the culture itself is very cut-throaty and backstabbish. I would not recoommend to any friends or family.When I interviewed for the job I was guaranteed advancement opportunities.  After being on the job 2 weeks,  I was told that no growth in jobs are coming to Henderson.  Leads and Heads talks down to employees.  A lot of contradiction and favoritism.A typical day involved dealing with requests and technical questions from clients and other internal departments. The fast paced nature of the job was thoroughly enjoyable, and I found that staff members always aided each other if additional assistance was required. Management were keen to train staff up on as many skills as possible, and provided intensive training every few months. This enabled us to grow in our knowledge, which in turn allowed for promotions.Solid learning environment in a fast-paced, dynamic culture. Opportunity for growth if supported by management. Benefits are top of the industry.my day starts around 7:30 and the first part is reconciling our overnight exceptions.  The fed opens at 8:30 and our day to day activity start immediately.  Volume is high, so we are busy throughout the day.As a manager I learn how to deal with many different personalities and how to motivate my team members. the hardest part of the job is ensuring Client assets are protected at all times. I enjoy resolving challenging issues. Management was good, but their plans were not always thought out for the long term correctly.  When long term goals were set, they seem to start the process without a detail planExcellent teams. Mornings were usually meetings with London and Singapore teams. Afternoon and early evenings were development time. Working on the trading floor afforded me many interactions with different traders, risk managers, financial controls. Learned Java, perfected C++ and a lot of credit derivative knowledge. The hardest part of the job was managing global teams, many late night calls. The most enjoyable part of the job were that the traders gave me the time to interact and communicate. I saved the firm $1.6 million over a couple of coffee machine stops.I WAS AWARDED AS BEST PROJECT MANAGER FOR THE    YEAR UNDER REVIEW ;Leading the collections team to achieve 90 to 97% collections rate (a first time achievement of BACLAYS BANK (Ghana) Plc.I introduced the cheque form of collections at the branch which gives the company 70% collections.Bringing on board and championing the mobile money wallet for cash collections which has aided collections from the beginning of the year to date.I also initiated the bulk cheques collections on behalf of the bank (company management)Very bad experience while working at Barclays Too many politics. Management is really terrible only promoted their friends hire their relatives. I'm sorry to say this but Barclays was considered a good company to work forgreat place to work Aside from the job scope itself, one factor that significantly influences how employees feel about work is the environment. By work environment, I mean everything that forms part of employees’ involvement with the work itself, such as the relationship with co-workers and supervisors, organizational culture, room for personal development, etc.A positive work environment makes employees feel good about coming to work, and this provides the motivation to sustain them throughout the day.You are required to get to work 10 minutes early to sign on before your (paid) start time which equates to about 50 unpaid hours per year.  How they continue to abuse this is beyond me.  If you are late you get written up and so forth until you are boxed up and herded out the front door. It is a one-way relationship, not your way.  Pay is based on great-recession job surveys so they pay as little as possible and a full classification below the sister site in Delaware.  It is an obstacle course to get a raise or a promotion, with rules and requirements changed at will.  The monthly meetings where the promotions are announced are just a sad display of how the game is rigged.  Managers hold all the power and play favorites, have snitches mingle into break time and off-the-record conversations to report back on what and who.  Quality Call scores are one of the determining factors as to if you earn a bonus (yes-they have bonuses) this score is rigged by what calls they grade. The fact is that calls are 'selected' so as to produce the desired result.  they do have benefits which you pay for but it beats Obamacare.  Everyone is treated the same, however poorly I may think that to be.  in spite of the poor morale, most of us enjoy working with each other, so misery does love company.  For those 20 -23 this is a first job you will not soon forget, especially after you have worked for a real people's company later in your career.Good company overall. Decent compensation, but could be better. Good place for early career individuals. Would not recommend staying too long unless there are opportunities for growth.When I left Credit Suisse to join Barclays in 2007, it was a unique opportunity to be integral to the buildout of Barclays' West Coast leveraged finance business.  My former boss at Credit Suisse and I recruited a talented team of junior bankers to join in building out an entrepreneurial platform within the context of a major global financial institution.Barclays was my first professional job at his school, as far as development is concerned. To be frank they are going to be a tough act to follow. My peers and managers treated us all the same and every problem that we came a crossed we solved as a group. As far as the work environment, it wasn't fantastic. There were numerous recreational areas and there was also a full cafeteria so people could eat without having to leave the office. I was very sad to leave at office, and to hear of them shutting the site down. Very much looking forward to new opportunities, especially considering that I am much more experienced now and I feel like I can contribute tons more at my new team.typical day at work is often communication heavy, high paced with a lot of people.I often learn from veterans of the work place management is kind, understanding and gives work initiativesmost my co- workers are nice with your occasional grumpy people hardest part of the job would have to be managing your breaks, and warding off people who do not belong in certain placesmost enjoyable part of the job is seeing people smile and enjoying their time spent.Highly productive environment with hard working and dedicated employees. There is opportunity for growth and movement within the organization. Net working and shadowing with colleagues enables you to apply for internal position with mobility tool.Wonderful place to workGreat work environmentEncourages professional learning Cutting edge in their job spaceColleagues and management are enjoyable to work withMy area is Build /release/deployment engineering, and configuration management. I have a broad understanding of software development methodologies; with a focus on industry standards based process design, and automation. I have extensive experience interfacing with development, test, and operations teams with the common goal of producing high quality software in a timely fashion.Good for work life balance.

Employees are treated like an expendable number and if asked without the fear of being fired would agree and then some. The company manages with fear of getting fired.  The health care benefits are TERRIBLE!!!! They lay off people, departments and whole facilities without hesitation nor advance notice.  You have a job today but you will have no idea if you have one next month.Challenge-Find a First Data employee who is not looking for another job. Impossible!!!This place is for people who are workaholics. This place thinks work is more important than family. Working both days on a weekend is a negative when it comes to family. Working five days a week is good and working an extra day should be voluntary. The zipsort department thinks that employees have to work 6 days a week all the time. They don""t ask if employees to work the 6 days a week.Don't take a job at this company. They are constantly transitioning jobs oversees so there is no stability. Director level and above management is completely out of touch with how to create a good culture. The turnover is insane which speaks to the lack of culture and overall issues with the company. The systems are antiquated and there is no desire to fix it. Management's answer is to not fix the systems and to even place tighter deadlines that results in longer hours, and by longer I mean past midnight. Honestly, worse job I have ever had.The job was rewarding to me because at the end of each day I either was apart of a team resolution or I researched and resolved issues.Learned that my way may not always be the best way to handle a task. I always conferences with the agent that perform.the task daily My job was always challenging because each day there are different issues which gave me the opportunity to be involved with many different divisions of finance, credit, and legal areas. I looked forward to my challenges each and everyday because that was my enjoyment. The hardest part of my job was leaving unresolved issues at the end of the dayextremely high turnover of employees. First Data set very high quality requirements of the employees increasing the stress on the employees with no consideration to the amount of changes to job description on a daily forum.They flood the market through multiple avenues. Selling against your own company at every turn. Then they give you no support. Lost 10-20 deals on circumstances where they never even replied to me. If you are a hunter and can learn quickly to become self sufficient, you will have a chance of being successful.Normal as usual routine clock in briefing from supervisor and manager. I learned many things about management for instance  important of human resources in providing tools for  jobs from machineries to manpower and also managing devorsified environment.  I will say that the management in my department is poor for some reasons first unfair rise which led to many leaved and difficult to bring in new employees.My co-workers are such are good people. I like to be around them.Hardest part  of job when we have  5 million pieces of mail to go out at any day that have high volume and we short of staff as now a days. Meeting my co-workers make some jokes.My time at First Data was short lived as my department was moved to Omaha, Nebraska.A days work consisted of reviewing accounts for potential fraud to make sure a persons debit card was not being compromised.My coworkers were a good team.The hardest part of the job was not being able to satisfy every customer and the most enjoyable part of the job was when someone did say thanks and appreciated you for looking out for them.I really love this Job! They work with you on just about any challenge you come in contact with as long as you are performing your job duties. You are recognized for your hard work, overtime, and overall a wonderful company to work for. They work with your school schedule, tuition reimbursement, Ample advancement opportunities.

The most enjoyable part of my job is my teammates, opportunities to solve problems and drive change.  FDC has a ton of process improvement opportunities and management is making investments to make it better.The pay rate is not competed to other companies. The weekly working hours of associated is fluctuated and going down to  day by day. There is not an opportunity to grow up career path in learning new things , jobs cross-training, to higher position and professional careers.A typical day at work is very productive, there is always something to do...if not technical than administrative.  The environment is team cultivated.  The hardest part of the job is the fact there is no formal training and because the position is so demanding you have to really engage yourself in learning the processes quickly and efficiently. It is a very challenging position.Numbers driven corporate culture that preaches ""Genuine Concern"" for the client but will fire employees who do not hit their quotas regardless of leads generated from primary lead source.  Merchant market is saturated with competition.  Referral partner makes all the difference.  Decent salary, short sighted management, insufficient training, high turnover.Working with multiple banks all over inland empire. Following up and managing staff leads and progress in sales stage. Daily engagement with business owners and their staff to earn business and present business solutions. Closely work with management and staff to acquire business and cross sell more banking products. Being busy is always great, whether it's working on daily reporting or always being in communication with staff and clients.When I worked for First Data it was a great place to work. The benefits were very generous, stock purchase plan, good 401 k plan. The building in Marlborough was State of the art 10 years ago. A lot of the jobs are dependent on contracts with other companies.Days were never dull here, most people were loads of fun to work with, work was interesting enough to keep the job from being boring. management was awesome, my coworkers were fun, the managements did things from time to time to make the days fun and to motivate us all, the hardest part of the job was some of the deadlines that we had to meet to get come claims out. the most enjoyable was just the whole experience of the job.A very short time frame to complete quality work, if work flow is behind we only have a 4 hr window to  complete all work including work that is behind schedule time.The back up flow of work that comes from the day shift due to unseen delays by the system. Hard to maintain the quality of work the company so desires to produce. Very self rewarding at the end of the day with work all completed on time with no mistakes. Management has little knowledge of what it takes to complete all work including work delayed due to unseen delays. I get along with all my co-workers and help where ever I am needed.A typical day at work would be to get 25 fraud cases completed in 1 hour as possible. I enjoyed what my position was but do not make any mistakes. The management frowned dearly on those. You was always documented all of your mistakes. It would have been so much better to learn from them, they never corrected or showed you how to fix mistakes. I enjoyed my co-workers. My Manager never came out of the office.In business for over 35 years and well established in the Credit Card Processing Industry!  The had offices throughout the US and offered relocation packages to all employees.  I was able to travel the Eastern US at least 3 times monthly and able to establish relationships with a lot of well known organizationsI enjoyed working at First Data.

Within Ops, there are plenty of opportunities for advancement/role change, and the pay is good compared to similar roles at other firms.Be it management, leadership development, sales, recruiting, negotiation, training and/or providing an incredible client experience, I am driven to succeed. Whether I am working by myself, with others, or leading a group of people, I am highly motivated to complete every challenge with excellence. Professional, yet personable, I have a strong reputation for being a dynamic leader with the ability to influence teams, colleagues and entire enterprises to succeed and achieve high levels of performance. I am a motivator, encourager, moral builder, success driver through my personal approach of Servant Leadership to the people I support.I liked my job as loan specialist working with titles daily. Learned a lot about the Auto Finance Industry that I didn't know prior. No micro-management will you work, able to listen to music, fun and family atmosphere celebrating all occasions, flexible family life. Able to earn funds toward your MRA account for medical expenses. Enjoyed that occasionally we received breakfast and lunch served an employee appreciation and many more Perks!A typical day at work for me is interacting with my team of 18 specialists. I coach on call opportunities, after listening to live calls. Review performance metrics and discuss opportunities for improvement. I am available to assist with escalated calls from clients. I approve payroll and enter information in employee personnel files. I review emails to determine information to pass down to my specialists so that they are always in the know.Very stressful environment.  The customers don't stress you out; the management does.  You get monitored on every call and if you don't use the right phrase, you get a policy and procedure error.  One error gets you a performance improvement plan.  Two errors gets you a written warning,  Three errors in a 2 month period and you're out.  It would be easy to avoid if they didn't keep changing policy consistently.  And there's no easy way to look up policy.  They don't have it in a nice neat little book that you can reference.  It's every where on the intranet and connected to several links.  If you don't memorize it, you're out.  Good luck.  Everyone is always on a PIP!Started great but moved to the numbers game of 12 minute resolution times and extreme micromanaging.You were questioned why you were not on call if 1 minute has passed between calls. Bathroom breaks were refused until the managers decided it was ok and then gripes if it lasted over 10 minutes. Much hidden politics and cut-throat environment where unless your work can directly benefit a higher-up, you were just a replaceable.i dont want to rant about a company but i will say this ! i will never advise anyone to work for this company. Under paid and over worked. Also no appreciation of your hard work . I was a bank teller with many many rolls.  I did the work of a full time employee  but would never get full time pay. My manager was very very fake ! She lied to me on countless occasions . I really hated working here and i think that is job is only good for a temporary moment (2 months) and thats it.Hands down most horrible job I've ever had.  Kiss the work life balance goodbye.  You will work way more than 40 hours and you will work 6 days a week.  There are always a few nice customers, but depending on if you are in a bad part of town, most customers are awful.  I got screamed at, spit on, had stuff thrown at me, and called every name in the book.  It is personally your fault when their account is overdrawn and they can't qualify for a loan.  The pressure that upper management places on the employees to ""provide a great customer experience"" is ridiculous.  Customers know they can walk all over you and there is nothing anyone will do about it. The ability to prioritize and make on-the-spot decisions regarding customer transactions, weighing customer satisfaction issues with bank exposure to loss or fraud.  Excellent customer service skills and mathematical skills  In-depth knowledge of all bank deposit products and policies Ability to work in a fast-paced environment  Ability to work well under pressure  High degree of accuracy  Strong communication skillsMy typical work day consist of focuses on Chase internal relationships with individual people – whether those are customers, service users, colleagues or suppliers, different lines of business while sorted and filed loan documentation for multiple Chase business departments. Monitored workflow, including dates of work received, incoming types and relative volumes of work.Followed departmental procedures necessary to intake, decision and process customer inquiries. .I have grown a lot in Chase and I love this company. I have worked my way up to being the best banker in my district 2 years in a row and a top 100 banker in all of chase, 2 years running. However the bank is making cuts and they have chased away all walk in business with new eatms. My job recently has become a have cold calling job.•	Responsible for the administration and daily operation of the bank.•	Mainly responsible for assisting the branch manager and providing reports and statements of the daily work to the manager.•	Maintained good relationship with the staff and clients.•	Helped in preparing annual budget and strategies for meeting the goals and objectives.•	Responsible for solving all the queries and problems of the staff and clients.•	Prepared loan titles for closing process (purchase and refinance) under various loan programs in accordance with policies and procedures. •	Reviewed loan file with loan origination system to ensure data accuracy.  Prepared loan closing document package including closing instructions and dual wiring of funds request. •	. Prepared loan for wire funding. Submitted closed loan file for shipment to National Post Closing.•	Trained and coached all new hires. Managed non preforming employees with weekly performance managementWorking in marketing was amazing and I enjoyed most of it.  My position was stressful because I was trained for 2 weeks and then my support went out on maternity leave.  In her absence I was doing the job of 4 people and doing it really well.  I had great support from the other departments.  There was one hiccup that the copy editor was not good and only got worse after being promoted.  Ultimately she went on a power trip and Chase merged with Bank One.  Right after that our department was downsized and she was laid off.  Eventually we were all let go.Working for JPMorgan and Chase was an eye opening experience. During my time there I realized how society viewed banks. While working there, often times Occupy Atlanta came by to protest during the end of our shift leaving us hostage in the bank until enforcers came to break it up. This was during the time families were losing there houses to Chase because of mortgages not being paid. It was definitely a learning experience but I still found ways to enjoy the job by making connections with my daily customers.Banks are all pretty much the same.  I don't really have anything good or bad to say.  You are either interested in working at a bank or you are not.  You learn the rules of the game or you will lose. Politics are everywhere.  The difference with Chase is this - they get what they want and will pay you for it.  Don't be afraid to ask for an out of range salary.  You may be surprised depending on the line of business. Otherwise a bank is a bank is a bank.Dealing with inbound technical calls, billing statement inquires, deposit information, general account inquiries.Couldn't ask to have met better people in the time I was there.Management wasn't the greatest. There was a lot of favoritism and unfairness.The hardest part of the job was dealing with the occasional irate customer.The most enjoyable part was the gratitude of the merchants when getting their needs / issues resolved.very busy typical daylearned a lot of legal terms, to be independent, multi tasking and how to deal with the attorneys and how to manage timevery knowledgeable and understanding managementresponsible and very efficient co-workersto download documents because it was a repetitive task using copy and paste with hundreds and hundreds of documents or more for each loanflexible time of work, going to have fun with the whole department like having a group trip to the movies, watching dodger games and have fun bowling as an incentive of the company to the employees and the free good food.Overall the benefits and pay are in line with company standards.The culture is very competitive. It's a great place to challenge one self and develop strong leadership skills. If you are proactive there are tons of groups and company supported community events that you can become involved with. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping clients reach their goals and helping employees grow.DEVOPS Lead role was challenging as I had to analyse all manual work and come up with a scope for automation. Define automation roadmap to team. We as a team had spent many hours in fixing things right for Development and Testing team. work used to be interesting and challenging. We also used to have fun at work. We had a very supportive manager who gave us complete freedom to explore automation options and gave design liberty. He used to review and understand the process better and was a good mentorManagement is supportive and provides allows staff to work in an environment in which is positive and allows for growth.Work from home employee for 4 years work independently meeting requirements and deadlines.Organizational changes happening so often do present challenges in processes at times.Making new relationships with other parts of the organization when working new projects and learning new skill sets when processes change are always an exciting part of the job.","10,000+",New-York,New York,NY,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/1a455926-8770-4a9c-8c3a-4d1dc2aaccb3?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
84,2498.0,Data Scientist - US Customer Data Science,American Express,4.2,3200.0,"Amex was a growth opportunity in my career change from insurance to travel industry.  I enjoy working with the cardmembers the most.  I disagree about the management use of survey systems but I realize that is a part of the customer service world.The company changes and reacts often.  Jobs have recently been outsourced to Philippines and India. Amex does what makes Amex money. They do not care if you see your family. They monitor bathroom breaks.  There is no freedomAmerican Express is a great place to get your foot in the door if you're interested in banking. It's fast paced which means things are always changing and you end up learning something new almost everyday.AmEx is a great place to work at. You get tons and tons of project management experience and the company loves to think outside the box.lots of consultants hired and cycled through - most of the foreign.Very large environment. Lots of bureaucracy could have been a much simpler environment.Must be very technical to survive. very long commute from where I live.Best company I've worked for to date. Great group of people, awesome environment, state of the art technology and plenty of activities to break up the daily race stress.Great place to work, unfortunately the contractor with them that I worked for lost the contract.  People that I worked with were very professional and of good character.American Express is a great place to work.  The finance division is now Ameriprise.  I can only hope that it is still the same great company.-On site food market, great lunches!-Learned the importance of professionalism -Managers are there to work by your sideGreat company to work for both as an employee and contractor.   Always new opportunities to expand knowledge of technical and business skills.   I enjoyed the people that I worked with on a daily basis.I held a variety of jobs working for this company which was great. I was able to learn and grow everyday. The clients were nice and I enjoyed the office team. I was very proud of my office team. We made our deadlines and help advisors all over the market group. I initially set up how we would do our technology and marketing areas. We did well and other market groups were interested in how it was done. Then, our home office wanted to streamline the marketing and took back the distribution and allocation process. This made it very difficult for us to obtain the numbers we were getting. My hands were tied by home office and I could not find a work around to please the Group Vice President. However, in dealing with this process, I was able to get back $11,000+ back to the market groups budget.I worked here for several years and there just didn't seem to be much room for advancement. Many times they hired from outside of the company instead of promoting internal employees.I loved working in American Express. They always take care of the employee needs.I worked in American Express for 27 yrs and I got nothing to critized.American Express pretty much left me in the dark most of the time. Very little communication about the job or who exactly cares. Most communication was via a team member whom I did not really answer to. They seemed quite disorganized cared little about my skillset or utilization of them. I often had no idea if my job was going to be dissolved due to transitions even though I was praised and had high marks as a top performer. Often 'other' teams handled issues with very little explanation as to why. Such teams may or may not respond to any communication attempts possibly passing the buck when contacted. Processes for handling specific 'areas' were typically inept at best and appeared frequently mishandled. They seemed very 'low-tech' which was the opposite of what my impression was before working for them.Amex has an environment that allows for employees to cultivate themselves and the company. The work life balance has been key.Great organization. They really have the work at home segment nailed down. Training could use a bit more consistency and more mentoring time would be beneficial. Especially in the live-call listening. Overall the experience and culture is inclusive. One does not feel like a number in this vastly huge company.Great place to work following a structured environment.  The company believed in their mission and vision and give their employees hope for advancement and security.Loved working at American Express. One of the best companies I worked for. Great environment, team and reachable managers. Intellectually stimulating work.Amex encourages employees to try new positions, challenge themselves, and broaden their horizons. It is a great and fun place to work and the people are awesome.They pay well, have fair benefits, good work life balance and attempt to create a positive culture. However, they are behind the times in product growth and frequently make bad decisions that effect the entire company. Every year, if not twice a year people wait with baited breathe to see if they will be one of the people getting axed in the current ""reorganizing"" round. The last round consisted of 10% of the entire company. Very shaky and unstable. You constantly feel insecure.as in any large company, there is a lot of politics and power play involved.  Working for a strong brand with very smart people is always a thrill.  great work life balance and love that they bring in speakers from different industries.","10,000+",New-York,New York,NY,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/1a249014-2bc5-454c-9036-74cd97661530?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
85,2499.0,Marketing Data Scientist,"MetLife, Inc.",3.9,2100.0,"I have had a great experience with MetLife. All the people I work with are intelligent and fun to be around. The job has ebbs and flows, people are always willing to train. There's a lot to learn and management is very encouraging.CBS Corporation is a mass media company that creates and distributes industry-leading content across a variety of platforms to audiences around the world. The Company has businesses with origins that date back to the dawn of the broadcasting age as well as new ventures that operate on the leading edge of media. The project is about creating ETL processes to populate summary data structures and development of stored procedure queries to investigate data issues or to create new reports structures for business units.Working independently and with team to monitor timely and proper reviews of all 50 state regulatory and financial quality standards through adherence to policies and protocols.Communicate effectively to management team, associates and other claims units; sharing best practices; support initiatives to ensure expected outcomes.Difficulties involved signing into many different systems to accurately review the entire claim handling process.I enjoyed traveling with my team to several claims offices to deliver results and receive feedback on our observations.A typical day consisted of completing adherence and compliance and other metrics concerning my team. I answered questions and handled escalated calls. I learned from my immediate supervisors how to maintain a work and at home balance. I learned from my co workers that it is ok to have some kind of fun in the workplace instead of it always being a serious workplace. The hardest part of my job was talking to people that just received the news that there illness was terminal. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I changed the work atmosphere for the better.Not a great place to work. Company seems to be going through many changes. There is excessive work, bad software and tedious processes... not a good combination.  They will work you like a slave picking cotton.  The company is sacrificing their employees with too many cuts. This is the only place that I know of that hires so many temps and they stay hoping to get a full time position.  Very deceitful, immature and messy management.  They are threaten by real professionals. Over aggressive men.They replaced all of the worker bees and kept all the Chiefs who play Machiavellian politics. The company is in serious financial turmoil due to its high expenses compared to its peers and low profits. It is difficult to drive change and get things done in this highly political environment that is more focused on manipulation, perception and self interest vs. getting the work done and doing what is best for the company. The GTO leadership is out of touch with what is going on as none of them physically work in Cary NC. However, they require all of their minions to physically go in the office each day.I liked the job, I just wished it would've last longer. I wanted a permanent position but I was led to believe there were none available and found out later that there were. I was contacted for an interview and a couple days later was told the position had been filled. I thought that was a bit unprofessional to mislead me into thinking the position was available and contact me for an interview and then cancel the interview.Was brought in as a temp to enroll Washington State employees; Letter that was sent to customers had wrong information.  Customer was told that they will have a smooth transition and keep the same coverage, which was true but they were not told that the monthly cost would change.  I asked for help with issue multiple times and management seem like they did not want to helpThe culture and technology stack were both in disarray.It's not possible to review the current state of Metlife since things have changed dramatically since I left. Staff have been removed, the operations center relocated and many functions outsourced.During my tenure, there wasn't a clear direction leaving technical staff with the task of discerning what needed to be done.The company overall is very friendly, and the environment is very welcoming and relaxed. The open space allows for visibility of all employees and creates a sense of family and partnership. They also have many company events which allow for individuals to to take a break, share experiences and network.They gave excellent training in both insurance and financial services Good compensation and recognizable name made sales much easier.  Time with family, as single parent, not what I wanted it to be and when I remarried wanted to go back to retailing.5 stars I would definitely recommend Met Life as well as Mercy hospital to a friend or family member looking for employment or a good career choiceI loved working at Metlife. The compensation was just ok. I was working in an entry level position and just felt like I needed to be more challenged. The environment was very relaxed, almost too relaxed. Sometimes I felt that the dress code was too relaxed. Sometimes you felt like you couldn't tell the difference between someone on the street, or someone who worked there.Lots of work to do great oppurtunity for growth in other areas of investments. The people are great lots of fun activities and great oppurtunity to volunteer in the community.Work from 730-430 with an hour lunch, small office and all co-workers work great together.  Casual work environment and flexibility to be able to work from home if needed.  My position requires multi-tasking everyday.  I am in charge of making sure that office supplies are ordered as well as office technology is working including computers, fax machines, printers, ect.  I also work directly with our Sales people in making sure deadlines are met to get Ancillary proposals out to customers as well as prospects.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the relationship that we have in the office.  Everyone really works as a team.  The hardest part of my job is during peak season when RFPs are coming in like crazy and making sure that I due dates on my calendar for me to meet.Paid less than promised, great people in a new building. Blind corruption by upper management. A good place if you are Not White, under 40  and have a sheepish personality. Your helping to offload work to offshore and excessive Vendor costs. Requests for technical training ignored. Great diversity . Give, give and live a short life on this happy campus. Work hard so you are replaced as soon as possible. There is no HR service, mentoring or conflict resolution. Read these reviews, many agree the MetLife workers strive in a leadership dead zone. Smile and remind yourself that the mantra is: Me, Me, Me, what is here for Me today ?Childish, irresponsible management.  The whole environment is a popularity contest.  Treats people like criminals when you have completed your duties and your temporary position has run it's course.  Only positive is that they allowed as much overtime as you could possibly manage.MetLife definitely deserves the high rankings from big name diversity groups. The culture is very inclusive and that makes it easier to do your job. The only bad thing is very little paths for advancement.Worked there for many years, but recent changes are making adverse effects to the business. Managers are hit or miss. There are more bad managers than good managers. Working from home is difficult because managers do not receive any training or guidance on how to manage people who work from home.I began my work at Met Life working as a part time employee while attending college. Once I graduated from college I was offered a position working in their computer department. I worked at Met Life for twenty nine years and ascended to a supervisory postion. I truly enjoyed my time here.Upper level management can be demanding. Met Life just sold all retail operations this year - so things may be completely different now.Wonderful support staff - convenient offices and lots of perks.

Also the region has been overlooked at the corporate level and left in the hands of people who lack relevant experience.Its a good job, I have fun at the job. What you get paid when you start your job is pretty much what you're going to get. Don't expect good raises or promotionsGroundwater & Environmental Services, Inc. has no identity of itself.

Co-workers are nice people.  Typical day can range from 8-5 to 6-6.  Office hours and field hours range.Laid off after less than 1 year of service due to lack of work... made me wonder why I was hired in the first place.  Too much micro-management, too many managers.  Company feeds off oil companiesMundane and monotonous routine. Management was not interested in training junior employees. Excessive travel for below average compensation was the norm. Mass hiring and subsequent layoffs were commonplace. There was an extremely high turnover rate amongst employees that weren't laid off. Morale was extremely low during the entirety of my tenure with the company. Not a conducive environment for a burgeoning career as a scientist.When I was with GES, there was a very low company morale, and a very high turnover rate of 37%. The salary was low, in comparison to similar positions with other firms. Most people left after one or two years. Additionally, senior management would cater excessively to client demands, and did not hesitate to make personnel changes upon their demands.

Had to learn on my own, very little training.  Did not enjoy my experience there.The workplace was such that once one is ready to gain knowledge in that field, there was no limitation to progress. This made me enjoy working there.Great day. The environment is very work friendly.  Love seeing and meeting new customers. Hardest part is organization.It is a good place to work but the pay is not good and the management.. if they start to pay employe more than u will see better result and also mangers need to be more trainedwould have loved to continue my work with this company but unfortunately my schedule had too much of a impact at the time. job always kept you on your toes, never did the same thing ever day. would recommend this job to the right people any day!They lay off people every other year. Finally they moved most the work to China. That just goes to show how cheap of a company they are. If they want to pay Chinese $.5/hr of work, what do you think they will think of your wages?Not a secure job place to work at.Great company to work for!! Been there for over two years and have had no major issues. Great job work life balance, compensation, and job security.  The management and job culture is pretty good as well.Work/ life balance is good, the company is diverse and my manager is great! The overall company is good. They are not robots, which is something I can appreciate.Very Productive in all aspects, paper work, management meetings, setting up events with local or big time celebrities. (yo gotti,fetty wap, cast of the empire, ect.)Learned to multitask & meet deadlines,learned a lot about the men fashion industry (urban wear) (brands I associated with Rockstar, True Religion, PRPS, Robin Jean, Bally, Louis Leeman, MCM, ect.Co-workers were amazing, uplifting high spirited, fashion iconist. Would love to work again with such amazing people.The hardest part of the job was meeting deadlines for a total of 46 stores, as far as getting advertisement done, buying merchandise for each individual store. Traveling to each region was starting to take a toll on me but I managed it & did what I was told.The most enjoyable part of my job was, traveling to different states for big time trade show. Working with great people, seeing celebrities. Highlight was picking out the wear everyone enjoyed the most. I'm glad I was apart of this company.I worked in Radiology.  The management at this hospital is excessive.  I would say that they need to cut the fat at the top.  Too much duplicity in the management arena.I like the the great opportunity to make changes if that was for improvement.great schedule to work.In summer time was low that give as opportunity to be with the family and enjoy the summer.I learn a lot about organization and lean Manufacturing and be self motivated.the management was open to new ideas and implementation of them.I like to work with a different people from many culturesMake people to change ways to work and implement lean manufacturing but in the end all the people was into it.The fun part was the opportunity to implement changes and facilitated the job of the people making his job easy and more productive with less effort.Learned to work great with others and run a prodoctive line with a team players. had a great supervisor to lead us. they were willing to help us out always.I currently enjoy my current job. I help transport employees to and from the train station in a timely fashion. My passangers and I have formed a good relationship over the years and really enjoy serving them. The most difficult part of my job is driving in the snow. I am very skilled in this regard, so its not too challenging. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work for and with. We get along very well.Great environment, managed office network, devices, and company website. Learned more about Apple OS and devices. Hardest part of the job was meeting the demand of the staff and customers. Most enjoyable part of the job was editing website.I had a good time at ICON when it started, that being said, it turned at the end. The CEO talks alot about how great the company is doing but they never really want to promote. Some of the managment in the Chicago office is lackluster and can actually be alittle bit of a bully and mentally abusive. i still have PTSD from the blond lady who looks like an orangutang.Very friendly co-workers, they helped me out with using a cash register. The manager made you feel like part of their family.not at this time, I do not feel like this is something I would like to talk about at this time.  If I get hired at this company then I will tell more about my back groundHigh energy workplace with a tight-knit group of co-workers. Management cares about individuals as well as pushing business growth. The majority of my fellow employees are counted as friends after having spent time together at work. The hardest part of the job is balancing life/work balance. Late nights do not always help in having a normal daytime existence. The most satisfying part of my job is seeing new guests returning after a positive experience and continually growing the business.","5,001 to 10,000",New-York,New York,NY,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/3848b0ef-25ba-4152-bcda-937434a1ac09?mescoid=1900255001001&jobPosition=12,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
285,2699.0,Quantitative Software Engineer,T. Rowe Price,4.0,131.0,"Excellent company to work for, learn, and have work life balance. Depending on career interest T. Rowe has many paths to travel. management is open and helpful.Best company I have worked for!  Great work environment, co-workers, management team, and numerous opportunities for continuous learning, training, and education.  Solid work/life balance as long as you were efficient and a good time manager.  Easy to move up if you network appropriately.Advancement is more time driven than merit driven - regardless of your skill set, you will not be considered for a promotion until X months/years in your current role.Work life balance was solid with relatively flexible hours and a decent company culture.There is a lack of accountability though, so employees are able to skate by without any risk of punishment.Great benefits, and an awesome atmosphere. The management and compensation are lacking, and not up to par with other companies in the financial industry.There could be more vision in terms of their strategic technology plan, but overall the firm is a good place to work.  They have good benefits packages, and for the most part are good about work/life balance.Great company to work for with advancement opportunities and generous benefits. It can be challenging in the beginning to understand the IT infrastructure and to establish yourself. But the coworkers are very helpful.Prosgreat non-monetary benefits, easy company mobility, excellent work-life balance, and really nice people. overall, a really solid company to work for.Consin order to move past a certain level, you definitely need a solid education background or significant professional experience. hard to break through into the trading environment, similar to many competitorsAdvice to Managementtake smaller bonuses and reward employees at the bottom making less than 50k a year. no reason someone should be making $10 million a year when others at the same company are just trying to stay afloatManagement is okay and stay off your back if you do what you are supposed to. Easy to slip through the cracks if you don't lobby for yourself. Management path is the best way to advance in other areas of the company- nearly impossible to get a promotion out of operations unless you are on the management track.My days here are really enjoyable. I really like the people and the atmosphere. Work/Life balance is really important to the management.T. Rowe Price is an excellent company to grow and develop your skill and knowledge in the investment world. I highly recommend anyone who wants to start somewhere in the investment world to apply for T. Rowe. However, the company has a lot of catching up to do with industry standards and trends.great company to work for. Really good benefits including large 401k contributions. Just have to be able to deal with many different projects and responsibilities at one time. Opportunities are there, you just have to go after and get them.Good place to work but very little communication through teams. There is little to no communication between teams working on the same project. There is even less communication between management to the teams.Company taught me a lot about corp culture - great place to . I learned alot about how a company can teach you about life. Nothing in life comes easy... you must put in the work to achieve your dreams.T. Rowe Price is an absolutely great place to work.  Employees are very friendly.  Fringe benefits are very good.  Leader was great.  Very helpful.I like the job. Not a fan of doing the same thing everyday but if you don't mind talking on the phone to customers, and looking at computer screen while on a recorded line to ensure compliance then this job is nice. Not much room for growth though until you get your series 7. You get two 15 minute breaks a day and an hour lunch.It was nice working with T Rowe Price. Warm Culture. Co workers were very helpful specially Manager. Though there is still some discrimination between contractors and Full Time but I didn't have to face this in my team. Team was supportive and helpful.Good and stable company to grow your career in Finance domain. Nice work environment and people to work with.It was very corporate and quiet. Every weekend there was work and never had a day off. Management was never seenThey have a fitness center at both locations, Owings Mills and Baltimore.  There are two in Owings Mills, one brand new. The management at T. Rowe is great. There is room for growth and a lot of wonderful opportunities to advance.From my perspective, it seemed the only avenue to promotion into leadership was to be a part of the crony crew. Most members of general management were very close friends, in some cases connections dating back to High School. Promotions seemed to be honored based on friendships and not previous professional experience or true talent.  Friendships and being a part of crony club should not be a compelling reason to promote an individual. These high school antics have contributed to my decision to seek employment in a professional environment, where promotions are based on merit and not likeability or one's ability to mesh with a homogenous group.There is also no life/work balance with mandatory overtime. 8 hours is plenty of life to contribute to work. Family and health is more important. If you are not a crony, you will not experience organizational agility anyway.I worked for a group of writers who were a very interesting.  I met some great friends there, and learned a bit about stocks.  I made travel arrangements for the writers, kept vacation requests, etc.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the fact that everyone got along.","5,001 to 10,000",New-York,New York,NY,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/c031eba2-7e13-48b3-93cf-454629a96237?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=28,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

As a team, we've recently started to break the glass ceiling of implementing arts within the STEM work environment, learning every step of the way. Combined, the arts and STEM can help to engage more US learners and help our economy grow.Good workplace environment for longterm employment. Good place for internal organizational job changes. Management varies depending on the organization you support. Co-workers can either be team players or non-team players. It depends on your organization. Hardest part of the job is figuring out what management's expectations from day to day. Working for the federal government was an enjoyable employment opportunity.Coming to work everyday at NASA is never a stressfull day. People are very professional and work oriented. Working with people of high caliber made me do my best at all time. We have a saying at our work place,"" Failure is not an option"".and I always keep that in my mind. Management is great. Supports EOE,treat everybody with great respect. We have a diverst co-workers that is fun to work with. It is a mix of people of different backgrounds and cultures that made NASA what is now.I interned in the Finance Department at NASA Ames Research Center the summer before my senior year of high school. Having been my first internship and exposure to a real work environment, NASA taught me a lot and influenced the career path I have taken. A typical day at work began around 9 AM, ending at 3 PM. I learned Ames' internal control procedures for accounting and analyzed financial statements for accordance with NASA's Continuous Monitoring Program. My co-workers were friendly and were happy to assist me with whatever issue I encountered. The hardest part of the job was familiarizing myself with government accounting protocols, as it was my first exposure to the field. The most enjoyable part of the job was having access to recreational facilities during my break times, such as the basketball court and the gym.A typical day at NASA was very relaxing and hard working. During my time at NASA I learned how to create a phasing plan, communicate with others from different departments, and lastly I learned how to manage multiple financial accounts. My co-workers were very patient and straight forward with the task at hand, they were friendly and very hard working. The toughest part of my job that I had to overcome was having to complete a full financial report before a given deadline. The best part of my job was that I had the opportunity to work for NASA and the fact that I got the chance to work and live in Florida for three months.NASA is in the news every day for absolutely awesome accomplishments.  As Senior Organization Development Consultant and executive coach at Headquarters, I get to guide leaders as they build environments that foster such success.Typical days may include working on space hardware, research aircraft, exact models, to testing in wind tunnels, You learn to accept additional responsibliities, work to completion deadlines, deal with scientists, reseqrchers, contractors, vemdors and researchers as well as management and other technical staff. hardest days mat require to climd 28 flights of stairs outside in all weather condtions to complete testing of experiments The most rewarding is watching test complete sucessful, models so exact they become standards for future projectsFirst Rated place to work with unlimited benefits and opportunities.  Excellent working environment.  This is all for nonw.A typical day at work would range from watching the Shuttle land to stocking office supplies. Working with a wide range of people...astronauts to NASA nerds. Hardest part of the jobs was ensuring & training new or changing procedures to staff. Change management was a constantI was given the opportunity to learn cutting edge technology before it was introduced to the public. The staff and management were always there to help.NASA once was a place to work where brilliant ideas met hard work in order to achieve the impossible.  Those days are long gone.  Mostly due to budget cuts over the decades.One of the more disappointing aspects of working for NASA is the lack of job security  Due to repeating term hires, you can be let go after investing too many of your earning / research years.  The only individuals who are protected, are managers.  If I could go back in time, personally I would have not accepted a position at NASA, and instead pursued a career with DoD or DoE.Working for NASA was a rewarding experience in that I got a chance to see what the environment was like there, as well as a look into the levels of government security, types of technology, and main objectives of the Armstrong team.  The most enjoyable part was interacting with quite a few very pleasant individuals at various levels of command.  The hardest part of the job was meeting the ever present increasing demands for productivity while facing obstacles such as customer availability, and seriously corrupted systems.  Overall we managed to meet the overall goals of the contract.I really loved this job.  Management was wonderful and the staff was wonderful as well.  My co workers were wonderful.  They really cared about each other and they helped one another any way they could.Great place to work. Family Orientated environment. My day was busy, learned something new each day in regards to customer relations and support of my group. Management was understand a not difficult to work with.  I supported a great group of guys and we worked together as a team. I can not say that I remember any hard times unless it was trying to meet a deadline that was short.Planning events and helping all of the wonderful groups in the building. I truly enjoyed working at NASA, plus it is only 5 minutes from home.Excellent work/life balance, average pay and benefits, no bonus, no profit sharing, management seems not appreciate your hard and quality work.The project was not that easy to build, wire, test and rebuild. There was 15 member to work in the project and found/solve the problem. The management of the team was not really good because some people want to work in their own which is not a team work idea. People lame each other about not doing anything or do work in their own without referring to the design drawn. The hardest part of the work was when we have to rebuild and rewire the whole robot because of some mistake people did. Rewiring was because some of the electrical component was old and did destroyed.The daily work changed from day to day, keeping things from getting tedious. People were friendly and interested in their work, and willing to listen to ideas no matter who had them. This feeling of inclusion and importance, combined with a air of mutual respect regardless of position, helped keep even the hardest work from being frustrating and boring. I learned new things every day I was there, and even the worst day there was better than the best day at some places I've been.NSSC in Bay St Louis is a great place to work.  Friendly people and helpful Management.  Lot of training opportunities and the NSSC promotes from within first which is a plus.Amenities such as Post Office, Day Care, Cafeteria, and Mini Mart.I felt very welcomed. Being an intern at NASA helped me obtain great technical and soft skills. A typical work day is coming in to work saying good morning to everyone I see. While also meeting with my managers and supervisors and completing the worked that has been assigned to me for the day. While working I'm learning and experience what the do's and dont's are in a professional environment. I'm learning so much in so many different fields of work at NASA. NASA has helped me to become very proficient with the Microsoft office. The hardest part about the job was learning how to use Microsoft Excel. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to be in a flexible position to where i can work with many departments and deal with more than one type of work duties.I enjoyed my work its variety and for the most part the folks I worked with and the challenges they regularly place before me.

It paid well and I liked the fact that I was on my own. They paid for my gas and a hotel to stay in plus they paid a per diam for food.It has been a very an ok experience, didnt get to learn much. colleagues were good, and you get to travel if you cover different countries.Working for the U.S. Department of Commerce was very rewarding. I met several people in my community and have remained friends with a few of them. I took pride in providing an important service to my city, state and country. The pay was very good and the hours were flexible.Great place to work, very independent job, management can be a little out of touch with how things are supposed to be done, and what the different laws regarding prosecution actually are.As Assistant Manager for Administration it was important that I communicated with my co-manager to assure all operations were completed in a timely manner. Working for the U.S. Census allowed me to interact with a diverse group of people and understand how our difference would also allow us to work well together. The job was not hard, but you must be precise in the actions taken to complete projects in a timely manner. As a team to complete operations in a timely fashion gave us great pleasure.Great place to work, the mission is solid and the work is clear,concise and to the point. I really enjoyed working for this location/environment.

Must have great time management, writing and organizational skills.the work here is amazing. most of the work is individual and its at your own pace. most workers here are middle age professionals. hardest part of the job is staying focus.I worked with fisheries ( NMFS) Doing on task for other employees, copies a lot, Data entry, etc. A lot of things to do by myself till I am retired 2016.I never went to the actuall DOC while workign for NOAA, it was downtown and I worked inthe suburbs of Maryland. Although I did speak to a lot of the folks daily regarding acquisitions.The U.S.P.T.O is probably the best place I've had the pleasure of working for. The diversity of people and the career opportunities are great as well.It vary according on the need, I did anything from filing, answering the phones, entering data, verifying cost of commercial, verifying personal information on our employees. It was a busy environmentwith people from all nationalities. It was a rewarding experience.To process the paper work of the Executive of the branch. While setting up meeting rooms and travel arrangements for upper management to travel around the city.Great company to work with as a  Administrative Assistant .I learn a lot about Veterans. I gain a lot of experience in travel and using there Concur travel system.I have learned a great deal about the demographics of the Houston area while on this job.I would gladly participate in future campaigns should the opportunity present itself.This was my first real exposure to the real world during my undergraduate years and I am so thankful that I was able to experience it.The job was really interesting, but I didn't seem the mesh with local office culture. I would consider going back if the cost of living in DC wasn't so high.Opportunity for promotion and training.  Great health care packages. Nice 401k.

556,2970.0,Microbiologist,Unilever,4.2,2200.0,"I love working for Unilever . I was enjoyed making ice cream and work with good co-workers work as team and make job much easy. I was very sad when we got laid off from job and the plant shut-down.The culture is great and the company does fun things for their employees. The management and HR are horrible though. You are never working hard enough or doing enough for anyone there.  They like 22yo's and like to groom them so managers are 26 and have zero management or life experience. They are all about the metrics not having a happy work/life balance.Unilever is a great place to work if you like being part of a global corporation. The company has great benefits for salaried employees, and encourages personal development.fun fun fun place to work.  Lots of challenges, if I had a question, someone was always there to assist.  Great place to work.I wished I had stayed living in NJ, I would have loved to retire from this company.Scope of roles have great depth and breath. Colleagues & Work Environment are positive natureGood Products and Innovation pipelineGreat Diverse CultureToo much to accommodate within a small amount of time, pushing one to either work consistently during off-work hours or fall behind.Lack of appreciation for work done stemming from a fundamental lack of understanding of effort involved in accomplishing tasks.Cleaning offices the hardest part of the job climbing three flights of stairs 8 to 10 times a day. the most rewarding part of the job was meeting new people.I liked working for the time I'm workingGood Person's And I learned a lot for My supervisorsThe Good Crew and Support the staffI've worked at Unilever JC for 17 years.  It was a good place to work up until the last 4 years.  New management & HR sucked the happiness from lower managemt & production.  Poor raises like 1%, or none at all.  Health insurance is at an all time high, making it difficult to takie family members to Dr.  Point system : 8 in one year, getting point for being one minute late.  Even if your in a car accident.  Better be on time if the roads are ice covered, no lea way at all.  4 years ago, they would work with you on issues such as these.  Running lines under staffed is almost an everyday thing.  Making it a risk to work safely.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this job to my worst enemy.My name is peter pan and this site requires a test. So I will type a long winded sentence talking about how things could always be better. I was happy getting a job with unilever then depressed by how silly things can get.I have no complaints working with Unilever It has been a pleasure to work for this staffing company. Manpower has open plenty of doors for me making sure I get sufficient pay, a good working experience and have made me feel valuable as a worker.I really dont disapprove of Unilever, but I dont really recommend it. The turnover rate is outstanding. The people are okay, but the wear and tear this job puts on your body is unbearable. Great experience though.It was a union job so all the eeoc laws were enforced. Nothing is perfect, but this was not far from it.Safety meetings were regular. Seniority was used to before skills but this meant an opportunity for advancement was offered but not given. If the person failed that tests, the next level of seniority was then given a chance.The human resources department is horrible.  They never have an answer to a question.  The job itself didn't seem too difficult but the employees made it so.  They weren't welcoming of direct hires and would love to always sit back and watch you fail.  I left due to medical reasons and was let go.  In some way I've never been so happy to be fired from a job!I enjoyed working at Unilever.  Beautiful campus and a diverse population of employees.   I was lucky to have a manager that encouraged and supported me in my work.Work day goes by very fast with keeping equipment running and performing maintenance on equipment. Very positive work environment and extremely clean facility.Challenging opportunities in the field of foodservice and retail production. Always changing to keep pace with markets.  Wide spectrum packaging and formulation processes.Even though i work 3rd shift, everyone still comes in with a positive ready to work attitude. Mostly every Unilever employee is willing to help in their own way.Unilever was my first job. I began in Q.C. since there were no openings in R&D. However, the learning form my Q.C. experience helped me more effectively commercialize products that I developed as member of R&D group. I had the opportunity to work on consumer products related to both skin and hair. For my advancement, I was given the opportunity to take a substantial number of professional courses, which helped me advance my career. This additional knowledge also benefitted the company, because I was able to develop more advanced and innovative products, which met/ exceeded consumer needs and expectations.I would recommend for anyone who wants to be part of a large global organization.  To advance beyond manager level the competition is strong and you really need to be flexible on location.  Need to be ready to stay 3-5 yrs and move on.  Proud to work for a company which invests in our society.I was hired here just 6 months ago being told that the work schedule was a 12 hour day with 3 days on & 4 off one week & then 4 days on & 3 off the next. Occasional overtime would be posted to cover vacations & such as needed. This was an outright lie. Yes we do work 12 hours, may be forced to a 16 hour shift with almost no notice & you get 1 day off on a long week & 2 non consecutive days off on the short week. I work anywhere between 60 & 80 hours each week. This has taken a severe toll on my family life & health. The work itself isn't too bad but the hours & no set time off make it impossible to do anything but go to work.","10,000+",New-York,Englewood Cliffs,NJ,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/d4783a52-3932-4b98-9928-c2975fea9630?mescoid=1900242001001&jobPosition=21,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
