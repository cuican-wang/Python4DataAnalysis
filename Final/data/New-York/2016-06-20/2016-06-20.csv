268,2682.0,"Tutor(College Assistant) - ASAP Program - English, STEM and Social Science",CUNY,4.0,81.0,"It was a lovely place for learning and teaching, and gained respect from students. Supervisors were very nice, always held thanksgiving party for all staff.College Assistant typical work life is like working as hotel doormat.Management is a joke! They don't care about you. All they care about when is their next paycheck! Co-workers/students are a joke, they are smart in their academics but lazy as F$#K! You can literally not show up for work and get still get pay, and not get fired.Most enjoyable part of the job is leaving end of the day!In theory, CUNY is a good place to work.However the demands of the job supersede the compensation provided. My colleagues are helpful. The commute is awful.performed numerous transfer evaluations for transfer students using the BOSS and TES SystemAssisted students with undergraduate admissions and transfer related issuesMet with students to discuss their evaluationsprofessional work atmosphere hundreds of transfer caseloads per semester in addition to the case files from the previous semester that need to to be evaluated and updatedI worked in the CUNY SEEK department as part of my school's work study program in order to pay for my classes and books.  It was enjoyable and gave me additional experience working with the public.Wonderful people and greate place to work. Recommended to all cuny students to work there. You can meet various people throughout the entire CUNY system.Best place to work, professional development guaranty, Fun environment, flexible and prosperous. Working in that place made me a better person in terms of learning and capacity buildingCUNY campuses have been nationally recognized as culturally diverse institutions of higher learning that foster a profound appreciation for different cultures, languages and world perspectives.go in, do the job, leave at end of shift.  best part: possibility of studying while working. hardest part:  when classes canceled but school not closed, still expected to go to work.not a good place to be. no chance for advancement. whatever job you do will stay the same so will your salary. managers pressure people into working crazy hours for free. some make sexist racist and homophobic comments all the time . one of the executives of the school said that arabs were not even human beings to the new york times. a lot of the people are just awful . incompetent and lazy are rewarded with big salaries. hard workers get taken for suckers and punished for it. some high level staff are convicted felons who were hired anyway .google it . a lot of nepatism. know somebody and get hired don't and you wont. if you are good at that go for it. if you are a woman a minority (other than asian) or lgbt stay away from this place. you will be treated like garbage. the amount of waste and fraud is very very high. this place is corrupt.relocated assets for 23 collegesreconciled cash and bank statementcollected data, coded computer entriesprepared quarterly and annual reconciliationsIts a typical day at work but has you own your toes literally, don't sit and help students with there technical issues. the co-workers are nice though.Working for any government agency you obtain a great amount of experience only if you choose to work hard.internal promotions are always available but compensation never meets the amount of resposibilityoverall very good just some problems with contract being renewed due to this being a city job. The management is well rounded but the really good people don't last long since the compensation for good work simply isn't there.Prolidase is a metallopeptidase that is ubiquitous in nature and has been isolated from many different organisms such as bacteria, archaea and fungi.  Prolidase specifically hydrolyzes dipeptides. It requires zinc and/or other metals for activation. Routinely used laboratory isolate of C. albicans, ATCC 36232 produces significantly reduced amount of prolidase. We investigated to determine the enzyme level during different phases of growth in minimal media. The data for prolidase activity yielded negative results. It was also concluded that DBP/Tween-80 mixture was not toxic for the respective strains. All toxicity assays performed with cultures of the chemical dilution were positive indicating the absences of toxicity at the concentrations utilized. For the whole cell assay, MnCl2 was used for activation of prolidase. The qualitative assay of this whole cell was also negative. We assume that the amount of time affected our results. We can conclude that an appropriate future strategy with a time course spanning from 12 hours to 72 hours or longer may yield better results.I have been with this company for 25 years and I enjoy working with them. I love my job. The benefits are great but the salary is not.On the campus that I was employed it is somewhat laid back atmosphere except when employees that have been at the campus for many many years try to sabotage newer younger employees that may help the institution by introducing positive changes. There is no regard for authority for those older employees, some of them believe they are above authority because they have tenure. Sometimes employees who do no work outlast employees who work really hard.on the positive side for the most part everyone is very friendly and there is a sense of community amongst most employees making the work environment very pleasurable leading to high employee morale. Benefits are really good too!!The job was okay. You have to deal with people that are crazy and rude on the phone. Management cares about how quick you can end the call. Doesn't feel like people are actually being helped.My typical work day consisted of various clerical duties such as typing, data entry, filing and retrieving, answering telephone/providing information/relaying messages, serving as a receptionist,opening/sorting/distribution of mail, providing photocopies. I worked under the direct supervision of the College Office Assistant. Assisted the professors, adjuncts, counselors/advisers with open enrollment/registration of incoming freshmen and continuing students. My co-workers and I had a great and wonderful rapport. The fulfilling part of my job was seeing those students you helped graduate and move on successfully. The hardest part was leaving...I enjoyed working at CUNY.  It was a great experience.  I love the interaction with staff and students, which was positive.  A typical day would be meeting with students to assist them in identifying an internship in their career interest or lecturing a seminar (Critical Reflections or Fundamentals of Career Advancement).  The hardest part was finding an appropriate internship for a student at the last hour.  Fortunately, the student was able to secure one.I enjoyed the flexibility of my schedule.  For the most part, it was a nurturing environment as well as a supportive.I love working at CUNY.  Although you may have the same title as some other employee, your task may be triple theirs and nothing can be done.  You can get lucky and get in a laid back department or you can be placed somewhere, and become the manager and paid as an office assistant.",,New-York,Brooklyn,NY,2016-06-20T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/11244644-5bcf-4e04-b9cd-0f16c9b45eec?mescoid=1900287001001&jobPosition=11,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
