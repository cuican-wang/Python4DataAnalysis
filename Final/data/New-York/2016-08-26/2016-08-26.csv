150,2564.0,Gain Theory â€“ Data Scientist/Statistical Modeler,GroupM,4.0,47.0,"GroupM is truly a great company and an a awesome place to start off your career in media and learn about the industry as a whole. Laid back and relaxed work atmosphere and very welcoming environment.Overall, GroupM is a great place to work, but bad communication between upper management and employees. Direct supervisors were great in Atlanta office.A typical day here in the office includes checking buys to make sure that correct day-parts are being used, correct spot lengths and approved programming is used. Also to make sure that buyers are spending budgets correctly.A typical day of work one must do many different things and constantly learning on the job. Management worries for the employee health. The hardest time is the last few days of the month where situations occur that are out of one's control. There were different relationships between employees but my favorite thing would have to be the activities.enjoyed meeting and working with great people; clients are respectable; room for growth; great location; demanding work hours.Very big and matrixed organization.  Good opportunity to learn at the biggest player in the media space.  Space is a little outdated, but moving to world trade area in 2018Best people in the industry, job security. Dynamic and fast paced environment. Opportunity to work in smaller divisions of a large holding company which offers the best of both worlds.GroupM is a very large company with many moving parts. It was a very rewarding place to work. There has been a major reorganization worldwide and at the moment there is very little direction and no leadership.Being here I have learned a great deal about office automation development within SharePoint. My coworkers have all been very friendly and helpful and my team of direct reports were very easy to work with. As was my overseas development team The hardest part of the job is also the most enjoyable. The various projects I have either managed or developed myself can be (and most were) very difficult but so rewarding when they are successfully completed.The organization is an excellent place to learn hands on.  Always trying to stay ahead of the curve on cutting edge technologies.Working for the organization I learned a large number of technologies such as Cisco ASA, Checkpoint, 3Par Storage Citrix Netscalers, EMC RSA Atuhenication Manager and VMware.I have been working at GroupM full-timeProsGroupM provides a Great work/life balance with plenty of ""day off"" timeConsIT going through changes, little transparency, very uncertain on futureCan be challenging as depending on your role and which agency, roles and expectations aren't always well defined. You get to work on great brands, however; depending upon your level, salary doesn't always match work responsibilities. You need to be your own advocate. Being such a large agency has its pros and cons.I worked with two exceptional team members and we not only got the job done but had fun while providing IT support to several companies. We worked together for 7 1/2 years together and we were like family.  The work environment was positive and the people we supported were outgoing which made our jobs in IT even more fun.There are some nice people that are good to work with, however you will not move up in this company.  You will be stuck in same spot for years and no one will be helpful.This job was very fast paced and had a high volume of work but it was great working there. The co-workers were amazing we all got along.A good starting point to open to new things and network. Job culture could use some improvement.Very fortunate to work with the leading holding company globallyI've learned so many valuable things. One of them is to work in a team and finish what needs to be done.- Nice team of co-workers- Large international company- Fun to work in Advertisement sphereExcelent co-worker to work. I learned much about diferents accounting in advertising.A typical day consists of any of the following: A/R and A/P, reconciliations, analysis of accounts, variance explanation, etc. My experience at GroupM has taught me to be detailed oriented as well as how to efficiently manage my time. I've gotten the chance to work with great individuals who are very helpful and supportive. The hardest part of the job is resolving problems that occurred prior to my employment with the company. The most enjoyable part of the job is completing difficult projects and getting our month-end and yearly closes.A great place to learn the basics in media.  More often than not, issues or discrepancies are realized in the finance department.  It is our job to resolve these issues by requesting additional information from vendors, planners, analysts and/or reviewing contracts or insertion orders.  I've learned how to meet demanding deadlines and to communicate in a multi-level corporate environment.  In my position, the hardest part of my job is knowing that there is no way to move up without waiting for someone to retire.  My co-workers are the best part of the job.",,New-York,New York,NY,2016-08-26T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/0f901092-9efd-48cc-b423-40ca08492098?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
