553,2967.0,Quantitative Developer,Royal Bank of Canada,4.1,1300.0,"Busy office but manageable. Management and co-workers were great to work with. Very enjoyable job!It was such a great experience to work for RBC Wealth Management. I learned to work in fast pace environment and to managed competitive priorities. I was helping a team of two financial advisors with all the administrative tasks, calendars, communication and financial transactions. The managers and supervisors were great allies to help me grows within the company. The team I worked with were mainly reactive rather than proactive and it made it very hard to learn a structure and organization. However, I always felt appreciated by them. I was able to remain myself and still belong to the team.Enjoyed working with my clients and prospects.Reasonable commission schedule.Nice office and location.Office closed due to lack of recruiting on part off management.Royal Bank of Canada offered a professional and comfortable work atmosphere. Salary and compensation levels were competitive. Personal were very Team orientated.Very comparable in terms of compensation and work-life balance with the bulge bracket banks, but still lacks top exit opps. Culture and management varies widely between different groups. Great place to learn a lot.RBC was a great company to work for that allow for growth and personal development.  I worked my way up from middle office to front officeRoyal Bank of Canada is a very sound financial institution. I worked for the Bank for 10 years in the Futures division located in Chicago. They are very responsible to there employees and create a comfortable work environment.It's fun and rewarding to work for RBC. The culture is open and inclusive.  Senior management communicates and keep employees informed about the direction and strategies of the firm.RBC is a good company to work for.  The benefits are good, the pay is competitive.  You do want to make sure that if you pick a career path (operations over business line) that you stick with it however.  Once you get too high up in one or the other it is hard to switch over.I worked within the trade support team for just over 7 months on a contract role. The role support the equity sales traders. I was located in London..I have worked here for 14 years and have found that the culture has increasingly become very toxic. That being said the benefits are good and there is a decent amount of job security.RBC works hard to provide affordable competitive benefits.  However, they determine employee salary by analyzing industry averages and meeting, not exceeding, the average.RBC is a terrific company to work for and love that there are options for growth if you are willing to make changes.  Just like any company there are differences in opinion and management but overall this company is good to work for long term.Excellent leadership.Learned about banking.Excellent training.One of the best companies that  I have worked for.They give you all the tools to be sucessfulMy day begins with updating reports, checking for errors and preparing for closing calls. The rest of my day is all about making sure all deadlines are met. Towards the end of the day we make sure  that all account are balanced and if we have to  assist each other to  get issue that demand urgent solutions.Lots of hours for little outcome. Depending on the group you could work on some M&A deals but mostly you will be pitching a lotThis company is a small but nice place to work at, They show appreciation. The contribute to your success. You really work as a team to in a good way.Support 40+ executives with a variety of requests including travel, creating presentations/org charts, answering phones, faxing/copying,Enjoyed coming to work.  I like to keep busy and help other employees if need be.  I enjoy talking to client on the phone and developing a personal relationship with them.Great intern projects and responsibilities. Company and people really care about your professional growth. Good work/life balance is actually something that is stressed on employees, depending which department you are in but overall it's the company's culture. Really great people to work with especially within the Project Delivery Office (PDO). I would love to come back and work here full time.like working here because the days seem to go by fast. This was a very high stressful Job because it was about the stock market and other people money.","10,000+",New-York,Jersey City,NJ,2016-07-26T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/e0155459-48e2-4a3c-8868-c7ce41970fc2?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=18,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
