106,2520.0,Data Scientist (geospatial),WeWork,3.4,14.0,"I worked at this company for almost a year, and although it was a wonderful opportunity for meeting cool entrepreneurs and networking, that was one of the ONLY pros. You work incredibly long hours (10-12 per day), and because people can be fired at will, they can also quit at will, so there was so much turnover that upper management never knew what to do. It seemed that decisions were made at whim, and new useless policies were implemented out of nowhere. Towards the end of my time there, there was such a huge push on sales that we were having to work weekend events to create more leads, and never received any overtime compensation other than free beer and food. Free food is nice, but work/life balance is better. No one on my team ever took a full hour for lunch, and eventually we started to feel guilty when we actually did. You have to plan and work weekly events, as well. Additionally, the pay is the same across the board, regardless of what city you live in, so kind of ridiculous to compare the San Francisco employees to the Texas employees. All in all, I would recommend this company if you just graduated and need experience, or are used to long hours and really love networking. But prepare to be disposable, and make a back-up plan.WeWork has amazing potential and if run properly has the ability to be a really great place to work. Until there are some serious changes in management I would not recommend someone to consider working at WeWork. The company refers to management style as ""fixing the plane while it is in the air.""working for wework is great. they have a fun vibe and twice a year you get to go on a company trip. the hours can be very long and you have to work some days after hours but other than that it is a grate place.The whole building was full of positive energy.Always get received with a good morning.fast pace work at times. all my coworkers great people supportive,work as a team.Everybody I have come in contact with has been supportive, welcoming, and encouraging. There is a fantastic sense of community here. You become a part of something huge and join a family. Everybody works extremely hard here. We all believe in providing the best member experience and that doesn't happen without hard work! WeWork is doing some amazing things and it's an amazing experience to be a part of! HR is extremely helpful and employees are treated with the utmost respect. You will get out of this job as much as you put into it!This was one of my favorite jobs I have been with! From the atmosphere, teamwork, and relationships you build, this company had it all! I loved working with everyone and learned so much from those I worked under. It not only helped me to grow as an employee but it helped me to grow as a person.On paper this looks like a great company but it is under paid for what the employee do and can't live off of the wage they pay its employeesWework was a good place to work at. Everyday I was greeted kindly by the people who's offices I had to collect trash from. The environment was great, and it was a job close to home to.the members were very rude someday and then there were days when they were friendly and comical. i learned a lot of cleaning habits.Great people but a chaotic and unpredictable environment. Little organization within departments and expected hours were 9-8:30 or 9. If you're looking for a decent work/life balance, do not consider a job here.Each day there are tasks that must be completed within a deadline such as building walk-through, follow up emails for visitor that have toured the office space, sales calls with market, team meetings among ourselves, and other member support related duties.Typically, I am the primary point person for all sales development in our building and also take most of the tours that are scheduled daily for the facility.Daily collaboration with multiple teams such as maintenance, IT, security, and cleaning staff as it relates operations, day-to-day supplies, and support tickets from members.Members are exclusively small business owners, startups, their staff, and our community management team.  These are people that I have development friendly connections with over the months and would speak highly of all.  WeWork provides the facility but the folks here create a truly enriching community experience that is beyond compare to a typical office space.Generally a good experience however there is very little opportunity for advancement from the property level. The corporate environment is very insular and doesn't provide much recognition to property managers for their efforts. I would recommend for someone right out of college but wouldn't suggest for a mid career individual. Also, high turnover and very little recognition from senior management.When i was working at Wework, i saw that it was very important that our customers had to have a clean environment and for to accomplish this, it important that we had a strong and responsible team. I made sure that all three building had all of there proper employees.",,New-York,New York,NY,2016-11-03T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/1e28ae21-08b6-40dc-97e0-382f28f59242?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
