228,2642.0,Senior Research Scientist,Visiting Nurse Service of New York,3.7,169.0,"driving from visit to visit. if you don't like driving around and dealing with the public this will not be for you. you. wont have a set area, you could be driving all over the borough.Educational environment. I have learned so much working here and have grown alot. I enjoyed working as a Public Health Nurse.They made me an incorrect offer and told me to trust them as they couldn't get it in writing for a couple days. So I put notice in at my current position and then they rescinded the offer the next day because I accepted an offer that was incorrect. I guess I wouldn't want to work there if that's how they are anyways.Got a lot to learn. Very fast paced environment. Proper work life balance. Great location and great benefits. Great communication channels between cross functional teams.VNSNY used to be a great place to work-But inow there is a hostile working environment ,no management support, poor problem solving skills from managers.I have been a Public Health nurse for 20 plus years and still enjoy seeing patients at home but this agency had made it more difficult for us to casemanage safely and efficiently . The nurses and rehab group that i worked with are awesome !I have worked for this company for more than a decade, it was a wonderful company but sadly at this time the current management, especially in Westchester and the Bronx is HORRIBLE, it has sunken to the depths of a DRACONIAN ERA where backstabbing and witch-hunts of the dedicated staff that has been there for 10-25 years is under attack. Especially the Westchester management team, the 2 managers here are basically incompetent and they want to micro-manage the nurses to prove they are doing their jobs, but honestly they are destroying the efficiency of the nurses and they are horrible managers, sadly they used to be nurses in the organization and have lost perspective.  The salary and benefits are excellent, but if you want to be worked to death for money that is a personal question.  The Manhattan division is still run OK - but there is not the opportunity to make the money that there used to be in the company.  There is UFT UNION representation for the nurses and they do a wonderful job, but it is definitely an exhausting place to work these days.  The benefits through the UFT union are wonderful, full paid medical/dental for the entire family just for union dues, no employee contributions. And a pension managed by the UFT fund.VNS was okay to work for at first. The workload was always heavy but we made the best of it. In the last 3 years, however management has shifted their focus to be more harrassing than usual and the big stick mentality is constant. Your cases keep increasing and you cannot even get to see patients on schedule. They care more about numbers, spending millions on ridiculous dashboards while laying off essential staff and downsizing a 3 floor office space down to a 4 room corner box. This company does not care about their patients and less so the workers. Most managers have resigned so you work without supervision. You cannot even reach them via phone. Move along if you wish to provide safe patient care and maintain your sanity or integrity. This is not a good place to work.This job sounded wonderful but when it came down to it, it was pushy people that if they didn't like your work this when you were not in their churchI was layed off more than 2 years ago and still miss the work life balance. I would work there again at the first chance i get.The employees were rude I was offered a work study assignment from my school to work here. I would walk into the office and there would be no work available I would have to ask around if there something to do to make the day go by quicker.Field work three times a week in the office for 2 days a week. I learned to be a caseworker by fieldwork training being out in the field. Management staff was very concern about sending employees to classes so they can continue to exceed in their position, Co workers worked as a team so we can assist members who needed homecare services. The hardest part was convincing elderly members when it came to documents needed for healthcare but over all they come around and are please with the services VNS has provided.VNSNY is a great place to work. The benefits are awesome and my colleagues are wonderful. The hours are comfortable too.Company does not value and invest in its employees.  Management let great talent walk out the door.  Many talented individuals were forced to leave. People that are there are not recognized and developed.  No opportunity for growth due to politics.  Very political organization.  Not based on what you do but who you know.Love the patient care and day to day dealings with patients. don't care for the numerous managers, lack of communication to staff. great co-workers!I loved my job.Never called out sick, never late. I look forward to every night going on duty.  Always signed on an hour early to see how the flow was going and check all emails before starting. Sometimes back flow from evening was a little hectic but then slowed down.  Learned to listen carefully to what patients did  not say to clue me in to their problem.  Management as per my clinical instructor was very good. Received good advise. My co workers were the best.  Assisting with Hospice calls and translating  spanish calls for the Manager on duty was stressfull,  or pt that were lonely and just wanted someone to speak to at night, which I would stay on the phone and speak to them.  Most enjoyable when pt was so sad and at end of conversation would tell me I made their day brighter, I would keep their phone and call them few days later to check up on them.  I spoke to my coordinator about the need to call our clients to check up on them, which we implemented.  Worst day of my life when I retired.. My Dad was very sick I had to be there for him, he died 11/15.  Now I am looking forward to giving to my clients what I learned caring for him and my step mom.  My understanding for the  care  patients with dementia and progressive alzheimers need  is very difficult. Want to give back for all I have learned, patience, love for nursing them back to an acceptable way of life with dignity, making sure no one hurts them emotional or bodily.lots of transition, good for someone who likes to work in the field and likes the change.A lot of employees left due to the increase in the caseloads but not in pay.There are no annual bonuses any more.Caseloads increased from around 25 to 40/50 and moreProductive and supportive hospice team with excellent management, time consuming travel however, interesting and self-fulfilling during patient and family encounter. Provides great learning experience.I met wonderful people who work/worked for VNSNY. I also learned and was taught how to be a good administrative assistant by the head of VNS Choice. Best boss I ever had. What was wrong with VNSNY is that there was no loyalty to me or anyone else at VNSNY. There never is any loyalty and that is a shame. Especially those of us who worked so hard for so many years. The management from the top has changed and it's not the same place it used to be. It was a pleasure working there from 2001 when I started and then around 2007 it started to change. It's gone down hill from there. Massive lay offs and a lack of loyalty to it's employees. It used to be a wonderful place. There old logo was ""We Bring the Caring Home"". I miss that...Big company lots of challenges. No  structure. will like to work where there is more structure. Company has good benefitsDoes very good with payroll and any other task ask to do.Does great job with AR.Always takes on other task to help other.Fills in when other are on vacation.3 days a week out in the field making home visits to assist members with documents needed for Medicaid Applications and bringing Medicaid application down to 34th street  Medicaid office to be process timely  and 2 days a week in the office reviewing and assisting members over the phone regarding what documents are needed for scheduled pick up date.  I learned how to travel within the Borough  of the Bronx NY.  Management was fair with caseload and willing to send you to classes for training to keep you educated & updated with the different changes within Medicaid guidelines. Co-works were team players and family oriented. The hardest part of the job is not knowing if you were safe going into member's homes. Most enjoyable was working in the Borough  that you lived in it felt like you were giving  back to your community.","10,000+",New-York,Manhattan,NY,2016-10-09T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/93497153-fbde-4f4e-b184-cdca8a82d40a?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
