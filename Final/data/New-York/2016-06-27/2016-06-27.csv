The biggest problem this place has is that it doesn't have a CTO directing the technology used across the board or giving an overall technology leadership across the organization.People tend to use siloed tools and those pushing for standardizing the tools don't tend to be in sync with the users they're pushing them on. There's a lot of communication problems across departments and every project is completely different from every other project. Many departments are under-staffed and overworked, and the company's always hiring, but it takes so long to onboard people to the disorganized process that it just winds up adding more work to the already overburdened departments.To make this worse documentation initiatives tend to fizzle or get deprioritized compared with project work, which is the reason why onboarding is so labor intensive. At the same time process improvement is expected to be performed while also working on projects, which is a serious problem when you don't even have time to finish project work. In other words, the process is so slow, that it inhibits having time to increase the efficiency of the process.The chief goal of the company owners is to sell the company, but they prioritize flashy names and branding rather than focusing on having a well-designed product. The engineering team is offsite (India) and often out of communication with the rest of the departments,  more... a lot of times bug reports are ignored or argued against and the relationship with the engineers feels hostile. A lot of processes that should be automated or done with tools purpose-built to handle them are done inefficiently, and the inertia of siloed users paired with the lack of coordinated adoption of effective tools renders every project a slow, grinding, manual process.This company has a lot of potential, but right now it's a quagmire and the longer people work here the more likely they are to seek other employment when they realize that fixing the problems requires a lot more work with respect to coordinating and motivating other people than just participating in the inefficient process.The food in the kitchen's nice, the HR staff are on top of their game, the events tend to be frequent and fun, and it's nice to have a pool/ping pong table as well as a number of other games available to play on breaks. It is nice to be able to work from home and have unlimited vacation, but often times people are so busy that these perks are rendered completely impossible.A lot of things about this place work well, but there's serious issues that need to be addressed or this place won't be able to scale or maintain momentum.  lessWork is pretty adhocNothing new to learnManagement is clueless about their jobco workers are not team playersHardest part is to find some good work. People work mostly on SAS, a stone age frameworkBeing a living sign for Marketshare Inc, has been a great source of supplimentary income.  I have been working for this company almost 3 years, and they are a great company. They pay well, and have a good open door policy (over the phone, of course).Because of the limited job advancment, I would have to overall rate this job, 4 stars...Its a nice place to work but job security is low. Training or Learning curve is bad. Hence Self-dependent  attitude can help.working out in all types of weather, holding a sign and waving to traffic.",,New-York,New York,NY,2016-06-27T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/7284c94a-7afc-4e37-979b-790f8ab4d2a5?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
