Supportive management and encouraging teams/co-workers. offers great work-life balance. Enjoyed working with the team .I enjoy selling on Etsy, it's a good way to make a little extra cash now and then with a crafting skill I possess that isn't in great demand in the general workforce. It's not a typical day job.This business was convenient for me because I was able to stay at home with my son the first two years of his life. It is very well organized.Do what you love, make it happen.On my free time, I work on designing the wedding floral parasols, I get to use many different kinds of materials.My mother and I currently own 3 shops together. When we started this 3yrs ago we had 1 shop and I did the photography, loaded the photos to the laptops, edited the photos, and she did the rest. This worked for quite a while and we even managed to open a 2nd shop but then I got sicker, at that time, and she had to take over everything. Eventually I got better and was able to start up social networking which brought in some views (not a lot but more than before) to the shops. So it ended up that she runs the shops and I run the net (which kinda became a thing of it's own).My mother goes to garage sales, second-hand stores, estate sales, etc. to find things almost every weekend. She takes photos in the mornings and loads them to her laptop when she gets the chance. She does thorough research on all items as well as VERY thorough packaging.The company is a good company, the people are amazing, its stellar. It is full of so many smart, creative people, there is no doubt that whatever you do there, you will find something cool out about yourself.  What it presents to the outside world, is exactly what it is on the inside. Politics are not prevalent, and employees have a genuine interest in helping you out.Etsy was great in the sense you had complete freedom to choose your work load and schedule. Complete control over your marketing,  design and management. On the downside, you had to juggle many roles at once.Etsy HQ is a warm and truly unique workspace. It offers an open-air seating arrangement with communal desks. The company has made a proactive commitment to sustainability and provides quality, locally sourced goods for employee meals and events. This is a non-discriminatory environment that actually celebrates individuality, promotes gender equality, and encourages work to be executed colorfully, thoughtfully, and communally. There is an attitude that we all have something to learn from one another and that everyone's ideas can propel Etsy's teams to greatness and the company to higher ground.I love working for myself, however the income is not steady enough for my household needs.Great way to make money working from home.  I've been searching for a job for quite a while, and selling on Etsy has kept my head above water for quite a while now.I enjoy the flexibility of selling handcrafted items on Etsy.com. I can easily work from home or when I am traveling.Though products on Etsy are sometimes priced unfairly by the people who use the site, Etsy has become famous for helping artisans connect with their audience worldwide. The site has a positive atmosphere, and the developers tried to make both selling and buying items as easy as possible.loved it the best part was satisfying the customer in what they wanted",,New-York,Brooklyn,NY,2016-11-10T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/627829e0-b598-40b9-9721-08bf84cefde8?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=15,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
