Great place to learn the hedge fund work.Filled out documents and memos.  Learned that I could be a very productive at work if I like the place.  Management was good, all but one person.  Co workers were great.  Hardest part was cleaning the company's gym facilities.  Most enjoyable was working with so many different people, bankers, stock brokers among others.Very exciting fast paced position.  Multitasking is a must. The warm and friendly colleagues made the position very enjoyable.  In a typical day at my job I ran the mail for 500 employees while maintaining the everyday needs of the employees on 4 different floors.  I enjoyed speaking to all the different employees at the job.  I learned how to multitask in different situations at a fast paced environment.  The hardest part of the job was not being appreciated by the upper management.  I desire working for a company that values their employees.Great people with entrepreneurial spirit and the willingness to help others.

116,2530.0,Data Scientist,American International Group,3.8,915.0,"The company has had turnover in senior management over the last decade.  This unfortunately has created an environment of chaos with regards to having effective management in place.  Many managers typically stay in their office and it is up to the employee to approach the manager vs. the manager actually setting clear and direct communications.  This leads to the overspending of funds for system enhancements and/or projects.  A number of the Project Managers hired recently don't seem to know how to manage a project as those project managers from years ago.  It is unfortunate this company gone from being a great company (with some issues, needless to say) and many, many dedicated employees to a company of counting $$$, which it is wasting on an immense basis.Good work life balance and great benefits. Shift differential for over night shift and benefits for the weekend. International company that has many other offices for international opportunities.There was no room for advancement unless you wanted to move to the technical side of the house and then that wasn't guaranteed. Lots of lay offs with the administrative staff.Really depends on the department you work. During my time there, the company was going through a lot of restructuring which involved a lot of lay offs. So as you can imagine, that environment wasn't really the greatest to work in as many people were worried about Job security. My favorite part about working there though were my managers. Their open door policy, honesty, among many other things made working there quite pleasantI learned a lot at AIG and the management is generally easy to work with.  The hardest part of the job was the way systems were sometime implemented.  The people were the best part of the job.Productive Workplace. I have worked with AIG for eight years and I am currently looking for a Customer Service or Administrative position.They were a great company to work for. They were supportive of all the employees and their job goals. Management and co-workers were very helpful and friendly.Good place to work for a big company, but you only learn a small piece of the company. The people are fun and the environment is okay. Lots of overtime during quarter end, but overall was okayAllowed myself to have creative freedom in a relaxed atmosphere, with great management. AIG did the best to accommodate me for the high costs of living in the San Francisco Bay Area. Only downfall was being laid-off during company cutbacks from a job I truly enjoyed.Overall, I enjoyed my 10 years with AIG.  AIG chose to exit the Employer and Voluntary Group Benefits business and in doing so allowed them to align more closely with the company's organizational goals and vision.  As part of this strategic reorganization, my position as an Account Service Rep, along with hundreds of others, no longer fit in with the new direction AIG is currently undertaking.I enjoy working at AIG.  Awesome teamwork environment.  The work life balance is great.  The management style is very open and laid back.  The most enjoyable part of the job is finding great talent to join the organization.I really enjoyed my time at this company.  I was given the opportunity to learn many areas and had the chance to do all aspects of different positions from data entry, processing, scanning , mail sorting to applications.This was a good job for me to bridge my job loss from AT&T to retirement. I would recomment this company for other job applicants.Overall my experience at AIG was not good. Not clear who your reporting to. 3 changes in management in a 6 month period. Overwhelming tasks, Work/Life balance almost non existent.Head of Department resigned 3 months after I resigned. Good for a single person who is a workaholic.The management is very engaged with their staff and everyone works towards one goal...the customer.  This is a very professional environment with skilled individuals.Handled workers comp claims from beginning to end.  Was allowed to work from home 4 days a week.  Co-workers are very helpful.A typical day at work is a stressful one wondering when you are going to be laid off.  AIG is not a bad company and there is a lot to learn but Management has been concentrating more on the layoff of employees instead of making the employees happy and give them an incentive to stay with AIG.No raises are given.  Benefits are good but moral is not.  The day is like a sword hanging over your head wondering what time it will fall on your head.Could be a great company but it fails.  Different departments doing the same work in different fashions,  why not stream line and handle calls, disbursements and other transaction the say way among all department.  AIG does not value it's employees.enjoyed working as a scheduler but was working 3 jobs and could work the hours. It was too much to handle the hours. I called clients that had a retirement fund with the company and scheduled meetings with their adviser to go over their retirement goalsVery political , high turnover, employee gets burned. there's not too much advancement. stay there not long, can't comment on too much. Can this sight not force people to write review ?Great opportunity to meet people from all walks of life and different parts of the world.  Continued learning and sharing outlooks and outcomes of life experiences.","10,000+",New-York,New York,NY,2016-10-27T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/090f221b-0b9b-493d-8b2b-b5fdab4d28ca?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
