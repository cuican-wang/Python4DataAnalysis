74,2488.0,Data Scientist,Enigma,3.9,28.0,"It was a good company but it was not the type of work i was looking for.the hardiest part of the job was sweeping up every piece of hair like every 5 mins. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the costumers, and washing hair.You are responsible for people passing their driving test, so you have to think and talk a lot. And never fall asleep in this joblovely people to work with, good pay, good management and work ethic, learnt a lot while working here. busy company and very good at what they do.Open store, count the floatCheck customer orders and queriesaccept deliveries, input deliveries onto computer, and price up stock ready to go out.Keeping tabs on stock sold ready for another orderUpdating website on new stockInputting invoices and payments onto databaseCashing up and locking up storeHardest part was keeping my busy when there was no deliveriesMost enjoyable was the displays, inputting deliveries, and serving customers.Workday started at 10:30am where I would do door to door services as a representative of the british red cross while doing so I would learn good communication skills and was interacting with the public. My fellow co-workers were helpful when needed but management in the job was not very helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I got a chance to better my communication skills but the worst part was the long hours and the lack of care and communication throughout the management of the workplace.this has got to be the best work i have had since i have last school and from today because it takes skill to paint and gloss very tall and wide buildings at chesire oaks. I really did enjoy working with this company i had learnt so much from it and can hopefully bring me somewere in the future. It was very good money that i was earning with them for my age i couldnt of asked for anything better and would love to go back there again.we would start the day with going over were and what we were going to be doing always up beat everyone always happy looking forward to the day ahead. i learned communication skills how to talk to people face to face and work as part of a team the management were always asking if u needed anything they were always there for help and they would be out in the field just the same as us who worked for them never putting anyone down if anyone ever made mistakes they never pulled you up in front of everyone they were awsum and the co workers were brilliant as well we all worked as part of a team so would help each other out. the hardest part of the job was all the walking in all kinds of weather and the most enjoyable part of the job was the people i spoke to some not so nice but that was part of the job and i traveled more over scotland in that job than i ever did growing upi liked my time whilst working at enigma, there were a lot of young girls that used the store so i felt i could relate to them and help with clothes advise and picking out diffrent outfit options.I did work experience here and thoroughly enjoyed it. I worked the tills, dealt with the stock, priced items, helped customers buy items and advised customers when they asked me questions.Very sad that it was closed. I learned lots of knowledge and got experience about PCB boards.It is happy that I had a nice boss who gave me training and encouragement.I am able to work independently as well as in a team.I am pleasant and sociable.Always well presented.Communicate well with anyone on any level.I had to process data and put certain airplane parts in boxes.I had great colleagues to work with which made the day go by much faster.Got great experience in uploading products on Ecommerce sites/this was an enjoyable job. co-workers were great. job was fast working.*Un día normal es: Limpiar, acomodar prendas de percheros y mesas, atender al cliente.*Aprendí a desenvolverme mejor en mis tareas diarias.*Excelentes compañeros, muy unidos y organizados en todo.*La parte mas difícil para mi es cuando ingresa un cliente indeciso y se complica cerrar una venta.* Lo que mas me gusto fue haber obtenido una gran experiencia laboral.Un dia tipico normal, acomodar limpiar, atender al cliente trato de tanto yo y la otra empleada de sentirnos cómodos, aprendo mucho sobre como atender a un cliente, lo mas dificil es mucha tensión con el dueño muchas diferencias y de su parte cero consideración por mi esfuerzo.İş ortamı içindeki çalışanların sıcaklığı tam bir aile tablosu. Yöneticisinden mutfakta çalışanlara kadar herkes birbirine saygılı ve güler yüzlü.

75,2489.0,Data Scientist - US Customer Data Science,Amex,4.2,3200.0,"Amex was a growth opportunity in my career change from insurance to travel industry.  I enjoy working with the cardmembers the most.  I disagree about the management use of survey systems but I realize that is a part of the customer service world.The American Express Service Center (AESC) in Phoenix, AZ is a truly remarkable facility.  Having worked in private, public, and non-profit sectors, AESC has proven to have the strongest work culture I've seen in my career.  The company has fantastic work/life balance opportunities:  work from home, flexible schedules, onsite dental, onsite flu shots, onsite nurse/medical, onsite cafeteria, onsite massage, a break room with video games, TVs, and couches.  And yes - there are expectations to produce very high quality work - but this is accompanied by fantastic training and coaching.Jobs are being lost because the company rather save a dollar more and out source them to cheaper labor in India and Philippines. Customers are not happy and the company doesn't care about it, they rather save extra money, rather than listen to their customers. Which ultimately they will end up losing in the long run because of this decision making. They release employees who have put their hearts and souls into this company for many years, and they are just laying them off.I have worked at American Express on a full time basis for a few years. I would say overall it is a good company to work for.  Work-life balance is great depending on which group you are in.  Most groups allow you to work from home most Fridays.Compensation at American Express is not the best.  It's certainly not the worst.  But, I think American Express struggles to be competitive from a compensation point of view.Job security is not great here at the moment.  Layoffs are happening across the board and at all levels.  So, I would say proceed with caution.Overall, I have enjoyed my time here.I have been with American Express for 3 years now. I have learned a lot about the banking industry and how to help people in a calm manner.Unfortunately, I don't see room for advancement for me here. I was not fortunate enough to go to school for a degree and most positions, regardless of qualifications, require a degree.I enjoy working with people on a team, but I also enjoy being left to do my job, the way they I can do it.I enjoy being able to help clients when they are in a bad situation, it gives me a sense of satisfaction when they really appreciate the help I can provide.On the other side of that, there are some people you just can't please no matter the situation, so that is tough.They pay well, have fair benefits, good work life balance and attempt to create a positive culture. However, they are behind the times in product growth and frequently make bad decisions that effect the entire company. Every year, if not twice a year people wait with baited breathe to see if they will be one of the people getting axed in the current ""reorganizing"" round. The last round consisted of 10% of the entire company. Very shaky and unstable. You constantly feel insecure.Good on the job training opportunities, very light on any training that has cost associated to it. Performance based compensation, bonus and recognition programs for high performers. Standard benefits of medical, dental, 401K with 5% matching and vesting. Heavy contract staff augmentation on shore and off shore.Global Company that causes interference with work life balance.American Express pretty much left me in the dark most of the time. Very little communication about the job or who exactly cares. Most communication was via a team member whom I did not really answer to. They seemed quite disorganized cared little about my skillset or utilization of them. I often had no idea if my job was going to be dissolved due to transitions even though I was praised and had high marks as a top performer. Often 'other' teams handled issues with very little explanation as to why. Such teams may or may not respond to any communication attempts possibly passing the buck when contacted. Processes for handling specific 'areas' were typically inept at best and appeared frequently mishandled. They seemed very 'low-tech' which was the opposite of what my impression was before working for them.This strong US financial company is outsourcing jobs to India for customer servicing despite card member complaints. With the recent co-brand partner dissolutions with Jet Blue and Costco, American Express recently displaced nearly 220 customer service professionals from their Salt Lake City facility, with an offer to retain approximately 80 - 100 home based servicing positions only. It's a shame, as the jobs are needed to support our American workers, not to mention the US economy. In 2011 AMEX displaced nearly 300 New Account specialists from the SLC facility.  In 2015 nearly 100 of their Fraud specialists were also displaced.I worked in a center 9 years before transfering to Home Based Servicing. Working from.home sounds great... but its very lonely. Once you are at home their is very little opportunity for advancement and you are just stuck taking calls day after day with no end. It wears you down fast. I did enjoy that ability to drop and pick up hours easily with colleges. This made it simple to adjust my schedule with out using PD time. American Express is a great company but home based servicing was just not for me.Amex is a great company overall with nice people, but has become too slow and is unable to move quickly enough to be competitive.  Advancing in the company is difficult as greater value is place on planning events then actually deliver results.I actually love working for AMEX. The culture, leadership and opportunities for advancement are phenomenal. I worked my way up the corporate ladder and have not been disappointed. I have been given the opportunity to lead a team and work hand in hand with American Express' head of marketing/developmental teams out of Phoenix Arizona. Absolutely love this company.Amex is not only customer centric but also employee centric and the management will do it's best to develop you and your skills.They believe in maintaining a good work-life balance and will support your development. There is a lot to learn from this organization which will help you explore your capabilities.Great place to work following a structured environment.  The company believed in their mission and vision and give their employees hope for advancement and security.Good salariesGood benefitsTraining and developmentCareer pathswaps and cross trainingWinning Cultureteam buildingAmerican Express is a great place to get your foot in the door if you're interested in banking. It's fast paced which means things are always changing and you end up learning something new almost everyday.Great environment if you just want to plug in and get a job done.  If you want to make a difference, this is NOT the place for you.  Unless you are a VP (they are very top heavy in VPs by the way), you don't really have a say in what happens on a day to day basis.  The company is very vocal about peer reviews and surveys to make the working environment more appealing to all stages (entry-level up to senior management) of your career.American Express was a great place to work.  They care for their employees and have a good work life balance.  I really like the people I worked with.  American express tried to build a culture of team work.Work Life Balance. Great Work Schedule. Great Culture. Customer Oriented. Job Security. Future Forward Management StyleI worked here for several years and there just didn't seem to be much room for advancement. Many times they hired from outside of the company instead of promoting internal employees.as in any large company, there is a lot of politics and power play involved.  Working for a strong brand with very smart people is always a thrill.  great work life balance and love that they bring in speakers from different industries.","10,000+",New-York,New York,NY,2016-11-29T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/5a039fef-b00b-4126-be5a-f482f257e161?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=22,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Management changed during my tenure which is what led to my resignation.Job offers great benefits and gives most employees a great work/life balance. I would highly recommend this company to anyone.NSLIJ made me who I am today, the constant help for co-workers and colleges helping each other, motivating each other, being polite is what molded me to be the employee I am today, Now a days is very hard to find a job environment like that.This company is a fun and productive place to be. I have been working for this agencies for the past four years and have had wonderful experiences.A typical day consisted of meet and greet new hires and candidates.I learned the HR applicant tracking system. My coworkers were very helpful and friendly.The hardest part of the job was the environment.Great place to work but is not offering full time position. Co-workers are hardworking and pleasant and management is very helpful in educating their employees.Clock into work and read emails of the day ,check messages & begin to see patients, either individually therapy sessions or group therapy sessions. I've learned that I enjoyed working inpatient as opposed to an outpatient clinic setting. I've worked inpatient for many years and I am not used to micromanagement. My Social Work colleagues are experienced and experts in the field of Substance Abuse. The hardest part of the job were the hours, 1PM to 9PM 3 days a week & then switching gears into 9 to 5 midweek and on Fridays. Understaffed. Low moral of employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the patients, especially when you realize you've helped them to become well.A typical day at work included of: participating in meetings with interdisciplinary staff team, conducting an intake, conversing with social workers, RN's, MD's, psychologists, psychiatrists, nurse practitioners and MHC's. leading/co-leading or observing group therapy sessions on a variety of topics, conducting a private one-on-one therapy session, writing and formulating session notes from group and personal therapy as well as receiving supervision in a relaxed and no-pressure environment.Vocational Services is a wonderful department.Supervisors and staff are always willing to go above and beyond.Working in vocational services I have learned different skillsVery Busy, productive, under staffed.  My most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help patients.  I am a team player and love to assist Doctors during procedures and examinationsSince working at North Shore I've learned a different methods of talking and working with people. The team-work is amazing this the true meaning of team work. When i ask for help I actually receive it from my fellow co-workers. My patients are the best part of my job. A typical day for me is getting my patients ready for a relax evening after working so hard in therapy, taking temps, giving showers, just making sure my patients are as comfortable as possible.From intake to discharge the patient is given world class service, as the nurses are provided with world class education and leadership from management.During my years of service as a ward clerk I was able to apply and learn new skills.  Which gave me the opportunity to move on into other avenues within the North Shore Facility.Train by excellent teachers. Great thorough demonstration followed by repeat demonstration.some managers are to young and unexperienced  can feel ""less than""  un acknowledge most of the time. some floors are great team players.South Side Hospital is working within a community for a community.
