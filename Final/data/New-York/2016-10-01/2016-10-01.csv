140,2554.0,Data Analyst / Data Scientist,Rent The Runway,3.6,28.0,"Every one was friendly and very helpful with helping new employees.I learned how to do things such as drycleaning, machine operating, and spotting. Co workers are always efficient and on top of work. Hardest part is working a high amount of hours completing a high number of garment , almost 10,000 a day. but it's also fun and challenging. Most enjoyable part was the environment and people that I worked with.Associates are great. Upper management needs work. Prime example of a startup company that lost sight of the core values that made them.Awesome Culture.Very young company. Very calm environment. Can drink in the office.No dress code. Very free spirited. End of the month is always a headache but not a big deal.Coming into the position, you are trained on all aspects of the rules and guidelines of the company. This is strictly a customer service role. Unfortunately, the only growth within is to become a Senior customer communications associate (with a $1 raise). The pay is not enough for the 9 hour days and weekend shifts.The most enjoyable part of the job is the random perks and fun coworkers.working at rent the runway was an great opportunity for me. it was fast pace and i like that. they provided me with great hours and worked around my school schedule.Once management was changed, the culture shifted. There were a lot of dishonesty going on with the CEO causing a spiral affect in their Customer Insights Department.I enjoyed working here unfortunately there wasn't any open permanent positions at the time my contract expired. The staff was very open and kind. They're an awesome team to work with!A typical day at work includes documentation of all new merchandise, quality assurance, and last but not least, input of all new inventory into our warehouse management system.Lots of lifting, poor management, lots of employee turnover.  Overtime most days due to poor decision makingVery hard workI was able to learn how to dry clean garments. I had learned more information on how to wash clothing. So many things I experimented and experienced working are skills I still use today.One must have an extremely tough skin working in the corporate office at Rent The Runway. Thank goodness for wonderful co-workers who became friends and confidantes. Many times seeing their faces and getting to talk to them during lunch was the only thing to keep me going.the morning there were kinda busy, but died down after 10 amI learned that your pay hardly increasesco workers are very friendlythe hardiest part of the job was staying positive therethe most enjoyable was smoke breakCompany culture is very inclusive and everyone is easy-going, friendly and sociable. As it is still a relatively new company, management is sometimes confusing, but seems to be developing successfully.One must have an extremely tough skin working at any of the Rent The Runway stores.  Thank goodness for wonderful co-workers who became friends and confidantes.  Many times seeing their faces and getting to talk to them during lunch was the only thing to keep me going.  The combination of low inventory, extremely long wait times for dressing rooms and irate customers, it definitely took the toll on everyone.  Few things that need to change that would dramatically improve morale:- Please thoroughly TRAIN THE CUSTOMER SERVICE TEAM!! It is unacceptable and hurts us when CI tells customers over the phone the wrong things to get them off the phone (ie: telling customers wrong store hours, incorrect information about when their dress will arrive knowing that we cannot guarantee what van a dress will be on, saying that we carry all 65,000 dress in store when we only carry 1,000, etc.)- Please be more clear on the website explaining the ""walk in"" procedure, if you walk in without an appointment you will have to wait for a dressing room to open up you can't just pop in and immediately try on, dressing rooms are reserved for the clients who have paid for an appointment, too much confusion from walk ins who take their anger out on the employees- Management: Please have monthly events for the team to boost morale.  Dealing with a high stress job is emotionally taxing.  Please keep your promises when saying that we will have team outings (bowling, dinner boat cruises, karaoke, team dinners, etc.) and please be open to feedback from employees and do not bring outside drama/personal  more... matters into the job - we should not be subject to your anger over what happened with your boyfriend, friends, etc.The most enjoyable part was seeing my co-workers and learning a lot about myself and drawing out strength I didn't know I had.  lessI like the people I work with. We all work hard but the job is a little underpaid when it comes to how much work and energy we put it in.A good company to work for. The work environment is fast pace but an enjoyable work to go to. Enjoyable and fun co-workers, very friendly environment too.I worked as a store stylist for Rent the Runway. At first I was excited and thought I would really enjoy the work and in some ways that was right, however things took a bad turn. There is good and bad, the people I worked with are great, but the compensation is a joke. When they tell you you will make $40,000 a year or $20 an hour, run away because that's a lie. Trust me I'm saying this and my sales were some of the best in the country. You really cant move up in the company from retail to corporate, they don't hire from within and they don't promote. Rather than advancing stylist to senior stylists who had been at the retail location they hired outside stylists. What does that tell you? The business also needs SERIOUS work. There are a lot of issues with there never being enough merchandise to sell, dresses never arriving to customers and dresses arriving but being dirty or ripped. Which of course customers will yell at you for that, and when you complain about business practice nothing happens. If it's your first job its a good stepping stone, but if you are experienced and want a career go elsewhere. One of the worst markers of this company is that you could walk into their retail location right how and ask all the associates if they would quit on the spot given any other job offer and they would all say yes. Trust me I have asked.Amazing company with some of the best, most methodical people that I have ever worked with! Definitely a fun work environment to be a part of!Fun, cool place to work. However I didn't want to go another year a as a ""temp""The company is run like a sorority house and they have no clue about fashion. Do not leave a well established company to go here. They hire and fire irrationally.Morning consisted of processing returns for shipping (i.e. scanning, sorting and cleaning.) Afternoons were more chaotic with the majority of the day's shipments requiring assembling of orders, processing orders, organizing showrooms, communicating with center control from New York. During evenings, preparations for next day shipments, double checking inventory and managing damaged and problem orders. The work partition involved incoming, outgoing, and cleaning. However, many of us floated from divisions to speed up work flow. Hardest part would be the long hours of constant physical strain for 12h+ sometimes. Most enjoyable parts had to be the teamwork, break station with pool table, and helpful/accessible management team. Typically the personality constant of everyone was determined, work orientated however friendly, funny and approachable.",51 to 200,New-York,New York,NY,2016-10-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/be29c031-b6d5-4c4e-8718-666df6efe656?mescoid=1300087001001&jobPosition=23,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
141,2555.0,Senior Data Scientist - Verticals,Bloomberg,3.9,299.0,"I am very happy to run my own business of flower designs which is a very enjoyable and creative job. And I also enjoy making new friends through the working period.Bloomberg is a solid firm but lacks vertical movements for employees already employed there. Still overall a good place to workI learnt a lot in this company, good place for work ethics.Good Work cultureInnovativeGood place for team workShare information across companyTreat people fairlyProfessional growth is given prioritylinking between people groups and organizations is goodGood compensation and benefits. Great leadership by Mike Bloomberg. Very positive experience to be a part of this company. Many chances to relocate including overseas.Bloomberg is an excellent employer that provides great benefits and a healthy work environment. The office can become quite silent at times, but the atmosphere livens up often.Great place to work at. Everyone loves the free meals and snacks of course too. Great vacation to start at 4 weeks and superb health benefits. Very friendly teams open to new ideas and ways to improve on existing methods of going about daily operations. Would like to see them hire more contracted employees full time as there are several I interact with on a daily basis who have a great understanding of the business and go above and beyond every single day as well as have great knowledge of the terminal already.Project assignment with little to know guidance as to what the overall goal is. Temp work was misguided and length of project was cut short. We were notified at the last minute we were no longer needed.Benefits are the best of the best and internal mobility is available if you show your worth. In some departments a typical day is 8-5 or 9-6 but it depends where you work, some departments don't offer much work life balance. Co-workers are considerate and the ticketing systems are very useful once you wrap your head around it all. The most enjoyable part if how much programming is available to engage employees in productive thought provoking topics.Bloomberg manages a large and complex set of software for obtaining, analyzing, and disseminating financial information.They have a high degree of structure and process that software developers must adhere to. This is necessary, but it can also be overwhelming for some people.They have a ""people-oriented"" corporate culture.I enjoyed my entire time there. The people pay careful attention to ensuring that folks have appropriate training. The workforce environment is also positive and open, allowing folks to excel in their positions and work harder than they ever realized.Great health insuranceGood 401KGlobal OfficesGood co-workersGood Entry Level Free food including breakfastGood work life balance for the most partManagement is lacking big time at this firm. They have a severe disconnect for what it is like to work as a rep in Technical Operations and thus do not offer any type of support or career development to move on further with your career. The pay scale here is horrible and offers ZERO transparency on why external hire that are new to the company receive a higher salary than a individual who works in the same role and has been there for years.Very nice people here. The place was one of my favorite places to work. People there always go above and beyond to help each other and always being polite. I just wish I could of be there longer. Project over and you move on in life.Great place to get started in any position. Not for long term as stress levels will increase in time. Department managers are chosen internally and typically understand 15% of the departments functions..this forces any good long term employees to move on, thus losing a valuable resources for the company.Great first job. Learned a lot and had a great training program. Management can be secretive at times. Not much room for growth or upward mobility. Great co-workers and fun place to work.A typical day would be to monitor the queue for incoming break fix tickets. These tickets range from service impacting high severity to low priority infrastructure work and operational updates. I've learned a wide variety of skills as diagnosing hardware issues, troubleshooting connection/link down events and also uploading and analyzing core/log files. Management can come down on you for small things, but that is because of Bloomberg is a multi-billion dollar company with potentially millions of dollars at risk. The hardest part of the job is multi tasking and handling multiple issues at once.  Bloomberg has certainly helped with pressure.  The most enjoyable part of the job is learning.  You can learn a little bit of everything here. You can learn networking, storage, the various operating systems, troubleshooting, and much more if you are willing to put in the time.Bloomberg is a large global company. There is a lot of upward mobility and ability to move throughout the various departments. Also, it has a great training program.Very good company, cant think of anything negative to say about my experiences with them. Good pay, good location, good people.The work environment was challenging and intellectually interesting. I was a software developer for the FX (foreign exchange) group. The hours were rather long, but the learning experience was rewarding.Bloomberg is an excellent place to gain knowledge of the financial market. With their terminals, I was able to learn more about different industries and how they performed on a daily basis. While there, I worked on S&P 500 markets and various European markets. Data that I analyzed and corrected, would be updated in real-time to help provide an overall better trend analysis for clients.This is a privately held financial software, data, and media company that is headquartered in Midtown Manhattan, New York City","10,000+",New-York,New York,NY,2016-10-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/54ca878c-69e9-4834-96f8-e8f887eac26c?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
