177,2591.0,Data Scientist,Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield,4.0,305.0,"Excellent place to work especially for those whom have never been employed in the health insurance industry. I really enjoyed working here and meeting some incredibly intelligent people while contributing to the ongoing success of a 70-plus year old non-profit organization. The Blue Cross Blue Shield brand is well recognized.At Horizon BCBSNJ--similar to other licensees in the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association--there is a large faction of pessimistic individuals in leadership positions, holding on to antiquated business models and perceptons with white-knuckled grips.  As a result, it can be extremely challenging to present business case for, and then receive approvals  for abandoning the status quos--e.g., adopting more progressive, data-driven and primary intelligence-driven approaches to driving sales and marketing instead of relying on ""gut"" instincts and anecdotal stories.Worked in case management for 9 years.  Was micromanaged last 6 months there along with others with 9+ years invested in the company, felt like being picked on and weeded out.  Direct supervisor needed management skills in working with co-workersAnswered benefit questions for future and current customerMy co-workers were friendly and great to work with.Great pay.I learned to work well with everyone even irate customers.Horizon BCBS is an excellent place to work!!! The management team on up cared very much about their employees and work environment.It offer opportunity to learn more about the health insurance industry. My coworkers are very knowledgeable n we work great together as a team.Working within a team to meet a common goal was enjoyable whenever everyone completed their part.  The management only concern was how much money did they save the company by any means necessary.Worked in the call center where the work environment was fast paced, busy, and you had to stay on top of frequent changes in the healthcare market.  Co-workers were extremely helpful, but dealing with management can be challenging.  The hardest part of the job was staying on top of the changes, and the most enjoyable part was the ability to assist people in their time of need.I enjoyed working at Horizon BBSNJ it is a place you can grow if you apply yourself. Unfortunately the management can be more educated and willing to promote educated and well deserved staff.You will be able to advance your career working in this environment. Normal day at work for any employee who is considered work from home will exceed the 8 hour work day (typically 10-12 hours) and there will be weekends where you are playing catch up. Some of the programs do not have enough people working for them which makes your caseload much more difficult to balance with your home life.A typical day at work involves auditing programming and defect resolution consultations with Production Analysts. Verification of business and technical requirements as business liason. Evaluate prospective /new technical design implementation. Weekly inventory status meetings  with management. Provide monthly status reporting to senior level management. Reduce audit inventory by educating coders on best programming practices and identification of new, more efficient programming configurations.Productive environment, processing claims, management knowledgeable.  Co-workers helpful, always willing to help. Hard talking to irate customers.I worked there for over 23 years. The benefits & salary are great. They have a great fitness center, daycare, ATM, beautiful cafeteria, Starbucks, and great places to sit & eat. Oh, not to mention on site medical care (RN Practioner & Labcorp). There are many departments so you can move around.I have worked for this company for 10 years. I received 6 months worth of training and felt very prepared and confident when it was time to perform. The expectations can be a little more stringent than some other insurance companies. But you will be trained properly.Training is notoriously poor. Goals are unrealistic. Supervisors are allowed to bully staff without consequence. Managers do not know how to manage people.Horizon is a wonderful place to work. They are committed to providing superior health insurance, provided by top rate hospitals and physicians at the most affordable cost.Horizon fosters the idea of getting the problems solved and doesn't not believe in the idea of putting a bandage on a problem.  This is one of the many attributes of Horizon that I so appreciate.Great company!! You get to learn the ends and outs of insurance claims. However, I started as a temp employee and I felt that I was being taken advantage of. I was given numerous responsibilities and very low pay.Nice place to work. I enjoyed my time there. People are very friendly. nice work environment. I would recommend the company to anyone looking for a job in the healthcare insurance industry.Since this was my first job, I was able to learn a lot of skills that I think will help in the future. The support from my Team Lead and Manager helped ensure that I learned to do the right process(following process flows).Horizon is and extremely amazing company to work for. but the management isn't organized, they donot prioritize their employees.Prior to my involvement in my crime, I was a top employee with numerous highlights while working at Horizon. Almost all of my reviews were above reproach and with high regard from management and staff.I was supervisor/lead for the staff at wall NJ location and had a great experience while there. was looking forward to retiring from Horizon until my problems away from work happened.",,New-York,Newark,NJ,2016-02-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/698648c8-7fcc-4056-9176-fce8402ad728?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
