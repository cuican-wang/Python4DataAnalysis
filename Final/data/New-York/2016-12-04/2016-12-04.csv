29,2443.0,Quantitative Developer,Genesis10,4.0,27.0,"Genesis 10 is a Staffing Agency located in New York. I found it very difficult to deal with them because they would change their offer each time I spoke to them, I actually turned down the position because of this and three months later they had someone else from the company email me and see if I was still interested in the position. I told them I would take it for a certain salary and no changes.I went to work for Windstream Communication as an Analyst in the Engineering Department. I enjoyed every part of this job. I had to apply for permits for Right of Way Access in several different states. I worked with many different state and government agencies. In this position I worked as part of a team, where we would automatically jump in and help one another get caught up. We had to remain within company regulations of how quick we sent out the permit applications once they were submitted to us. Multitasking was most important, because there was always more than 10 to 15 projects to work on at the same time. Time management was important to meet deadlines. Most important follow-up was required to complete each project. I had very high stats for projects completed, because I was organized and kept my work area neat and organized at all times. The most enjoyable part of this job was working as a team. There was nobody that was trying to out do the next person. We were really a team working to accomplish a goal. The most difficult part of the job was getting the state and government agencies to return the permits in a timely manner. It required developing good relationships with  more... the State and Government Agencies Representatives to ensure the permits moved along  in their system. I highly respected the management, they all practiced what they preached by their actions.  lessTreated like adults and not micro-managed. Every now and then a little fun is thrown in. Overall a good place to work with friendly co-workers.Having worked as a consulting professional for most of my career, I have encountered varying support from the intermediary companies I found work through.  Some have been quite good, some have been so bad, I have refused to work for them and one has been the biggest mistake of my career.  That would be this company..Be warned if you choose to work for these people: the very moment you need them to have your back they will throw you under the bus.  This company is a wonderful company to work for.  They are always out to help their consults grow.  I have been on two assignments for them and can say they are a caring group of people that will do everything they can for their consultants.  They also care about their relationship with their partner/clients and work hard to keep the relationship strong.  I am proud to be a consultant for Genesis10.Working with my fellow group hand in hand and working with computers. Installing and removing old and replacing new computers. Learnt that I have progress in installing and replacing new computers. Management is fine. The co-workers are better workers to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job is removing and installing new computers. Do not have a hardest part of the job, it's just right for me and my school work.A nice place to work in a fast-paced Environment. Day-to-day responsibilities include supporting vendor managed clients, tracking requirements, submitting candidates, coordination and appointment/interview scheduling, placement/term paperwork, process improvement, timesheet and invoice issue resolution and coordinating consultant events and recognitionThis was a very good company to work for. This was a contract job on the weekends to do a PNC Bank refresh. This was a very good learning experience for me. We changed out all of the PC's, Printers, Cisco switches in different banks throughout Monroe County Michigan and Toledo, Ohio. I was second in command due to my experience with being a computer technician.this company taught me a lot about the porting of cell phone numbers worked well with every one. great hours to  work enjoyed not working any overtime that was offeredBeing my first full-time opportunity right out of college it was a great company. I worked with a lot a great people, and learned a lot of information that will be used doing my careerPeer groups were fun and energetic. Management team is flaky on every level. Beware, they have a marketing team out there writing all these great reviews.I have worked for Genesis 10 for 4 years and have always been treated with respect and honesty. Benefits could be better, but in this economy I really can't complain.Good people, fair and productive atmosphere. A youthful atmosphere with a variety of support and energetic people to make things happen.Genesis10 is a good company for individual contributors. Many teams are virtual so that is good in terms of work-life balance. The company has very little management. The people are the most enjoyable part of the job.G10 was my first professional job and the culture and people were both warm and welcoming. I learned so much within just my year there.Productive and non stressful workplace. Managers communicates and interacts well with employees and they do not micromanage.Nice small company environment. Great co-workers, people stay at their jobs for a number of years. Lots of flexibility as far as working remotely.A very comfortable office environment, laid back culture.A typical 40 hour weeks with no over-time. Management makes effort to provide a pleasant environment to work in. They hire good, experienced professional people.Facilitate meetings, capture key outcomes, project plan updates, weekly reports, and maintain System of Record. Analyze, forecast and implemented project closure.Worked on a project that was supposed to last 6 months, but lasted only 4.  Definitely a down side, they do not press their clients to honor contracts (but I guess that is industry standard).Management supported me during a wishy washy transition period, where client kept pushing back the start date.  Gen10 stepped up and bumped my rate slightly for the inconvenience, which I thought was fair.One big downside was mailing checks to 1099 C2C contractors.  If you were to do a survey in this market, most agencies delivered payments via Direct Deposit.  Hopefully, Gen10 will change.One last disappointment was that once it was determined that my last day was moved up two months, Gen10 didn't do anything noticeable to get me placed.  Their advice was to make sure I use other agencies as well.  I believe I performed admirably in my assignment, and this was the best advice they could offer.I hope they will read this critique as constructive criticism.  I thought they behaved in a professional manner through out, just wishing for more.Nothing really bad to say about this place....Managers could have been a bit better....But I would go back....Good company to work for.  Would work for them again.It is centrally located in Troy.Onboarding process is simple and well documented.Awesome co-workers.","1,001 to 5,000",New-York,NEW YORK,NY,2016-12-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/c0fafdb3-0c2f-4618-95d0-f67f96b78bdf?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
