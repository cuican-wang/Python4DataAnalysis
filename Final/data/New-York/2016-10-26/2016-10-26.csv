315,2729.0,Research Scientist,ObjectWin Technology,3.9,21.0,"I enjoyed the Placement/assignment that I got in Starwood Hotels, but I thought Objectwin could have Tried a lot harder to get me a New assignment when it Ended!!!My experience with ObjectWin has been very positive. Once placed in my contract position, ObjectWin has been hands off unless I have questions for them. They are prompt with replies. I do get weekly reminders to submit my timecard which I don't need, but the connection is nice. I do get health insurance benefits, but they are not great - a very high deductible. No vacation and no holiday pay.Good pay / hour.  401K 3% match.  No vacation.  Standard medical / dental.  All hiring and paperwork are handled remotely.  Most of the company is out of India.Joined as an Executive in Pre-Sales Department. Learnt a lot about the market. Very friendly staff and encouraging Managers. There is always a healthy competition among the employees.This place was my first to work in USA, I was quite worried about how I will learn and work there. But my supervisor was so patient and friendly, helped me in every step when I was in learning processs. The management was helpful as well, how ever like every place there were some areas which needed some attentions. The best part was I was given all the independence and resources I needed to resolve the issues. I loved working there every moment. Had wonderful and relaxing  lunch time, when we used to discuss the ways how to improve the policies as at that time my supervisor was working on make a HR Handbook.We had a bad experience with this company. They hired an employee and terminated him without giving any reason that too in a week. No compensation was provided. The company is extremely unprofessional, just a slaughter house.  They do not accept calls, they do not answer mails once they terminate the employee. If you are hired by ObjectWin, you are doomed!Watch out if you have to sign up for any contracts with them. They are sneaky. Not reliable! Another exploiting Indian company!They find you an assignment, once assignment ends they don't try to find you another assignment.  You call and you have to leave a message on vmail.  They never return your calls.  They don't  communicate.  Very unprofessional people.Participate in daily scrum meeting, share with the team what I've worked on the previous day and what I'll be working on today. See, what all the other team members are working on which includes other    developer, and SMEs. Making sure to update my status in Agile Mgr. and continue to work on my immediate assignments.Poor physical work environmentMany systems and procedures to learnManagement very hands offTerrible work conditionsSmall Consulting company and I had good experience considering where I was in my career at that pointObjectwin technologies works very hard to locate a place of work for potential employees. I never had any trouble with pay, taking off, emergencies, tc. Thex were always available and there to help meet my direct needs. I woukd reccomend this company.Great place to work. This is smaller company with unlimited potential to grow.Great people to work with, Everyone was really Friendly and supportiveCo workers were hard to work withDays use to start late and ended early.",,New-York,New York,NY,2016-10-26T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/03588204-fc88-4616-a9c6-a33a2dcf9595?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
