138,2552.0,Data Scientist,FactSet,3.8,45.0,"-Great entry level job-Consulting has three components:-Finance-Technology-Client Service-Very good company with strong career growth-Long hours and fast paced work, do everything your clients demandFactSet is a great place to start your career if you want to get into finance but you're not sure where to start. Excellent exposure to industry professionals.Consultant role is more of a technology position than finance. You will be working with clients to help with research/problem solving from a technology standpoint and not from a strategic finance position.Good place for just after school settlement. The outdated technology in some groups make it dangerous to stick for a long time. Make a leap in 2-3 years.I liked the technical opportunities that were presented to me.  However, management did not have much of a presence.  There was no clear direction in regards to project management, which lent itself to ambiguity and inefficiency.fun and young environment good management. i enjoy.. free drinks. management is nice and co workers are easy to get along withPeople is expected to work 60-70 hours a week even though the company only pays 40 hours per week. Managers utilizes a micro-managing and fault-finding approach. Oncall rotation is not a real ""On call."" This is a poor excuse to make the engineers execute changes during the weekend and after hours during the week. Your weekend work is equal to 16-20 extra hours at least. Company does not pay overtime. Employees are not recognized for their extra efforts instead, they are treated as objects that belongs to them, therefore, you have to do what I want you to do.  There are not words to express the bullying approach used by managers to their employees.Consulting for FactSet Research Systems was my first job out of college and was the perfect gateway into the working world.  The company entrusted me with responsibility from day one and taught me how to be a working professional.  They provided me with growth opportunities and a great work life balance.My true passion was to become an investment professional and the knowledge I gained from working at FactSet opened the door for me to become one.Consulting role is merely customer-service and troubleshooting, with little or no true consultative, strategic work whatsoever.  Additionally, organizational claims to be 'flat' and entrepreneurial, yet management is not clear about professional development or expectations whilst there is virtually no autonomous work that outside of what you're micromanaged on.I liked the company, but unless you were a software engineer, you did not get all the great perks FactSet has to offer. Longer mandatory hours, no overtime pay, terrible management. Good coworkers but most leave, its a starter job, not something long term.Overall good place to work. You are given interesting and ever-changing projects.The New York City office is in a good location and benefits are comparable to the industry standard!Great benefits and free lunch coupled with a good opportunity to network with financial experts in the field. Consultants aren't compensated for the amount of work required, and are understaffed. There is a high turnover and employees are expected to pick up the slack without any assistance from management.Mid level managers seem disconnected and are more preoccupied with their personal lives often doing little to help their subordinates.I worked at FactSet for 15+ years.  Was fiercely loyal, deflected competitors overtures for years. I worked up through several positions but not management, and did fairly well. One Friday this March, I was let go. I was told it was a reevaluation of company priorities,  future investment,  etc.  Reality was it was just cost cutting. I had grown too old and expensive,  and recent process improvements I had made to my product line basically ""improved"" myself out of a job.   I could have easily moved to another position.  When I questioned the reason for termination, noting the above, the director of product development actually sat there with a cocky grin on his face and said no can do.   Squirming to keep from wetting himself,  the coward jumped up and left me with the HR rep to finish it off.  No ""I'm sorry, this is hard in me as well"" or any of that nonsense.  I blame myself for being so loyal to a company for so long and not moving on sooner.  I had been so good at my job that I allowed myself to get pigeonholed into such a narrow role that I'm finding it almost impossible to convert into a new position. So in some regards, when I lose my house and my family is evicted,  I will place the blame on FactSet.  But on the flip side,  this experience has taught me to never be that loyal to another firm again.  I will only be focused on the job at hand, and will be constantly looking for that next position. I would strongly recommend anyone considering a non-engineering role at FactSet look elsewhere and be rewarded for your efforts.After having done lot's of code for myself during my PhD, I learned at Factset how to be part of a software engineer team. We had strict coding style, code review, shared library between project. Typical day was lot's of coding from 9am to 7pm. Atmosphere was not so good because interesting projects were occasional and everybody was fighting to be on it.FactSet is a great place to work as a Consultant if you are interested in Investment Management or Investment Banking. Be aware that the first 6 months are spent on the support desk where you are essentially customer service for all their clients. The job requires someone to be technical savvy and good with excel. If you are good with computers and are okay with troubleshooting computer based problems then you should consider this position.My typical day at Factset consists of troubleshooting client connectivity issues over the help desk line. I've learned alot when it comes to technology and pleasing the customer. Management in general is good and they care about their employees. My co-workers are all team oriented and we all have the common goal in mind, which is to ensure customer satisfaction. The hardest part of my job would be the physical demands placed on me away from my desk. The most enjoyable part of my job is when a client is satisfied with my troubleshooting steps to get them working again.I was employee 250 when I started working at FactSet as a Trainer for internal and external clients. When I left the company there were over 10,000 employees. FactSet prides itself on rewarding it's employees for working hard and brining solutions to the table.Management is great. Your work is seen and noticed. Company culture is awesome. Very limited politics. Most people are friendly and willing to help. Lot of perks of a big company, travel, food, stability. The work life balance is one of the best you can get even for software engineers. The job can require strong concentration in areas where one's pedigree might not be focused, advancement is possible if the right people are approached with the correct words. Management is often involved in special high-profile projects.I enjoyed the work everyday at Factset. The most hardest part of the job is to attend the meetings and bridge calls late nights with US team, as i was placed in India. Working with co-workers is knowledgeable. Got some appreciation emails from online team.FactSet was a face paced environment that challenged it's employees to learn something new every day and work hard at fulfilling their job requirements.A great working environment with collaborative culture.  Good work life balance.  Creative environment that embraces self starters.","5,001 to 10,000",New-York,New York,NY,2016-10-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/59555eef-da7e-407e-86a1-398df6c64e9f?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
