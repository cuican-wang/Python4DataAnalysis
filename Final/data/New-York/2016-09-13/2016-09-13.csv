146,2560.0,Data Scientist,"Avon Products, Inc.",3.9,2900.0,"I would keep this up as a side job, however I'm looking to gain more work experience. Avon is a great company to work for, they offer plenty of support on, ways to generate customers, while showing you how to mantain your customer base. They have several events around the US, that allows networking and good fun.The sucess of your business with Avon relies on you, your sales will be slow at times,but if you stick with it great things will happen for you.Working at Avon has been a great experience. It mostly involves sales by catalog so I was able to start out at a young age helping my  mom with her sales. Now I'm able to sale as a independent representative and the products basically sell themselves. All it takes is showing the catalogs to people and promoting the right products based on their likes and personalities.It is a very good job if you have motivation and determination to be your own boss. It takes a lot of time and effort. The advancement benefits are good and they constantly have new incentives for their employees.They move you around a lot. They change there mind one minute from the next as to what or how you were doing something. They expect some people to give 200 percent while they give people help that don't even try. Poor pay and every year benefits decreased.I enjoyed working for this big incorporation. i had my own time's to work. I enjoyed selling and but most of all show my previous customer's the new things they had new to buy.Great company and amazing benefits!  I can work on my time around my schedule and the relationships formed while meeting new people are ones that last a lifetime!ex time, family oriented, match 401k, must take vacation, remote work/work from home, equipment and hardware upgraded frequently, free lectures and education, access to gym, awesome health care, easy quick expense reimbursement, birthday offA typical day is unknown.  It could be 6 hours or it could be 12, depending on orders and staffing.  I learned and grew a lot in my position and gained useful experience.  Some management seem to have their own agenda and once you fall from their graces you are pretty much out the door. It's a different culture and if you have problems adjusting to the culture you won't do well.   Loved my co-workers and I enjoyed the company benefits.a typical day at work for me would be to go in have our morning meeting and get put in what ever area that needs help for the day im usually on the shipping dock but can preform well in every part of the building i have learned alot about avon from where the order begins to where it ends and everything in between management at avon is awesome their all understanding and treat you like family not a worker my co workers for the most part are good to work with but every company has the lazy ones but most of them work hard and the new ones always approach me for ideas on things because most of the guys are set in there ways and bull headed but we all get along great the most enjoyable part of the day is when we get a yellow light for a line thats backed up cuz every one goes nuts over it and acts crazy and yells about it but when you go in the trailer most times it takes 15 minutes to clear so they get all worked up for nothingI loved working for Avon, but honestly not too many people are interested in Avon as they use to be. Products are Amazing and good quality. I would only recommend working for Avon if you're looking to make a little extra money not a huge amount of money.The job was fine but you had to have  alot of coustomers to make a profit or  you didn't really get a salaryI was a sales representative for Avon. I sold it for 7 years. I learned how to manage my own business. I managed my advertising, customers, and the inventory that they bought. I didn't have to deal with co-workers, I just had to make sure I submitted my orders each week. The hardest part of selling Avon was when I quit selling it I didn't get to see my customers anymore. The most enjoyable part was being able to see my customers and help them get the products that they ordered.Worked at Avon over 18 years.  It was a great family environment, fast-paced.  Great management team.  Co-workers were always helpful and willing to do what it takes to get the job done.  Most difficult part of the job was trying to figure out why so many layoffs, then re-hiring of people for the same positions a few months later.Avon Products has a great job culture and work life balance, however, the compensation and benefits are really low and job security is questionable.Being an Avon sales representative was great position to have. It allowed me to become my own boss for my first time. Support from my family has made my life a lot easier to cope with when order taking became too tough to handle.Great people to work with, gave tips on how to approach people making sales door to door and easy to follow tips on hosting successful book shows.Receiving calls, booking shows, making sales through social media or phone calls. Patience, understanding, and compromise. Management was supportive and connected with co-workers frequently to track progress. Mainly self involvement on making sales.Hardest part was going door to door passing out catalogs and booking shows. Be your own boss, set your own hours.-High exposure to top management;-Good environment to work;-ownership and accountability of your responsibilities;-Challenges;My day would begin at 7:00 am with meetings and travel to the district. Then I would begin meeting with representatives. Training on sales, recruiting, leadership, new rep meetings, sales meetings. Selling the benefit of  becoming a representative and helping them build a profitable business for themselves. The hardest part of the job is getting the representatives to be involved and working with you so that you can help them be successful. They are independent so they earn their own paycheck not paid by the company. Keeping new representatives engaged so they can see the benefit of owning their own business. The most enjoyable part was watching those that succeeded and knowing that I was able to teach them something to help with that success.A typical day at work would be collecting inventory and organizing spaces for products. Some days I was able to help with transactions and sale a few products to people.    I was able to learn how to collect inventory and properly keep organization.   The management was very nice. She was easy and a joy to work with.    I had no co-workers for the job.    The hardest part of this job was to make sales, because there was not much of clientele.     the most enjoyable part of my job was keeping things organized. I am a very organized person already and it is sometimes very relaxing.it was a really good place to work  the benefits were outstanding  and the job pay was really outstanding  you would go in every morning and you would know what you had to do that day  in contracts you printed out the contracts that avon representatives had filled out  and scanned and deal with any problems in a timely manner.  All the ontracts received overnight had been completed by noon that day.  The management was very good, they were supportive  and gave you supervision if you needed it.  All of the co-workers were very professional.  To me there was no hard part of the job  except when the system would go down  and you would have to wait for the system to come up.  I enjoyed working with the representatives.","10,000+",New-York,New York,NY,2016-09-13T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/bd047196-f522-4027-860a-684b80bc0c8c?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=29,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
