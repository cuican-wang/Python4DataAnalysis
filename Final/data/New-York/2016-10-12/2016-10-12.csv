23,2437.0,Ecologist,NYC Parks Dept,4.1,7.0,"My view was great being with the NYC part department , great , respectable, hard working employees, work with people on hours that fit your needs, I wish I was able to stay at this job but it was or for temporary.Not a long term career. Agency does not back up its officers when they try to enforce park rules and laws. Very political and difficult to advance. It is Mandatory to work all weekends as well. Not worth it for the salary they pay.Employers are rude and disrespectful. Mean and degrading. The supervisors treat employees bad. Failing parks make it hard for jtp's to work. Needs new management.cleaned parks by picking up litter, cleaning bathrooms, removing graffiti, changing garbage bags, raking leaves, painting, keeping an eye out for needles and disposing it in a proper manner.  I learned to work with others as a team and  how to communicate in a proper manner. management was great always kept us in check and made sure everyone got to take part in every work activity that was provided. the most enjoyable part of working with the parks department was being able to see the children play at a clean and safe park. knowing that we are there to keep the parks clean for them n the smiles they had on there face made me happy.I really enjoyed working for the parks dept. there was plenty room for advancement the only down side was having to work with people that didn't want to work.I loved working at Rockaway. The people I worked with were great. We became more of a family then coworkers. I could never forget working in Rockaway. Working at the beach has taught me the meaning of team work. There 's always a possibility of people struggling to come back to shore, being intoxicated, being compliant, etc. You really need to focus and be able to go at any given moment.It waas fun everyday. I learned to document any situation that needed to be written down etc. My co waorkers were great and teh hardest pat of the job was leaving when it was so much fun!",,New-York,Manhattan,NY,2016-10-12T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/ecologist-job-manhattan-ny-us-173855096.aspx?mescoid=1900261001001&jobPosition=13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
