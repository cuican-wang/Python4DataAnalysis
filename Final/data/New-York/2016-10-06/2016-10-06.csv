Management was fair and worked towards continuous development of their employees.Given plenty of empowerment within the company, thought the performance appraisal process is flawed.  Also not enough involvement from upper managementnever seem to get to what you planned on, daily challenges to find answers and better processes, fun people to work with, plenty of coffee, on site cafeteriaA great place to work and wonderful working conditions. I learned a lot about security and obtained a number of certificates. The hardest part of job was the hours worked.very little interaction with senior mgmt., uncertain of job or career path. Do best to make co worker feel positive and they are serving a purposeLike most large organizations, National Grid balances their business needs (keeping the power on) with their need to prepare for the future.  As a company, they have many of the same challenges that every other organization has - not enough resources to get everything accomplished but the commitment of the employees is outstanding for the majority.  In crisis - storms, power outages, there is none better.This is a company where you can excel at many career paths as long as you take the ownership to improve your skills attitudes and beliefs.Expect the Best!An okay atmosphere for work, great people, but little compensation for workers. Involves long hours of receiving calls from customers. Job is great as you interact with customers of all types, some very angry, others just need help. A good and calm temperament is requiredExcellent place to work. Safety and reliability are alway number one. Spent 26 years with this great company where I learned so much about the electrical industry.Taking incoming calls, setting up dates for service to be turned on or off depending. Assisting customers explaining the breakdown of their account. Coworkers were alright. Training was very informative. Hardest part was reading the meter cards.National Grid is a good company to work for that provides employees with a good work to life balance. The compensation and benefits are on par with other large organization and management staff is easy to work with.Managers are really helpful and informative. Plenty of technical training and the benefits are very good. Plenty of on the job experience and an outstanding opportunity for growth.Wonderful environment. Call center and employee services and benefits resolution. Many levels of human resources.  Corporate support and training.  Would have loved to have stayed in the TDC.Decent company to work for. Reorganization reduced management workforce by 20%. Corporate politics can be frustrating at times but overall good company.","10,000+",New-York,Brooklyn,NY,2016-10-06T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/9d56d9c5-1cfe-4869-abf0-fa9f065600f1?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=18,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

499,2913.0,CHEMIST (AIR/RESPONSE),Alion Science and Technology,3.6,103.0,"Day-to-day tasks are to just do what the government client wants. There is no room for suggestions or creative ideas whether for process, product, or office moral. There is no room for even anonymous suggestions and/or a human resources person to talk to on site.The company itself is average. The office culture is mundane at best.I was a telework employee, but everything at Alion made me feel part of the team.  All support staff were easy to get in touch with and any issues, when they did arise, were addressed quickly.Alion had a great health insurance plan for their employees. Unfortunately, over the 3 yrs. I worked their, out of pocket cost got higher and the match for putting away for retire went away, due to poor management in the corporate headquarters.Employees treated like cattle.  All profits go into the pockets of the highly compensated 10%.  Questionable use of govt funding for company overhead expenses.The company is now owned by a financial firm solely focused on revenue and low bids to win contracts.  Often salaries and benefits of current employees are reduced in order to stay employed on a new contract award.Overall, I would say that this job taught me how to stay on task, even when I did not enjoy the work every day.A typical work day changed on a daily basis. It was the same type of work, but the parts that we worked on changed every couple of days. We assisted in building a radio system to place on the back of military vehicles. There were around 200 pieces that fit on each pallet so we were tasked with putting them together. The job tested my motivation but I was able to push through. My co-workers were good people that were pretty easy to work with. We did not develop any outside of work relationship. The hardest part of the job was doing the same thing about 200 times per day but I learned to persevere. The most enjoyable part of the day was that the day-to-day duties changed.A great working environment full of intelligent professionals. But company leadership has made many bad choices over years, and this has led to hard times in the current industry environment. Two bad quarters and many lost recompetes have led to several hundred employees leaving the company, many involuntarily. Key management has been stripped out so critical thought leadership needed to grow the company is non-existant. Wait a couple of years before considering a job at Alion. They need to turn their ship around first.I have been employed at this company for 11 years there is great opportunity for advancement I have been promoted 3 times in those 11 years, I started off as a temp for 1 year then hired permanently for the past 10 years nothing but growth there are some management who gave me the ability to learn new things I love everything about my position and manager. The most enjoyable thing about working at Alion is the ability to advance and free educational classes.Always a different challenge everyday. Work with amazing people. Personally rewarding due to the fact that we were able to help soldiers regarding fuel, and safety. Cutting edge of technology.Management sometimes makes it feel more like a staffing agency.  High turnover has been constant, management is more concerned with filling a billet for a low rate than anything else.Provided onsite SETA support to Air Force Acquisition.  So, there was limited direct interaction with the company.  Role involved navigating three ISR programs through the Programming, Planning, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) cycle for obtaining funding for these programs.Management does not value or reward employees with a strong work ethic. The most enjoyable part of the job was lunch break and going home for the day.  Management also stressed ""teamwork"", but would allow certain employees to get paid for doing nothing all day.It pays the Bills- Other than that, I would avoid Alion at all costs.  Zero benefits and an imaginary advancement plan.  Not sure if this is twenty words or not.Collaborative work environment with both internal teams and Government customer. Excelling place to gain leadership skills and expertise in your domain.The best part of the job was my contract work for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The work was interesting and provided for the acquisition of new techniques in my profession.It's a good place to get your foot in the door. My coworkers are kind, personable people who gp the extra mile to mentor juniors like myself. The Navy programs that I work on serve as challenging, interesting work.Everyone was focused on customer satisfaction, so there was good teamwork to do the job well.  Upper level management ran the ship aground.A typical day at work was very busy doing multiple tasks throughout the day.   I was in charge of running the facility at every level which I started doing back in 2013 and learned quite a bit on how everything is run.  Management was very supportive and the co-workers were very pleasant and easy to work with.The most enjoyable part of the job is working with highly skilled people in their respective fields.  Co-workers are top notch and create a very enjoyable work environment.Although an ""Alion employee,"" this is in name only for pay, benefits, and tax purposes only.  Am really an employee of the contract.  When the contract ends, employment with Alion ends.  No opportunity for advancement.  Have never discussed future growth opportunities in Alion with any Alion leadership.  Lost over $40,000 when Alion stock tanked and Alion was bought at $1.25 per share.  Think Enron.  Pay frozen for past 2+ years.  Cut out of government award fee bonus.  Would not recommend Alion as a place for employment unless it's the only option until find something better.The company has complex business models and is quite challenging in many aspects. The most enjoyable part of the job are the people, everyone seems very nice.","1,001 to 5,000",New-York,Edison EPA Reg 2,NJ,2016-10-06T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/c60f5529-0933-4446-bba0-05624efb1f30?mescoid=1900259001001&jobPosition=34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
