30,2444.0,Statistician: Pharmaceutical Marketing Analytics,QuintilesIMS,3.9,491.0,"Great people, management is not always aware of how processes, transition, and the clinical model and career pathway workIts like home, like a family you never want to leave.  I am only a temporary associate who works on the Medicaid team.  I am stationed at my own desk, with very little micro managing. Self starter and goal oriented, to get the job done.Keeping up with tested slides and properly storing them. Organizing and keeping up with lab equipment was very important as well as carrying many medical files and placing them in alphabetical order. Great environment to work in, hardest part was carefully placing the slides in their storage area having to be extremely careful. Easiest job I would say keeping up with the records and maintaining the lab equipment and assisting others.Working at Quintiles was a great experience.  They take care of their employees and help them further their careers by offering opportunities to grow and advancement.They are slow to promote but very understanding with life events and giving a good balance of work to family life. Depending on your role you work at your own pace to produce results.Pros: Work/life balance, benefits, vacation, and compensation. Cons: High turn over rate within engineering department.  Uncertainty with senior level management.A company with lots of opportunity to do different work projects, however it does not afford those opportunities to those lacking experience in specific jobs, therefore not a great place for growth.Good company to work for. There are several opportunities to learn and grow. The staff is very knowledgeable and willing to help. There are many opportunities for your hard work to be recognized.Very good company to work for. The employees work very well together in getting the projects done on time with a very hard working teaming atmosphere.A typical work day was pretty med range as far as stress levels go and the work loads are not to bad. You go in, wait for a delivery truck to drop off your work load and then you began your work which takes about 2 1/2 - 4 hours and you are on your feet the whole time.I learned better time management and to speak up if I had an ideal that may better the business. Nothing good to say about the Management team so I won't speak on it. Co-workers are like family. The hardest part of the job was trying to remember all of the protocols to are continently being changed every few weeks. Second half of the work day which was light and some of the positive people I worked with was the most enjoyable part of the job.technology. work flexible.(telecommute). Client visits. Vendor services.Great name in information industry, new tools and products.largest vendor industry.The job I was hired for didn't have long to really take off.  After a few weeks, my boss learned that his new boss was transferring the project we were working on, over seas and the whole team would need to look elsewhere for a position - either within Quintiles or outside of Quintiles.Management treated employees with respect and listened to ideas from the field.  They truly cared about the individual as well as the companies bottom line.I loved working with Quintiles. A very diverse place to work with good benefits. Salary was good, and the employee gym.  Everyone was excited to work for this companyGood Company, good co-workers environment was fast paced . Quntiles was employee oriented and had very good field managers.Quintiles is a great place to work.Competitive wages.Competitive insurance.Many opportunities for upward mobility.Quintiles provides a stable environment within an evolving and changing market.Develop recruitment strategies and an enrollment plan with the investigator and site staff to meet recruitment goals in coordination with the Global Monitoring Plan project recruitment plan and conducts evaluation, initiation, routine monitoring and close out visits at each assigned study site, as outlined in the Global Monitoring Plan.I have enjoyed my time here. I like the people I work with and am grateful Quintiles gave me my first job. Management decisions have led to the closing of many jobs.I was working on Special Projects that would bring a new product to the marketplace based on the results.  1000 people were involved in this study.what I did at this company was data entry.  I data entry all of there clinical study data in the system. I learn how to work serval study at one time.Strong background in project management, technical training, and support.

32,2446.0,Scientist Pharmacovigilance,"Daiichi Sankyo, Inc.",3.8,110.0,"Very good to work and the manager, business users are very co-operative to work with. They maintain the professional ethics and balanced expectation.Not convinced that another reorganization is going to happen.  Management is terrible otherwise the culture is good.DSI does not pay the industry average in compensation.  The health insurance benefits are expensive and not the industry averageGreat working environment, great pay, great benefits, wonderful people to work with. There are not too many hard parts, I love the company.  The most enjoyable would have to be the team I work with.7 years ago, this was an exciting and growing company with great benefits and competitive compensation.  I learned a lot from my co-workers, my teammate who I provided back-up support to the VP  of Supply Chain and Technical Operations, providing executive support and putting in overtime as needed.  I learned the Purchasing process and was elected to be in charge of all the ordering of equipment, vendors and consultants at our new Bethlehem Plant in Pennsylvania, which was a challenging but rewarding project.  I learned how to support the Japanese culture, which was interesting.  I took a class on how to support the Japanese culture.how to greet the Japanese professionally.The unfortunate part, was the company went through some changes over the past few years, losing our CEO, and resulting in multiple layoffs.  This made it hard to advance within the company, morale was low and there was no job security.great culture, work/life balance for full time employees. plenty of hands on experience. The only thing is contract work is for a long period of time.  Contractors are not really involved as they could be or should be in the company overall activities if they've been there over a year.DSI is really the place where I learned the most about Payroll.  The manager who hired me saw the value of finding and keeping exceptional employees.I learned the ins-and-outs of Payroll Administration, including the role-out of a new system.  I have also come to realize that without all team members sharing a common vision, motivation and production...The best part of the job was interacting with all of the different people, from 48 states and Puerto Rico.  A very diverse employee population.  I learned so much from so many different people, personally and professionally.typical office environment with little advancement opportunities. Decent work/life balance. Decent cafeteria. Companies is not stable and constantly does layoffs.The company was a wonderful place to work for many years.  In the last 5 years there has been tremendous change and turnover in upper management.  It was very stressful with yearly/ bi-yearly layoffs.  The company has just gone through a total restructuring.It is not the same company I worked for, so I don't know how it currently is to work for.For years, DSI was a positive environment to work in because they stressed a team environment.Traveled 12-14 overnights per month for 4 1/2 years.  My pay was very dependent on what my co-workers did in their role of sales representatives as we were all paid on the same products, just with different weightings.My direct managers were both fantastic!!  Couldn't have asked for better district managers!Hardest part of the job was being gone from my family and young child all the time.Most enjoyable part of the job was learning about the disease states, how the pharmaceuticals I sold helped people, and meeting so many wonderful providers, nurses, and other people across Montana and Wyoming!Amazing employeesamazing culturegood compensationi have nothing negative to say about Daiichi Sankyo, it has been a great foot in the door to the pharmaceutical industryExcellent products with excellent leadership from the top down.  Despite losing patent rights on their blockbuster anti hypertensive Benicar, they have acquired products and made themselves a viable and strong force going forward once Benicar expires.  Excellent training and excellent benefits!Loved working here.  Loved my coworkers and Managers.  Culture at the Parsippany location was enjoyable.  Ability to telecommute when weather is bad or children are home sick.My workday consisted of meeting deadlines; managing staff and trouble shooting. Upper management was very supportive of ideas. This company provided superior benefitsCo workers functioned as a team, supporting each other and working togetherMeeting daily deadlines was a must! Payroll can never be late.Most enjoyable part of my job was seeing results from organized preparation and execution. But most important was working with a dedicated staff.Currently transitioning in the United States. Awaiting product approvals in 2018-19. Large geographies, limited products and coverage.  New upper management leading US efforts.a typical day at work would be to talk to Life Insurance agents. I learnt a great deal of people management skills in short time. i also created relationship with Life insurance agents and assigned my agents of Auto and Home division to make product sales.DSI offered a competitive salary with good benefits in the market of pharmaceutical sales. They stood out in the type and quality of training received prior to entering the field as well as continued support and accessibility to resources in the home office. My partners are top notch individuals with a strong work ethic. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the changes in the managed care and healthcare reform as it effects our efforts.Great place to work with wonderful people. I consider my job to be a ""home-like"" enviornment with competitive benefits. My present supervisor is stellar and I consider myself blessed to have such a long career in the same department for 6+ years. The most enjoyable part of my job are the problem solving efforts and the interaction with people.Overall not a bad place to work, typical day includes; selling benefits to doctors on certain products for certain patient types, setting up business lunches and presentations, managing inventories in offices, and of course a lot of driving. If you don't enjoy speaking, selling or a high pressure management structure I wouldn't recommend this job to you. However if you enjoy competition, and don't mind the stress, this job can be enjoyable. The management in this company will put INCREDIBLE amounts of pressure on you to win quickly, this could be a good thing or bad depending on how you handle stressful situations, in can crush you or make you stronger depending on your personality type. Your coworkers are usually great, competition is fierce but friendly and generally people are willing to help you. If you are looking for an entry level pharma job this company can be a great test job to see if the industry is for you, it may not be a long term solution however as layoffs seem to happen every 2 years or so.Nothing to say about DSI.  If they had not had a restructure and handled it poorly, I would have stayed.Company was good and culture was good until they partnered with AZ on a bad contract.Daiichi originally started out as a great company, however many changes made in the last couple of years has lead to many employees leaving the company for better opportunities.  Many of the decisions made do not seem to be well thought out.  already submitted a review about this wonderful company. Ruch culture, great benefits, and work life balance. Promotes empployees from within and values their employees.","10,000+",New-York,Edison,NJ,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/7cf1e49e-a399-4147-ac19-94c4dd9f4212?mescoid=1900254001001&jobPosition=13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Teamwork is excellent.I needed a job while I was in school. It was a great place to work. My only critique was that no matter how hard I worked, they didn't make a hard enough effort to keep me as a perm instead of just a temp.This job is not woman friendly unless you accommodate them, they also operate on a prison clique mentality.They use reward bad behavior and celebrate bad choices that have even lead to death ask about their handling of a Christmas event ,  not at all a good working environmentBoth the ICU and hospital strongly support and encourage professional growth.  Strong employee appreciation and job satisfaction.  A culture that promotes superb patient care.Environmental service department has a good starting rate.

Happy to come to work everyday and motivated as well. Great placeThis was one of my first jobs out of college, so I wasn't making much money as an analyst. However, we were able to take grad school classes at a discount, which was really great.good group to work with and knowledgeable about processes.  management changed, however, still maintained focus on science and operations.  great group.Before they were bought out they were a decent company to work for. Not organized, HR was slow in getting back to you about anything. More like a small mom and pop organization.I have grown as an individual since I started working here, co-workers are fun to be around and very helpful. There is always room for growth and expansion, the job itself is very manageable.typical day at this job taking patient vitals and preparing them for examination from the doctor. good days and bad days but I always kept a smile on my face because I know most people don't like coming to the doctor. So many different people from different cultures. my co-workers was awesome always a good day.NYU Langone was a fast past working environment where deadlines needed to be met immediately. I worked in the finance department at this company. I inputed data, worked proficiently using Microsoft Office applications and setting up routine computer procedures to resolve simple software/hardware problems, accessing emails, electronic records and other basic office support software. Some of my employers were difficult to work with however I've always been able to separate personal from business.  Although I may not have agreed with someones process I pride myself on being a good teammate to get a job done.NYU Langone Medical Center is an excellent place to work. The staff is kind, hardworking, and dedicated to exceptional patient care.Typical day of work starts by reading emails and prioritizing your daily task. Prep faculty meetings for each course sessions with follow ups. Weekly meeting with deans and management. Review educational courses with directors.  Contact vendors and speakers for special events and training.  Collect all data and educational materials needed for the Inter-Clerkship courses.  The hardest part of the job was to get all the educators, directors, deans and management to agree to a specific educational course for the clerkship. It was a horrible battle of brains and egos. Best part of the job was my co-workers who supported me. It was a family type bond that kept me going.i love working there, the staff and doctors are great and so are the patients. its just awesome overall. there is short to no breaks and always be on your toes because it gets really busyI have worked at NYU Medical Center in Radiation Oncology for 14 years.  I was trained on the job in all aspects of clinical work and QA.  I passed my board exams and have continued to grow in all areas of clinical and research.  I have developed departmental policies and procedures.  On a daily basis, I manage the HDR program.  I strive to make the department more organized and efficient.Been here now 8 years love it. Very friendly, loving place to be an work. Over all exciting place to work wonderful staff, loving nurses and Dr's. Nyu one of the best hospitals in NYCWorking for NYU Langone Medical Center was the beginning to my exceptional potential in Finance. I started my career as an Financial Analyst Associate working with the analysis and invoicing of federal and non-federal grants. I managed and submitted invoices to the project coordinator for six clinical research departments. I worked closely with the manager and analyst to assure accuracy and timely execution of documentation and expenditures for quarterly, monthly or annually invoicing of expenditures for payment. I submitted over thirty invoices monthly following all policies and procedures of the authorization submitted from the administrator for NIH funding. I created journal entries in the general ledger for transferring of fund information. I reconciled expenses that hit after the project period and recorded transaction on the next invoice submission. I worked very closely to all teams assisting with information that they may not be able to acquire because of there obligations to finishing financial reports. I learned a lot from being pro active; now I am able to work autonomously which lessens micro management when completing tasks. I complied documentation for the A-133 and all three years we  exceptional with the reports as a team and organization.I really love this per diem job. I enjoy doing IV's and teaching new floor nurses who are just learning to do IVs when the opportunity comes up. There is great teamwork amongst the nurses on the Vascular Access Team and that makes it always a pleasant day there.I love working here but I would like to see more opportunitied to grow.Its a small hospital, the environment is freindly and not as hectic as other hospitals. We have great management, freindly co-workers, and I enjoy the fact that I get off fairly early each day.This was a great experience. Professional work environment. Multiple work sites available for per diem shifts.i am still signed with this company and will return if i ever live in NY again.NYU Langone Medical Center is one of the best places to work.  I enjoyed my time there. And I will gladly go back.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the culture of the company.  People stay there for over 45 years there.Great management, great perks, room for advancement. Healthcare team works well together with the common goal of patient care in mind. Nurses are treated well, they're encouraged to further their education and are pushed to do better and better. Lots of support provided. Salary is great for manhattan living.-Great team -Wonderful work-life balance-Flexible hours-Flexible scheduling-Get to choose department-Great co-volunteersI really do not think that after spending all this time on your site I should be made to write you a story or review on a company. I don't want to do that. I object to being funneled into your market research.maybe it has to do with where you are placed, but my employers office was bought by NYULMC in november, and since then it brought nothing but chaos. E-mails weren't answered in a timely fashion, questions were never answered. i waited about 8 months for the site manager to hand me rules for medical records. everything is unorganized and chaotic. there is favoritsm and BULLYING. i felt very uncomfortable as to how i was spoken to.  One office manager felt like she had something against me and was always after me. i wouldn't mind working for NYU, but the faculty group practice where i was, was all over the place, and i would NEVER go back there.","10,000+",New-York,New York,NY,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/ab789861-f2cd-45da-99f0-1dd7135e7147?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

However, advancement opportunities are available seemingly only in specific departments.Great people, culture, compensation. The dual business model of generics and branded products has provided stability during the industries ups and downs.very quick paced environment, great people, great opportunities and great pay. They offer great benefits and compensation depending on what shift you work. Great leadership as well. The company has a bright future.Not a good place for bluecollar workers. Always under pressure to perform and always worried about losing your job. Management is too concerned about their own survival to be concerned about their direct reports. However there are quite a few nice people there, but as the saying goes, ""nice people finish last"".Very good work environment. Not sure about job everyday. Family environment.Overall very good work place. Management very good and good benefits. Co-workers very helpful.The company has great benefit for yourslef and your family. It was a little strict but it was becuase everything has to be in people ready.Teva Pharmaceuticals is a great place to work.  Good work life balance.  Accurate balance between base salary and bonus.  Management team that considers sales force when making decisions.I was appalled by the culture. Falsification of documentation was a daily occurrence. SOPs and approved process rarely followed. Compliance and patient safety was an afterthought. Hired as a ""GMP Specialist"", but quickly found out GMP was not at all a priority. Tried to address it with management and HR. Big mistake on both counts.Very good company to work for. The work load is very reasonable. Management do change usually, however it is just titles, the people stay the same. Great coworkers, the environment is not at all toxic.most enjoyable part of the job is the team is very good at being international, a global company feels much smaller due to weekly meetings.The leadership at Teva has grown ever more evil over the last few years - there really is no other word for it.  The HR department in the US is run by clowns who were fired from their previous companies.  The corporate headquarters in Israel wants to get its hands in the daily business more and more, even though they don't understand American tax, compliance, or operations.  They continue to cut headcount so that they can keep investors happy.  That's great if you're an investor, but it's terrible if you're an employee there.  You will be required to carry your iPhone everywhere and respond to emails immediately, doesn't matter if you're at a funeral or if it's Christmas you're going to suck it up if you want to keep your job.  The pay and benefits are amazing which is why most people stay there because the compensation is difficult to match.  But make no mistake, you are selling your soul and your health if you stay there.  If you get an interview, be sure to ask how many US employees have committed suicide in the last year, and how many have had heart attacks, or stress related illnesses.  Do yourself a favor and run away from that place as fast and as far as you can.it was a good company to work at and gain valuable experience in the pharmaceutical industry. The hours were good and the compensation was good.Horrible experience interviewing......manager from PA wanted to prove something and was visciously trying to degrade me during our meeting.  Asked such irrelevant questions should have reported her....this place not worth the culture.....very bad wrap.  Manager wasn't even professionally dressed.  Glad I ended the interview abruptly...lolTEVA is a top pharmaceutical company and treats their employees the way a top pharmaceutical company should.  Going to work was a delight and compensation was on par with most major pharma companies.Changed managers 4 or 5 times while I was there. No security.  Morale of the employees and many leaders at a very low. Pay is low with very little raise each year, benefits OK. Appreciation is not shown often. The work is not hard but full attention is necessary to eliminate costly mistakes, which makes it stressful.I've been with this company for about 2 1/2 years. Since the beginning I have learned a lot about pharmaceutical medications, FDA regulations, and mostly safety. This company's main concern is their employees safety. This specific plant in Utah is still growing and has the potential to grow bigger. TEVA is a huge worldwide company and is very successful being one of the top producers of generic medicine, which means job security. As the company grows there is new regulations, new rules and new processes but that comes with every growing company.Teva Pharmaceuticals is a great company with great benefits. Employees stay there for years and still walk around with a bright smile on their faces.  Interaction among everyone is encourages and appreciated.  Working at Teva has allowed me to learn the importance of being even more detailed and achievable person.I work hard daily to ensure all duties and task have been completed in a timely manner. The location is great. The people are great and the benefits are awesome. They care about their employees.No chance for advancement,cheated out of raises each year,90% of managers don't know the job and lean on employees to pull their weight.No training program whatsoever.They make you sign off on computer based Sops and barely give you a chance to read them.I ran products several years without being signed off on anything.The only time they worry about following rules and plant cleanliness is when there is company coming.Supervisors and Leads sign off stuff without even checking it and are too lazy to gown up and go in the rooms to check stuff.Wonder how the FDA would like that!There are many valid reasons for the high CNE turnover rate as I will outline below:1) Integrity/ Teva values: They love to talk about it at meetings and in communications; but in practice, integrity is sorely lacking among the program manager and others in upper management. You often see a sugary sweet persona on the outside, but underhanded and deceitful behaviors in practice. Inauthentic and robotic interactions are the norm. Integrity comes naturally to the CNEs in the program, and in general is part of the genetic make-up of true nurses.It is the management that does not practice what they preach in terms of integrity and Teva values.,2) Advancement: Many highly qualified CNEs are groomed for management positions but are then overlooked for promotions when positions become available. Long-time Teva employees with Sales and Marketing backgrounds are selected over well-qualified nurses to manage CNE teams.3) Sales people managing clinical staff: Why are managers with absolutely no healthcare or clinical experience/background allowed to observe and/or participate in patient trainings and interfere with the sacred patient/nurse dynamic?  This is out of their element and they are not qualified to participate in any way.4) Common sense is nowhere to be found. If you have a brain and like to use it, think twice before you sign on because your ideas are not appreciated or welcomed.5) Poor communication: Things change all the time but new information does not always make it to everyone who needs to know about it. Processes are not enforced uniformly.","10,000+",New-York,Elizabeth,NJ,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/9dd2240c-282d-4b04-9642-8e50a68a2ae0?mescoid=1900259001001&jobPosition=14,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

356,2770.0,"Instrumentation Chemist, Fairfield, NJ",SGS,3.7,288.0,"This is a company that puts the well been of its employees first.The site I work at was on 8th street location in Deer Park, Tx and the Assistant Manager wanted me gone from the jump. I started as a Contract worker to Dow Chemical in Bayport, Tx which was a horrible experience. The Operators there ran the show and if they wanted you gone they would make it difficult for you. Or they will make it their business to get your Fired. The Lab Manager at SGS was fair but I feel like she was oblivious of what was going on and her Assistant Manager at the 8th Street location in Deer Park was manipulating her to take her position. I was let go because of what someone else say. A fair investigation with both parties were not conducted. I realize by past experiences with this company it was the planned. I eventually was able to received my Unemployment benefits.I'm enjoying my time working for SGS. I performed various ASTM methods on various petroleum products. I trained fellow employees in the proper techniques of various ASTM methods. I've had the cooperation of supervisors reporting results to clients and have built good relationships with clients and fellow employees.However, of late, we have lost half our staff to better opportunities. I have decided it is time for me to pursue better employment opportunities also after 9 years with SGS.I learned after working at SGS for a few years that the company really cares nothing about their employees. They will work you to death if you let them and they want you to feel grateful that you have a job. You won't get paid enough for amount of work you have to do. Managers and employees are allowed to talk to people horribly and never have any repercussions.  Every administrative process is tedious, repetitive and ridiculous. It takes a room full of people talking through jobs to get them invoiced because the process is lengthy and the instructions given to you can be interpreted in so many different ways. I've never seen a company have so many errors with invoicing in my life. The building I worked in had so many OSHA violations; wasps and mosquitos flying in the kitchen and offices, leaky windows causing mold and mildew on the carpets. The air conditioner never worked; in the winter the temperature in the office was 50 degrees. These things were reported and nothing was done by management because they could never get approval from corporate to spend money and fix the problems. The health benefits are astronomically expensive for employees.  Stay away!Although SGS is a multinational corporation, compensation and benefits weren't similar to engineering like companies I've worked before.I tried to take a certification class that SGS itself offers to external clients. The discount for being an employee was way less that I expected and they would discount from my salary the time I was 'off-work' :'(Very demanding career as you sample coal from trains, barges, stockpiles and mining pits. Great way to start out of highschool to learn basics on working in real world. Very dirty and dusty at times as you crush and prepare coal for lab testing.SGS is the world's leading inspection, verification, testing and certification company. They provide lots of training to staffs, with high efficiency.if you are looking for a low end job then this is place for you. if you want a real job keep looking. they cant even take right amount of taxes out your pay!! new training program is laughable. computer and phone system are outdated. there is no advancement. they pay new hires more than people who have been there for several years. you dont even have own desk. so if you wanted to make up hours you cant.starting pay is way above what you can find anywhere else they have good benefits, your 401 starts just after 90 days some companies it starts after 1 yearIt was like working with family. We all worked as a team and cared for one another. Productivity, learning and integerity was the overall goal. I would work there again anytime they needed me. Best Job I ever had.SGS North America is a good company overall to work with. As long as you know your role and do a good job, they will notice.  The co-workers are great and that's what I like most.  Right now there are some managerial changes, so it's difficult to say what's in store, but I think it's headed in the right direction. Work-life balance could be improved a bit more and sometimes dealing with Corporate can be tedious.  Overall, if you put the time and effort in, and willing to learn....SGS is a good company to be at!It was great to begin with, but the culture changed. I retired from there. My job went from tech support to sales in addition to the tech side. They had very little regard for their employees, due to the amount of folks looking for a position of any sort.While working for SGS I learned a lot and had a lot of opportunity to learn. I enjoyed working with most of my co-workers and enjoyed the early schedule. But the Management was a joke. They treat their employees extremely poorly and are very much based off of favoritism. The site manager was horrible to deal with and cannot personally run a lot of the equipment.Poor management. No adequate training performed. Stressful work environment. Poor communication between management and staff. Used to be a great place to work until SGS took over.SGS is all about the bottom line.  Promises were made when they bought Accutest Labs. and nothing has been done. They plan on closing more labs.The company took care of their employees. Safety of their employees was top priority. As long as you did your job the way it was required to be done, no one hassled you. Provided you with your entire uniform except boots.no rain outs, how to work as a team, management team good, good people to work with. Walking threw mud when it rains. a complete work day.During my two years at SGS I acquired new knowledge in the developmental side of the automotive industry. The company offered outstanding benefits, including a 401K and accumulating vacation time. I met some wonderful people and had the opportunity to work side by side with engineers from all over the country. Overall i enjoyed my co-workers and the duties of the job. Unfortunately management had poor communication between themselves and the employees which led to mistakes. When mistakes were made an unforgiving, unprofessional response was gave to employees, which led to there high turnover rate. If clear direction was provided and treatment of the employees by management was improved, this would have been a life long career.This position is a very similar to my last review. The hours dedicated to on the road and in the office are the same . The exposure to clients is a very important aspect of this job.I work in the Deer Park lab for 5 yrs. I work my tail off to move up but the lab manager was all about favoritism.  If she didn't like u she made it known to everyone. She is a condescending mean woman and   will treat you miserably. The other staff are no better or just follow along even if they disagree with her.  And if u try and go to HR they don't do much to help you feel comfortable. The raises are only given based on how much you can such up rather than performance. Also everyone is always in your business. Nothing u do goes unseen by someone.Decent Job, I've had a lot worse.  i was a loader, tank trucks and railcars.  Very procedure driven company.  Safety was always top priority.  Good entry job for plant work.","1,001 to 5,000",New-York,Fairfield,NJ,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/a795703d-757d-49ab-9344-f2103d24db25?mescoid=1900259001001&jobPosition=31,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

493,2907.0,Medical Science Liaison/Sr MSL,Mallinckrodt,3.4,56.0,"I have been working at Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals full-time about one year. Company is old and big, I have lot of to learn.My job is checking form, fit and function. I found those jobs I checked were designed by competent people. When I found an over-site, they were most often agreeable to comply.To many changes that are not beneficial to run a successful operation, they have created a very stressful environment to work in, to far to travel to everydayday started out with changing into your uniform, going to the board to see what blending room you are working in and seeing where they were with the blend. it was a great place to work. the hardest part of the job was the lifting and dumping of drums and other ingredientsA company with poor management and no direction . Like a concentration camp with pay . No job security . You can be fired for the tiniest thing . Management has no grasp of reality , they just want what they want . People leave and whoever is left must take up the slack.I learned to work as a groupThe management and supervisors we're helpfulThe co workers we're like familyThe hardest thing was looking at the tiny pills coming down the lineand being on your feet all dayCompany is changing its focus and moving away from the longer term research to put most resources on product extensions.  If you are not part of that focus update your resume and start looking.I always have had fun at my job and have made great relationships with my clients and co-workers. I have been very successful.- Creative problem solving.- Technical trouble shooting.- Encourage creativity in work environment.- Leading group discussions.I have thoroughly enjoyed my R&D colleagues and the work challenges put forth over the last several years with complex drug product matrices for extended release and abuse deterrence. Some belaboring challenges come with bureaucracy of controlled substance products. Unfortunately, recent upper management is now more focused on short-term high-profit limited market drug products obtained through acquisitions rather than on long-term and sustainable investment in R&D for new internal products.After having had the opportunity to experience Questcor and the feeling that the Specialist in the field that provided the customer facing were of great importance, its been very difficult to understand the direction and the focus of Mallinckrodt.  I'm unsure if they undserstand the value of 1 patient and the impact that Acthar and the role that it plays within the MS Franchise.I'm proud of the fact that for 3 years I never missed a quota and I finished each year within the top 5 of the Neurology Sales (ARD) Team.  The southern Nevada market has grown from a 100,00K market to more than 13 million yearly.Management is still in transition. It's not the same with the new management.  A lot of the original people are jumping ship because the culture is changing.Downsized with 150+ reps and managers on a phone call.  Had been there 7 months.  They made us buy cars one month before terminating  all of us.  Some of the reps had just gotten out of training the week before.hard to review, the company is changing very fast.  I am not sure what a  typical day there is because each lab is different, I think you need to check back in a couple of years to see if it's still here or if maybe it merged with another company.Being a part of the data management group at Mallinckrodt for 13 years was very rewarding.  I had wonderful co-workers within clinical data management as well as other functions in clinical affairs.As a production superintendent I am responsible for overseeing the manufacturing of three main production lines.  Operations require a collaborative and strong work ethic with my staff as well as with internal support groups.  The team is heavily production orientated with a strong understanding of safety and quality.   Along with being production orientated, I lead the team in championing cost savings and process efficiency drivers.I typically have a project to work on.  I develop experiments to conduct and transfer the final process to manufacturing to validate.  I then follow the production data to compare results from the changes made.the pay,benefits, and vacation time is really good. Most of the people where great to work with. I disagreed with the cutbacks so after 23 years I leftI worked for mallkinckrodt for 9years I was laid off on sept 5 2014 I was grateful to work for mallinckrodt for 9 years.Good company and  great people.Good productsGood Tech support.Good benefits.Field service based from home. Did all travel and scheduling arrangements.Did field service on xray equipment in hospitals, too much travel","1,001 to 5,000",New-York,New York,NY,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/b030de91-b41a-4e45-adee-9f02e94ce231?mescoid=1900254001001&jobPosition=28,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
