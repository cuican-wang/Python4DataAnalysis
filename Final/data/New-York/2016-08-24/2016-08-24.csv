151,2565.0,"Senior Manager, Data Scientist",Diageo,4.1,293.0,"Diageo was the first office job I had after graduating high school so it was defiantly a good learning experience for me. Even though it was a temp assignment I got to learn how to work with other on a very professional level. The team made me feel right at home and taught me more computer skills than I did in school which was very thoughtful and helpful for me. They really wanted to me do well in life and that's what motivated me to work hard to get a higher positive.This company is under investigation by the SEC for channel stuffing. The CEO needs to go to reset the business as it is a slave to delivering for wall street at the expense of growing brands. Management has all been home grown and lacks any ability to motivate or think of the result of the team over the result of the individualOverall great company with great benefits and employee perks.  Fast- paced environment that celebrates success and employee accomplishments.  Great place for growing families.  Flexible hours, work from home options, and summer hours Fridays year around in the Norwalk office.There is always something going on in the background and you cannot rely on job security.The people are nice but it can sometimes feel like high school with cliques and gossipingOverall, the culture is good as they generally allow you to be somewhat flexible with work hours and locations and it's almost an unwritten rule that nobody really works FridaysI Have work for Diageo for 14 years and 8 months to be exact.I had an excellent manager who help me be  a stronger leader.I learned alot from her and other managers within company.There were some challenges with scanners malfunctioning,short staffed during are busy times.Finding a way to keep things moveingI had a great team to work with. learn alot of things from them.And was able to install my knowledge and  skills in them.Diageo is a family oriented company and has been a fun place to work.Management positions are very political. Be prepared to suck up if you want to get anywhere.If you disagree with your Line Manager you probably are in for a rough time.Unlike other promoting jobs they give you your schedule ahead of time and supply you with everything you must need and know before a shoing unlike some of the other promoting companies out there. They pay for gas and hotel if needed.Diageo is definitely a good place to work. Young but experienced team makes it much easier. It was a pleasure going to the office and enjoy the good atmosphere with your peers.I loved this Job. It was one of the best jobs I had. The co workers were great. Management so what sucks but The benefits were great. I recommend working for this company.Amazing leading brands in the industry, that look really good in your resume.HR does a good job recruiting brilliant people, unfortunately, they don't last, either from a re-org or they leave.Diageo is a good place to work for and fun products. but the yearly re-org stressed people out and lost talented employee.Fun place to work. Boys club exists as with most other corporate organizations. Overall great experience. No matched 401k.worked here for years had some slow times but was always compensated for time missed. well paid and awesome at recognizing our hard work.Diageo is a great place to work and grow.  They give you any chance that you want to develop with their company.  They provide various training as well.Diageo is a place to grow and develop skills by providing the learning tools and opportunity with people who are willing to help.I was Proud to work with the People,the Machines & the Product. There was a feeling of Pride to make she a fine finished Product I know the end user could enjoy. We all worked together. From Upper Management to label inspector.I usually try to arrive at least half hr to an hr early to get settled in by reading my Holy Scriptures and eating a snack. i always try to get a lead on what were doing that day and what is our goals for the day. speak to all co workers.The hardest part of the job is not being busy it makes time go slow, And my most enjoyable part of the job is whatever we accomplished or achieved that day did we break some kind of a record or something because its all history and should be written or kept a record of......Overall great place to work. There are a lot of perks including excellent pay and social environment. They hire top candidates and have very aggressive brand plans, so you will have an opportunity to grow as a professional. However, it's very competitive and management value clones (""yes sir"" type people). There is no room to be authentic or creative. Too much energy to deal with the corporate politics, and there's a reorg every year or so.Best strategy- work here for 2-3 years, learn a lot and go to another CPG. You will get a higher title, more respect, less stress, but salary may not change.I started as a LP and was promoted to Warehouse last spring. I learned a lot from the operators and warehouse employees. I wasn't a fan of the micro managing and the inept HR department that didn't help me when a manager was messing with me while I was in probation. He told me that he was timing me while I was in trailers. I guess safety wasn't important at that time. The Union didn't help either. All in all I loved working with the OTMs, and it was mostly a good experience.Very enjoyable companyCulture was inviting and openChange was often acceptedWork-life balance respectedGreat company to work forThe best part of my job was being able to work with minimal supervision along side of a great crew.  The worst part was when the machinery would break down, and sometimes red tape and politics caused delay in resolution.  I am grateful to have been awarded the opportunity to learn more and more each day.","10,000+",New-York,New York City,NY,2016-08-24T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/75c12b06-0a5a-4e89-8346-1208672df328?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
295,2709.0,Sr Analytical Chemist,L'Oreal,4.1,1200.0,"I had many duties at L'OrealI worked in the Homologation and Compatibility labs helping in many aspects.Co-workers were always of immediate assistance and guide.Several extra activities were carried on during the work days which made the place a funny and stimulating second home.L'Oreal was a very family orientated place to work at. It was a great working environment and they were also very friendly.My typical day at work would be face paced, hands on, and cautious. Everyday there was always something new to learn. My coworkers were very friendly and handy. The most enjoyable part of the job was that i got to experience making beauty products for women/men and making them feel better about themselves.A typical day at work is to meet, greet and engage each customer. Ask about their concerns or questions, if any. My Job is to assist each customer with their desired product as well as introduce and market new products to them.Management is fully structured and organized at L'Oréal.  Co-workers are very supportive and act as a collective unit. The best part of the job is, it forces me to challenge myself to be a better employee each day. Another great thing I like about his job is, I get the opportunity to try new products first hand before the public.Was an excellent experience. I saw the world and worked with amazing people. I enjoyed working for L'Oreal until I witnessed hair product technologies being shared between the brands. I felt that brand identity and proprietary technology had been sacrificed for their bigger picture.You work diligently for what you get and what you get is good. No complaints except I had around 30 comp days due me when I left. No time to take them. Lots of work. You would be happy to get a 6 month project off your plate because the plate was over-flowing. No time to celebrate or feel a sense of accomplishment for the amazing work you did. Otherwise...no complaints. Excellent work environment and amazing people in the organization as well as the clients that loved the brand. Had more fun than not...perhaps thats why I didn't take the comp days due me. Just saying'...Very good company with a lot of benefits, and they give away a lot of extra incentives just for working their. The only thing that i did like  was the pay raise was not fair. If the pay raise was better then that would help.My recent experience in Packaging, Replenishment, Stocking, and Full Case has been an opportunity to learn the mission of the distribution center in providing customer products to meet their demands in deadline.Typical day at work involved SAP interaction and excel reporting and macro creation. Most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with, and the biggest challenge was facilitating the necessary answers I needed from co-workersPoor management.Good Benefits and trainingsCan only advance if you are in with higher ups.Promotions happen to fast and under influence of high turnover.Not professional.•	Managed the global project ‘ERGO ATTITUDE’ •	Analyzed the ergonomics of 18 workstations•	Presented the results to the CIO The Active Cosmetics Division brands•	Supervised three working group of 5 employees each•	Coordinated actions' plan for the reduction of the ergonomic risk•	Reduced 25% risk of ergonomic injuriesgood place to work, met a lot of people. big numbers place so very few fun days. good money but they trap you there with the money they start you out at. didn't care for managementhave to work multi taskinglearned a lot about retail, sales and operationlearned how to handle people, adjust and get a long with diff peopleenjoy on learning new thingsAs a Full Time Key Holder I have learned a lot and I am constantly given new material to learn.My boos set me up with great tools and advice so that I am more confident to carry out my job and excel even further.I got to work right below a director of the company. I had one major job and would do other little tasks that my boss asked me to do. The major task was a three month project in which I was designing a new system. Gave me a different experience than I have had before.Typical day at work is starting off with a groupmeeting and finding out what machine you will be working on. You could be working a 8 or 12 hour shift depending on the job. You really won't have any problems with co-workers if you keep to yourself.There is allot of gossiping going around so keep your personal life to yourself. Management is ok but sometimes do not know what goes on around the work place to make it a better enviorment. If your machine is broken down or multiple you could be sent home. Depending on how long the machines are able to be fixed you could be out of a job for weeks with no pay.I've learned the diversity of the company.The most enjoyable part of the job is that they ensure that you have career advancement and flexibility at work.There´s always something new to learn everyday.  The diversity of culture makes the work environment a good place to work.A very fast-paced work environment which requires you to be very flexible and ready to resolve any issues that may arise. Great learning experience.For the most part nice people too work with. Good day off plan. A bit of dislike for short notice; of overtime. Safety was preached not always practiced.Job Culture is great. Everyone is nice and most are willing to help.  Depending on the department pretty good work/life balance.L'Oreal became is one of world's largest beauty company with32 global brands , came we say no more with such name recognition","10,000+",New-York,Clark,NJ,2016-08-24T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/d9a66376-58d4-41de-9d2d-57a423b4d582?mescoid=1900259001001&jobPosition=4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
