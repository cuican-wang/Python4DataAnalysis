A variety of work projects all with different challenges.The department I was in did not provide enough opportunities for advancement.  The management was mostly concerned on what you could do for them to further their career.Koch Industries values employees highly- training them in new skills and enabling them to suceed.I started working for Koch at one of their manufacturing plants in Salt Lake City in 1998 and worked at the location for 2 1/2 years. I was immediatedly treated like family. I enjoyed my job and co-workers very much. If I needed extra help, I could hire temp workers whenever needed. I learned a great deal from this position, especially about teamwork and recognizing and appreciating hard work. When my husband's job moved us to Houston, Koch was very accommodating in helping me find another job with Koch in Houston in their natual gas trading division. This was a corporate environment and quite different from my previous position but I was welcomed warmly by management and was made to feel very comfortable in my new role. I remained there for 2 years before accepting a job closer to home.Strong corporate culture/values, normal working hours, overtime paid if worked, excellent medical and 401K benefits, generous paid vacation and sick time, Fair and considerate treatment of all employees.",,New-York,NEW YORK,NY,2016-09-14T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/26dc9775-0702-472b-a860-13a23e48ad5a?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=28,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
