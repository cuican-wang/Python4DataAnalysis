6,2420.0,Data Scientist,Bed Bath and Beyond,3.7,2300.0,"Its not a difficult job. Retail in general is not really difficult. Customer service values are top priority. This is a great job for friendly motivated sociable people.My general impression of most of my coworkers is either young and lazy or old and stuck.My oppinion of managers is that most of my managers are alright.The hardest part of the job is dealing with the occasional rude customers. Honestly it's no big deal in general but no one likes to be disrespected.The most enjoyable part... I can't say i particularly enjoy any part of the job in all honesty. I do enjoy a handful of my coworkers though.Job was good. However limited opportunities for increase.  Hard worker and results are obvious but not able to see results through pay.  Thanks in advance for your consideration.Working at Bed Bath & Beyond was a positive experience. Besides them not being able to work with my school schedule, it contained a positive group of people along with a good system of management.A typical day at Bed Bath & Beyond was busy. the Management was great a very skilled. My coworkers were definitely team players. The hardest part was stocking. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people.Great managers that will fight for you and help you out when you need it. Always a fun day at work. They are your managers yet treat you like you are a person and not a number.This job was very accommodating with your schedule and management was very positive. Bed Bath and Beyond puts the customer first and managers insisted we help customers over doing freight and stocking the shelves. Typically I would answer phone calls, help customers find products, and in most cases we would help customers compare product descriptions and prices to help them make a purchase. When we weren't busy helping customers we worked on stocking shelves, and organizing inventory. A big part of this job was to make online sales, also known as ""Beyonds"". In order to do this, approaching customers was key, and from there you had to identify their needs and if it wasn't available in the store you could influence them to order it in store. This helped the stores numbers and it also put you in a sales scenario, in which you could develop your sales strategy. The job didn't offer commission, but it did help you when you received your performance review. This job has a great environment and I also liked that it had holidays off and the company would often buy food from local restaurants for the employees.nice place to work positive environment good learning experience systems are old but they make it work management is nice co workers are great peopleIts a good company to be with. People will love the company when they join. People are good and cooperative. You wont be disappointed after joining.The typical day involved a lot of stocking and facing mingled with helping customers learn to read the back of product boxes.Everyone was relaxed and seems to enjoy the daily toil.The day that I be working it's usually fast paced dayCustomers always rightThey willing to help you outThe co-worker are awesomeBe there on time all the timeThe customersThis is a very friendly place to work. I have enjoyed helping customers find what they are looking for. The hours are flexible and as long as you show effort, the managers will work with you for any requests you have of them.Tight knit group of employees focused on service, great place to work, always something to do, great place for newlyweds to shop, reasonable expectations.Morning Shifts - Clock in, Head to the front grab the reports for the department, head to the stock room check to see if we have the product if so grab it and add it to your cart to put onto the floor before the store opens, Finish reports and then fill up the store with what you found inside the stock room, Store Opens finish putting away your reports and help and greet customers when you see them. Continue this until your shift is over, Clock Out.Night Shifts - Clock in, Look on the schedule to see which department you are in for the night, head to the department clean up the department and help customers when you see them, Store Closes, Head to the back room and grab the freight to put out for the night in your department until your shift is over, Clock OutI loved working in the office and having the option to also interact with customers and help them as well.  The company fosters a great culture, unfortunately the management at each location doesn't always follow through with that.Can be a great place to work. It is very hard to advance within the company. Yearly raises on excellent reviews are 20 to 30 cents. I have worked at three different stores with very different ways of doing things. It can be very high drama or very relaxed depending all on management. The customers for the most part are great, but also very needy because that is how we've trained them to be. It's nice to able to take care of customers and we bend over backwards for them. That said, the corporation does not go out of its way to help employees. The company is very frugal and raises are ridiculous; people will often get hired that make more than I do, and I'm a keyholder. There is a lot to do and its hard to get bored if you have a good work ethic.I liked this job but the pay is at a stand still to long. You was able to wear several titles and no pay raise for what  person was worth. The job was very interested and there was a lot to be learned. The feeling to be able to tell a customer about an item and the customer is very satisfied and happy while making their purchase was a joy.became an opener every single weekend since i started and enjoyed it. lunch parties sometimes. great people to work with. not too hard, but not to light either.Personally I could not wait to switch jobs out of this particular line of work. I could not enjoy myself or put myself fully into this job because it was a terrible working environment. After the managerial change within the store it all went down hill.This store has great training that is ongoing as the newer product comes in. Having product knowledge makes it fun to interact with customers.I spent most of my time training cashiers. These reviews are getting ridiculous. All I want to do is place my resume on here. I really don't understand the importance of this.Typical work day at BBB is attending to customers and providing them with great customer service skills, management is great and easy going, hardest part is informing the customer we do not have a product in stock when it shows in stock in store, and my most enjoyable part of the day is the rush throughout the day.","10,000+",New-York,Union,NJ,2016-11-16T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/data-scientist-job-union-nj-us-174259346.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Dusty warehouse conditions. Also worked certied forklift. Hard working labor for a minimum quick pay check.overall good place to work, great friendly environment good management. happy place to be if you make it that way. I enjoyed going to work everydayI went thru this company as Siemens called me back after lay off. They were very professional and helped me go thru the process very quickly.I like company because it has lot of opportunity to work with and get lots of experience but they are slow with they employees and sometime I cant understand them because they send u different places to work but I like that at sametime I want to stable schedule.scheduling staff, talking with guests, managing servers, bartenders and chefs.  lots of customer service and talent development.This position started as a dream job for me; seemingly great compensation, almost immediate benefits, promise of bonuses!  However, things quickly went south.  Mostly this was due to the lack of support; my manager moved away and was communicating remotely once a week or so, my partner went on maternity leave and there was no replacement that was knowledgeable enough to keep from making extra work, much less helping with the work load, etc.  There was no ""typical day at work,"" which isn't so bad unless your boss demands perfection at a constantly variable position.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting the two bonuses I received during my four months there; the least being the constant verbal lashings and lack of praise I received from my area vice president over things as trivial as post-its.The ratings depend on the manager who oversees the Randstad office that the talent works with. As of today, I have an excellent manager.  She listens.  She is helpful.  She is attentive, makes sure we are treated fairly, makes effort to match us with departments that would be a ""good fit"" for both parties.  She keeps open communication and good relations between both the talent and the contractors.The manager before her was not good.  She was not on our side.  She would advocate for the contractor over her talent (employees).Its a good place to get into, just for experience. there is no advancement. A raise a very difficult to get in this company.I enjoy my job and like being on the move. My co-workers are great people and ive learned I can excel myself now that I have the experience!Just an overall poor performance for a staffing agency. I did all the leg work and there was little to no communication after I had the position. Not a place that I would stay.At first it was a good place but then everthing change they be came mean people so i just left. But i use to love it. They pack pills and make traysI love working for this agency. I've learned how to operate different medical systems for different states.The management team is very enthusiastic and outgoing and likes to communicate with their employees.My job was great I really enjoyed my co-workers and I learned a-lot about urethane mold making and pouring the job was very hot and was only as hard as you made itManagement should really learn to listen to the associates that are out on the floor.Co-workers are great.Hardest part of the job is the long hours however it does feel great when a team reaches one goal togetherI work with good people and the management did not no what they was doing we had to put up and take down the same thing 3 to 4 time everyday because the management did no what was going on the pay was not no goodRandstad is a very professional organization to work for.  I spent 16 years with the organization and was involved with multiple clients.  I enjoyed with the clients and the employees.  It can be a challenge to balance the needs of the client and the employees.  This challenge can be very rewarding.Helpful for job hunting. Not much contact other than hiring process and online portal. They come across as professional and well organized.We load and unload trucks. We load the material take it to where it needs to go then we unload the material. After we unload it we go back to warehouse to load more material.When there are assignments available they will get you to work. They can be rude at times when they are busy. They hire just about anybody which was a problem for me because I don't like to work in just any type of environment.I have no complaints about Randstad.

I would stock shelves, food items and assist cleaning crew to help out. I was always told that I was a good team player. My most enjoyable was seeing that the work I had done was done right and others benefitted from it.They didn't tell me when they hired me that it was only going to be for three weeks while the manager was visiting family in Chicago. So I came to get my pay check and they told me they no longer needed me.I enjoyed my coworkers, and there was potential to make a good salary through bonus and daily spiffs. I'd recommend it to someone looking for a sales job.Everyday is always busy.  There is always something to do.I learned how to use great plain (another accounting software).I enjoyed working with my coworkers and they are easy to get along with. I live and learn alot during my employment there with Ice.Overall, the established system provides a good sense of job security; allowing for expectation of long term employment. A very dynamic operation with lots of moving parts allowing for significant multitasking and obtaining solid results...more accomplishments than the general public knows or understand.

If you have family issues like a death in the family. They put work first. I would not go back thereEnjoyable work environment with hard-working, reliable coworkers. Management was laid back but dependable. Owners are very good people and are extremely involved in their business. Most enjoyable part of the job was bartending and meeting new people. The hardest part of the job was being short-staffed, sometimes management approved other servers/kitchen staff to leave early.My GM was not a nice person. he was very rude to his employees and never gave any hours to anyone but just one person that he was having a relationship with. I am happy they are no longer a businesswork is routine and atmosphere is very dry. Management fears lawsuits so they keep allowing bad employees to stay around. Hard to promote or get a permanent position due to veterans preference.* Constant ongoing training* Good Management* Talented people to work with.* Cafeteria on site* Public transportation close byThis is a dead end job with no opportunity for growth. It was completely unprofessional. They are not timely with shift bids, coaching's or year end reviews. The job requirements and expectations certainly surpass the pay with new job requirements being added on weekly and your pay staying the same.CONS: Must absorb OT on lunch hour. no sick days. lack of communication between management and employees. no concern for non-sales positions. PTO is not handled in a timely manner and the logic behind it makes no sense.Typical day consitst of managing contracts, initiating case investigations, participating in outreach efforts, participating in operation shield, auiditing, creating presentations for managment meetings, ectI learned both physical and personnel security rules, regulations, and requirementsManagement was awsome, everything was structured and very organizedMy coworkers were very supportive, knowledgeable, team playersThe hardest part about this job was actually leaving, even though it was for a promotion. The people wer the most enjoyable part about the job, being about to do outreach activities with those who were really passionate about the support in the community.This was a home based position. I loved every minute of it. My team was amazing, our management team was always available to help and assist us. The pay structure was great. I learned more than I could of ever thought about the travel industry and got the opportunity to  take advantage of many gifts that were available to the employees.  Worked with a very difficult colleague and the leadership team did nothing to improve the work environment.

15,2429.0,Geologist -  Hazardous Site Investigation/Sampling /Remediation Projects,Randstad Engineering,3.8,7200.0,"very effiecient in getting in contact regarding job openings, don't work within the company as I am an agent they send out for various jobs if i fit the criterialaoding and unloading store products. Dusty warehouse conditions. Also worked certied forklift. Hard working labor for a minimum quick pay check.overall good place to work, great friendly environment good management. happy place to be if you make it that way. I enjoyed going to work everydayI went thru this company as Siemens called me back after lay off. They were very professional and helped me go thru the process very quickly.I like company because it has lot of opportunity to work with and get lots of experience but they are slow with they employees and sometime I cant understand them because they send u different places to work but I like that at sametime I want to stable schedule.scheduling staff, talking with guests, managing servers, bartenders and chefs.  lots of customer service and talent development.This position started as a dream job for me; seemingly great compensation, almost immediate benefits, promise of bonuses!  However, things quickly went south.  Mostly this was due to the lack of support; my manager moved away and was communicating remotely once a week or so, my partner went on maternity leave and there was no replacement that was knowledgeable enough to keep from making extra work, much less helping with the work load, etc.  There was no ""typical day at work,"" which isn't so bad unless your boss demands perfection at a constantly variable position.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting the two bonuses I received during my four months there; the least being the constant verbal lashings and lack of praise I received from my area vice president over things as trivial as post-its.The ratings depend on the manager who oversees the Randstad office that the talent works with. As of today, I have an excellent manager.  She listens.  She is helpful.  She is attentive, makes sure we are treated fairly, makes effort to match us with departments that would be a ""good fit"" for both parties.  She keeps open communication and good relations between both the talent and the contractors.The manager before her was not good.  She was not on our side.  She would advocate for the contractor over her talent (employees).Its a good place to get into, just for experience. there is no advancement. A raise a very difficult to get in this company.I enjoy my job and like being on the move. My co-workers are great people and ive learned I can excel myself now that I have the experience!Just an overall poor performance for a staffing agency. I did all the leg work and there was little to no communication after I had the position. Not a place that I would stay.At first it was a good place but then everthing change they be came mean people so i just left. But i use to love it. They pack pills and make traysI love working for this agency. I've learned how to operate different medical systems for different states.The management team is very enthusiastic and outgoing and likes to communicate with their employees.My job was great I really enjoyed my co-workers and I learned a-lot about urethane mold making and pouring the job was very hot and was only as hard as you made itManagement should really learn to listen to the associates that are out on the floor.Co-workers are great.Hardest part of the job is the long hours however it does feel great when a team reaches one goal togetherI work with good people and the management did not no what they was doing we had to put up and take down the same thing 3 to 4 time everyday because the management did no what was going on the pay was not no goodRandstad is a very professional organization to work for.  I spent 16 years with the organization and was involved with multiple clients.  I enjoyed with the clients and the employees.  It can be a challenge to balance the needs of the client and the employees.  This challenge can be very rewarding.Helpful for job hunting. Not much contact other than hiring process and online portal. They come across as professional and well organized.We load and unload trucks. We load the material take it to where it needs to go then we unload the material. After we unload it we go back to warehouse to load more material.When there are assignments available they will get you to work. They can be rude at times when they are busy. They hire just about anybody which was a problem for me because I don't like to work in just any type of environment.I have no complaints about Randstad. They have assisted me with my job search many times and have always been successful. Good pay and good hours, as well as the opportunities.",,New-York,Edison,NJ,2016-11-21T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/geologist-hazardous-site-investigation-sampling-remediation-projects-job-edison-nj-us-176487674.aspx?mescoid=1900265001001&jobPosition=13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Not worth it for the salary they pay.Employers are rude and disrespectful. Mean and degrading. The supervisors treat employees bad. Failing parks make it hard for jtp's to work.

29,2443.0,Quantitative Developer,Genesis10,4.0,27.0,"Genesis 10 is a Staffing Agency located in New York. I found it very difficult to deal with them because they would change their offer each time I spoke to them, I actually turned down the position because of this and three months later they had someone else from the company email me and see if I was still interested in the position. I told them I would take it for a certain salary and no changes.I went to work for Windstream Communication as an Analyst in the Engineering Department. I enjoyed every part of this job. I had to apply for permits for Right of Way Access in several different states. I worked with many different state and government agencies. In this position I worked as part of a team, where we would automatically jump in and help one another get caught up. We had to remain within company regulations of how quick we sent out the permit applications once they were submitted to us. Multitasking was most important, because there was always more than 10 to 15 projects to work on at the same time. Time management was important to meet deadlines. Most important follow-up was required to complete each project. I had very high stats for projects completed, because I was organized and kept my work area neat and organized at all times. The most enjoyable part of this job was working as a team. There was nobody that was trying to out do the next person. We were really a team working to accomplish a goal. The most difficult part of the job was getting the state and government agencies to return the permits in a timely manner. It required developing good relationships with  more... the State and Government Agencies Representatives to ensure the permits moved along  in their system. I highly respected the management, they all practiced what they preached by their actions.  lessTreated like adults and not micro-managed. Every now and then a little fun is thrown in. Overall a good place to work with friendly co-workers.Having worked as a consulting professional for most of my career, I have encountered varying support from the intermediary companies I found work through.  Some have been quite good, some have been so bad, I have refused to work for them and one has been the biggest mistake of my career.  That would be this company..Be warned if you choose to work for these people: the very moment you need them to have your back they will throw you under the bus.  This company is a wonderful company to work for.  They are always out to help their consults grow.  I have been on two assignments for them and can say they are a caring group of people that will do everything they can for their consultants.  They also care about their relationship with their partner/clients and work hard to keep the relationship strong.  I am proud to be a consultant for Genesis10.Working with my fellow group hand in hand and working with computers. Installing and removing old and replacing new computers. Learnt that I have progress in installing and replacing new computers. Management is fine. The co-workers are better workers to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job is removing and installing new computers. Do not have a hardest part of the job, it's just right for me and my school work.A nice place to work in a fast-paced Environment. Day-to-day responsibilities include supporting vendor managed clients, tracking requirements, submitting candidates, coordination and appointment/interview scheduling, placement/term paperwork, process improvement, timesheet and invoice issue resolution and coordinating consultant events and recognitionThis was a very good company to work for. This was a contract job on the weekends to do a PNC Bank refresh. This was a very good learning experience for me. We changed out all of the PC's, Printers, Cisco switches in different banks throughout Monroe County Michigan and Toledo, Ohio. I was second in command due to my experience with being a computer technician.this company taught me a lot about the porting of cell phone numbers worked well with every one. great hours to  work enjoyed not working any overtime that was offeredBeing my first full-time opportunity right out of college it was a great company. I worked with a lot a great people, and learned a lot of information that will be used doing my careerPeer groups were fun and energetic. Management team is flaky on every level. Beware, they have a marketing team out there writing all these great reviews.I have worked for Genesis 10 for 4 years and have always been treated with respect and honesty. Benefits could be better, but in this economy I really can't complain.Good people, fair and productive atmosphere. A youthful atmosphere with a variety of support and energetic people to make things happen.Genesis10 is a good company for individual contributors. Many teams are virtual so that is good in terms of work-life balance. The company has very little management. The people are the most enjoyable part of the job.G10 was my first professional job and the culture and people were both warm and welcoming. I learned so much within just my year there.Productive and non stressful workplace. Managers communicates and interacts well with employees and they do not micromanage.Nice small company environment. Great co-workers, people stay at their jobs for a number of years. Lots of flexibility as far as working remotely.A very comfortable office environment, laid back culture.A typical 40 hour weeks with no over-time. Management makes effort to provide a pleasant environment to work in. They hire good, experienced professional people.Facilitate meetings, capture key outcomes, project plan updates, weekly reports, and maintain System of Record. Analyze, forecast and implemented project closure.Worked on a project that was supposed to last 6 months, but lasted only 4.  Definitely a down side, they do not press their clients to honor contracts (but I guess that is industry standard).Management supported me during a wishy washy transition period, where client kept pushing back the start date.  Gen10 stepped up and bumped my rate slightly for the inconvenience, which I thought was fair.One big downside was mailing checks to 1099 C2C contractors.  If you were to do a survey in this market, most agencies delivered payments via Direct Deposit.  Hopefully, Gen10 will change.One last disappointment was that once it was determined that my last day was moved up two months, Gen10 didn't do anything noticeable to get me placed.  Their advice was to make sure I use other agencies as well.  I believe I performed admirably in my assignment, and this was the best advice they could offer.I hope they will read this critique as constructive criticism.  I thought they behaved in a professional manner through out, just wishing for more.Nothing really bad to say about this place....Managers could have been a bit better....But I would go back....Good company to work for.  Would work for them again.It is centrally located in Troy.Onboarding process is simple and well documented.Awesome co-workers.","1,001 to 5,000",New-York,NEW YORK,NY,2016-12-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/c0fafdb3-0c2f-4618-95d0-f67f96b78bdf?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I am only a temporary associate who works on the Medicaid team.  I am stationed at my own desk, with very little micro managing. Self starter and goal oriented, to get the job done.Keeping up with tested slides and properly storing them. Organizing and keeping up with lab equipment was very important as well as carrying many medical files and placing them in alphabetical order. Great environment to work in, hardest part was carefully placing the slides in their storage area having to be extremely careful. Easiest job I would say keeping up with the records and maintaining the lab equipment and assisting others.Working at Quintiles was a great experience.  They take care of their employees and help them further their careers by offering opportunities to grow and advancement.They are slow to promote but very understanding with life events and giving a good balance of work to family life. Depending on your role you work at your own pace to produce results.Pros: Work/life balance, benefits, vacation, and compensation. Cons: High turn over rate within engineering department.  Uncertainty with senior level management.A company with lots of opportunity to do different work projects, however it does not afford those opportunities to those lacking experience in specific jobs, therefore not a great place for growth.Good company to work for. There are several opportunities to learn and grow. The staff is very knowledgeable and willing to help. There are many opportunities for your hard work to be recognized.Very good company to work for. The employees work very well together in getting the projects done on time with a very hard working teaming atmosphere.A typical work day was pretty med range as far as stress levels go and the work loads are not to bad. You go in, wait for a delivery truck to drop off your work load and then you began your work which takes about 2 1/2 - 4 hours and you are on your feet the whole time.I learned better time management and to speak up if I had an ideal that may better the business. Nothing good to say about the Management team so I won't speak on it. Co-workers are like family. The hardest part of the job was trying to remember all of the protocols to are continently being changed every few weeks.

After a few weeks, my boss learned that his new boss was transferring the project we were working on, over seas and the whole team would need to look elsewhere for a position - either within Quintiles or outside of Quintiles.Management treated employees with respect and listened to ideas from the field.  They truly cared about the individual as well as the companies bottom line.I loved working with Quintiles. A very diverse place to work with good benefits. Salary was good, and the employee gym.  Everyone was excited to work for this companyGood Company, good co-workers environment was fast paced . Quntiles was employee oriented and had very good field managers.Quintiles is a great place to work.Competitive wages.Competitive insurance.Many opportunities for upward mobility.Quintiles provides a stable environment within an evolving and changing market.Develop recruitment strategies and an enrollment plan with the investigator and site staff to meet recruitment goals in coordination with the Global Monitoring Plan project recruitment plan and conducts evaluation, initiation, routine monitoring and close out visits at each assigned study site, as outlined in the Global Monitoring Plan.I have enjoyed my time here. I like the people I work with and am grateful Quintiles gave me my first job. Management decisions have led to the closing of many jobs.I was working on Special Projects that would bring a new product to the marketplace based on the results.  1000 people were involved in this study.what I did at this company was data entry.

32,2446.0,Scientist Pharmacovigilance,"Daiichi Sankyo, Inc.",3.8,110.0,"Very good to work and the manager, business users are very co-operative to work with. They maintain the professional ethics and balanced expectation.Not convinced that another reorganization is going to happen.  Management is terrible otherwise the culture is good.DSI does not pay the industry average in compensation.  The health insurance benefits are expensive and not the industry averageGreat working environment, great pay, great benefits, wonderful people to work with. There are not too many hard parts, I love the company.  The most enjoyable would have to be the team I work with.7 years ago, this was an exciting and growing company with great benefits and competitive compensation.  I learned a lot from my co-workers, my teammate who I provided back-up support to the VP  of Supply Chain and Technical Operations, providing executive support and putting in overtime as needed.  I learned the Purchasing process and was elected to be in charge of all the ordering of equipment, vendors and consultants at our new Bethlehem Plant in Pennsylvania, which was a challenging but rewarding project.  I learned how to support the Japanese culture, which was interesting.  I took a class on how to support the Japanese culture.how to greet the Japanese professionally.The unfortunate part, was the company went through some changes over the past few years, losing our CEO, and resulting in multiple layoffs.  This made it hard to advance within the company, morale was low and there was no job security.great culture, work/life balance for full time employees. plenty of hands on experience. The only thing is contract work is for a long period of time.  Contractors are not really involved as they could be or should be in the company overall activities if they've been there over a year.DSI is really the place where I learned the most about Payroll.  The manager who hired me saw the value of finding and keeping exceptional employees.I learned the ins-and-outs of Payroll Administration, including the role-out of a new system.  I have also come to realize that without all team members sharing a common vision, motivation and production...The best part of the job was interacting with all of the different people, from 48 states and Puerto Rico.  A very diverse employee population.  I learned so much from so many different people, personally and professionally.typical office environment with little advancement opportunities. Decent work/life balance. Decent cafeteria. Companies is not stable and constantly does layoffs.The company was a wonderful place to work for many years.  In the last 5 years there has been tremendous change and turnover in upper management.  It was very stressful with yearly/ bi-yearly layoffs.  The company has just gone through a total restructuring.It is not the same company I worked for, so I don't know how it currently is to work for.For years, DSI was a positive environment to work in because they stressed a team environment.Traveled 12-14 overnights per month for 4 1/2 years.  My pay was very dependent on what my co-workers did in their role of sales representatives as we were all paid on the same products, just with different weightings.My direct managers were both fantastic!!  Couldn't have asked for better district managers!Hardest part of the job was being gone from my family and young child all the time.Most enjoyable part of the job was learning about the disease states, how the pharmaceuticals I sold helped people, and meeting so many wonderful providers, nurses, and other people across Montana and Wyoming!Amazing employeesamazing culturegood compensationi have nothing negative to say about Daiichi Sankyo, it has been a great foot in the door to the pharmaceutical industryExcellent products with excellent leadership from the top down.  Despite losing patent rights on their blockbuster anti hypertensive Benicar, they have acquired products and made themselves a viable and strong force going forward once Benicar expires.  Excellent training and excellent benefits!Loved working here.  Loved my coworkers and Managers.  Culture at the Parsippany location was enjoyable.  Ability to telecommute when weather is bad or children are home sick.My workday consisted of meeting deadlines; managing staff and trouble shooting. Upper management was very supportive of ideas. This company provided superior benefitsCo workers functioned as a team, supporting each other and working togetherMeeting daily deadlines was a must! Payroll can never be late.Most enjoyable part of my job was seeing results from organized preparation and execution. But most important was working with a dedicated staff.Currently transitioning in the United States. Awaiting product approvals in 2018-19. Large geographies, limited products and coverage.  New upper management leading US efforts.a typical day at work would be to talk to Life Insurance agents. I learnt a great deal of people management skills in short time. i also created relationship with Life insurance agents and assigned my agents of Auto and Home division to make product sales.DSI offered a competitive salary with good benefits in the market of pharmaceutical sales. They stood out in the type and quality of training received prior to entering the field as well as continued support and accessibility to resources in the home office. My partners are top notch individuals with a strong work ethic. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the changes in the managed care and healthcare reform as it effects our efforts.Great place to work with wonderful people. I consider my job to be a ""home-like"" enviornment with competitive benefits. My present supervisor is stellar and I consider myself blessed to have such a long career in the same department for 6+ years. The most enjoyable part of my job are the problem solving efforts and the interaction with people.Overall not a bad place to work, typical day includes; selling benefits to doctors on certain products for certain patient types, setting up business lunches and presentations, managing inventories in offices, and of course a lot of driving. If you don't enjoy speaking, selling or a high pressure management structure I wouldn't recommend this job to you. However if you enjoy competition, and don't mind the stress, this job can be enjoyable. The management in this company will put INCREDIBLE amounts of pressure on you to win quickly, this could be a good thing or bad depending on how you handle stressful situations, in can crush you or make you stronger depending on your personality type. Your coworkers are usually great, competition is fierce but friendly and generally people are willing to help you. If you are looking for an entry level pharma job this company can be a great test job to see if the industry is for you, it may not be a long term solution however as layoffs seem to happen every 2 years or so.Nothing to say about DSI.  If they had not had a restructure and handled it poorly, I would have stayed.Company was good and culture was good until they partnered with AZ on a bad contract.Daiichi originally started out as a great company, however many changes made in the last couple of years has lead to many employees leaving the company for better opportunities.  Many of the decisions made do not seem to be well thought out.  already submitted a review about this wonderful company. Ruch culture, great benefits, and work life balance.

65,2479.0,Data Scientist II,Comcast,3.8,6500.0,"Great company & great people, great benefits as well. I have learned many things while working at Comcast- I have done an overall training of our department to grow within the companyHuddles are conducted each morning to review performance and address anything necessary for the day or week.  Consistent rotation for greeting and helping customers with an easy Queue system to track who is in the store.  Management and upper management always actively looking for your opinion of workplace, opportunities, as well as customer feedback. Hardest part of the job is getting to know the system and working for a company which does not have the best track record for customer service.  It's hard to work with people who do not like this company, which is often, but it is worth it when you are able to change the perspective of the company with your store and your own customer service.The best thing about this job is the co workers. The benefits are okay. Alot of time off. But work/life balance isnt that great. Supervisors are always on you about metrics. Numbers numbers numbers. Your numbers can be great for a couple of months with no issues until you have a bad month then your integrity as a technician is put into question.  And then all of a sudden you start receiving corrective actions for little things so they can get you out the door. Its not about the customer its about metrics. The pay is terrible for the type of work you do (climbing poles, getting into attics, rewiring houses, correcting mistakes that contractors didnt correct, angry customers, faulty equiptment and management on your behind. At&t deals with the same amount of issues but atleast they get paid well for it and they have union.A typical day at work usually is not so routine.  I can either climb a ladder, enter a crawl space, or simply install inside a customer's home.  I have learned quite a bit working for Comcast.  I have learned the basics of cable installation, also how to communicate with customers and troubleshoot their problems.  The management is very helpful and supportive.  My coworkers are very friendly and funny.  The hardest part of the job would have to be working out in all of the weather. The best part of the job is interacting with customers and learning more and more about my job.This was by far, the worst company I've ever worked for.  Management fostered a snitch culture among the employees, encouraging them to inform on one another, driving down morale.  In addition to informing on one another, employees constantly watch for 'weakest link' tickets and pounce, not for the edification of the employee, but for the sole purpose of making themselves look good at the expense of that employee.  In addition, management had its favorites and its designated 'red-headed stepchildren', often deliberately embarrassing other reps in front of their peers.My advice - do your career a favor - AVOID COMCAST!!!!this company could be a great one to work for if they could get all departments on the same page with the same ethical standards. As a customer facing employee, the majority of the job was being screamed at for misinformation, lies, or unwanted products being given to customers by phone representatives, all while trying to upsell those angry customers into more services, then begging for a 5 on the satisfaction survey. In the ever-complex technical world that Comcast inhabits, amazingly the only two fixes offered to any issue are a new TV box, or a new modem regardless of the actual issue(s) affecting service.Normal working day. Job training with new software. Super Management Team, benefits and excellent working environment.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customer issues which was not a problem really, especially when we had to apply what we learned during the training on how to deal with these types of situations. The most enjoyable part is the rewards. Comcast knows how to shower its employees with gifts, stipends and also the quarterly pay granted every individual employee sales percentage. This is what to expect while working at Comcast Cable Communications.I would worked 11 hour shifts. I would take customers calls to help them with their TV, Internet and phone service. I learned different ways to help meet customers. The management was great with helping you learn to be a better agent. I was part of a team of 14 so we would have have weekly meetings to discuss problems and new options coming out. The supervisor would also do one on one meetings to share with you your strengths and weakness. The hardest part of my job was always trying to find away to make all of the customers happy. The most rewarding part of my job was when I was able to lower a customer's bill or make customers day better.This is secure job and some of the benefits are good, but overall a difficult place to work. Customer service, although on the surface seems decent, is severely lacking. Technicians can do anything and everything to support the customer and provide great customer service, but every other line of customer service is defective in many ways. Pay is very low in comparison to other communications companies and requirements for promotion are only getting more absurd.I was able to do my work without supervision.  If I needed to work with my team, we were allowed to collaborate on issues. I learned a lot of new technical skills. Management was awesome, until they changed directors.  I loved my co-workers.  They were always willing to help, when I was new. Hardest part of my job at the end was dealing with the time restraints that were put on us once the director changed everything about our job.  I love talking to people, and giving good customer service, as well as resolving the customers issues.I worked at Comcast for many years. Moved up through several positions and enjoyed each position that I took on. It is more difficult to maintain a position in the customer service and sales departments due to the ever changing stats that must be adhered to but it is possible to get the job done. Management, for the most part, was always helpful and friendly. Once I moved into a less customer facing position and worked from the back office, I started to really enjoy my Comcast life. Office team was much smaller than the call center teams and the full team including management were able to actually get to know one another. I definitely wouldn't mind going back. I would like more money, though.Typical day at work would consist of taking calls from people who wanted to switch companies or add or remove services, or people who had service problems or billing problems, etc....  Some days would consist of team meetings in which we went over our team's numbers and other days consisted of coaching where we went over our individual performances.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the people I worked with and the feeling of appreciation from customers who believed I did everything in my power to help them.  The hardest part of the job was when I wasn't able to help people to their satisfaction for one reason or another despite my efforts to do so.Spent 13 years working for them in various capacities. Worked in the field at two locations as a technician for first year and a half then eleven + in two call centers. During that time I saw a lot of changes. Some good and some not. High turnover. Toughest thing was providing good quality customer service because of lack of training and enough tools at your disposal to assist customers. Company had a perception that they were providing great service. Comcast management realized based on responses from employees that it was frustrating and possessed limited abilities to succeed. They have since changed their policies, procedures and expectations for call center representatives.After 1.5 years of working for Comcast Xfinity, I can honestly say that I learned a lot about problem solving, great customer service delivery, and enhanced my computer skills. I have learned to address technical equipment issues as well as interpreting complex code errors from customers' accounts, turning them into basic explanation. Management hasn't been always on top of their game, this year due to short-staffing, employees quitting, but at the end of the day management still pulls through. Overall, Comcast has a lot of opportunity for different positions to apply for and also brings out the best in you. The sales environment can be quite stressful with customer complaints and coworker/new hire ambitions. However, adapting to that kind of environment will only make you stronger.In 16 years, 20 total in all with the company and different owners.  I had always been respected and worked well in the company Instead of having opportunities past your grade is tough after your at the top.  To move to management or headend is impossible unless your willing to relocate.  The Northwestern supervisors were very professional and helpful.  The Midwestern supervisors had no clue to the extent of the experience differences there is to the other areas.  I was farther into fiber than coax in the NW.  It was a night and day experience in the two areas. No matter what, always work hard.Great company, good benefits and a nice people. I started in 1984 and worked as a construction tech, moved into Installation, service and on to Head End operations.This was followed by deployment of an enterprise network, An all fiber network under the name of cell back haul.Routing cellular traffic and metro Ethernet traffic through our facilities and into local points of contact throughout our region.Deploying DWDM transport equipment, active and passive.Monitoring equipment daily, maintaining, servicing and organizing and repairing as needed.Testing, installing new routers, switches, installing circuits on a daily basis.Testing and turning up of 1g,10g, and 100g optical links.I will always value this expearance with Comcast as I endeavor to seek new opportunities.Working in cable you have to be ready and willing to adapt to changes very quickly. With almost everything being done over high speed internet the customers needs often dictate how your day will go. Overall this is an excellent company to work for with great benefits and room for advancement. The crew of technicians work hard to provide quality service to the customers as does the management team. Thought the years I've learned how to adapt quickly and change directions at a moments notice. Dealing with customers can be the hardest part of the job at times, but also the most satisfying when you can resolve an issue for a truly thankful customer.I was putting in 60 hour weeks steadily and they were billing techs as part time employees ontop of contractor per job compensation which ended in a class action lawsuit for unpaid overtime. I did not participate in this lawsuit but it caused this installation to go under.We were required to complete 10-15 jobs per day some days working up to 15 hours at a time, 6 days a week. Customers were often very irritated and angry before I even met them due to previous technicians sub par work. When you work with a large group of individuals the work reflects on everyone involved. I was able to relax customers and eliminate repeat service calls by educating them on the services properly.PROS: Good Pay, Good Health Benefits, 401k, Quarterly Bonuses,  40hrs vacation (yearly), employees who know what they're doing help you out.CONS: Forced to make sales in any position, Supervisors/Management never available, Information provided in training not acurate, Customers you handle constantly screaming, cussing, degrading you while you have to keep professional demeanor, can still get in trouble even while following policy, No job security.If you can handle not having any support or any form of leadership and can handle overly irate customers while biting your tongue and have your job dependent on metrics that you truly have no control over and constantly being given misinformation then penalized for utilizing the misinformation then this is the job for you oh also they won't mention this until after your hired but be sure to sharpen up on your sales pitches because this is definitely a large portion of your job requirement.The hours are long, expectations a bit unrealistic due to varying skill levels. You have your workers who aren't that great but can knock out a lot of jobs, or the truly knowledgeable workers who don't have enough time to get everything done properly and up-to-code.  Corporate environment can be a bit shady, people get fired for bringing up the word union or making too much noise on issues. Management are just pawns of the corporate system here. However compared to a lot of companies, they're not all bad.   Pay is average for low voltage; however, benefits really are great as well as quarterly bonuses. You will deal with a lot of cleaning up Comcasts mess so besides hands-on experience you better have customer service skills as well.    I give it 3 stars due to there being so much room for improvement and they put the almighty dollar over anything else even customer or employee experience.Never in all my years of work have I had the pleasure of working with a group that cared so much about the customer. So much so that I now worry about every interaction and find ways to better myself, all on behalf of supporting our departments that ultimately support our customers, the ones that I work for and pay my paycheck. The people I am surrounded by are intimately aware of their impact on the customer, and every decision is scrutinized for ways in which we can better serve them. I am proud to work with such dedicated people.","10,000+",New-York,New York,NY,2016-12-03T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/d4816b55-5c24-4d7b-ad22-4bcb52546a86?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

71,2485.0,"Data Scientist, Digital Strategy",Morgan Stanley,3.9,1600.0,"First big job out of college.  Thought is was my dream job, however, found out it is pretty cut throat within the office and very high stress.  Was a good learning experience for me, just wasn't for me as a career.Work consumed your personal life. Constant pressure from management teams to push products that weren't right for the client. You're salary would decrease as your production increased unless you were apart of a ""larger team"". The Management teams were only willing to support advisors when it benefited them for their quarterly bonus. Management was very political in regards to helping certain individuals succeed in the organization. They promote and sell a training program with coaches that had little to no experience whatsoever. In my opinion was a waste of time and money. Can not stress the negative taste I received from the local management team.Typical Day of Work is quite intense. Requires you to use your intellectual abilities and most roles require you to work in collaboration with others. I've learned many different things but due to the focused nature of each role at such a large firm it is probably less than you would encounter at a smaller financial firm.Management is very focused and goal oriented. Generally a good amount of focus is placed on leadership.Coworkers are intelligent and personable. Occasionally, some make it into the firm due to relations with management, however those are fewer now then before.Pay was reasonable, however for such a large firm that has had continued success due to it's people, not enough is paid in comparison to other firms.Working here all depends on your manager and your department. It can vastly vary from one team to the next. You can have a manager that's flexible with work/life and others that are very rigid. I personally think the compensation is not aligned across the board properly and hasn't recovered since the 2008 crash. It claims to be a total reward company yet above base compensation can vary greatly from one year to the next leaving you to be under compensated. Base salaries need an adjustment. How can new associates make the same as veteran officers at the firm.I typically worked eight or nine hours a day.  I learned many things about prime brokerage, and the financial services industry as a whole.  I also learned a lot about operations in general.  Morgan Stanley is a great company because it gives you many opportunities that other firms do not, such as being able to interact freely with upper management (VPs and above).  Middle managers are not that great.  It appears that they may be sandwiched, or pulled in too many directions, and therefore lack focus.  The hardest part of the job is the turnover / attrition.  The most enjoyable part of the job is processing / production, as it does not carry over into the next day.MS has good points and bad points. In the last couple of years they haven't really compensated their employees well. A good point is MS is all about community involvement and volunteering. They dedicated 2 months to giving back and encourages every employee to participate.The CAC is where I work and have worked from day one. The culture /moral is poor. Management is unwilling to listen or support anyone but their own. They will even block anyone from moving to another dept. The pay is reasonable until you want a pay increase. They will say no raises department wide and then give them to management.A typical day  at work can be starting off with a case load of 4 patients and  having to discharge 2-4 and  ending up with all new patient. Management can be helpful at times on a floor level. MY coworkers are my second family. we work together as a team to get the work done in a timely and effective manner. The hardest part of this job at time is working under short staff. The most rewarding part of this job is having to go home  and knowing that i gave it all my best and i actually made a difference in my patient's lives.The business culture did not meet my high standard of work ethics.  Lack of transparency.  There was an extreme lack of communication between staff and management.  When tax reporting issues came up that would result in clients being audited, my concern were left ignored.The work life balance is the best out of any company I've ever worked for! MS really cares that you're able to have a life outside of work. The compensation was okay, but the benefits were great. Management has an open door policy and they take great pride in that. The job culture was wonderful and diverse...leaving so many people to learn from.review daily mismatch report, training offshore team in Guadalajarareporting of CMO securitized items to FINRA.  Daily communication makes work easier and productiveManagement allowed me to work independentlyNothing too hard with proper training.Enjoying my co-workers and being able to help each otherGreat place to work.  Salary and Benefits were also Great. I got alone with my co-workers and helped to meet Company goals and objectives. Enjoyable part of the job was, I never did the same thing everyday. Many assigned tasks were different everyday and a great challenge to meet them. I was disappointed and sad when the Company got out of the Defined Contribution Business.Very supportive management however compensation could be better and ever since they went to the branch complex model, opportunities for advancement are limited.Management has total lack of regard for leadership staff development and recognition. No true track of productivity or path for advancement.Speaking from a Registered Associate (CSA) role, the firm and the branch I worked in valued the employees.  The managers, compliance, operations and reception staff were very respectful and trusted you until you couldn't be trusted. The hardest part of the job was getting accustomed to constant changes in operations and things beyond one's control (i.e. market fluctuation, handling multiple client requests) and the most enjoyable is fulfilling a client's request with ease, having assistance from the managers when you really need it. It's vital that the CSA has a good working ""chemistry"" with their FA's, it makes all the difference especially during stressful times as in any relationship.The management needed to be changed.  They hire you as a temp with no benefits such as holiday pay, sick leave or vacation.  There is no given time frame as to how long you will be on temp status.Very easy to get stuck within a team. Bonuses and raises are becoming less frequent. It is a good place to get some good experience to put on your resume as a young person.The firm is acutely focused on keeping headcount low and budgets thin. The firm provides some nice benefits that come with a big company, but is not competitive with non-bank financial institutions.Compensation is great how ever leadership and management needs to be more diverse. and FAA could use more guidance.. instead of just throwing you out there to fend for your selfNice and friendly staffRight in the middle of midtown Manhattanfast paced work environment Great work ethicsGreat management staff great compensationPeople are nice and understanding and accommodating of any personal issues.

Employees must be committed to attaining and maintaining these standards, and are well compensated for it.There was amazing people and management that made working at Verizon a fun and enjoyable place to be.  The job was fast paced, and excellence driven but was very rewarding.They brainwash you that they are not a bureaucracy, but that's exactly who they are!  If you dont become buddy buddy with your managers, you get no where!  Not a good company to work for,Work life balance is a weakness with the company. Not much room for growth.

It was pure enjoyment coming to work everyday.The company is decent overall but does not protect their employees rights as well as I would like in a place of business. Overall they provided great products.The problem is no matter what this will always be a sales job. The cellphone industry is hurting badly while at the same time your goals increase. Your schedule will always fluctuate. Unless you are the top dog than your job is never safe. If you are a manager than you will really be putting in all the work.independent environment that allows employees to be self sufficient. however, management is very knowledgeable and always willing to help. The benefit are also great especially for new parents.Environment in the stores can be very fun and productive.  However, there are strict goals set which can lead to a stressful environment.  When working in retail it is very hard to have a solid work life balance.The Hardest Part was working just for comission.Manager is the most amazing person in the world. A typical day our office would be making about 30 to 40 sales.Responsibilities included producing revenue through sales and service, handling outstanding customer service, opening/closing the store, inventory checks, stocking, and understanding the products. Consistently generated the most revenue per employee for the store each month while attending evening college classes.While being an Uber Partner and driving commuters around the DC Metropolitan Area, this job has given me the opportunity to meet people of all ethnicity and disabilities. One challenges on the job shows how diverse the world is. I must adapt and be able to communicate with a variety of people when it comes to getting them to there destination.  Another example would be me working as a Lead Sales Associate for Finish Line. At times on the job I would have to remain patient while attending costumers needs. Each Customer should be treated with respect until they are satisfied. I consume products of all sorts, so as a consumer I try to use that advantage to sell merchandise and treat the consumer as a equal individual.The most enjoyable part of both jobs was gaining experience and confidence in retail, management, and communication over the years while I use for future endeavorsYou are micromanaged from day one. The culture is not bad , if someone looking over your shoulder at all time do not bother you. I enjoyed working there.Verizon offers competitive pay and benefits, and provides an ever changing work environment with lots of opportunity for advancement. The quotas can be challenging, and the expectations unrealistic, but lower management was usually someone who recently was in the same position, so they were always willing to help and team sell. The hours are normal retail hours, which mean you are drained dry during holiday season, or at any special release (iPhone release for example). Customers are terrible and demanding, and there isn't much in place where employees can defend themselves from harassment or unfair treatment by customers.Overall, the job is pretty good and the pay is higher than similar positions, but if you don't like working weekends, holidays and never having a set schedule, look somewhere else.","10,000+",New-York,New York,NY,2016-11-30T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/3aa15715-a32c-4d58-acf6-905c73213d8e?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=20,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

I enjoy working with the cardmembers the most.  I disagree about the management use of survey systems but I realize that is a part of the customer service world.The American Express Service Center (AESC) in Phoenix, AZ is a truly remarkable facility.  Having worked in private, public, and non-profit sectors, AESC has proven to have the strongest work culture I've seen in my career.  The company has fantastic work/life balance opportunities:  work from home, flexible schedules, onsite dental, onsite flu shots, onsite nurse/medical, onsite cafeteria, onsite massage, a break room with video games, TVs, and couches.  And yes - there are expectations to produce very high quality work - but this is accompanied by fantastic training and coaching.Jobs are being lost because the company rather save a dollar more and out source them to cheaper labor in India and Philippines. Customers are not happy and the company doesn't care about it, they rather save extra money, rather than listen to their customers. Which ultimately they will end up losing in the long run because of this decision making. They release employees who have put their hearts and souls into this company for many years, and they are just laying them off.I have worked at American Express on a full time basis for a few years. I would say overall it is a good company to work for.  Work-life balance is great depending on which group you are in.  Most groups allow you to work from home most Fridays.Compensation at American Express is not the best.  It's certainly not the worst.  But, I think American Express struggles to be competitive from a compensation point of view.Job security is not great here at the moment.  Layoffs are happening across the board and at all levels.  So, I would say proceed with caution.Overall, I have enjoyed my time here.I have been with American Express for 3 years now. I have learned a lot about the banking industry and how to help people in a calm manner.Unfortunately, I don't see room for advancement for me here. I was not fortunate enough to go to school for a degree and most positions, regardless of qualifications, require a degree.I enjoy working with people on a team, but I also enjoy being left to do my job, the way they I can do it.I enjoy being able to help clients when they are in a bad situation, it gives me a sense of satisfaction when they really appreciate the help I can provide.On the other side of that, there are some people you just can't please no matter the situation, so that is tough.They pay well, have fair benefits, good work life balance and attempt to create a positive culture. However, they are behind the times in product growth and frequently make bad decisions that effect the entire company. Every year, if not twice a year people wait with baited breathe to see if they will be one of the people getting axed in the current ""reorganizing"" round. The last round consisted of 10% of the entire company. Very shaky and unstable. You constantly feel insecure.Good on the job training opportunities, very light on any training that has cost associated to it. Performance based compensation, bonus and recognition programs for high performers. Standard benefits of medical, dental, 401K with 5% matching and vesting. Heavy contract staff augmentation on shore and off shore.Global Company that causes interference with work life balance.American Express pretty much left me in the dark most of the time. Very little communication about the job or who exactly cares. Most communication was via a team member whom I did not really answer to. They seemed quite disorganized cared little about my skillset or utilization of them. I often had no idea if my job was going to be dissolved due to transitions even though I was praised and had high marks as a top performer. Often 'other' teams handled issues with very little explanation as to why. Such teams may or may not respond to any communication attempts possibly passing the buck when contacted. Processes for handling specific 'areas' were typically inept at best and appeared frequently mishandled. They seemed very 'low-tech' which was the opposite of what my impression was before working for them.This strong US financial company is outsourcing jobs to India for customer servicing despite card member complaints. With the recent co-brand partner dissolutions with Jet Blue and Costco, American Express recently displaced nearly 220 customer service professionals from their Salt Lake City facility, with an offer to retain approximately 80 - 100 home based servicing positions only. It's a shame, as the jobs are needed to support our American workers, not to mention the US economy. In 2011 AMEX displaced nearly 300 New Account specialists from the SLC facility.  In 2015 nearly 100 of their Fraud specialists were also displaced.I worked in a center 9 years before transfering to Home Based Servicing. Working from.home sounds great... but its very lonely. Once you are at home their is very little opportunity for advancement and you are just stuck taking calls day after day with no end. It wears you down fast. I did enjoy that ability to drop and pick up hours easily with colleges. This made it simple to adjust my schedule with out using PD time. American Express is a great company but home based servicing was just not for me.Amex is a great company overall with nice people, but has become too slow and is unable to move quickly enough to be competitive.  Advancing in the company is difficult as greater value is place on planning events then actually deliver results.I actually love working for AMEX. The culture, leadership and opportunities for advancement are phenomenal. I worked my way up the corporate ladder and have not been disappointed. I have been given the opportunity to lead a team and work hand in hand with American Express' head of marketing/developmental teams out of Phoenix Arizona. Absolutely love this company.Amex is not only customer centric but also employee centric and the management will do it's best to develop you and your skills.They believe in maintaining a good work-life balance and will support your development. There is a lot to learn from this organization which will help you explore your capabilities.Great place to work following a structured environment.

If you want to make a difference, this is NOT the place for you.  Unless you are a VP (they are very top heavy in VPs by the way), you don't really have a say in what happens on a day to day basis.  The company is very vocal about peer reviews and surveys to make the working environment more appealing to all stages (entry-level up to senior management) of your career.American Express was a great place to work.  They care for their employees and have a good work life balance.  I really like the people I worked with.  American express tried to build a culture of team work.Work Life Balance. Great Work Schedule. Great Culture. Customer Oriented. Job Security. Future Forward Management StyleI worked here for several years and there just didn't seem to be much room for advancement. Many times they hired from outside of the company instead of promoting internal employees.as in any large company, there is a lot of politics and power play involved.

Great team atmosphere and partnership across functions and businessesGood Place To Work.... good balance of work life..good mobility. management is ok but the culture is not great. Co-workers are ok, but the culture itself is very cut-throaty and backstabbish. I would not recoommend to any friends or family.When I interviewed for the job I was guaranteed advancement opportunities.  After being on the job 2 weeks,  I was told that no growth in jobs are coming to Henderson.  Leads and Heads talks down to employees.  A lot of contradiction and favoritism.A typical day involved dealing with requests and technical questions from clients and other internal departments. The fast paced nature of the job was thoroughly enjoyable, and I found that staff members always aided each other if additional assistance was required. Management were keen to train staff up on as many skills as possible, and provided intensive training every few months. This enabled us to grow in our knowledge, which in turn allowed for promotions.Solid learning environment in a fast-paced, dynamic culture. Opportunity for growth if supported by management. Benefits are top of the industry.my day starts around 7:30 and the first part is reconciling our overnight exceptions.  The fed opens at 8:30 and our day to day activity start immediately.  Volume is high, so we are busy throughout the day.As a manager I learn how to deal with many different personalities and how to motivate my team members. the hardest part of the job is ensuring Client assets are protected at all times. I enjoy resolving challenging issues. Management was good, but their plans were not always thought out for the long term correctly.  When long term goals were set, they seem to start the process without a detail planExcellent teams. Mornings were usually meetings with London and Singapore teams. Afternoon and early evenings were development time. Working on the trading floor afforded me many interactions with different traders, risk managers, financial controls. Learned Java, perfected C++ and a lot of credit derivative knowledge. The hardest part of the job was managing global teams, many late night calls. The most enjoyable part of the job were that the traders gave me the time to interact and communicate. I saved the firm $1.6 million over a couple of coffee machine stops.I WAS AWARDED AS BEST PROJECT MANAGER FOR THE    YEAR UNDER REVIEW ;Leading the collections team to achieve 90 to 97% collections rate (a first time achievement of BACLAYS BANK (Ghana) Plc.I introduced the cheque form of collections at the branch which gives the company 70% collections.Bringing on board and championing the mobile money wallet for cash collections which has aided collections from the beginning of the year to date.I also initiated the bulk cheques collections on behalf of the bank (company management)Very bad experience while working at Barclays Too many politics. Management is really terrible only promoted their friends hire their relatives. I'm sorry to say this but Barclays was considered a good company to work forgreat place to work Aside from the job scope itself, one factor that significantly influences how employees feel about work is the environment. By work environment, I mean everything that forms part of employees’ involvement with the work itself, such as the relationship with co-workers and supervisors, organizational culture, room for personal development, etc.A positive work environment makes employees feel good about coming to work, and this provides the motivation to sustain them throughout the day.You are required to get to work 10 minutes early to sign on before your (paid) start time which equates to about 50 unpaid hours per year.  How they continue to abuse this is beyond me.  If you are late you get written up and so forth until you are boxed up and herded out the front door. It is a one-way relationship, not your way.  Pay is based on great-recession job surveys so they pay as little as possible and a full classification below the sister site in Delaware.  It is an obstacle course to get a raise or a promotion, with rules and requirements changed at will.  The monthly meetings where the promotions are announced are just a sad display of how the game is rigged.  Managers hold all the power and play favorites, have snitches mingle into break time and off-the-record conversations to report back on what and who.  Quality Call scores are one of the determining factors as to if you earn a bonus (yes-they have bonuses) this score is rigged by what calls they grade. The fact is that calls are 'selected' so as to produce the desired result.  they do have benefits which you pay for but it beats Obamacare.  Everyone is treated the same, however poorly I may think that to be.  in spite of the poor morale, most of us enjoy working with each other, so misery does love company.  For those 20 -23 this is a first job you will not soon forget, especially after you have worked for a real people's company later in your career.Good company overall. Decent compensation, but could be better. Good place for early career individuals. Would not recommend staying too long unless there are opportunities for growth.When I left Credit Suisse to join Barclays in 2007, it was a unique opportunity to be integral to the buildout of Barclays' West Coast leveraged finance business.  My former boss at Credit Suisse and I recruited a talented team of junior bankers to join in building out an entrepreneurial platform within the context of a major global financial institution.Barclays was my first professional job at his school, as far as development is concerned. To be frank they are going to be a tough act to follow. My peers and managers treated us all the same and every problem that we came a crossed we solved as a group. As far as the work environment, it wasn't fantastic. There were numerous recreational areas and there was also a full cafeteria so people could eat without having to leave the office. I was very sad to leave at office, and to hear of them shutting the site down. Very much looking forward to new opportunities, especially considering that I am much more experienced now and I feel like I can contribute tons more at my new team.typical day at work is often communication heavy, high paced with a lot of people.I often learn from veterans of the work place management is kind, understanding and gives work initiativesmost my co- workers are nice with your occasional grumpy people hardest part of the job would have to be managing your breaks, and warding off people who do not belong in certain placesmost enjoyable part of the job is seeing people smile and enjoying their time spent.Highly productive environment with hard working and dedicated employees. There is opportunity for growth and movement within the organization. Net working and shadowing with colleagues enables you to apply for internal position with mobility tool.Wonderful place to workGreat work environmentEncourages professional learning Cutting edge in their job spaceColleagues and management are enjoyable to work withMy area is Build /release/deployment engineering, and configuration management.

Employees are treated like an expendable number and if asked without the fear of being fired would agree and then some. The company manages with fear of getting fired.  The health care benefits are TERRIBLE!!!! They lay off people, departments and whole facilities without hesitation nor advance notice.  You have a job today but you will have no idea if you have one next month.Challenge-Find a First Data employee who is not looking for another job. Impossible!!!This place is for people who are workaholics. This place thinks work is more important than family. Working both days on a weekend is a negative when it comes to family. Working five days a week is good and working an extra day should be voluntary. The zipsort department thinks that employees have to work 6 days a week all the time. They don""t ask if employees to work the 6 days a week.Don't take a job at this company. They are constantly transitioning jobs oversees so there is no stability. Director level and above management is completely out of touch with how to create a good culture. The turnover is insane which speaks to the lack of culture and overall issues with the company. The systems are antiquated and there is no desire to fix it. Management's answer is to not fix the systems and to even place tighter deadlines that results in longer hours, and by longer I mean past midnight. Honestly, worse job I have ever had.The job was rewarding to me because at the end of each day I either was apart of a team resolution or I researched and resolved issues.Learned that my way may not always be the best way to handle a task. I always conferences with the agent that perform.the task daily My job was always challenging because each day there are different issues which gave me the opportunity to be involved with many different divisions of finance, credit, and legal areas. I looked forward to my challenges each and everyday because that was my enjoyment. The hardest part of my job was leaving unresolved issues at the end of the dayextremely high turnover of employees. First Data set very high quality requirements of the employees increasing the stress on the employees with no consideration to the amount of changes to job description on a daily forum.They flood the market through multiple avenues. Selling against your own company at every turn. Then they give you no support. Lost 10-20 deals on circumstances where they never even replied to me. If you are a hunter and can learn quickly to become self sufficient, you will have a chance of being successful.Normal as usual routine clock in briefing from supervisor and manager. I learned many things about management for instance  important of human resources in providing tools for  jobs from machineries to manpower and also managing devorsified environment.  I will say that the management in my department is poor for some reasons first unfair rise which led to many leaved and difficult to bring in new employees.My co-workers are such are good people. I like to be around them.Hardest part  of job when we have  5 million pieces of mail to go out at any day that have high volume and we short of staff as now a days. Meeting my co-workers make some jokes.My time at First Data was short lived as my department was moved to Omaha, Nebraska.A days work consisted of reviewing accounts for potential fraud to make sure a persons debit card was not being compromised.My coworkers were a good team.The hardest part of the job was not being able to satisfy every customer and the most enjoyable part of the job was when someone did say thanks and appreciated you for looking out for them.I really love this Job!

The weekly working hours of associated is fluctuated and going down to  day by day. There is not an opportunity to grow up career path in learning new things , jobs cross-training, to higher position and professional careers.A typical day at work is very productive, there is always something to do...if not technical than administrative.  The environment is team cultivated.  The hardest part of the job is the fact there is no formal training and because the position is so demanding you have to really engage yourself in learning the processes quickly and efficiently. It is a very challenging position.Numbers driven corporate culture that preaches ""Genuine Concern"" for the client but will fire employees who do not hit their quotas regardless of leads generated from primary lead source.  Merchant market is saturated with competition.  Referral partner makes all the difference.  Decent salary, short sighted management, insufficient training, high turnover.Working with multiple banks all over inland empire. Following up and managing staff leads and progress in sales stage. Daily engagement with business owners and their staff to earn business and present business solutions. Closely work with management and staff to acquire business and cross sell more banking products. Being busy is always great, whether it's working on daily reporting or always being in communication with staff and clients.When I worked for First Data it was a great place to work. The benefits were very generous, stock purchase plan, good 401 k plan. The building in Marlborough was State of the art 10 years ago. A lot of the jobs are dependent on contracts with other companies.Days were never dull here, most people were loads of fun to work with, work was interesting enough to keep the job from being boring. management was awesome, my coworkers were fun, the managements did things from time to time to make the days fun and to motivate us all, the hardest part of the job was some of the deadlines that we had to meet to get come claims out. the most enjoyable was just the whole experience of the job.A very short time frame to complete quality work, if work flow is behind we only have a 4 hr window to  complete all work including work that is behind schedule time.The back up flow of work that comes from the day shift due to unseen delays by the system. Hard to maintain the quality of work the company so desires to produce. Very self rewarding at the end of the day with work all completed on time with no mistakes. Management has little knowledge of what it takes to complete all work including work delayed due to unseen delays. I get along with all my co-workers and help where ever I am needed.A typical day at work would be to get 25 fraud cases completed in 1 hour as possible. I enjoyed what my position was but do not make any mistakes. The management frowned dearly on those. You was always documented all of your mistakes. It would have been so much better to learn from them, they never corrected or showed you how to fix mistakes. I enjoyed my co-workers. My Manager never came out of the office.In business for over 35 years and well established in the Credit Card Processing Industry!  The had offices throughout the US and offered relocation packages to all employees.  I was able to travel the Eastern US at least 3 times monthly and able to establish relationships with a lot of well known organizationsI enjoyed working at First Data.

I am a motivator, encourager, moral builder, success driver through my personal approach of Servant Leadership to the people I support.I liked my job as loan specialist working with titles daily. Learned a lot about the Auto Finance Industry that I didn't know prior. No micro-management will you work, able to listen to music, fun and family atmosphere celebrating all occasions, flexible family life. Able to earn funds toward your MRA account for medical expenses. Enjoyed that occasionally we received breakfast and lunch served an employee appreciation and many more Perks!A typical day at work for me is interacting with my team of 18 specialists. I coach on call opportunities, after listening to live calls. Review performance metrics and discuss opportunities for improvement. I am available to assist with escalated calls from clients. I approve payroll and enter information in employee personnel files. I review emails to determine information to pass down to my specialists so that they are always in the know.Very stressful environment.  The customers don't stress you out; the management does.  You get monitored on every call and if you don't use the right phrase, you get a policy and procedure error.  One error gets you a performance improvement plan.  Two errors gets you a written warning,  Three errors in a 2 month period and you're out.  It would be easy to avoid if they didn't keep changing policy consistently.  And there's no easy way to look up policy.  They don't have it in a nice neat little book that you can reference.  It's every where on the intranet and connected to several links.  If you don't memorize it, you're out.  Good luck.  Everyone is always on a PIP!Started great but moved to the numbers game of 12 minute resolution times and extreme micromanaging.You were questioned why you were not on call if 1 minute has passed between calls. Bathroom breaks were refused until the managers decided it was ok and then gripes if it lasted over 10 minutes. Much hidden politics and cut-throat environment where unless your work can directly benefit a higher-up, you were just a replaceable.i dont want to rant about a company but i will say this ! i will never advise anyone to work for this company. Under paid and over worked. Also no appreciation of your hard work . I was a bank teller with many many rolls.  I did the work of a full time employee  but would never get full time pay. My manager was very very fake ! She lied to me on countless occasions . I really hated working here and i think that is job is only good for a temporary moment (2 months) and thats it.Hands down most horrible job I've ever had.  Kiss the work life balance goodbye.  You will work way more than 40 hours and you will work 6 days a week.  There are always a few nice customers, but depending on if you are in a bad part of town, most customers are awful.  I got screamed at, spit on, had stuff thrown at me, and called every name in the book.  It is personally your fault when their account is overdrawn and they can't qualify for a loan.  The pressure that upper management places on the employees to ""provide a great customer experience"" is ridiculous.

My position was stressful because I was trained for 2 weeks and then my support went out on maternity leave.  In her absence I was doing the job of 4 people and doing it really well.  I had great support from the other departments.  There was one hiccup that the copy editor was not good and only got worse after being promoted.  Ultimately she went on a power trip and Chase merged with Bank One.  Right after that our department was downsized and she was laid off.  Eventually we were all let go.Working for JPMorgan and Chase was an eye opening experience. During my time there I realized how society viewed banks. While working there, often times Occupy Atlanta came by to protest during the end of our shift leaving us hostage in the bank until enforcers came to break it up. This was during the time families were losing there houses to Chase because of mortgages not being paid. It was definitely a learning experience but I still found ways to enjoy the job by making connections with my daily customers.Banks are all pretty much the same.  I don't really have anything good or bad to say.  You are either interested in working at a bank or you are not.  You learn the rules of the game or you will lose. Politics are everywhere.  The difference with Chase is this - they get what they want and will pay you for it.  Don't be afraid to ask for an out of range salary.  You may be surprised depending on the line of business. Otherwise a bank is a bank is a bank.Dealing with inbound technical calls, billing statement inquires, deposit information, general account inquiries.Couldn't ask to have met better people in the time I was there.Management wasn't the greatest. There was a lot of favoritism and unfairness.The hardest part of the job was dealing with the occasional irate customer.The most enjoyable part was the gratitude of the merchants when getting their needs / issues resolved.very busy typical daylearned a lot of legal terms, to be independent, multi tasking and how to deal with the attorneys and how to manage timevery knowledgeable and understanding managementresponsible and very efficient co-workersto download documents because it was a repetitive task using copy and paste with hundreds and hundreds of documents or more for each loanflexible time of work, going to have fun with the whole department like having a group trip to the movies, watching dodger games and have fun bowling as an incentive of the company to the employees and the free good food.Overall the benefits and pay are in line with company standards.The culture is very competitive. It's a great place to challenge one self and develop strong leadership skills. If you are proactive there are tons of groups and company supported community events that you can become involved with. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping clients reach their goals and helping employees grow.DEVOPS Lead role was challenging as I had to analyse all manual work and come up with a scope for automation. Define automation roadmap to team. We as a team had spent many hours in fixing things right for Development and Testing team. work used to be interesting and challenging. We also used to have fun at work. We had a very supportive manager who gave us complete freedom to explore automation options and gave design liberty. He used to review and understand the process better and was a good mentorManagement is supportive and provides allows staff to work in an environment in which is positive and allows for growth.Work from home employee for 4 years work independently meeting requirements and deadlines.Organizational changes happening so often do present challenges in processes at times.Making new relationships with other parts of the organization when working new projects and learning new skill sets when processes change are always an exciting part of the job.","10,000+",New-York,New York,NY,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/1a455926-8770-4a9c-8c3a-4d1dc2aaccb3?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
84,2498.0,Data Scientist - US Customer Data Science,American Express,4.2,3200.0,"Amex was a growth opportunity in my career change from insurance to travel industry.  I enjoy working with the cardmembers the most.  I disagree about the management use of survey systems but I realize that is a part of the customer service world.The company changes and reacts often.  Jobs have recently been outsourced to Philippines and India. Amex does what makes Amex money. They do not care if you see your family. They monitor bathroom breaks.  There is no freedomAmerican Express is a great place to get your foot in the door if you're interested in banking. It's fast paced which means things are always changing and you end up learning something new almost everyday.AmEx is a great place to work at. You get tons and tons of project management experience and the company loves to think outside the box.lots of consultants hired and cycled through - most of the foreign.Very large environment. Lots of bureaucracy could have been a much simpler environment.Must be very technical to survive. very long commute from where I live.Best company I've worked for to date. Great group of people, awesome environment, state of the art technology and plenty of activities to break up the daily race stress.Great place to work, unfortunately the contractor with them that I worked for lost the contract.  People that I worked with were very professional and of good character.American Express is a great place to work.  The finance division is now Ameriprise.  I can only hope that it is still the same great company.-On site food market, great lunches!-Learned the importance of professionalism -Managers are there to work by your sideGreat company to work for both as an employee and contractor.   Always new opportunities to expand knowledge of technical and business skills.   I enjoyed the people that I worked with on a daily basis.I held a variety of jobs working for this company which was great. I was able to learn and grow everyday. The clients were nice and I enjoyed the office team. I was very proud of my office team. We made our deadlines and help advisors all over the market group. I initially set up how we would do our technology and marketing areas. We did well and other market groups were interested in how it was done. Then, our home office wanted to streamline the marketing and took back the distribution and allocation process. This made it very difficult for us to obtain the numbers we were getting. My hands were tied by home office and I could not find a work around to please the Group Vice President. However, in dealing with this process, I was able to get back $11,000+ back to the market groups budget.I worked here for several years and there just didn't seem to be much room for advancement. Many times they hired from outside of the company instead of promoting internal employees.I loved working in American Express. They always take care of the employee needs.I worked in American Express for 27 yrs and I got nothing to critized.American Express pretty much left me in the dark most of the time. Very little communication about the job or who exactly cares. Most communication was via a team member whom I did not really answer to. They seemed quite disorganized cared little about my skillset or utilization of them. I often had no idea if my job was going to be dissolved due to transitions even though I was praised and had high marks as a top performer. Often 'other' teams handled issues with very little explanation as to why. Such teams may or may not respond to any communication attempts possibly passing the buck when contacted. Processes for handling specific 'areas' were typically inept at best and appeared frequently mishandled. They seemed very 'low-tech' which was the opposite of what my impression was before working for them.Amex has an environment that allows for employees to cultivate themselves and the company. The work life balance has been key.Great organization. They really have the work at home segment nailed down. Training could use a bit more consistency and more mentoring time would be beneficial. Especially in the live-call listening. Overall the experience and culture is inclusive. One does not feel like a number in this vastly huge company.Great place to work following a structured environment.  The company believed in their mission and vision and give their employees hope for advancement and security.Loved working at American Express. One of the best companies I worked for. Great environment, team and reachable managers. Intellectually stimulating work.Amex encourages employees to try new positions, challenge themselves, and broaden their horizons. It is a great and fun place to work and the people are awesome.They pay well, have fair benefits, good work life balance and attempt to create a positive culture. However, they are behind the times in product growth and frequently make bad decisions that effect the entire company. Every year, if not twice a year people wait with baited breathe to see if they will be one of the people getting axed in the current ""reorganizing"" round. The last round consisted of 10% of the entire company. Very shaky and unstable. You constantly feel insecure.as in any large company, there is a lot of politics and power play involved.  Working for a strong brand with very smart people is always a thrill.  great work life balance and love that they bring in speakers from different industries.","10,000+",New-York,New York,NY,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/1a249014-2bc5-454c-9036-74cd97661530?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

The job has ebbs and flows, people are always willing to train. There's a lot to learn and management is very encouraging.CBS Corporation is a mass media company that creates and distributes industry-leading content across a variety of platforms to audiences around the world. The Company has businesses with origins that date back to the dawn of the broadcasting age as well as new ventures that operate on the leading edge of media. The project is about creating ETL processes to populate summary data structures and development of stored procedure queries to investigate data issues or to create new reports structures for business units.Working independently and with team to monitor timely and proper reviews of all 50 state regulatory and financial quality standards through adherence to policies and protocols.Communicate effectively to management team, associates and other claims units; sharing best practices; support initiatives to ensure expected outcomes.Difficulties involved signing into many different systems to accurately review the entire claim handling process.I enjoyed traveling with my team to several claims offices to deliver results and receive feedback on our observations.A typical day consisted of completing adherence and compliance and other metrics concerning my team. I answered questions and handled escalated calls. I learned from my immediate supervisors how to maintain a work and at home balance. I learned from my co workers that it is ok to have some kind of fun in the workplace instead of it always being a serious workplace. The hardest part of my job was talking to people that just received the news that there illness was terminal. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I changed the work atmosphere for the better.Not a great place to work. Company seems to be going through many changes. There is excessive work, bad software and tedious processes... not a good combination.  They will work you like a slave picking cotton.  The company is sacrificing their employees with too many cuts. This is the only place that I know of that hires so many temps and they stay hoping to get a full time position.  Very deceitful, immature and messy management.  They are threaten by real professionals. Over aggressive men.They replaced all of the worker bees and kept all the Chiefs who play Machiavellian politics. The company is in serious financial turmoil due to its high expenses compared to its peers and low profits. It is difficult to drive change and get things done in this highly political environment that is more focused on manipulation, perception and self interest vs. getting the work done and doing what is best for the company. The GTO leadership is out of touch with what is going on as none of them physically work in Cary NC. However, they require all of their minions to physically go in the office each day.I liked the job, I just wished it would've last longer. I wanted a permanent position but I was led to believe there were none available and found out later that there were. I was contacted for an interview and a couple days later was told the position had been filled. I thought that was a bit unprofessional to mislead me into thinking the position was available and contact me for an interview and then cancel the interview.Was brought in as a temp to enroll Washington State employees; Letter that was sent to customers had wrong information.  Customer was told that they will have a smooth transition and keep the same coverage, which was true but they were not told that the monthly cost would change.  I asked for help with issue multiple times and management seem like they did not want to helpThe culture and technology stack were both in disarray.It's not possible to review the current state of Metlife since things have changed dramatically since I left. Staff have been removed, the operations center relocated and many functions outsourced.During my tenure, there wasn't a clear direction leaving technical staff with the task of discerning what needed to be done.The company overall is very friendly, and the environment is very welcoming and relaxed. The open space allows for visibility of all employees and creates a sense of family and partnership. They also have many company events which allow for individuals to to take a break, share experiences and network.They gave excellent training in both insurance and financial services Good compensation and recognizable name made sales much easier.  Time with family, as single parent, not what I wanted it to be and when I remarried wanted to go back to retailing.5 stars I would definitely recommend Met Life as well as Mercy hospital to a friend or family member looking for employment or a good career choiceI loved working at Metlife. The compensation was just ok. I was working in an entry level position and just felt like I needed to be more challenged. The environment was very relaxed, almost too relaxed. Sometimes I felt that the dress code was too relaxed. Sometimes you felt like you couldn't tell the difference between someone on the street, or someone who worked there.Lots of work to do great oppurtunity for growth in other areas of investments. The people are great lots of fun activities and great oppurtunity to volunteer in the community.Work from 730-430 with an hour lunch, small office and all co-workers work great together.  Casual work environment and flexibility to be able to work from home if needed.  My position requires multi-tasking everyday.  I am in charge of making sure that office supplies are ordered as well as office technology is working including computers, fax machines, printers, ect.  I also work directly with our Sales people in making sure deadlines are met to get Ancillary proposals out to customers as well as prospects.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the relationship that we have in the office.  Everyone really works as a team.  The hardest part of my job is during peak season when RFPs are coming in like crazy and making sure that I due dates on my calendar for me to meet.Paid less than promised, great people in a new building. Blind corruption by upper management. A good place if you are Not White, under 40  and have a sheepish personality. Your helping to offload work to offshore and excessive Vendor costs. Requests for technical training ignored. Great diversity . Give, give and live a short life on this happy campus. Work hard so you are replaced as soon as possible. There is no HR service, mentoring or conflict resolution. Read these reviews, many agree the MetLife workers strive in a leadership dead zone. Smile and remind yourself that the mantra is: Me, Me, Me, what is here for Me today ?Childish, irresponsible management.  The whole environment is a popularity contest.  Treats people like criminals when you have completed your duties and your temporary position has run it's course.  Only positive is that they allowed as much overtime as you could possibly manage.MetLife definitely deserves the high rankings from big name diversity groups. The culture is very inclusive and that makes it easier to do your job. The only bad thing is very little paths for advancement.Worked there for many years, but recent changes are making adverse effects to the business. Managers are hit or miss. There are more bad managers than good managers. Working from home is difficult because managers do not receive any training or guidance on how to manage people who work from home.I began my work at Met Life working as a part time employee while attending college. Once I graduated from college I was offered a position working in their computer department. I worked at Met Life for twenty nine years and ascended to a supervisory postion. I truly enjoyed my time here.Upper level management can be demanding. Met Life just sold all retail operations this year - so things may be completely different now.Wonderful support staff - convenient offices and lots of perks.

The only time i would come and work would be when there had a patient for me. I would always come after class and maybe have one or two clients.ARCH was a great learning experience. It allowed me to help those who were in need. A typical day at work varied because each day was different. Most days were booked meeting with clients to assist them in their needs.

The most enjoyable part of the job was was working in a group and fun people.I worked in different chase branches. The managers are the one who either suck the life out of you, or help you advance. I was lucky to have 2 great managers! Some busy locations can be stressful for tellers, but bankers can really profit from sales. Slower branches are better for tellers, and bad for bankers, due to sales.Great place for career minded people, room for mobility and advancement.  Great team atmosphere and partnership across functions and businessesEveryone is very helpful put they do not have the best mgmt in place. they have to many layers and things get stuck in the system.need to become more streamline.A great company to work and have met some good people working there including the CEO, who is one of the most down to earth guy you can meet because his head is not in the clouds and he knows how to use the power.However, the subculture of poor managers needs to be better!A typical day at work consisted of compiling numbers for various reports due to numerous legal entities across the globe. This was challenging work but rewarding.If you like a fast pace environment, this is it. I liked the culture, the people, the activities and the most important, I was really happy with my day to day duties and my team.Great atmosphere at work, professional and friendly co-workers, fast paced environment with lot of networking and customer service.I love working for Chase they have great benefits I just want to do something different. Will love to experience something different been in the banking business for 16 years.JP Morgan Chase was a great company and I would recommend anyone that is thinking about getting into the banking profession to consider this company as a perfect place to start.You meet a new person everyday at Chase. I've learned so much from cash handling to dealing with fraudulent customers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with irate customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know your customers and building lasting relationships with them.","10,000+",New-York,New York,NY,2016-11-19T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/80da4999-85e8-4210-bcf8-1403249ae1d3?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=7,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

94,2508.0,Data Scientist,VDart Inc,3.1,27.0,"VDart is an awesome place to work. People are very helpful, prompt, supportive and professional. My recruitment and on boarding was quite quick and seamless.They gave me an excellent opportunity and I have been hired by the client fulltime. I have referred my friend and he has been working with VDart for the last few weeks, they gave me a referral fee as well without asking :)This was one of the worst experiences ever. They are in India and you really cannot understand them. I had to send and resend my paperwork I don't know how many times. It's like it got lost in some black hole and it's personal information (which is a little scary.) There insurance is ridiculously expensive.  There management team is very young but my issue with them is they had no idea what you were doing on a day-to-day basis.  They were not trained for what we did. They came from other projects and were constantly stressed out. There was no consistency.The Best Company I have ever worked. Good work ethics and friendly environment.Well Qualified and experienced Staff.It was an immense pleasure to work with Vdart Inc.Fun and exciting company. You get to be involved in a lot of things you wouldn't experience in a large company. Get more knowledge on different skills as this organization spends more money on making the employee be cross skilled as well. Has good number of clients and well established technical expertise to kick-start your career. Leads are very cooperative and lots of opportunity to make money.This is the worst agency i ever worked for. They don't appreciate the business and it's not that easy to get paid. I have to fight for my money every month.VDart is an awesome place to work - great people, great technology, great challenges, great package and perks. Professional growth is encouraged. There's not a sense of clock-watching or micromanagement in the organization. You are trusted to perform. The culture encourages you to work above and beyond, and can help folks progress their careers. Smart, hardworking people, good managers, training is available, benefits are very good, work is interesting, culture is pretty goodThe company has a good management team. In the initial stages I had a few problems but the company took a great effort and initiative in solving them. They respond to emails in time. Some  people in the company lack communication which the company needs to overcome. Overall I suggest its a great company to work with.This is an excellent place to work with and it is still going great. They have an excellent team in India that were extremely nice and helpful. There were endless opportunities and an excellent environment over there. Everything was great except for one small thing: communication skills. Now, obviously since they worked in India, the employees over there could not speak perfect English, but it was not only that, they would sometimes not email me on time and not explain why. It was the only bad thing that i experienced, but it was still a great experience and i would definitely work with them again.These people say they are in Georgia, but their workers are in India.  They barely understand English.  And here's the big thing.  They lose your paperwork on purpose so they won't have to pay you!  That is beyond stupid!  I've literally been waiting for my first paycheck for three months all because they keep claiming: ""We don't have your paperwork.""  Despite the fact that they give me the address that I put on the envelope, somehow it still gets lost in the mail.After promising a rate, they went back on it and offered a lower rate. Their attitude sounds unprofessional. They call at inappropriate times. They do not provide their real names and go around using fake names.Everything started off so good....nice people, great pay, even benefit coverage for consultant at a reasonable amount.The problem: no pay day!  I have adjusted my lifestyle to a once a month payday and now you tell me that youre sorry about this oversight?  This is not acceptable! I have been a contractor for over 20 years and this has ""never"" happened.  Even worse...there is no one locally to help resolve, only the guy overseas who never resolves anything...constant swirl and fake promises.  Management needs to really, really get this together as this type of behavior lacks integrity and breeds total mistrust.The recruiter scheduled a fake interview apparently as a joke.  I waited for a response as to why the client never showed up for the interview and never heard from vDart.  Very professional !!!VDart is a great company to work for. I never had to call the company for any issues while working as a contractor for 6 months. With their good efforts I was also able to get a full time opportunity in the company I worked as a contractor. Thank you VDart.Been with VDart for over 5 years now, incredible learning experience so far, fun place to work, creativity at its best, provides adequate growth opportunities. Strong mentoring program delivered by industry leaders in which employees get to participate. Uses latest tools for employee engagement.I have worked with this company as a contractor almost for 3 Years till now. Very good management and the employers pay in time. They answered all my calls with patience and helped me during my immigration . I am very glad to work with them.I have been calling these folks for days after being told I was supposed to begin my assignment on July 1, 2014.  I put in a notice for this job.  I cannot get anyone to return my call...not even the second party client (HCL America).  I am supposed to start working through HCL America and TIAA-CREF since the three interviews I had produced a job offer but no one will return my calls.  Do I start tomorrow and if so...where?  Hey, this is affecting my livelihood.  This isn't India..this is the US and we have laws against this type of action, don't we?Got to learn a new tool and new technology.Working environment was friendly.This is the worse contracting agency I've worked for.  After contracting for the last 9 yrs, I have to say this particular contract is a mistake. They say they have an office in Atlanta, but they never want to talk on the phone.  They always ask for an email but do not respond to the email.  You end up calling them back.  45 days to get your paycheck?  That's not an industry standard.  Want it earlier?  Sure.  They'll work with you for a price.  1.5% of your pay to get it 30 days after invoice (which is actually the standard), and 3% if you want it two (2) weeks after invoicing.  But they will not guarantee you'll get it on time, even though you are paying them to get it to you on time.They will push you to do corp to corp.  No support structure.  Their only interest in you is that they get a paycheck from you.  They have no idea what's taking place on-sight.  When you explain it to them, they ask for an email but never respond.  I've turned in my notice and I'm moving on.  Take my advice, don't make the mistake like I did and take a job with this company.Prior to the contracting job, VDart handled the paperwork and was able to clearly and professionally answer all my questions.  During the contracting job, VDart answered completely any questions or concerns.  The first payment was missing, but it was quickly resolved.  Future payments onwards were on time with advance email communication that payment was issued.  Overall a positive experience.  Would work with VDart again in the future.Great pay..provide you the required documentation on time...good marketing  team...i dint had a any issue with themFor the year and a half I worked through VDart I have to say that it was a positive experience. Everytime I had an issue with the customer, my VDart rep worked hard and fast to resolve the issue. Most of the time this involved going to bat for me to get me more money. By the time I left my ending rate was 20% higher than my starting. I've never had a company get me raises without even asking for it.","501 to 1,000",New-York,New York,NY,2016-11-15T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/4b1c2dbb-8e4d-4b4d-9960-700e4f8e1aed?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

It's not a typical day job.This business was convenient for me because I was able to stay at home with my son the first two years of his life. It is very well organized.Do what you love, make it happen.On my free time, I work on designing the wedding floral parasols, I get to use many different kinds of materials.My mother and I currently own 3 shops together. When we started this 3yrs ago we had 1 shop and I did the photography, loaded the photos to the laptops, edited the photos, and she did the rest. This worked for quite a while and we even managed to open a 2nd shop but then I got sicker, at that time, and she had to take over everything. Eventually I got better and was able to start up social networking which brought in some views (not a lot but more than before) to the shops. So it ended up that she runs the shops and I run the net (which kinda became a thing of it's own).My mother goes to garage sales, second-hand stores, estate sales, etc. to find things almost every weekend. She takes photos in the mornings and loads them to her laptop when she gets the chance. She does thorough research on all items as well as VERY thorough packaging.The company is a good company, the people are amazing, its stellar.

Politics are not prevalent, and employees have a genuine interest in helping you out.Etsy was great in the sense you had complete freedom to choose your work load and schedule. Complete control over your marketing,  design and management. On the downside, you had to juggle many roles at once.Etsy HQ is a warm and truly unique workspace. It offers an open-air seating arrangement with communal desks. The company has made a proactive commitment to sustainability and provides quality, locally sourced goods for employee meals and events. This is a non-discriminatory environment that actually celebrates individuality, promotes gender equality, and encourages work to be executed colorfully, thoughtfully, and communally. There is an attitude that we all have something to learn from one another and that everyone's ideas can propel Etsy's teams to greatness and the company to higher ground.I love working for myself, however the income is not steady enough for my household needs.Great way to make money working from home.  I've been searching for a job for quite a while, and selling on Etsy has kept my head above water for quite a while now.I enjoy the flexibility of selling handcrafted items on Etsy.com. I can easily work from home or when I am traveling.Though products on Etsy are sometimes priced unfairly by the people who use the site, Etsy has become famous for helping artisans connect with their audience worldwide.

98,2512.0,Senior Investments Data Scientist,AIG,3.8,915.0,"The company has had turnover in senior management over the last decade.  This unfortunately has created an environment of chaos with regards to having effective management in place.  Many managers typically stay in their office and it is up to the employee to approach the manager vs. the manager actually setting clear and direct communications.  This leads to the overspending of funds for system enhancements and/or projects.  A number of the Project Managers hired recently don't seem to know how to manage a project as those project managers from years ago.  It is unfortunate this company gone from being a great company (with some issues, needless to say) and many, many dedicated employees to a company of counting $$$, which it is wasting on an immense basis.Good work life balance and great benefits. Shift differential for over night shift and benefits for the weekend. International company that has many other offices for international opportunities.There was no room for advancement unless you wanted to move to the technical side of the house and then that wasn't guaranteed. Lots of lay offs with the administrative staff.Really depends on the department you work. During my time there, the company was going through a lot of restructuring which involved a lot of lay offs. So as you can imagine, that environment wasn't really the greatest to work in as many people were worried about Job security. My favorite part about working there though were my managers. Their open door policy, honesty, among many other things made working there quite pleasantI learned a lot at AIG and the management is generally easy to work with.  The hardest part of the job was the way systems were sometime implemented.  The people were the best part of the job.Productive Workplace. I have worked with AIG for eight years and I am currently looking for a Customer Service or Administrative position.They were a great company to work for. They were supportive of all the employees and their job goals. Management and co-workers were very helpful and friendly.Good place to work for a big company, but you only learn a small piece of the company. The people are fun and the environment is okay. Lots of overtime during quarter end, but overall was okayAllowed myself to have creative freedom in a relaxed atmosphere, with great management. AIG did the best to accommodate me for the high costs of living in the San Francisco Bay Area. Only downfall was being laid-off during company cutbacks from a job I truly enjoyed.Overall, I enjoyed my 10 years with AIG.  AIG chose to exit the Employer and Voluntary Group Benefits business and in doing so allowed them to align more closely with the company's organizational goals and vision.  As part of this strategic reorganization, my position as an Account Service Rep, along with hundreds of others, no longer fit in with the new direction AIG is currently undertaking.I enjoy working at AIG.  Awesome teamwork environment.  The work life balance is great.  The management style is very open and laid back.  The most enjoyable part of the job is finding great talent to join the organization.I really enjoyed my time at this company.  I was given the opportunity to learn many areas and had the chance to do all aspects of different positions from data entry, processing, scanning , mail sorting to applications.This was a good job for me to bridge my job loss from AT&T to retirement. I would recomment this company for other job applicants.Overall my experience at AIG was not good. Not clear who your reporting to. 3 changes in management in a 6 month period. Overwhelming tasks, Work/Life balance almost non existent.Head of Department resigned 3 months after I resigned. Good for a single person who is a workaholic.The management is very engaged with their staff and everyone works towards one goal...the customer.  This is a very professional environment with skilled individuals.Handled workers comp claims from beginning to end.  Was allowed to work from home 4 days a week.  Co-workers are very helpful.A typical day at work is a stressful one wondering when you are going to be laid off.  AIG is not a bad company and there is a lot to learn but Management has been concentrating more on the layoff of employees instead of making the employees happy and give them an incentive to stay with AIG.No raises are given.  Benefits are good but moral is not.  The day is like a sword hanging over your head wondering what time it will fall on your head.Could be a great company but it fails.  Different departments doing the same work in different fashions,  why not stream line and handle calls, disbursements and other transaction the say way among all department.  AIG does not value it's employees.enjoyed working as a scheduler but was working 3 jobs and could work the hours. It was too much to handle the hours. I called clients that had a retirement fund with the company and scheduled meetings with their adviser to go over their retirement goalsVery political , high turnover, employee gets burned. there's not too much advancement. stay there not long, can't comment on too much. Can this sight not force people to write review ?Great opportunity to meet people from all walks of life and different parts of the world.

Culture is fun but as a loyal employee one wants to grow and feel appreciated by the company.  Some of the managers are a bit unexperienced (not all) and very young.  The lack of experience can create difficult situations.  The company has great clients and brands but you will not be assigned to a role because of your skills.  If they need a body, they will trow you into the fire.  To survive in this culture you need to constantly be kissing arses.  You will work hard but that's given.Good place to work in sapient environment.Financial growth as well as skill enhancement..Decent pay master and work life balance is very good for recruiters when compared to other similar consulting environmentSapient is an employee friendly place and compensation is good  too. Leadership is approachable.Work culture is fun and they do lot of activities and parties too.Hardest part of the job is time management sometimes.People are friendly and socializingIn my experience, there are 2 types of people who work here.1. Who identify themselves very strongly with the Sapient culture. They work hard, party harder. Dont hesistate to take responsibilities, risk-takers and cool people to hang out with.2. Who are content leading easy lives. Work just so much as needed. Nothing more, nothing less.The career path, compensation etc. is driven by whioch category you belong to.Overall, the company is good. Encourages you to come up with creative solutions. A sincere effort is more often than not acknowledged!The real talent at Sapient lies in the mid-career stage workers. These are the architects, the designers, the developers, and the PMs who tirelessly work to successfully deliver projects for clients.You can expect a culture of hard work with limited reward and work/life balance. On the up side, there are really smart people working on interesting things for high profile clients.Sapient is a company that truly values their workforce where they value you as a PERSON first, and then utilize your skill second.  A strong job culture that, when you're the right fit, you harmonize with your peers and create and complete amazing projects.  I call it ""Google Consulting"".  If you're looking to be inspired by the work you do, and the people you work with, I highly advise you to find your place in this company.i enjoyed each and every minute in the company i really had a good experience with them.And the co-workers where really very good and i was really comfortable working with themTeam are global so you often work outside of NA timezones. Good overall culture and flexibility is offered.Overall it is fun with lots of activities and work going on. Office design is awesome.Good working environment, fun place.Most enjoyable part: Bagels on Wednesdays and Fridays.Nice place to work for Business  Consulting in the midstream industry. People who want to work on the area of Business devlopement & Long Term Client relationship, strategic Partnering with Clients...this is the place to go to. Also recently taken over by a french company Publicis which also has Digitas and Razonfish under the same umbrella, so the possibilities are boundless in future. Sapient also imparts and encourages lot of trainings to grow their people in the area they want to. The houston office is limited to Global Markets business unit, mostly deals with oil and gas pipeline systems automation and TRM.Productive fun place to work with a foozball table.  Work life balance is important here.  Flat organizational structure helps approachability with leadership.Company is good for college pass out with wide spectrum of project to gain experience. Very slow progress for Manager and above. You need to watch your own back when on you go on Bench.The work and atmosphere entirely depend on the project that you are on. Most of the company is at the site of the client, half of Government Services is at NIH in Bethesda so there is not a lot of visibility among leadership there.OnPoint/Sapient has terrific people.  The company supported many of my change management initiatives.  It was rewarding to know I made a contribution through education and training.	Verifying the functionality of the Insurance portal. 	Developed Test plan based on testing requirements and created Test cases. 	Responsible for creating quotes and policies, calculate ITV and endorsements in  	Main Frame environment	Actively participated in enhancement meetings focused at making the application more stable for real time usage. 	Reviewed the bug reports in bug meetings with developers. 	Involved in various levels of testing including Smoke test between various builds and patches. 	Involved in UAT (User Acceptance Testing). 	Worked with agents to develop user UAT (User Acceptance Testing) for Internet-based busi-ness applications. 	SAP CRM GUI testingSapient is a great Company to work for.

We are responsible for monitoring the Title IV programs and ensure that all eligible students are being paid.I guess if you are in college and u need additional income its ok, but for an adult that actually has bills to pay, I wouldn't recommend it, you just wont make enough.

However, there is little promotion possibilities within the organization with only management receiving pay and title raises.Every day a new challenge. Knowing that your work will help future students to achieve their goals more easily is a priceless reward that only jobs in higher education can provide.On a typical day, I come in with a postive mindset and punctual manner. There is always something new to learn. I love to be diligent with my job and work in a professional and organized environment. The library I work for has many different departments which I have the great opportunity to learn the different functions of a college Library. There is room for growth. It helped to update my computer and office skills and learn new systems such as Aldeph and Outlook. I enjoy helping students with research, shelf reading, and training student aides. My job as a library Assistant helped me to gain more confidence with dealing with patrons and faculty. The hardest part of the job for me is dealing with aggressive, impatient students. But no matter the circumstance, I am patient and bring professionalism to the job.This was a temporary appointment, working in the college campus to keep all faculty, students and visitors safe. also being vigilant because there was a beach on campus as well.I was a work study employee so my job was seasonal as needed, but for the most part it was a helpful to me. Sorry I have nothing else to add.Supervising children. Management very friendly. Stable pay and hours given. Most enjoyable part was that it was in my college. No traveling.I enjoy teaching, since it lets me share my knowledge to upcoming graduates who are going to move forward in life. Solving complex problems, writing efficient algorithms is crucial to any software engineer.Talented IT professionals make up a great team.

I must admit however, the job can be challenging especially at the college level.

Also had a technical bar ,where we would meet with end users to resolve issues. Great place to work as long as you are ready to learn and go to work everyday with a clean slate. Best part of the job is your team! Very lax environment workload is distributed amongst , everyone is always willing to assist as long as you don't ask the same question constantly.This was once a great and fun company to work for. Times in the Miami office were wonderful and relatively smooth. Management had its faults but was overall great to work with. Coworkers felt like family. But once CEO ZAZLAV came around. The company went in to the toilet. While he gave himself huge raises every year. The company brand took a dive. Final straw was the move of broadcast operations to Sterling VA on June 2015. Worst mistake of my life to move up there for a year. Management in Virginia were and still are in over there heads. Wish they left our Miami office alone. We had a good thing going here.I worked at Discovery for 3 years and watched at least three rounds of layoffs. The co-workers, benefits, work environment, and pay are great. However it is clear that the greed of higher ups has effected the way they do business and the corporate culture. Management is back stabbing and looking out for themselves, as they have to be when no ones job is secure.I worked at Discovery Communications for 3 years. Discovery as many other companies offers great benefits: Salary, 401K, Legal Service, Fitness Reimbursement, tuition reimbursements, Health & Dental plans (Extra: On Site- Wellness Center & Health fairs) However, most companies offer some or all of these benefits to stay competitive.Discovery is going through a huge change in direction, less creative, innovative and exploratory to a more public corporate culture. Focus more on short-term results rather than long term growth to make quarterly and yearly earnings expectations. Let's don't forget that this is likely to get worse since Discovery has been cutting and shifting away positions towards Latin America and Europe.As a working mother, I struggle with being a good mom and being good at what I do.  I can honestly say Discovery has been an amazing place to really enforce work life balance.  With on-site day care, wellness, fitness and options to telework, I've been able to juggle my career and shuttle kids to girl scouts, sports, doctors, and talent shows.  Although my salary could be improved, I think Discovery makes up  for it with other benefits.I am grateful for the opportunity that Discovery has given me these passed 2 years. This organization has been a wonderful launch pad for my career and allowed for both tremendous personal and professional growth. I am fortunate enough to be under an amazing management team that really nourishes professional growth. I have demonstrated the compromise of my role as a Programming Manager, developing working tools that have allowed me to get a better overview of the objectives and have helped me to make the best strategic decisions.  I have demonstrated my competency in the business process, creating competitive programming strategies aligned with the region needs, monitoring broadcast ratings and competitive landscape regularly and developing initiatives to support content strategies.They run a professional operation there.  It's obvious you're working for an industry leader with a high standard of excellence. (Although, standards have dropped a little and a dropping.) Management has made some dubious choices as to whom they promote. Publicly traded company; money is ultimately the bottom line, don't expect life-long loyalty.Discovery has been a good place to work. It offers good work-life balance and good benefits including on-site day care, doctor/nurse offices, and parental leave.Loved working for Discovery. Great culture, great benefits including maternity leave. A lot of women in leadership roles. Great HR staff.Great place work. Management works closely with the staff.  Lots of room to grow in the with many locations if you are willing to relocate.  always away of the status of the company.Great place to  work. Value is found in share price as is executive compensation. Recent layoffs do not help the majority of the company.Very political. They don't really care about your career growth. Upper management is very condescending and don't want to help others grow.The company is an excellent place to work for. Excellent place to start from fresh out of school. Good people to work with.  Good benefit. Good location and safe place to work.The relationship between management and staff is very lose. There is constant communication both formal and informal. A typical workday is the open discussions held to discuss how to better serve the clients. Management is open minded and spend a lot of time on the floor among the workers. Co-workers got along very well and shared mutual respect. They were also supportive of each other and very team oriented.The hardest part of the job is implementing new ideas that are recommended by the staff.And the most enjoyable part was making lasting friendshipLove the upbeat attitude of the workers. Close-knit group. After hours get togethers allowed us to get to know each other on a new level, which ultimately helped be successful on the job.Fun workplace with great people and a very balanced work / life atmosphere.  A great place to start your career and grow.  Lots of movement with a clear career path.Domestically, Discovery Communications is in transition, moving from a strictly cable media company. For example, a stronger focus has been but on digital media.* In Cost Center Accounting, created cost centers, activity types, statistical key figures, Cost Center Standard Hierarchy, cost center categories, document numbers, maintained default account assignments and automatic account assignments, validations and substitutions, distribution and assessment.* In Profit Center Accounting, configured Profit center structure, Standard Hierarchy, Configured Profit center Master Data, assigned different Controlling Objects to Profit Center Accounting.* Responsible for identifying and documenting all CCA and PCA test cases.* Generated reports using Report Painter and Report Writer.* Documented the configurations and prepared functional/ technical specifications.It was a very gratifying experience working for a great company like this. This place has good energy and people are very friendly. In addition to this, most of the people are very professional.I would say overall the company is great. However, there is not much movement or growth. It is also somewhat political. If your boss doesn't like you, you will not do well.Very helpful team of managers, supervisors, and editors.many times a month the company would hold classes for editors to learn programs such as photoshop and After Effects.","1,001 to 5,000",New-York,New York,NY,2016-11-05T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/a3484e55-d251-4c0f-bab6-4ee70305f805?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=19,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

106,2520.0,Data Scientist (geospatial),WeWork,3.4,14.0,"I worked at this company for almost a year, and although it was a wonderful opportunity for meeting cool entrepreneurs and networking, that was one of the ONLY pros. You work incredibly long hours (10-12 per day), and because people can be fired at will, they can also quit at will, so there was so much turnover that upper management never knew what to do. It seemed that decisions were made at whim, and new useless policies were implemented out of nowhere. Towards the end of my time there, there was such a huge push on sales that we were having to work weekend events to create more leads, and never received any overtime compensation other than free beer and food. Free food is nice, but work/life balance is better. No one on my team ever took a full hour for lunch, and eventually we started to feel guilty when we actually did. You have to plan and work weekly events, as well. Additionally, the pay is the same across the board, regardless of what city you live in, so kind of ridiculous to compare the San Francisco employees to the Texas employees. All in all, I would recommend this company if you just graduated and need experience, or are used to long hours and really love networking. But prepare to be disposable, and make a back-up plan.WeWork has amazing potential and if run properly has the ability to be a really great place to work. Until there are some serious changes in management I would not recommend someone to consider working at WeWork. The company refers to management style as ""fixing the plane while it is in the air.""working for wework is great. they have a fun vibe and twice a year you get to go on a company trip. the hours can be very long and you have to work some days after hours but other than that it is a grate place.The whole building was full of positive energy.Always get received with a good morning.fast pace work at times. all my coworkers great people supportive,work as a team.Everybody I have come in contact with has been supportive, welcoming, and encouraging. There is a fantastic sense of community here. You become a part of something huge and join a family. Everybody works extremely hard here. We all believe in providing the best member experience and that doesn't happen without hard work! WeWork is doing some amazing things and it's an amazing experience to be a part of! HR is extremely helpful and employees are treated with the utmost respect. You will get out of this job as much as you put into it!This was one of my favorite jobs I have been with! From the atmosphere, teamwork, and relationships you build, this company had it all! I loved working with everyone and learned so much from those I worked under. It not only helped me to grow as an employee but it helped me to grow as a person.On paper this looks like a great company but it is under paid for what the employee do and can't live off of the wage they pay its employeesWework was a good place to work at. Everyday I was greeted kindly by the people who's offices I had to collect trash from. The environment was great, and it was a job close to home to.the members were very rude someday and then there were days when they were friendly and comical. i learned a lot of cleaning habits.Great people but a chaotic and unpredictable environment. Little organization within departments and expected hours were 9-8:30 or 9. If you're looking for a decent work/life balance, do not consider a job here.Each day there are tasks that must be completed within a deadline such as building walk-through, follow up emails for visitor that have toured the office space, sales calls with market, team meetings among ourselves, and other member support related duties.Typically, I am the primary point person for all sales development in our building and also take most of the tours that are scheduled daily for the facility.Daily collaboration with multiple teams such as maintenance, IT, security, and cleaning staff as it relates operations, day-to-day supplies, and support tickets from members.Members are exclusively small business owners, startups, their staff, and our community management team.  These are people that I have development friendly connections with over the months and would speak highly of all.  WeWork provides the facility but the folks here create a truly enriching community experience that is beyond compare to a typical office space.Generally a good experience however there is very little opportunity for advancement from the property level. The corporate environment is very insular and doesn't provide much recognition to property managers for their efforts. I would recommend for someone right out of college but wouldn't suggest for a mid career individual. Also, high turnover and very little recognition from senior management.When i was working at Wework, i saw that it was very important that our customers had to have a clean environment and for to accomplish this, it important that we had a strong and responsible team.

109,2523.0,Data Scientist,Gilt,3.8,13.0,"GIlt is a young company with a lot of great people. My only complaint is the work life balance. There is no work life balance, specifically in merchandising. Due to the nature of the business (ecommerce) there is work to be done in office and at home such a site and sale maintenance. As a merchandising assistant it is not rare to stay in office for 12 hours a day without taking a break for lunch. There is so much to do which keeps you productive but it can become overwhelming.Gilt is an incredible place to work. Co-workers are inspiring, innovative, smart. One of the best professional experiences working among them. Fantastic managers.I loved working for Gilt! I learned so many new things and have strengthened my technical skills. Everyone who I worked with invested a lot of time in me and they were very helpful. Everyone is super friendly. The work environment is awesome! You can dress however you want as long as it is fashionable and presentable. Lots of free food available in the kitchen area! One thing you need to know - everyone works extremely hard. Get ready to put in a lot of hours. You have to be willing to have your hands dipped into various functions. There is a lot of ambiguity at times so get ready to asking a lot of questions and finding answers on your own at the same time.It was always a team effort. GILT would have fun pep rallies to keep us informed and ready to work. I found this job most fun on the Cherry picker.Underpaying, favoritism, little chance for advancement, unless you make friends with someone higher up. It seems the harder you work, the more they want to add to it, but if you come in, and be lazy they wont ask for anything.managers have ""favorites"" and will do anything in their power to get you fired if they dont like you. discrimination against all people. low pay. no fun to work at.Great workplace to learn about all positions from entry all the up the ladder. Hard work always pays off, and is always recognized,fun place to work and i went from having no friends when i started to having over 20 new friends..it was really a fun place to work....The best of Gilt is its people.  Smart, nice, hard workers.  The best job I ever had! There was opportunity to learn, build, train, test, and enjoy the success of the work well done.I really enjoyed working at Gilt. I got converted to the company after four months of working there as a temp. A typical day at Gilt went by fast because there was always work to do but the temperature inside was worst then the temperature outside. I loved all of my co - workers and got along with all of my supervisors and mangers pretty well.I just love this job the people was very friends and i love getting the change to meet new people.I loved working for this company! What a talented group to work with and the pay is great! they treat their staff well, and I have no complaints at all.

111,2525.0,SENIOR DATA SCIENTIST,Viacom,4.2,207.0,"Viacom has the greatest employees.  I was blessed with the greatest co-workers.  We all worked together, helped each other, and always taught each other new technologies each week.  We supported each other goals and accomplishments..  The people make it a great place to work.During my time a Viacom there were pros and cons .My experience at Viacom with my co-workers was very positive. The work environment was great, the projects I worked on were very exciting and challenging. My team pushed me to really grow professionally. Management typically has a difficult time making decisions on just about everything. Expect little value on work/life balance.If management put more into their employees they would have better retention. A single ticket here or there does not make up for time lost while in the office.The benefits were good but the salaries are usually lower.  Great place to start your career in media but you must be willing to work very long hours and be flexible with constantly changing priorities.  I loved working at BET, many cool people and a fun working environment.  The people were extremely nice and I enjoyed going to work.  Always areas for growth and the managers were always helpful.  Very talent group of people, dedicated to creative work.  I learned so much and would do it again in a heartbeat! I think one of the best companies to work for to learn and grow.Viacom is a dynamic company with so many brands that appeal to different generations of people. Get work life balance, relaxed work culture and open door policy. The people here are great! However, they do not pay their entry level employees well at all. Competitors are openly paying employees of the same role at least $10-15k more and sometimes even more. It can be disheartening that a company this large and successful focuses so much on compensating the big whigs, but then forget about the work horses that are keeping the company a float.The culture of the company is great but the senior C-level management is extremely oblivious to the issues the employees have.  Also, if you prove yourself and get promoted internally, you get screwed over with compensation.  They pay more if you leave the company and come back instead of rewarding you for being a loyal employee.Large company with a lot of room for advancement, I personally did not work with the company culture. I enjoyed my coworkers, but had a frustrating time working as a permalance employee.It used to be a great place to work but the creative culture has changed and lost some of its appeal lately. The benefits are still great but the salaries are usually lower.Working at Viacom used to be super fun but there has been so much restructuring over the last 2 years and there is a huge lack of communication and proper management.Great place to start your career in media.  Must be willing to work very long hours and be flexible with constantly changing priorities.This is a great company to work for however the pay is always less that what it should be for the position. It is very hard for employees to move up as the managing positions are usually hired from outside of the company.Check emails, check the queue, data entry, amend records, setup orders for pickups.I have learned how to write emails and improve customer service management is a little flaky a lot of nepotism and bad ethics as far as moving up within the department/company. My co-workers are friendly and nice and fun to talk and work with. There is really nothing difficult or challenging about this job anyone can do this job. The enjoyable part about this job is when my shift ends.I truly enjoyed working at Viacom...  Great culture that allows their employees to be innovative and successful.  Viacom offers great work and personal environment.The glitz and glamour of Viacom's shows and markets are fun and energizing, and there can be some fun perquisites, but at senior management levels it is serious business.Difficult to navigate internal politics if direct upper management not at same location. Frequent recent layoffs lead to no sense of job security.Working at Viacom was a fun experience.  I interned for my whole senior year a Comedy Central and Logo.  There were no entry level opportunities when I graduated college.  I worked with some great supervisors that cared about teaching the ins and outs of the business.Organization is filled with lots of great talented people, but overall most brands could stand to overhaul and improve their senior management. See the recent article about the culture shift at Google....I love working here - such cool work environment. People are extremely nice and I crave to come to work everyday. Sky is the limit to growth and your managers are always helpful to help you grow. I think one of the best companies to work for to learn and growMy time at Viacom was great. I would recommend it if you're looking to beef up your resume. The staff was great as well as the culture of the company.You can still get a free cup of coffee if you're ok with not having Starbucks.  Most people work here for years.  Some people grow while some stay in the same roles for years.  This place is what you make it but it's not as fun as it used to be I hear.the most enjoyable part of this job is being creative. i love the dynamic of my core team. however, we're poorly managed and poorly compensated for what we do. no space to grow.Great dedication to creative work. Great environment. Loved my time working with MTV2 Team! I learned so much as an intern here and would do it again in a heartbeat! I hope I get to freelance here sometime soon.","5,001 to 10,000",New-York,New York,NY,2016-11-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/54ce8823-2c27-41ca-8e16-bf2198139889?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=29,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

116,2530.0,Data Scientist,American International Group,3.8,915.0,"The company has had turnover in senior management over the last decade.  This unfortunately has created an environment of chaos with regards to having effective management in place.  Many managers typically stay in their office and it is up to the employee to approach the manager vs. the manager actually setting clear and direct communications.  This leads to the overspending of funds for system enhancements and/or projects.  A number of the Project Managers hired recently don't seem to know how to manage a project as those project managers from years ago.  It is unfortunate this company gone from being a great company (with some issues, needless to say) and many, many dedicated employees to a company of counting $$$, which it is wasting on an immense basis.Good work life balance and great benefits. Shift differential for over night shift and benefits for the weekend. International company that has many other offices for international opportunities.There was no room for advancement unless you wanted to move to the technical side of the house and then that wasn't guaranteed. Lots of lay offs with the administrative staff.Really depends on the department you work. During my time there, the company was going through a lot of restructuring which involved a lot of lay offs. So as you can imagine, that environment wasn't really the greatest to work in as many people were worried about Job security. My favorite part about working there though were my managers. Their open door policy, honesty, among many other things made working there quite pleasantI learned a lot at AIG and the management is generally easy to work with.  The hardest part of the job was the way systems were sometime implemented.  The people were the best part of the job.Productive Workplace. I have worked with AIG for eight years and I am currently looking for a Customer Service or Administrative position.They were a great company to work for. They were supportive of all the employees and their job goals. Management and co-workers were very helpful and friendly.Good place to work for a big company, but you only learn a small piece of the company. The people are fun and the environment is okay. Lots of overtime during quarter end, but overall was okayAllowed myself to have creative freedom in a relaxed atmosphere, with great management. AIG did the best to accommodate me for the high costs of living in the San Francisco Bay Area. Only downfall was being laid-off during company cutbacks from a job I truly enjoyed.Overall, I enjoyed my 10 years with AIG.  AIG chose to exit the Employer and Voluntary Group Benefits business and in doing so allowed them to align more closely with the company's organizational goals and vision.  As part of this strategic reorganization, my position as an Account Service Rep, along with hundreds of others, no longer fit in with the new direction AIG is currently undertaking.I enjoy working at AIG.  Awesome teamwork environment.  The work life balance is great.  The management style is very open and laid back.  The most enjoyable part of the job is finding great talent to join the organization.I really enjoyed my time at this company.  I was given the opportunity to learn many areas and had the chance to do all aspects of different positions from data entry, processing, scanning , mail sorting to applications.This was a good job for me to bridge my job loss from AT&T to retirement. I would recomment this company for other job applicants.Overall my experience at AIG was not good. Not clear who your reporting to. 3 changes in management in a 6 month period. Overwhelming tasks, Work/Life balance almost non existent.Head of Department resigned 3 months after I resigned. Good for a single person who is a workaholic.The management is very engaged with their staff and everyone works towards one goal...the customer.  This is a very professional environment with skilled individuals.Handled workers comp claims from beginning to end.  Was allowed to work from home 4 days a week.  Co-workers are very helpful.A typical day at work is a stressful one wondering when you are going to be laid off.  AIG is not a bad company and there is a lot to learn but Management has been concentrating more on the layoff of employees instead of making the employees happy and give them an incentive to stay with AIG.No raises are given.  Benefits are good but moral is not.  The day is like a sword hanging over your head wondering what time it will fall on your head.Could be a great company but it fails.  Different departments doing the same work in different fashions,  why not stream line and handle calls, disbursements and other transaction the say way among all department.  AIG does not value it's employees.enjoyed working as a scheduler but was working 3 jobs and could work the hours. It was too much to handle the hours. I called clients that had a retirement fund with the company and scheduled meetings with their adviser to go over their retirement goalsVery political , high turnover, employee gets burned. there's not too much advancement. stay there not long, can't comment on too much. Can this sight not force people to write review ?Great opportunity to meet people from all walks of life and different parts of the world.  Continued learning and sharing outlooks and outcomes of life experiences.","10,000+",New-York,New York,NY,2016-10-27T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/090f221b-0b9b-493d-8b2b-b5fdab4d28ca?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

124,2538.0,"Data Scientist - New York, NY",Brooks Brothers,4.0,199.0,"Needs to go public to fund growth. Allocation issues, but loyal following. Generations shop here. Quality is second to none, ties made in USA,With the retail climate it is not the time to reduce pay, take away 90% of the salesforce commission. Generally a very difficult place to work and many people leaving. I have stepped up my sales where I sell more than double the sales associate under me. I was named Senior Sales Associate due to my hourly rate was increased by eight dollars and hour.I work best when a company recognize and reward great employees and I am willing to give my best to do my job to the best of my ability.When I first was hired, BB was a great company to work for. Management changes and a poor retail environment resulted in no room for advancement, position wise as well as salary. Base salary is not based (at least for entry level) on skill/experience, but set at a specific value and isn't negotiable. Some co-workers became my best friends, other co-workers disliked me greatly and made it harder for me to do my work. No comp time for hours worked over 40, which I did often. Rarely took a lunch break- it was assumed you ate lunch at your desk. Employee discount was a huge perk.Brooks Brothers is a diversity company that gives every associate or member an opportunity to develop.You start above the minimum payment, and help to raise within your role, store and company.I enjoyed my time at Brooks Brothers I leaned business part of retail which is exciting.  Seeing product from inception to the store.Everyone needed to work well as a team in order to get goods on time.Typical day:  Answer emails, vendor questions, HK Team questions.Management: Was OK.  Co-Workers - GreatHardest part of my job- able to leave on-time.  Over-workedMost enjoyable part of my job - the people. Team envirementBrooks Brothers, has sadly, began the slow decline that so many retailers are now embracing. Associates, because they don't want salespeople anymore, are hourly, and not a very good hourly. Their seasoned staff, with books full of clients, are leaving. This is not a job to support a family, or to turn into a career. It used to be, but it just isn't that, and they're alright with that.The discount is very good, at 60% off. There is a built in client base, but that doesn't really matter, as you're not paid that way anymore. The stores are beautiful, and the product is luxurious, but the expectation of management, and the customer, of you, the associates, is no longer worth the money they're paying. If you want a good job, to make some money while in college, or to bridge yourself between jobs, no a bad gig, especially for the discount.Brooks Brothers is a company that continues to challenge its associates on a daily basis. A typical day in the assistant manager position involves ensuring day to day operations are met as well as surpassing sales goals. Through this company I've learned exceptional interpersonal skills and management styles that are imperative to running a successful business.The day usually begins with a meeting on Results, Execution, Performance, and Preparations (REPP). Over the years, I have learned how to provide excellent services to our diverse clients. Being reliable and efficient at all times. The management is very focused on building a ""great place to work"", putting smile on the face of all our clients, and meeting our targets. Co-workers are made up of people with diverse features but I enjoy working with them.Management is great. Easiest job I've ever had but is boring most of the time. Spend 90% of the time standing around with nothing to do.overall this is a great company and a great place to work, there are some things that need to be enhanced like every other job, but other then that management cares about their employees, and everyone is always willing to help each otherCompany has found ways to weed out associates who had been the backbone of the organization for years and kept generations coming through the door. Co-workers had their share of ups and downs including no more commission but try and work together for the most part.Like most warehouse work, the day is long and repetitive. The actual work isn't vert physically demanding though. I was trained in various duties, such as using scanners and operating forklifts. The management is very poor. Section Leaders are lazy and irritable, and upper management is very out of touch.Most co-workers are very friendly and helpful, but a large number speak little to no English. The hardest part of the day is the unrewarding work and low pay, but the people you work with might just make the day more enjoyable.The day to day workings of Brooks Brothers is just like any other retailer.  You help customers find what they are looking for; you process shipment; you help train any associates on areas that they might need a little help in; you work with the team to reach goal reach day.  What I have learned from here and from other retail jobs I have had it is about the people/team.  You need to find a good balance between a fun work place and a place where work comes first.  Part of that is knowing your team and knowing how to motivate them properly, however you need to set standards and expectations that are equal across the board. For me the hardest part of that balance is making sure the fun happens and that it is not just all work.  In the end the no matter how hard the work is or how difficult the customers might be, the people you work with make the job.  Our job really is people; how to motivate, personalize, sell too, or help out.  That is what I have learned as a manager and I think it has made me a better leader.Great owner, managment team and people,,associates are treated more like family than employees. I would recomend Brooks Brothers to anyone looking for a career in retailManagement and higher ups are used to doing things are certain way and are unwilling to change with the times. There is a lack of organization that needs to be worked on within departments.Brooks Brothers is a company that allows to interact and serve customers in an excellent manner.I truly enjoy selling, however with recent management chance and shrink rate, there has been alot of changes and with co-workers leaving the job and taking medical leaves and absences there has been toll on the remaining employees. With the amount of work and scheduled timing the pay rate isn't worth the effort.Overall, it is truly a great organization that hold amazing values, I love the clients and our products best.This place is ok because it can give you multi-task opportunity of working experience, and the shoppers from all over the world would make you see many aspect of personality in many people. Also, it would practice your skill of teamwork.this is a great company to work for except the general manager gets away with harassment and discrimination. no team work or upper mobility. you live on a island when you work for this company because they only see what they want to see....A typical day at work consists of keeping the store stocked and up to visual standards, shipping out any orders that have been placed, reaching out to customers, and above all providing exceptional customer service to everyone that walks in the door.  Management is fair, and willing to answer any questions.  They will not go out of their way to help you with everything---you are required to think for yourself.  Co-workers are someof the best friends I have.  We are a tight knit crowd.  The hardest part of the job is getting business in a mall that is failing.  The most enjoyable part is making a difference in a customers personal and professional life.Great company to work for. All of my coworkers are amazing people and fun to work with. Beautiful product to work with and the clients are usually pleasant to work with. Technology wise the company is pretty outdated.I enjoyed my time at Brooks Brothers I leaned business part of retail which is exciting.

Management was fair and worked towards continuous development of their employees.Given plenty of empowerment within the company, thought the performance appraisal process is flawed.  Also not enough involvement from upper managementnever seem to get to what you planned on, daily challenges to find answers and better processes, fun people to work with, plenty of coffee, on site cafeteriaA great place to work and wonderful working conditions. I learned a lot about security and obtained a number of certificates. The hardest part of job was the hours worked.very little interaction with senior mgmt., uncertain of job or career path. Do best to make co worker feel positive and they are serving a purposeLike most large organizations, National Grid balances their business needs (keeping the power on) with their need to prepare for the future.  As a company, they have many of the same challenges that every other organization has - not enough resources to get everything accomplished but the commitment of the employees is outstanding for the majority.  In crisis - storms, power outages, there is none better.This is a company where you can excel at many career paths as long as you take the ownership to improve your skills attitudes and beliefs.Expect the Best!An okay atmosphere for work, great people, but little compensation for workers. Involves long hours of receiving calls from customers. Job is great as you interact with customers of all types, some very angry, others just need help. A good and calm temperament is requiredExcellent place to work. Safety and reliability are alway number one. Spent 26 years with this great company where I learned so much about the electrical industry.Taking incoming calls, setting up dates for service to be turned on or off depending. Assisting customers explaining the breakdown of their account. Coworkers were alright. Training was very informative. Hardest part was reading the meter cards.National Grid is a good company to work for that provides employees with a good work to life balance. The compensation and benefits are on par with other large organization and management staff is easy to work with.Managers are really helpful and informative. Plenty of technical training and the benefits are very good. Plenty of on the job experience and an outstanding opportunity for growth.Wonderful environment. Call center and employee services and benefits resolution. Many levels of human resources.  Corporate support and training.  Would have loved to have stayed in the TDC.Decent company to work for.

Excellent exposure to industry professionals.Consultant role is more of a technology position than finance. You will be working with clients to help with research/problem solving from a technology standpoint and not from a strategic finance position.Good place for just after school settlement. The outdated technology in some groups make it dangerous to stick for a long time. Make a leap in 2-3 years.I liked the technical opportunities that were presented to me.  However, management did not have much of a presence.  There was no clear direction in regards to project management, which lent itself to ambiguity and inefficiency.fun and young environment good management. i enjoy.. free drinks. management is nice and co workers are easy to get along withPeople is expected to work 60-70 hours a week even though the company only pays 40 hours per week. Managers utilizes a micro-managing and fault-finding approach. Oncall rotation is not a real ""On call."" This is a poor excuse to make the engineers execute changes during the weekend and after hours during the week. Your weekend work is equal to 16-20 extra hours at least. Company does not pay overtime. Employees are not recognized for their extra efforts instead, they are treated as objects that belongs to them, therefore, you have to do what I want you to do.  There are not words to express the bullying approach used by managers to their employees.Consulting for FactSet Research Systems was my first job out of college and was the perfect gateway into the working world.  The company entrusted me with responsibility from day one and taught me how to be a working professional.  They provided me with growth opportunities and a great work life balance.My true passion was to become an investment professional and the knowledge I gained from working at FactSet opened the door for me to become one.Consulting role is merely customer-service and troubleshooting, with little or no true consultative, strategic work whatsoever.  Additionally, organizational claims to be 'flat' and entrepreneurial, yet management is not clear about professional development or expectations whilst there is virtually no autonomous work that outside of what you're micromanaged on.I liked the company, but unless you were a software engineer, you did not get all the great perks FactSet has to offer. Longer mandatory hours, no overtime pay, terrible management. Good coworkers but most leave, its a starter job, not something long term.Overall good place to work. You are given interesting and ever-changing projects.The New York City office is in a good location and benefits are comparable to the industry standard!Great benefits and free lunch coupled with a good opportunity to network with financial experts in the field. Consultants aren't compensated for the amount of work required, and are understaffed. There is a high turnover and employees are expected to pick up the slack without any assistance from management.Mid level managers seem disconnected and are more preoccupied with their personal lives often doing little to help their subordinates.I worked at FactSet for 15+ years.  Was fiercely loyal, deflected competitors overtures for years. I worked up through several positions but not management, and did fairly well. One Friday this March, I was let go. I was told it was a reevaluation of company priorities,  future investment,  etc.  Reality was it was just cost cutting. I had grown too old and expensive,  and recent process improvements I had made to my product line basically ""improved"" myself out of a job.   I could have easily moved to another position.  When I questioned the reason for termination, noting the above, the director of product development actually sat there with a cocky grin on his face and said no can do.   Squirming to keep from wetting himself,  the coward jumped up and left me with the HR rep to finish it off.  No ""I'm sorry, this is hard in me as well"" or any of that nonsense.  I blame myself for being so loyal to a company for so long and not moving on sooner.  I had been so good at my job that I allowed myself to get pigeonholed into such a narrow role that I'm finding it almost impossible to convert into a new position. So in some regards, when I lose my house and my family is evicted,  I will place the blame on FactSet.  But on the flip side,  this experience has taught me to never be that loyal to another firm again.  I will only be focused on the job at hand, and will be constantly looking for that next position. I would strongly recommend anyone considering a non-engineering role at FactSet look elsewhere and be rewarded for your efforts.After having done lot's of code for myself during my PhD, I learned at Factset how to be part of a software engineer team. We had strict coding style, code review, shared library between project. Typical day was lot's of coding from 9am to 7pm. Atmosphere was not so good because interesting projects were occasional and everybody was fighting to be on it.FactSet is a great place to work as a Consultant if you are interested in Investment Management or Investment Banking. Be aware that the first 6 months are spent on the support desk where you are essentially customer service for all their clients. The job requires someone to be technical savvy and good with excel. If you are good with computers and are okay with troubleshooting computer based problems then you should consider this position.My typical day at Factset consists of troubleshooting client connectivity issues over the help desk line. I've learned alot when it comes to technology and pleasing the customer. Management in general is good and they care about their employees. My co-workers are all team oriented and we all have the common goal in mind, which is to ensure customer satisfaction. The hardest part of my job would be the physical demands placed on me away from my desk. The most enjoyable part of my job is when a client is satisfied with my troubleshooting steps to get them working again.I was employee 250 when I started working at FactSet as a Trainer for internal and external clients. When I left the company there were over 10,000 employees. FactSet prides itself on rewarding it's employees for working hard and brining solutions to the table.Management is great. Your work is seen and noticed. Company culture is awesome. Very limited politics. Most people are friendly and willing to help. Lot of perks of a big company, travel, food, stability. The work life balance is one of the best you can get even for software engineers. The job can require strong concentration in areas where one's pedigree might not be focused, advancement is possible if the right people are approached with the correct words. Management is often involved in special high-profile projects.I enjoyed the work everyday at Factset. The most hardest part of the job is to attend the meetings and bridge calls late nights with US team, as i was placed in India. Working with co-workers is knowledgeable. Got some appreciation emails from online team.FactSet was a face paced environment that challenged it's employees to learn something new every day and work hard at fulfilling their job requirements.A great working environment with collaborative culture.  Good work life balance.  Creative environment that embraces self starters.","5,001 to 10,000",New-York,New York,NY,2016-10-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/59555eef-da7e-407e-86a1-398df6c64e9f?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

They're actually very famous for the level of training they provide to their agents. Some times it could be a little bit too much.You are recruited by a partner (or manager,) and unfortunately, it depends a lot on whoever recruits you on whether or not you'll like your position over there or not. Some partner are very hands-off and you're on your own, some of them are very hands-on and ask you for #s all the time.The position of an agent is sort of lonely.

Co workers are always efficient and on top of work. Hardest part is working a high amount of hours completing a high number of garment , almost 10,000 a day. but it's also fun and challenging. Most enjoyable part was the environment and people that I worked with.Associates are great. Upper management needs work. Prime example of a startup company that lost sight of the core values that made them.Awesome Culture.Very young company. Very calm environment. Can drink in the office.No dress code. Very free spirited. End of the month is always a headache but not a big deal.Coming into the position, you are trained on all aspects of the rules and guidelines of the company. This is strictly a customer service role. Unfortunately, the only growth within is to become a Senior customer communications associate (with a $1 raise). The pay is not enough for the 9 hour days and weekend shifts.The most enjoyable part of the job is the random perks and fun coworkers.working at rent the runway was an great opportunity for me. it was fast pace and i like that. they provided me with great hours and worked around my school schedule.Once management was changed, the culture shifted. There were a lot of dishonesty going on with the CEO causing a spiral affect in their Customer Insights Department.I enjoyed working here unfortunately there wasn't any open permanent positions at the time my contract expired. The staff was very open and kind. They're an awesome team to work with!A typical day at work includes documentation of all new merchandise, quality assurance, and last but not least, input of all new inventory into our warehouse management system.Lots of lifting, poor management, lots of employee turnover.

So many things I experimented and experienced working are skills I still use today.One must have an extremely tough skin working in the corporate office at Rent The Runway.

Many times seeing their faces and getting to talk to them during lunch was the only thing to keep me going.the morning there were kinda busy, but died down after 10 amI learned that your pay hardly increasesco workers are very friendlythe hardiest part of the job was staying positive therethe most enjoyable was smoke breakCompany culture is very inclusive and everyone is easy-going, friendly and sociable. As it is still a relatively new company, management is sometimes confusing, but seems to be developing successfully.One must have an extremely tough skin working at any of the Rent The Runway stores.  Thank goodness for wonderful co-workers who became friends and confidantes.  Many times seeing their faces and getting to talk to them during lunch was the only thing to keep me going.  The combination of low inventory, extremely long wait times for dressing rooms and irate customers, it definitely took the toll on everyone.  Few things that need to change that would dramatically improve morale:- Please thoroughly TRAIN THE CUSTOMER SERVICE TEAM!! It is unacceptable and hurts us when CI tells customers over the phone the wrong things to get them off the phone (ie: telling customers wrong store hours, incorrect information about when their dress will arrive knowing that we cannot guarantee what van a dress will be on, saying that we carry all 65,000 dress in store when we only carry 1,000, etc.)- Please be more clear on the website explaining the ""walk in"" procedure, if you walk in without an appointment you will have to wait for a dressing room to open up you can't just pop in and immediately try on, dressing rooms are reserved for the clients who have paid for an appointment, too much confusion from walk ins who take their anger out on the employees- Management: Please have monthly events for the team to boost morale.  Dealing with a high stress job is emotionally taxing.  Please keep your promises when saying that we will have team outings (bowling, dinner boat cruises, karaoke, team dinners, etc.) and please be open to feedback from employees and do not bring outside drama/personal  more... matters into the job - we should not be subject to your anger over what happened with your boyfriend, friends, etc.The most enjoyable part was seeing my co-workers and learning a lot about myself and drawing out strength I didn't know I had.  lessI like the people I work with. We all work hard but the job is a little underpaid when it comes to how much work and energy we put it in.A good company to work for. The work environment is fast pace but an enjoyable work to go to. Enjoyable and fun co-workers, very friendly environment too.I worked as a store stylist for Rent the Runway. At first I was excited and thought I would really enjoy the work and in some ways that was right, however things took a bad turn. There is good and bad, the people I worked with are great, but the compensation is a joke. When they tell you you will make $40,000 a year or $20 an hour, run away because that's a lie. Trust me I'm saying this and my sales were some of the best in the country. You really cant move up in the company from retail to corporate, they don't hire from within and they don't promote. Rather than advancing stylist to senior stylists who had been at the retail location they hired outside stylists. What does that tell you? The business also needs SERIOUS work. There are a lot of issues with there never being enough merchandise to sell, dresses never arriving to customers and dresses arriving but being dirty or ripped. Which of course customers will yell at you for that, and when you complain about business practice nothing happens. If it's your first job its a good stepping stone, but if you are experienced and want a career go elsewhere. One of the worst markers of this company is that you could walk into their retail location right how and ask all the associates if they would quit on the spot given any other job offer and they would all say yes. Trust me I have asked.Amazing company with some of the best, most methodical people that I have ever worked with! Definitely a fun work environment to be a part of!Fun, cool place to work. However I didn't want to go another year a as a ""temp""The company is run like a sorority house and they have no clue about fashion. Do not leave a well established company to go here. They hire and fire irrationally.Morning consisted of processing returns for shipping (i.e. scanning, sorting and cleaning.) Afternoons were more chaotic with the majority of the day's shipments requiring assembling of orders, processing orders, organizing showrooms, communicating with center control from New York. During evenings, preparations for next day shipments, double checking inventory and managing damaged and problem orders. The work partition involved incoming, outgoing, and cleaning. However, many of us floated from divisions to speed up work flow. Hardest part would be the long hours of constant physical strain for 12h+ sometimes. Most enjoyable parts had to be the teamwork, break station with pool table, and helpful/accessible management team. Typically the personality constant of everyone was determined, work orientated however friendly, funny and approachable.",51 to 200,New-York,New York,NY,2016-10-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/be29c031-b6d5-4c4e-8718-666df6efe656?mescoid=1300087001001&jobPosition=23,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

Great vacation to start at 4 weeks and superb health benefits. Very friendly teams open to new ideas and ways to improve on existing methods of going about daily operations. Would like to see them hire more contracted employees full time as there are several I interact with on a daily basis who have a great understanding of the business and go above and beyond every single day as well as have great knowledge of the terminal already.Project assignment with little to know guidance as to what the overall goal is. Temp work was misguided and length of project was cut short. We were notified at the last minute we were no longer needed.Benefits are the best of the best and internal mobility is available if you show your worth.

Co-workers are considerate and the ticketing systems are very useful once you wrap your head around it all. The most enjoyable part if how much programming is available to engage employees in productive thought provoking topics.Bloomberg manages a large and complex set of software for obtaining, analyzing, and disseminating financial information.They have a high degree of structure and process that software developers must adhere to. This is necessary, but it can also be overwhelming for some people.They have a ""people-oriented"" corporate culture.I enjoyed my entire time there. The people pay careful attention to ensuring that folks have appropriate training. The workforce environment is also positive and open, allowing folks to excel in their positions and work harder than they ever realized.Great health insuranceGood 401KGlobal OfficesGood co-workersGood Entry Level Free food including breakfastGood work life balance for the most partManagement is lacking big time at this firm. They have a severe disconnect for what it is like to work as a rep in Technical Operations and thus do not offer any type of support or career development to move on further with your career. The pay scale here is horrible and offers ZERO transparency on why external hire that are new to the company receive a higher salary than a individual who works in the same role and has been there for years.Very nice people here. The place was one of my favorite places to work. People there always go above and beyond to help each other and always being polite. I just wish I could of be there longer. Project over and you move on in life.Great place to get started in any position. Not for long term as stress levels will increase in time. Department managers are chosen internally and typically understand 15% of the departments functions..this forces any good long term employees to move on, thus losing a valuable resources for the company.Great first job. Learned a lot and had a great training program. Management can be secretive at times. Not much room for growth or upward mobility. Great co-workers and fun place to work.A typical day would be to monitor the queue for incoming break fix tickets. These tickets range from service impacting high severity to low priority infrastructure work and operational updates. I've learned a wide variety of skills as diagnosing hardware issues, troubleshooting connection/link down events and also uploading and analyzing core/log files. Management can come down on you for small things, but that is because of Bloomberg is a multi-billion dollar company with potentially millions of dollars at risk. The hardest part of the job is multi tasking and handling multiple issues at once.  Bloomberg has certainly helped with pressure.  The most enjoyable part of the job is learning.  You can learn a little bit of everything here. You can learn networking, storage, the various operating systems, troubleshooting, and much more if you are willing to put in the time.Bloomberg is a large global company. There is a lot of upward mobility and ability to move throughout the various departments. Also, it has a great training program.Very good company, cant think of anything negative to say about my experiences with them. Good pay, good location, good people.The work environment was challenging and intellectually interesting. I was a software developer for the FX (foreign exchange) group. The hours were rather long, but the learning experience was rewarding.Bloomberg is an excellent place to gain knowledge of the financial market. With their terminals, I was able to learn more about different industries and how they performed on a daily basis. While there, I worked on S&P 500 markets and various European markets. Data that I analyzed and corrected, would be updated in real-time to help provide an overall better trend analysis for clients.This is a privately held financial software, data, and media company that is headquartered in Midtown Manhattan, New York City","10,000+",New-York,New York,NY,2016-10-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/54ca878c-69e9-4834-96f8-e8f887eac26c?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
142,2556.0,GILT- Machine Learning Data Scientist,Hudson's Bay Company,3.8,951.0,"A typical day at work is interacting with the truck drivers, I've learned to gain more patience than required when dealing with different backgrounds.  My co workers and manager make my day and job less stressful.  I enjoy networking and meeting different kinds of people from different ethnicity.Poor senior leadership and upper management. Lots of waste, due to poor project planning at the senior level. Every day is filled with chaos because internal resources are limited and enterprise projects are not well-planned, let alone executed with any process controls. Our data center is closing in 2017, and it's not a surprise for any of us who are still here. Many of us were looking for other jobs before the facility closure was announced. Some staff bolted as soon as they heard the news. Those of us who have been here for a year or more were offered a reasonable severance and retention bonus; so, I'm staying until my end date. I know I will have a job offer before my end date because the market is so hot....I work at Lord & Taylor.  I have not made a salary this low since just after college.  Granted, I love the line I work for but the pay is abismal.  And to make matters worse, bullying is tolerated at my store, even when reported.  The ""bullyer"" is a high money producer who gets away with murder.  This person has threatened to have other employees fired, makes others cry, and when it was finally reported to management, instead of feel protected by the General Manager, he became buddy buddy with the bullyer and now people are even more afraid to report it.  The one nice thing I can say about my store is that they are somewhat flexible with day off requests.Typical day at work would consist of Loading, Unloading, interacting with vendors, inventory checklist, Staging outbound shipments, daily stockroom activities.No job security, management shifts faster than fashion. They try to build a family like culture, but terminate without warning due to constant reorgs.Constant Management turn over. Four CIO changes in two years. Each CIO replaced all middle managers to match their 'Vision'. When I left had no first line manager to resign to. HR had me reporting to a co-worker. Was stood up for my exit interview by HR. They did not show up for the interview. Had to leave my laptop, keys, and badge on my desk and just leave the building on my own.Horrible place to work. Very hypocritical and lots of drugs in the workplace. Tested their employees badly but favored a couple people. Unfair wages and lots of missing moneyThere's an interesting dynamic between the Lord and Taylor/HBC side and the Saks side of the house.  It's a East Cost thing.Very fast paced environment.  Not many realize how big the company is and how it spans multiple cities and countries.  Not really in a position to say anything good or bad about the company.  A lot of good people work there.most negative place i ever worked everything is broken from the management team to the website. You have 3 or 4 managers who do their best and the rest just kinda wing it.Enjoyed assisting customers with placing orders, receiving wrong merchandise, sales price adjustments, returns, damaged merchandise and defective merchandise.This position has given me many skills as I'm involved throughout the entire SDLC within every release.  I gather and write business requirements; risk assess all requirements with impacted cross-functional teams/vendors, review requirements (business and technical) weekly with the business, write test scripts, conduct SIT and UAT testing, review any all defects with the business and technical teams, provide implementation plans/status and conduct maintenance/key learning's status meetings.  This position has tweaked all skill sets.A typical day at work includes working reported problems from opened tickets.  I've learned how to be calm in pressure situations.  Management allows myself and co-workers to make decisions without being micro-managed.  My co-workers are all a wonderful bunch of guys.  We are all team players.  The hardest part of the job is trying to complete tasks when given strict deadlines beyond our control.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to make our own decisions as to how we're going to get things done.Benefits need improvement and work atmosphere isn't great. On call sucks because they don't have an adequate help desk (yet) to triage calls. They have some nice percs like half day Fridays during summer and ability to work from home. They are laid back and seem to be trying to improve things. Cafe is above average and decently priced.Its a great team to work with, that moved from waterfall model to a fully agile workplace. There is a lot more potential for the company to grow its culture / tech processes. The tech leadership is great (same as GILT leadership), but senior leadership across the company does not understand tech culture, and has difficulty in managing the workload or the processes in software delivery.Good company, flexible schedule, friendly environment, very good and knowledgeable team. I learn a lot about retail business.Resolve production issue in different area such as user interface , business logic, and  data in the database. Enhance application by user request.It's ok but i just got laid off after being on call 24/7 for a year. They have unrealistic expectations for projects and don't seem to care much for the end product, they just want to 'get it done'. They are all about the profits really.I work with great people. That said, the company has created a toxic relationship with it's employees. They are not transparent about the direction of the company. I was offered a promotion, but it required relocating and the compensation was not on par with national averages for that position, so I ultimately opted to move closer to my family instead of remaining with the company.get to learn alot and try out different products.. meet a lot of great people and best of all be the face of a skincare line.. has been a pleasure working for them but unfortunately they do not have any job security whatssoevergood working environment, friendly people, mangement is fine, Job Culture is good, Compensation/Benefits not so good",,New-York,New York,NY,2016-09-21T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/aa2738af-cf72-48de-a986-7f5d824935f9?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

The biggest problem this place has is that it doesn't have a CTO directing the technology used across the board or giving an overall technology leadership across the organization.People tend to use siloed tools and those pushing for standardizing the tools don't tend to be in sync with the users they're pushing them on. There's a lot of communication problems across departments and every project is completely different from every other project. Many departments are under-staffed and overworked, and the company's always hiring, but it takes so long to onboard people to the disorganized process that it just winds up adding more work to the already overburdened departments.To make this worse documentation initiatives tend to fizzle or get deprioritized compared with project work, which is the reason why onboarding is so labor intensive. At the same time process improvement is expected to be performed while also working on projects, which is a serious problem when you don't even have time to finish project work. In other words, the process is so slow, that it inhibits having time to increase the efficiency of the process.The chief goal of the company owners is to sell the company, but they prioritize flashy names and branding rather than focusing on having a well-designed product. The engineering team is offsite (India) and often out of communication with the rest of the departments,  more... a lot of times bug reports are ignored or argued against and the relationship with the engineers feels hostile. A lot of processes that should be automated or done with tools purpose-built to handle them are done inefficiently, and the inertia of siloed users paired with the lack of coordinated adoption of effective tools renders every project a slow, grinding, manual process.This company has a lot of potential, but right now it's a quagmire and the longer people work here the more likely they are to seek other employment when they realize that fixing the problems requires a lot more work with respect to coordinating and motivating other people than just participating in the inefficient process.The food in the kitchen's nice, the HR staff are on top of their game, the events tend to be frequent and fun, and it's nice to have a pool/ping pong table as well as a number of other games available to play on breaks. It is nice to be able to work from home and have unlimited vacation, but often times people are so busy that these perks are rendered completely impossible.A lot of things about this place work well, but there's serious issues that need to be addressed or this place won't be able to scale or maintain momentum.  lessWork is pretty adhocNothing new to learnManagement is clueless about their jobco workers are not team playersHardest part is to find some good work.

144,2558.0,Data Scientist,Koch Nitrogen Company,3.7,36.0,"Not a bad place to work. There are a lot of smart people who work for Koch. Management was good. Would work for them again if I had the chance.Koch's core values are undeniably the right path for an employee base.  Integrity and compliance have always aligned with my common sense.  Market Based Management is also a mental model that is very natural to me, and provides an exceptional common vocabulary and mental model.  For the most part, there are a lot of great people and a lot of great managers at Koch Industries.  I cherished my time there.On the opportunities side, Koch Business Solutions unit needs an overhaul.  Their Applications Group is not competitive with external providers in cost, quality, nor competency, and their arrogance and cronyism are against MBM core principles.I worked with many talented people here, and generally the work was gratifying.  The Market Based philosophy was great as a way to run a business, however there were occasions where it did not seem to be applied consistently.Koch Industries was the best employer I ever worked for... The people and co-workers were nice enough. The management was good and the benefits were good. I learned a lot on this job because I was working with some knowledgeable contractors. Just a great company.Take care of long term employees, strong retirement benefits, entrepreneurial.  Work hard and you will be rewarded.  Follow the MBM if implemented in your department, really helps stretch your ability to be a team player.Koch Industries is a great place to work. They live out the guiding principals day by day. They are very professional and respectful and full of vision.I have loved working here for the better part of a decade, the company really knows how to take care of it's employees. If you are looking for stability I highly recommend this company.I worked at OSU during my time at school there. It is a great job because you get to study and be close to your teachers when you have any questions. I recommend.Professional environment with nice people to work with.  Sometimes fast paced, which I like.  Great hours 7:00 to 3:00.  Receiving invoices from vendors.Not a bad place to work just needs to full fill  promises made to people. I worked as a NH3 tech in the refrigeration department . My bosses were very good to me If it wasnt for the trouble maker on third shift I would still be there. Guy had allnight to install new water pump in the boiler i took it out on first shift and had it set to go back in well 16hrs later when i came back in it still wasnt installed, made me so mad i had to install it took me about an hour, just lazy tail people that had know clue of the work they claimed they knew.Koch Ind. was a wonderful place to work.  Huge company, broken into small companies run by wonderful management.  Positive daily feedback and stress free environment.During my temporary work at Koch industries I felt like I was part of the team and contributed to its success. It was a highly rewarding job. the co-workers were all very loyal, supportive and positive. The hardest part part of the job was to challenge myself daily and to always strive to be the best I can, and that is a great work ethic.Koch Industries utilize a management methodology called MBM.  In theroy this methodology fosters a healthy culture, however after working with two separate companies with in Koch industries I have found that the methodology is not practiced.  Upper management does not promote free thinking nor do they allow alignment with industry standards.6:00am tour facility. 7:30am review production results with staff covering all safety and quality concerns. Set goalls with team. 8:00am send out daily production email to president and vice president. 8:30am daily conference call with corporate. 9:00am safety walk through with an on shift hourly team member. 10:00am reviewed on hand raw materials.10:30am meet with the purchasing department to discuss materials. 11:00 am conference call with marketing team to discuss material sales and shipments.12:00pm meet with maintence team to discuss maintenance plan. 1:00pm avaliable to meet with vendors or outside personal. 1:00 pm to 3:00pm 1 to 1's with team members to cover growth oppportunities. 3:00pm conference call with corporate compliance team. 4:00pm conference call with Operations Manager to discuss days results. 5:00pm safety walk through with an on shift hourly team member.6:00pm review days acitivities.Great Culture to work at. Market Based Management. Value creation promoted. Ability to grow within the company is promoted and encouragedworked as a network and desktop support engineer for multiple companies within the Koch umbrella.Original manager was great, then got a new one when mine was promoted to a new role.  The new manager and I did not get along as I was not a suck up and just did my job.shortly after that change he hired two new engineers right out of college, had me train them both and then laid me off as both of them did the same job I did for less money as they were brand new and no experience.Since KS is a right to work state they can let you go without any reason, excuse or explanation.  Koch does this ALL the time.  They do not value their employee's or the experience they bring just the bottom line and where you fit in on that value.I currently work for KBS service desk.  I am very happy with my job, I love what I do, and the people that I work with are great.  Management at times seems lost though, and it almost seems to be a black hole working here.  I have been here for 1 year and still have not met the requirements that they have set to move forward in the company.Management at this company speak out of both sides of their mouth and they definitely don't know how to lead by example. They place strong emphasis on results and forget about caring for their employees. It is not a nurturing working environment.Management spend a lot of time behind closed door instead of out in the open to lead the team. Email and IM are closely monitored. You can forget about HR. They are there to protect the managers not you. Every thing you say will flow directly back to the managers.Watch for bait and switch.answered calls, re-mote to customer's PC's and fixed whatever issues they had. Every call is timed and some calls are screened and monitored for the scorecard. There were 27 different goals to meet with each call. Every day is a busy day. I learned a lot from working in the IT department.The company has grown tremendously, but it is not the easiest place to work.  So you get the stability, but will not see a level of compensation, management openness (despite the MBM culture), and mobility like in other companies.I learned abundantly oilfield skills. I greatly respected their Safety program; lectures on Hazmat.

I was immediatedly treated like family. I enjoyed my job and co-workers very much. If I needed extra help, I could hire temp workers whenever needed. I learned a great deal from this position, especially about teamwork and recognizing and appreciating hard work. When my husband's job moved us to Houston, Koch was very accommodating in helping me find another job with Koch in Houston in their natual gas trading division.

Avon is a great company to work for, they offer plenty of support on, ways to generate customers, while showing you how to mantain your customer base. They have several events around the US, that allows networking and good fun.The sucess of your business with Avon relies on you, your sales will be slow at times,but if you stick with it great things will happen for you.Working at Avon has been a great experience. It mostly involves sales by catalog so I was able to start out at a young age helping my  mom with her sales. Now I'm able to sale as a independent representative and the products basically sell themselves. All it takes is showing the catalogs to people and promoting the right products based on their likes and personalities.It is a very good job if you have motivation and determination to be your own boss. It takes a lot of time and effort. The advancement benefits are good and they constantly have new incentives for their employees.They move you around a lot. They change there mind one minute from the next as to what or how you were doing something. They expect some people to give 200 percent while they give people help that don't even try. Poor pay and every year benefits decreased.I enjoyed working for this big incorporation. i had my own time's to work. I enjoyed selling and but most of all show my previous customer's the new things they had new to buy.Great company and amazing benefits!  I can work on my time around my schedule and the relationships formed while meeting new people are ones that last a lifetime!ex time, family oriented, match 401k, must take vacation, remote work/work from home, equipment and hardware upgraded frequently, free lectures and education, access to gym, awesome health care, easy quick expense reimbursement, birthday offA typical day is unknown.  It could be 6 hours or it could be 12, depending on orders and staffing.  I learned and grew a lot in my position and gained useful experience.  Some management seem to have their own agenda and once you fall from their graces you are pretty much out the door. It's a different culture and if you have problems adjusting to the culture you won't do well.   Loved my co-workers and I enjoyed the company benefits.a typical day at work for me would be to go in have our morning meeting and get put in what ever area that needs help for the day im usually on the shipping dock but can preform well in every part of the building i have learned alot about avon from where the order begins to where it ends and everything in between management at avon is awesome their all understanding and treat you like family not a worker my co workers for the most part are good to work with but every company has the lazy ones but most of them work hard and the new ones always approach me for ideas on things because most of the guys are set in there ways and bull headed but we all get along great the most enjoyable part of the day is when we get a yellow light for a line thats backed up cuz every one goes nuts over it and acts crazy and yells about it but when you go in the trailer most times it takes 15 minutes to clear so they get all worked up for nothingI loved working for Avon, but honestly not too many people are interested in Avon as they use to be. Products are Amazing and good quality. I would only recommend working for Avon if you're looking to make a little extra money not a huge amount of money.The job was fine but you had to have  alot of coustomers to make a profit or  you didn't really get a salaryI was a sales representative for Avon. I sold it for 7 years. I learned how to manage my own business. I managed my advertising, customers, and the inventory that they bought. I didn't have to deal with co-workers, I just had to make sure I submitted my orders each week. The hardest part of selling Avon was when I quit selling it I didn't get to see my customers anymore. The most enjoyable part was being able to see my customers and help them get the products that they ordered.Worked at Avon over 18 years.  It was a great family environment, fast-paced.  Great management team.  Co-workers were always helpful and willing to do what it takes to get the job done.  Most difficult part of the job was trying to figure out why so many layoffs, then re-hiring of people for the same positions a few months later.Avon Products has a great job culture and work life balance, however, the compensation and benefits are really low and job security is questionable.Being an Avon sales representative was great position to have. It allowed me to become my own boss for my first time. Support from my family has made my life a lot easier to cope with when order taking became too tough to handle.Great people to work with, gave tips on how to approach people making sales door to door and easy to follow tips on hosting successful book shows.Receiving calls, booking shows, making sales through social media or phone calls. Patience, understanding, and compromise. Management was supportive and connected with co-workers frequently to track progress. Mainly self involvement on making sales.Hardest part was going door to door passing out catalogs and booking shows. Be your own boss, set your own hours.-High exposure to top management;-Good environment to work;-ownership and accountability of your responsibilities;-Challenges;My day would begin at 7:00 am with meetings and travel to the district. Then I would begin meeting with representatives. Training on sales, recruiting, leadership, new rep meetings, sales meetings. Selling the benefit of  becoming a representative and helping them build a profitable business for themselves. The hardest part of the job is getting the representatives to be involved and working with you so that you can help them be successful. They are independent so they earn their own paycheck not paid by the company. Keeping new representatives engaged so they can see the benefit of owning their own business. The most enjoyable part was watching those that succeeded and knowing that I was able to teach them something to help with that success.A typical day at work would be collecting inventory and organizing spaces for products. Some days I was able to help with transactions and sale a few products to people.    I was able to learn how to collect inventory and properly keep organization.   The management was very nice. She was easy and a joy to work with.    I had no co-workers for the job.    The hardest part of this job was to make sales, because there was not much of clientele.     the most enjoyable part of my job was keeping things organized. I am a very organized person already and it is sometimes very relaxing.it was a really good place to work  the benefits were outstanding  and the job pay was really outstanding  you would go in every morning and you would know what you had to do that day  in contracts you printed out the contracts that avon representatives had filled out  and scanned and deal with any problems in a timely manner.  All the ontracts received overnight had been completed by noon that day.  The management was very good, they were supportive  and gave you supervision if you needed it.  All of the co-workers were very professional.  To me there was no hard part of the job  except when the system would go down  and you would have to wait for the system to come up.  I enjoyed working with the representatives.","10,000+",New-York,New York,NY,2016-09-13T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/bd047196-f522-4027-860a-684b80bc0c8c?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=29,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

148,2562.0,"Data Scientist, FinTech",Citigroup Inc.,3.9,8100.0,"Good place to work . Good Opportunity to learn new things.Diverse opportunity, helpful co-workers.If you can get a manager that is understanding and realistic in regard to work/life balance then you will be very happy.There are managers who play politics very seriously and have unrealistic expectations for their employees, even if it requires you being on conference calls until 1AM and another at 7AM. They make it seem like that is a requirement to further your career, if you can manage to keep up that schedule for an extending period of time without losing your sanity.There are some great managers that are understanding, so you have to proceed with caution and understand that it might require you making a lateral job change if you end up with one who is not understanding.The benefits of this position in my opinion was the opportunity to utilize my knowledge of the mortgage and real estate markets.  This allowed me to ascend into management fairly quickly.  The work load in a typical day was enough to keep you focused for 8 hours and longer.  I was able to learn a great deal more about corporate America and how the market collapse had impacted that industry and the subsequent effects on consumers of mortgage products.  The relationships developed with co-workers and management were invaluable and made the job enjoyable each day. Were it not for the demise of the default department I would still be with this company.It's usually pretty busy and dynamic environment. There are lots of opportunities for learning and improving the system. Part of our tasks is to perform regression tests after implementations of improvements in the systems. The hardest part of the job is to find time to work in production and also with testing which requires time to evaluate, participate in conference calls and also do many tests. The most enjoyable part of the job is that if you are a sociable person, you may interact with different departments to get your job done and improve it. But you may not find collaboration from all departments and communication may be difficult sometimes.The big picture at Citi is that they care TREMENDOUSLY about their employees, and they do make a very concerted effort to make everyone feel like a piece of the whole. The truth of the matter is, at it's core, very different. The truth of the matter is that this is a big bank and employees are a number, nothing more. When it comes time to start cutting costs, the first place they go is to the employment pool. When it comes to investments, they do not spend money on the people that are already there. They instead, will waste thousands of dollars on systems that aren't tested or bring in outside agencies to evaluate the current state of affairs and spend a dime just to save a nickel. People are not the most important part of the organization.This job was a learning experience in the sense that it gave me a taste of corporate America. I learned a lot about banking and it's laws, regulations and policies. After one month of working the branch made me Head Teller. With that my responsibilities became counting the vault with an officer, count the ATM's with an officer, receive the incoming money from Brinks with an officer. I also processed daily transactions while giving exceptional customer service. Management was difficult to deal with sometimes. Co-workers were nice and they were great at training. The hardest part about this job was dealing with management. Most enjoyable part was meeting the customers of the bank.I worked for Citi almost 20 years, only regret was that I did not apply there sooner. Thoroughly enjoyed going to work there, each day was the same but at the same time each day was different - you never knew what type of calls you would receive, but all were interesting and sometimes a challenge. I always had support from managers and the options for advancement were varied and offered frequently. The bank was always exploring new and exciting programs and offered new positions often. I enjoyed working with a diverse group of people and felt like I benefitted from that experience.its a good place to work with great benefits and a competitive salary with job security.Good work/life balance for employeesFlexible hoursFrequent breaksGreat benefits. Company cares for its employees. Cross-training is encouraged. Management is compassionate and understandingColleagues are willing to work together to assist one anotherGood amount of time allowed for holidays and vacation timeCiti is a great company to work for if you're starting out. They pay well and have great benefits. The main issue I had working at Citi was that I felt a little Harassed by my managers and ultimately the managers harassing me fired me after i went to their boss. Overall not a terrible place if you don't mind sitting around waiting for work and getting discouraged for it.A typical work day at Citi consists of various projects related to HR, Java or data quality.  Citi provides many avenues to learn new technologies.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the various projects that need to be delivered.  My co-workers and management are easy to get along with and very helpful.  I've learned much about Java, HTML, XML, SQL and HR Data Quality.Citi offers excellent online training every year, good pay, benefits, matching 401k. Great people with professional and friendly atmosphere. Citi strives to value the importance of the employees and maintains activities of events for employee appreciation. Citi constantly wants to improve employee workforce conditions to inprove working procedures that benefits the employees. Management with Citi are very friendly and always willing to go that extra mile to help you learn to your full potential.This company was the best company I have had the pleasure to work with. The training was exceptional and lengthy to get all of the information we needed to learn the job perfectly and quickly. It was a complicated and confusing job at first, but with the correct and easily explained training we received, we excelled perfectly and I was very satisfied by the results and knowledge I gained. The company in itself is a very positive one. My coworkers and superiors were very kind and helpful. I could not think of a better company to work for.I worked at Citibank as a Teller for about 2-3 year. I had few manager changing there compare to my other job. The only thing I like about working there is the co-worker I met; Hate the last manager I worked with. The job is a kind of stressful, I hate the ""Sales and referrals"" pressure from the managers, especially the last manager I worked with before leaving the job (That manager was the worst, if a teller doesn't meet the sale or referral goal she give so much attitude and bullsh*t to the employees) The Last manager wasn't flexible with the work schedule due to shortage of employee and force employee to work even when they can't.I learned a lot working with Citi Bank, they have good training for employees. Great Compensation and Benefits.Great opportunity to grow and advancement, Management always helps employees to grow. My experience with Citi from Analyst to supervisor was outstanding, they provide me lots of training classes.Job culture is very friendly and supportive.Citi was a great experience.  I was lucky to meet a lot of great people along the way.  There was a lot of areas for improvement within management and who's running the departments.  Needs a complete overall to get the company to run effectively again. All in all I learned a lot and was able to expand my career while working for citi.Its a good place to work with great benefits and a competitive salary with job security but what I do is highly stressful as we handle many escalated calls everyday with extremely angry people and have to calm them down if possible and retain them with the bank. This is not easy. The co-workers are great and diverse and I get to help people.I do not mind working at citibank, you do have to be a fit for the job. I don't think I could work sitting at a desk staring at checks all day for the rest of my life, but it is not a bad or very stressful job by any means. It can be hard to advance once you've reached a certain point.  It also can be frustrating with all the change going on but you do just learn to go with the flow.Fast paced environment until you get the hang of working cases then everything slows down dramatically.Management is all about the numbers and not so much about developing future talent and leaders.Biggest perk to working for Citi would be the benefits package and work/life balance depending on the department.Well recognized company with great benefits and opportunity for it employees. I enjoyed working at Citi after more than 23 years I consider Citi my home. I enjoy working with everyone and I learned from management that clients is always comes first. Citi is consider one of the best company since they are in more than 100 countries.I manage a team of four that maintains our Citicards.com (pre-login) and Citi Online (post-login) sites.I work directly with my team, developers, testers and Business requestors to ensure updates are made correctly and in a timely manner.  I directly manage any escalations and process improvements for our channel. I work with my team on their goals and support them on any career paths.Hardest part of my job is managing differently personalities.  Being able to do so has made a stronger leader. The most enjoyable part of my job is working as a team. We work with a large group of developers and testers and seeing how everything comes together for a release can be petty rewarding.The work environment at Citi Group is absolutely top notch in its professionalism and attention to detail. The corporation and its businesses are run in such a way that quality and morality exist hand-in-hand. Attention to detail and simply doing the right thing runs through the core of everything.","10,000+",New-York,Long Island City,NY,2016-09-10T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/17f92ba2-5481-45eb-a91f-c98ca14bc90b?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=31,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Laid back and relaxed work atmosphere and very welcoming environment.Overall, GroupM is a great place to work, but bad communication between upper management and employees. Direct supervisors were great in Atlanta office.A typical day here in the office includes checking buys to make sure that correct day-parts are being used, correct spot lengths and approved programming is used. Also to make sure that buyers are spending budgets correctly.A typical day of work one must do many different things and constantly learning on the job. Management worries for the employee health. The hardest time is the last few days of the month where situations occur that are out of one's control. There were different relationships between employees but my favorite thing would have to be the activities.enjoyed meeting and working with great people; clients are respectable; room for growth; great location; demanding work hours.Very big and matrixed organization.  Good opportunity to learn at the biggest player in the media space.  Space is a little outdated, but moving to world trade area in 2018Best people in the industry, job security. Dynamic and fast paced environment. Opportunity to work in smaller divisions of a large holding company which offers the best of both worlds.GroupM is a very large company with many moving parts. It was a very rewarding place to work. There has been a major reorganization worldwide and at the moment there is very little direction and no leadership.Being here I have learned a great deal about office automation development within SharePoint. My coworkers have all been very friendly and helpful and my team of direct reports were very easy to work with. As was my overseas development team The hardest part of the job is also the most enjoyable. The various projects I have either managed or developed myself can be (and most were) very difficult but so rewarding when they are successfully completed.The organization is an excellent place to learn hands on.  Always trying to stay ahead of the curve on cutting edge technologies.Working for the organization I learned a large number of technologies such as Cisco ASA, Checkpoint, 3Par Storage Citrix Netscalers, EMC RSA Atuhenication Manager and VMware.I have been working at GroupM full-timeProsGroupM provides a Great work/life balance with plenty of ""day off"" timeConsIT going through changes, little transparency, very uncertain on futureCan be challenging as depending on your role and which agency, roles and expectations aren't always well defined. You get to work on great brands, however; depending upon your level, salary doesn't always match work responsibilities. You need to be your own advocate. Being such a large agency has its pros and cons.I worked with two exceptional team members and we not only got the job done but had fun while providing IT support to several companies. We worked together for 7 1/2 years together and we were like family.  The work environment was positive and the people we supported were outgoing which made our jobs in IT even more fun.There are some nice people that are good to work with, however you will not move up in this company.  You will be stuck in same spot for years and no one will be helpful.This job was very fast paced and had a high volume of work but it was great working there. The co-workers were amazing we all got along.A good starting point to open to new things and network. Job culture could use some improvement.Very fortunate to work with the leading holding company globallyI've learned so many valuable things. One of them is to work in a team and finish what needs to be done.- Nice team of co-workers- Large international company- Fun to work in Advertisement sphereExcelent co-worker to work. I learned much about diferents accounting in advertising.A typical day consists of any of the following: A/R and A/P, reconciliations, analysis of accounts, variance explanation, etc. My experience at GroupM has taught me to be detailed oriented as well as how to efficiently manage my time. I've gotten the chance to work with great individuals who are very helpful and supportive. The hardest part of the job is resolving problems that occurred prior to my employment with the company. The most enjoyable part of the job is completing difficult projects and getting our month-end and yearly closes.A great place to learn the basics in media.  More often than not, issues or discrepancies are realized in the finance department.  It is our job to resolve these issues by requesting additional information from vendors, planners, analysts and/or reviewing contracts or insertion orders.  I've learned how to meet demanding deadlines and to communicate in a multi-level corporate environment.  In my position, the hardest part of my job is knowing that there is no way to move up without waiting for someone to retire.

Even though it was a temp assignment I got to learn how to work with other on a very professional level. The team made me feel right at home and taught me more computer skills than I did in school which was very thoughtful and helpful for me. They really wanted to me do well in life and that's what motivated me to work hard to get a higher positive.This company is under investigation by the SEC for channel stuffing. The CEO needs to go to reset the business as it is a slave to delivering for wall street at the expense of growing brands. Management has all been home grown and lacks any ability to motivate or think of the result of the team over the result of the individualOverall great company with great benefits and employee perks.  Fast- paced environment that celebrates success and employee accomplishments.  Great place for growing families.  Flexible hours, work from home options, and summer hours Fridays year around in the Norwalk office.There is always something going on in the background and you cannot rely on job security.The people are nice but it can sometimes feel like high school with cliques and gossipingOverall, the culture is good as they generally allow you to be somewhat flexible with work hours and locations and it's almost an unwritten rule that nobody really works FridaysI Have work for Diageo for 14 years and 8 months to be exact.I had an excellent manager who help me be  a stronger leader.I learned alot from her and other managers within company.There were some challenges with scanners malfunctioning,short staffed during are busy times.Finding a way to keep things moveingI had a great team to work with. learn alot of things from them.And was able to install my knowledge and  skills in them.Diageo is a family oriented company and has been a fun place to work.Management positions are very political. Be prepared to suck up if you want to get anywhere.If you disagree with your Line Manager you probably are in for a rough time.Unlike other promoting jobs they give you your schedule ahead of time and supply you with everything you must need and know before a shoing unlike some of the other promoting companies out there. They pay for gas and hotel if needed.Diageo is definitely a good place to work. Young but experienced team makes it much easier. It was a pleasure going to the office and enjoy the good atmosphere with your peers.I loved this Job. It was one of the best jobs I had. The co workers were great. Management so what sucks but The benefits were great. I recommend working for this company.Amazing leading brands in the industry, that look really good in your resume.HR does a good job recruiting brilliant people, unfortunately, they don't last, either from a re-org or they leave.Diageo is a good place to work for and fun products. but the yearly re-org stressed people out and lost talented employee.Fun place to work. Boys club exists as with most other corporate organizations. Overall great experience. No matched 401k.worked here for years had some slow times but was always compensated for time missed. well paid and awesome at recognizing our hard work.Diageo is a great place to work and grow.  They give you any chance that you want to develop with their company.  They provide various training as well.Diageo is a place to grow and develop skills by providing the learning tools and opportunity with people who are willing to help.I was Proud to work with the People,the Machines & the Product. There was a feeling of Pride to make she a fine finished Product I know the end user could enjoy. We all worked together. From Upper Management to label inspector.I usually try to arrive at least half hr to an hr early to get settled in by reading my Holy Scriptures and eating a snack. i always try to get a lead on what were doing that day and what is our goals for the day. speak to all co workers.The hardest part of the job is not being busy it makes time go slow, And my most enjoyable part of the job is whatever we accomplished or achieved that day did we break some kind of a record or something because its all history and should be written or kept a record of......Overall great place to work. There are a lot of perks including excellent pay and social environment. They hire top candidates and have very aggressive brand plans, so you will have an opportunity to grow as a professional. However, it's very competitive and management value clones (""yes sir"" type people). There is no room to be authentic or creative. Too much energy to deal with the corporate politics, and there's a reorg every year or so.Best strategy- work here for 2-3 years, learn a lot and go to another CPG. You will get a higher title, more respect, less stress, but salary may not change.I started as a LP and was promoted to Warehouse last spring. I learned a lot from the operators and warehouse employees. I wasn't a fan of the micro managing and the inept HR department that didn't help me when a manager was messing with me while I was in probation. He told me that he was timing me while I was in trailers. I guess safety wasn't important at that time. The Union didn't help either. All in all I loved working with the OTMs, and it was mostly a good experience.Very enjoyable companyCulture was inviting and openChange was often acceptedWork-life balance respectedGreat company to work forThe best part of my job was being able to work with minimal supervision along side of a great crew.  The worst part was when the machinery would break down, and sometimes red tape and politics caused delay in resolution.

I loved how you got to choose the events you apply for so that it doesn't mess with your schedule at all.Fusion is awesome. They always have jobs available for you to choose from. I really love working for this company. Very nice and polite staff that are very helpful in assisting you.Low stress atmosphere to work at.

While many would consider us a marketing technology company, we like to think of ourselves as a people company.Family friendly environment. Heavy focus on work life balance and CSR.Fusion was great when I first started with them. But they changed their managers and staff; after that no one called or communicated with me. As a Consultant that made it difficult.I serve as a key resource to ensure all aspects of the maintenance of numerous scalable and highly available eCommerce system environments are available 24x7x365.

Ive learned the importance of customer service from working here. Management and co-workers here are fine.Was a normal day after you left the shop, when you got their it was a day of the unknown.I learned things about wiring houses that the inspectors wanted too see.The person in charge after someone left was not the person for the job as that person knew nothing about wiring or building a house or what it took to do the project at hand.The hardest thing was dealing with the manager that was put in the position.The best part was when we got to leave the shop and the coworkers were fun to work with and we didn't have to deal with management.Great Company, nice people, great bosses and employees.

I also attended various team meetings and created props for upcoming monthly video shoots. On shoot days, I would attend and assist on set with any tasks. I absolutely adored every single co-worker and they were all a pleasure to work with. Everyone is friendly and outgoing. The hardest part of the job was mastering the Birchbox voice through my writing. The most enjoyable part of the job was the office in itself, which is an upbeat environment filled with treats and surprises everyday. I really enjoyed being there everyday.When I first got hired, they made Birchbox SoHo (before it even opened) out to be an AMAZING environment with a great teamwork ethic and a place for advancement....HAHA!Management was very bad, and the only good ones they had they fired due to them not having the ""looks"" Birchbox wanted (aka discriminated against their body types, etc). Management also chose favorites and conducted things as if it was a middle school cafeteria lunch table... only certain people got praise and perks, whereas others who worked even harder got treated horrible.This place needs to get their act together. Stop making employees who are NOT PAID COMMISSION get in trouble for not having met ridiculous and unreasonable sales goals.

160,2574.0,"Data Scientist/Sr. Data Scientist, Analytical Insights - Marketing Analytics",marketshare,3.4,7.0,"It's a good place to work for the benefits as well as the perks (free food and regular catered breakfasts), but the pay's on the low-side with comparable positions at other companies. The biggest problem this place has is that it doesn't have a CTO directing the technology used across the board or giving an overall technology leadership across the organization.People tend to use siloed tools and those pushing for standardizing the tools don't tend to be in sync with the users they're pushing them on. There's a lot of communication problems across departments and every project is completely different from every other project. Many departments are under-staffed and overworked, and the company's always hiring, but it takes so long to onboard people to the disorganized process that it just winds up adding more work to the already overburdened departments.To make this worse documentation initiatives tend to fizzle or get deprioritized compared with project work, which is the reason why onboarding is so labor intensive. At the same time process improvement is expected to be performed while also working on projects, which is a serious problem when you don't even have time to finish project work. In other words, the process is so slow, that it inhibits having time to increase the efficiency of the process.The chief goal of the company owners is to sell the company, but they prioritize flashy names and branding rather than focusing on having a well-designed product. The engineering team is offsite (India) and often out of communication with the rest of the departments,  more... a lot of times bug reports are ignored or argued against and the relationship with the engineers feels hostile. A lot of processes that should be automated or done with tools purpose-built to handle them are done inefficiently, and the inertia of siloed users paired with the lack of coordinated adoption of effective tools renders every project a slow, grinding, manual process.This company has a lot of potential, but right now it's a quagmire and the longer people work here the more likely they are to seek other employment when they realize that fixing the problems requires a lot more work with respect to coordinating and motivating other people than just participating in the inefficient process.The food in the kitchen's nice, the HR staff are on top of their game, the events tend to be frequent and fun, and it's nice to have a pool/ping pong table as well as a number of other games available to play on breaks. It is nice to be able to work from home and have unlimited vacation, but often times people are so busy that these perks are rendered completely impossible.A lot of things about this place work well, but there's serious issues that need to be addressed or this place won't be able to scale or maintain momentum.  lessWork is pretty adhocNothing new to learnManagement is clueless about their jobco workers are not team playersHardest part is to find some good work. People work mostly on SAS, a stone age frameworkBeing a living sign for Marketshare Inc, has been a great source of supplimentary income.  I have been working for this company almost 3 years, and they are a great company. They pay well, and have a good open door policy (over the phone, of course).Because of the limited job advancment, I would have to overall rate this job, 4 stars...Its a nice place to work but job security is low.

The management here is also something to highlight. I respect and admire my managers and leaders so much. They are always giving me constructive criticism and are open to feedback. I can always go to them for help and I feel very comfortable with them. I truly enjoy coming to work everyday.I started here about 6 months ago and I can see myself here for years to come. So much growth potential and opportunity. If you put the effort in, it pays off in the end and will be recognized and acknowledged.The best job I've had to date yet. A typical day would be creating new users/ fixing things around the office. I would also be sent to the data center to fix servers if they went down. I've learned so much about systems administration at pulse point due to all my co-workers interest in seeing me grow intellectually.Very toxic place to work in, especially finance department. No work-life balanceI had my great internship at Pulsepoint this summer. It is a great place to learn, build-up your skills, and most importantly, have fun. As an intern, I was given a well-organized and planned intern plan on my day 1 and was assigned with a mentor. My mentor was very sharing, smart, patient, and responsive. They asked a lot ""what you have learned"" rather ""what you have done for them"". I felt I wasn't just an intern, but a part of the team and a part of the ""culture"". Little dreams matter and ""interns"" matter!The work days are very busy. Fast pace environment. I became proficient at Great Plains while working at this company.

Great shoe selection.Employ of mixture of some experienced Sales team to brand new kids.Too much pressure to follow corporate sales pitches which vs Very experienced qualified Sales techniques.Unlike most corporate recruiting agencies, The Bachrach Group is about growing and succeeding as a family.  Everyone comes in with a great opportunity to make money for themselves without being micro-managed in regards to call numbers and metrics.  The upper management will go to bat for any and all employees and they are truly a great company to work for in this field. If you do well you will be rewarded and promoted as the company continues to expand on their nationwide reach. I would recommend TBG 10 out of 10 times to anyone interested in a staffing and recruiting career.This is more of a calm cool and collected work environment. Meeting monthly goals or even weekly goals can be a struggle but when you work with a team who loves to help one another grow and sell, not only does it make work easier but a lot more enjoyable.I worked at BachRach over the summer and it is by far one of my favorite jobs I've ever had. The management was friendly and easy to get along with, and they were extremely flexible when it came to the hours. They train you fluently and prepare you to work with customers, they patiently work with you in any areas you may need help in, and although the job is designed to be competitive, they do not, in any way treat the job like a competition. The hardest part of the job is developing your own technique of making sales, because making sales is an important part of the job. The most enjoyable part is establishing your own list of regular customers.Bachrach was a steeping stone to having good customer service skills. I learned how to treat customers with the right balance of attention and direction. Management was a great plus. I worked with employees who had been there since I was born. Their experience and wit taught me a lot. Co-workers were easy to get along with because we helped each other out. The hardest part of the job was also the most enjoyable part of the job. That was maintaining a client database. Working at improving my skills and following up with clients gave me the experience to run my own business (music producing).Everyone was so nice and lovable. Very helpful and reliable . When i needed help they was there .A typical day included sales, client tracking, visuals, and to oversee tailor shop.met people from all over the world, tour guide was a fun job .. The experience took me afar..A typical day at work in Bachrach included organizing the store to make sure merchandise was neatly displayed, helping customers find what they were looking for, offer customer suggestions, process customer transactions and returns and providing excellent customer service.  The manager kept the store environment very relaxed and let the staff know the importance of making the customer feel welcomed and respected.  This was my first job in retail and I definitely learned how to speak to customers in a personable, effective way and how to sell merchandise.  The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the satisfied face of a customer after dealing with them and knowing that I did my job well.Good work place but poor management and job security. Company not sure of proper direction and attempts at success.My experience was that the store was very slow and on commission its hard to make a good living. The draw was almost never met. The products sold were of good quality and the co workers made it fun at times. The management was not very good at keeping control of the store and driving business. The fun part was customer interaction and being in the mall. The cons are low pay and benefits, long hours at times, not much flexibility with having to work holidays.There was really a lack of leadership. The store manager that hired me quit a week later. There was no structure. People in cluding managers would leave the store for an extended period of time. There was no sense of job security. Even if 2 people would come in the store for an entire 8 hour shift you were still responsible for selling. I felt like the volume that was done in the store I was in did not merit such a high quota. There was not a fair structure to evenly distribure sales. It was every man for himself, which led to infighting. I loved servicing the customers. That was my favorite part. For me however, Bachrach was not a good fit.Nice place to work when retail quotas are met. Reason that I stopped working there is because of store closing prospect.Upscale mens clothinjg store with quality clothing.

177,2591.0,Data Scientist,Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield,4.0,305.0,"Excellent place to work especially for those whom have never been employed in the health insurance industry. I really enjoyed working here and meeting some incredibly intelligent people while contributing to the ongoing success of a 70-plus year old non-profit organization. The Blue Cross Blue Shield brand is well recognized.At Horizon BCBSNJ--similar to other licensees in the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association--there is a large faction of pessimistic individuals in leadership positions, holding on to antiquated business models and perceptons with white-knuckled grips.  As a result, it can be extremely challenging to present business case for, and then receive approvals  for abandoning the status quos--e.g., adopting more progressive, data-driven and primary intelligence-driven approaches to driving sales and marketing instead of relying on ""gut"" instincts and anecdotal stories.Worked in case management for 9 years.  Was micromanaged last 6 months there along with others with 9+ years invested in the company, felt like being picked on and weeded out.  Direct supervisor needed management skills in working with co-workersAnswered benefit questions for future and current customerMy co-workers were friendly and great to work with.Great pay.I learned to work well with everyone even irate customers.Horizon BCBS is an excellent place to work!!! The management team on up cared very much about their employees and work environment.It offer opportunity to learn more about the health insurance industry. My coworkers are very knowledgeable n we work great together as a team.Working within a team to meet a common goal was enjoyable whenever everyone completed their part.  The management only concern was how much money did they save the company by any means necessary.Worked in the call center where the work environment was fast paced, busy, and you had to stay on top of frequent changes in the healthcare market.  Co-workers were extremely helpful, but dealing with management can be challenging.  The hardest part of the job was staying on top of the changes, and the most enjoyable part was the ability to assist people in their time of need.I enjoyed working at Horizon BBSNJ it is a place you can grow if you apply yourself. Unfortunately the management can be more educated and willing to promote educated and well deserved staff.You will be able to advance your career working in this environment. Normal day at work for any employee who is considered work from home will exceed the 8 hour work day (typically 10-12 hours) and there will be weekends where you are playing catch up. Some of the programs do not have enough people working for them which makes your caseload much more difficult to balance with your home life.A typical day at work involves auditing programming and defect resolution consultations with Production Analysts. Verification of business and technical requirements as business liason. Evaluate prospective /new technical design implementation. Weekly inventory status meetings  with management. Provide monthly status reporting to senior level management. Reduce audit inventory by educating coders on best programming practices and identification of new, more efficient programming configurations.Productive environment, processing claims, management knowledgeable.  Co-workers helpful, always willing to help. Hard talking to irate customers.I worked there for over 23 years. The benefits & salary are great. They have a great fitness center, daycare, ATM, beautiful cafeteria, Starbucks, and great places to sit & eat. Oh, not to mention on site medical care (RN Practioner & Labcorp). There are many departments so you can move around.I have worked for this company for 10 years. I received 6 months worth of training and felt very prepared and confident when it was time to perform. The expectations can be a little more stringent than some other insurance companies. But you will be trained properly.Training is notoriously poor. Goals are unrealistic. Supervisors are allowed to bully staff without consequence. Managers do not know how to manage people.Horizon is a wonderful place to work. They are committed to providing superior health insurance, provided by top rate hospitals and physicians at the most affordable cost.Horizon fosters the idea of getting the problems solved and doesn't not believe in the idea of putting a bandage on a problem.  This is one of the many attributes of Horizon that I so appreciate.Great company!! You get to learn the ends and outs of insurance claims. However, I started as a temp employee and I felt that I was being taken advantage of. I was given numerous responsibilities and very low pay.Nice place to work. I enjoyed my time there. People are very friendly. nice work environment. I would recommend the company to anyone looking for a job in the healthcare insurance industry.Since this was my first job, I was able to learn a lot of skills that I think will help in the future. The support from my Team Lead and Manager helped ensure that I learned to do the right process(following process flows).Horizon is and extremely amazing company to work for. but the management isn't organized, they donot prioritize their employees.Prior to my involvement in my crime, I was a top employee with numerous highlights while working at Horizon. Almost all of my reviews were above reproach and with high regard from management and staff.I was supervisor/lead for the staff at wall NJ location and had a great experience while there. was looking forward to retiring from Horizon until my problems away from work happened.",,New-York,Newark,NJ,2016-02-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/698648c8-7fcc-4056-9176-fce8402ad728?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

183,2597.0,Sr. Data Scientist - User & Product Analytics,Tumblr,4.3,6.0,"Tumblr has recently announced that they will start paying bloggers, however this is to come in the future. For now you need to seek third party businesses in order to monetize your site. Depending on your traffic, it is good passive income.Tumblr was honestly an amazing place to start working because it set the standards high for all my future work environments. My managers were supportive and effective and my coworkers were friendly. The company fostered a really open work environment were people were encouraged to mingle with other departments and understand how other people's work affected them. I think the free food and casual atmosphere helped people take breaks and socialize when they needed to and to get more work done without burning out.Most importantly, my job taught me how tech and social media companies work and how intellectual property laws affect them. It was a fascinating look into the way site policies were informed and reformed as well.Great culture and growing company. Fun place to work and think on your feet. Have the ability to make an impact on the company and bottom line.I joined Tumblr blogging web site in 2012, to share and contribute my love of the hit cable series, The Walking Dead.  The site is nicely outlined and formatted for experienced bloggers and writers to compose stories, fiction, media footage, quotes, and photos.  Many bloggers have thousands of followers, others have several hundred. Presently, Tumblr is the only media blog site I know of that is solely dedicated to Entertainment.  It also is a terrific avenue for newbies to practice and perfect their writing, designing, and blogging skills.Tumblr has trained me for this social media frenzy of a world we live in and has taught me the essentials. Trend-forecasting and fashion history research played a major part as well.",51 to 200,New-York,New York City,NY,2015-12-14T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/a99d17d3-7908-450d-80be-6c69981aeb57?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Did I mention the company pays $10,000 for employee referrals??  Awesome perk. The culture is great - everyone is young and has a work hard, play hard mentality. The management here is also something to highlight. I respect and admire my managers and leaders so much. They are always giving me constructive criticism and are open to feedback. I can always go to them for help and I feel very comfortable with them. I truly enjoy coming to work everyday.I started here about 6 months ago and I can see myself here for years to come. So much growth potential and opportunity. If you put the effort in, it pays off in the end and will be recognized and acknowledged.The best job I've had to date yet. A typical day would be creating new users/ fixing things around the office. I would also be sent to the data center to fix servers if they went down. I've learned so much about systems administration at pulse point due to all my co-workers interest in seeing me grow intellectually.Very toxic place to work in, especially finance department. No work-life balanceI had my great internship at Pulsepoint this summer. It is a great place to learn, build-up your skills, and most importantly, have fun. As an intern, I was given a well-organized and planned intern plan on my day 1 and was assigned with a mentor. My mentor was very sharing, smart, patient, and responsive. They asked a lot ""what you have learned"" rather ""what you have done for them"". I felt I wasn't just an intern, but a part of the team and a part of the ""culture"". Little dreams matter and ""interns"" matter!The work days are very busy. Fast pace environment. I became proficient at Great Plains while working at this company. Mgmt is great and I get along great with y peers.Great company and management!  I learned how to be very flexible and wear many hats!This is a great company to work for.

High turnover due to restructuring of departments and recent acquisition.The work environment is neatly organized. However, management is horrible and unorganized . The employees work well as a team. The hardest part of the job is taping boxes.Dealertrack Technologies, Inc is one of the result oriented working environment where each and every employee has their own Identity.Dealertrack is a big company to work for.  I work from 7:30-4:00, which are pretty awesome hours. They are pretty flexible when it comes to hours.  I think the best part of my job is working with my co-workers.  We are definitely a team that works together to solve any issue.  I've been with my company for almost 12 years and have learned a lot especially about management skills.  I think the hardest part of my job would have to be the amount of standing I do a day, but I wouldn't have it any other way.  I like to up and about.Fast paced environment with plenty of opportunity for advancement. Multiple locations across the country with many carreer paths to choose from.Great place to get a foot in the door as well as a little advancement; advancement is limited however and usually requires substantial relocationGreat work/life balance, benefits are amazing!  Great team work across all teams with amazing interactions.The CEO has great communication meeting very often throughout the year to keep everyone on the same page.The work is not too bad, flexible work week hours, every day is different, the work here is Decent work, not too bad pay, pretty good benifits, 401K, health, vison and dental insurancde, 17 days PTO.Title and registration of commercial vehicles according to state regulations.  I enjoyed working with new clients everyday and learning state laws in regards to registrationDealertrack excels at helping clients connect their marketing and operations across both digital and physical environments. They pay  really well.However, it was a great opportunity and I learned a variety of skills.  My supervisor was very down to earth and all employees, including temps, were treated to a monthly lunch.  The work was repetitive but everyone was always nice and lighthearted so it made the work less torturous.DealerTrack is a growing company. There is room for advancement and has a great environment. Great benefits. Opportunities are fair.A typical day at Dealertrack included reviewing your case load and working individual tickets, via email or phone.  Placing calls to clients to update them on the status of their issues.Not too much working pressure, the engineering team is pretty nice and willing to help you at all times. The engineering team is also willing to absorb the new technologies.","1,001 to 5,000",New-York,Edison,NJ,2016-09-06T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/f25ed78d-75c4-47db-85e7-e5ffb6786aa5?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

212,2626.0,Associate Research Scientist,NYU Langone Medical Center,4.1,178.0,"A great place to work. Staff and management are very friendly and make you feel like home!!! Happy to come to work everyday and motivated as well. Great placeThis was one of my first jobs out of college, so I wasn't making much money as an analyst. However, we were able to take grad school classes at a discount, which was really great.good group to work with and knowledgeable about processes.  management changed, however, still maintained focus on science and operations.  great group.Before they were bought out they were a decent company to work for. Not organized, HR was slow in getting back to you about anything. More like a small mom and pop organization.I have grown as an individual since I started working here, co-workers are fun to be around and very helpful. There is always room for growth and expansion, the job itself is very manageable.typical day at this job taking patient vitals and preparing them for examination from the doctor. good days and bad days but I always kept a smile on my face because I know most people don't like coming to the doctor. So many different people from different cultures. my co-workers was awesome always a good day.NYU Langone was a fast past working environment where deadlines needed to be met immediately. I worked in the finance department at this company. I inputed data, worked proficiently using Microsoft Office applications and setting up routine computer procedures to resolve simple software/hardware problems, accessing emails, electronic records and other basic office support software. Some of my employers were difficult to work with however I've always been able to separate personal from business.  Although I may not have agreed with someones process I pride myself on being a good teammate to get a job done.NYU Langone Medical Center is an excellent place to work. The staff is kind, hardworking, and dedicated to exceptional patient care.Typical day of work starts by reading emails and prioritizing your daily task. Prep faculty meetings for each course sessions with follow ups. Weekly meeting with deans and management. Review educational courses with directors.  Contact vendors and speakers for special events and training.  Collect all data and educational materials needed for the Inter-Clerkship courses.  The hardest part of the job was to get all the educators, directors, deans and management to agree to a specific educational course for the clerkship. It was a horrible battle of brains and egos. Best part of the job was my co-workers who supported me. It was a family type bond that kept me going.i love working there, the staff and doctors are great and so are the patients. its just awesome overall. there is short to no breaks and always be on your toes because it gets really busyI have worked at NYU Medical Center in Radiation Oncology for 14 years.  I was trained on the job in all aspects of clinical work and QA.  I passed my board exams and have continued to grow in all areas of clinical and research.  I have developed departmental policies and procedures.  On a daily basis, I manage the HDR program.  I strive to make the department more organized and efficient.Been here now 8 years love it. Very friendly, loving place to be an work. Over all exciting place to work wonderful staff, loving nurses and Dr's. Nyu one of the best hospitals in NYCWorking for NYU Langone Medical Center was the beginning to my exceptional potential in Finance. I started my career as an Financial Analyst Associate working with the analysis and invoicing of federal and non-federal grants. I managed and submitted invoices to the project coordinator for six clinical research departments. I worked closely with the manager and analyst to assure accuracy and timely execution of documentation and expenditures for quarterly, monthly or annually invoicing of expenditures for payment. I submitted over thirty invoices monthly following all policies and procedures of the authorization submitted from the administrator for NIH funding. I created journal entries in the general ledger for transferring of fund information. I reconciled expenses that hit after the project period and recorded transaction on the next invoice submission. I worked very closely to all teams assisting with information that they may not be able to acquire because of there obligations to finishing financial reports. I learned a lot from being pro active; now I am able to work autonomously which lessens micro management when completing tasks. I complied documentation for the A-133 and all three years we  exceptional with the reports as a team and organization.I really love this per diem job. I enjoy doing IV's and teaching new floor nurses who are just learning to do IVs when the opportunity comes up. There is great teamwork amongst the nurses on the Vascular Access Team and that makes it always a pleasant day there.I love working here but I would like to see more opportunitied to grow.Its a small hospital, the environment is freindly and not as hectic as other hospitals. We have great management, freindly co-workers, and I enjoy the fact that I get off fairly early each day.This was a great experience. Professional work environment. Multiple work sites available for per diem shifts.i am still signed with this company and will return if i ever live in NY again.NYU Langone Medical Center is one of the best places to work.  I enjoyed my time there. And I will gladly go back.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the culture of the company.  People stay there for over 45 years there.Great management, great perks, room for advancement. Healthcare team works well together with the common goal of patient care in mind. Nurses are treated well, they're encouraged to further their education and are pushed to do better and better. Lots of support provided. Salary is great for manhattan living.-Great team -Wonderful work-life balance-Flexible hours-Flexible scheduling-Get to choose department-Great co-volunteersI really do not think that after spending all this time on your site I should be made to write you a story or review on a company. I don't want to do that. I object to being funneled into your market research.maybe it has to do with where you are placed, but my employers office was bought by NYULMC in november, and since then it brought nothing but chaos. E-mails weren't answered in a timely fashion, questions were never answered. i waited about 8 months for the site manager to hand me rules for medical records. everything is unorganized and chaotic. there is favoritsm and BULLYING. i felt very uncomfortable as to how i was spoken to.  One office manager felt like she had something against me and was always after me. i wouldn't mind working for NYU, but the faculty group practice where i was, was all over the place, and i would NEVER go back there.","10,000+",New-York,New York,NY,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/ab789861-f2cd-45da-99f0-1dd7135e7147?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I attribute this to poor local management. Also the region has been overlooked at the corporate level and left in the hands of people who lack relevant experience.Its a good job, I have fun at the job. What you get paid when you start your job is pretty much what you're going to get. Don't expect good raises or promotionsGroundwater & Environmental Services, Inc. has no identity of itself. There is no cohesiveness, top to bottom. They would like you to believe that this company is a perfect place to work , with the best minds, and utmost attention to safety. They don't really care about safety...only the numbers associated with safety. Bright minds, yes, but all for themselves, with little upward potential unless you belong to a click.Operations level - good group on local level.Corporate level - Self-preservation oriented.Good work environment with a lot of travel for work. Co-workers are nice people.  Typical day can range from 8-5 to 6-6.  Office hours and field hours range.Laid off after less than 1 year of service due to lack of work... made me wonder why I was hired in the first place.  Too much micro-management, too many managers.  Company feeds off oil companiesMundane and monotonous routine. Management was not interested in training junior employees. Excessive travel for below average compensation was the norm. Mass hiring and subsequent layoffs were commonplace. There was an extremely high turnover rate amongst employees that weren't laid off. Morale was extremely low during the entirety of my tenure with the company. Not a conducive environment for a burgeoning career as a scientist.When I was with GES, there was a very low company morale, and a very high turnover rate of 37%. The salary was low, in comparison to similar positions with other firms. Most people left after one or two years. Additionally, senior management would cater excessively to client demands, and did not hesitate to make personnel changes upon their demands. This created a low morale and a disconnect between local employees and senior management.",,New-York,New York,NY,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/2fa40c43-1ce2-4510-b254-047be0dcab6f?mescoid=1900261001001&jobPosition=30,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I have learned so much working here and have grown alot. I enjoyed working as a Public Health Nurse.They made me an incorrect offer and told me to trust them as they couldn't get it in writing for a couple days. So I put notice in at my current position and then they rescinded the offer the next day because I accepted an offer that was incorrect. I guess I wouldn't want to work there if that's how they are anyways.Got a lot to learn. Very fast paced environment. Proper work life balance. Great location and great benefits. Great communication channels between cross functional teams.VNSNY used to be a great place to work-But inow there is a hostile working environment ,no management support, poor problem solving skills from managers.I have been a Public Health nurse for 20 plus years and still enjoy seeing patients at home but this agency had made it more difficult for us to casemanage safely and efficiently . The nurses and rehab group that i worked with are awesome !I have worked for this company for more than a decade, it was a wonderful company but sadly at this time the current management, especially in Westchester and the Bronx is HORRIBLE, it has sunken to the depths of a DRACONIAN ERA where backstabbing and witch-hunts of the dedicated staff that has been there for 10-25 years is under attack. Especially the Westchester management team, the 2 managers here are basically incompetent and they want to micro-manage the nurses to prove they are doing their jobs, but honestly they are destroying the efficiency of the nurses and they are horrible managers, sadly they used to be nurses in the organization and have lost perspective.  The salary and benefits are excellent, but if you want to be worked to death for money that is a personal question.  The Manhattan division is still run OK - but there is not the opportunity to make the money that there used to be in the company.  There is UFT UNION representation for the nurses and they do a wonderful job, but it is definitely an exhausting place to work these days.  The benefits through the UFT union are wonderful, full paid medical/dental for the entire family just for union dues, no employee contributions. And a pension managed by the UFT fund.VNS was okay to work for at first. The workload was always heavy but we made the best of it. In the last 3 years, however management has shifted their focus to be more harrassing than usual and the big stick mentality is constant. Your cases keep increasing and you cannot even get to see patients on schedule. They care more about numbers, spending millions on ridiculous dashboards while laying off essential staff and downsizing a 3 floor office space down to a 4 room corner box. This company does not care about their patients and less so the workers. Most managers have resigned so you work without supervision. You cannot even reach them via phone. Move along if you wish to provide safe patient care and maintain your sanity or integrity. This is not a good place to work.This job sounded wonderful but when it came down to it, it was pushy people that if they didn't like your work this when you were not in their churchI was layed off more than 2 years ago and still miss the work life balance. I would work there again at the first chance i get.The employees were rude I was offered a work study assignment from my school to work here. I would walk into the office and there would be no work available I would have to ask around if there something to do to make the day go by quicker.Field work three times a week in the office for 2 days a week. I learned to be a caseworker by fieldwork training being out in the field. Management staff was very concern about sending employees to classes so they can continue to exceed in their position, Co workers worked as a team so we can assist members who needed homecare services. The hardest part was convincing elderly members when it came to documents needed for healthcare but over all they come around and are please with the services VNS has provided.VNSNY is a great place to work. The benefits are awesome and my colleagues are wonderful. The hours are comfortable too.Company does not value and invest in its employees.  Management let great talent walk out the door.  Many talented individuals were forced to leave. People that are there are not recognized and developed.  No opportunity for growth due to politics.  Very political organization.  Not based on what you do but who you know.Love the patient care and day to day dealings with patients. don't care for the numerous managers, lack of communication to staff. great co-workers!I loved my job.Never called out sick, never late. I look forward to every night going on duty.  Always signed on an hour early to see how the flow was going and check all emails before starting. Sometimes back flow from evening was a little hectic but then slowed down.  Learned to listen carefully to what patients did  not say to clue me in to their problem.  Management as per my clinical instructor was very good. Received good advise. My co workers were the best.  Assisting with Hospice calls and translating  spanish calls for the Manager on duty was stressfull,  or pt that were lonely and just wanted someone to speak to at night, which I would stay on the phone and speak to them.  Most enjoyable when pt was so sad and at end of conversation would tell me I made their day brighter, I would keep their phone and call them few days later to check up on them.  I spoke to my coordinator about the need to call our clients to check up on them, which we implemented.  Worst day of my life when I retired.. My Dad was very sick I had to be there for him, he died 11/15.  Now I am looking forward to giving to my clients what I learned caring for him and my step mom.  My understanding for the  care  patients with dementia and progressive alzheimers need  is very difficult. Want to give back for all I have learned, patience, love for nursing them back to an acceptable way of life with dignity, making sure no one hurts them emotional or bodily.lots of transition, good for someone who likes to work in the field and likes the change.A lot of employees left due to the increase in the caseloads but not in pay.There are no annual bonuses any more.Caseloads increased from around 25 to 40/50 and moreProductive and supportive hospice team with excellent management, time consuming travel however, interesting and self-fulfilling during patient and family encounter. Provides great learning experience.I met wonderful people who work/worked for VNSNY. I also learned and was taught how to be a good administrative assistant by the head of VNS Choice. Best boss I ever had. What was wrong with VNSNY is that there was no loyalty to me or anyone else at VNSNY. There never is any loyalty and that is a shame. Especially those of us who worked so hard for so many years. The management from the top has changed and it's not the same place it used to be. It was a pleasure working there from 2001 when I started and then around 2007 it started to change. It's gone down hill from there. Massive lay offs and a lack of loyalty to it's employees. It used to be a wonderful place. There old logo was ""We Bring the Caring Home"". I miss that...Big company lots of challenges. No  structure. will like to work where there is more structure. Company has good benefitsDoes very good with payroll and any other task ask to do.Does great job with AR.Always takes on other task to help other.Fills in when other are on vacation.3 days a week out in the field making home visits to assist members with documents needed for Medicaid Applications and bringing Medicaid application down to 34th street  Medicaid office to be process timely  and 2 days a week in the office reviewing and assisting members over the phone regarding what documents are needed for scheduled pick up date.  I learned how to travel within the Borough  of the Bronx NY.  Management was fair with caseload and willing to send you to classes for training to keep you educated & updated with the different changes within Medicaid guidelines. Co-works were team players and family oriented. The hardest part of the job is not knowing if you were safe going into member's homes. Most enjoyable was working in the Borough  that you lived in it felt like you were giving  back to your community.","10,000+",New-York,Manhattan,NY,2016-10-09T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/93497153-fbde-4f4e-b184-cdca8a82d40a?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

234,2648.0,Laboratory Scientist l,Icon,3.9,77.0,"My typical day at work included logging into e-mail and data management systems. Every 2 weeks a meeting with your manager would be held. Much of the work was done independently.  It was a good place to learn data management software and use Microsoft office.Love this hotel.  Everyone is so nice and goes far and above the norm of customer service. The hotel is down town and next to the rail for great transportation.Long hours, in all types of weather.  Enjoyed co-workers, would travel for weeks at a time.  Work would vary depending on what job site I was sent to.8-10 hours /day.  Learned a lot about negotiating contracts.  Had to learn on my own, very little training.  Did not enjoy my experience there.The workplace was such that once one is ready to gain knowledge in that field, there was no limitation to progress. This made me enjoy working there.Great day. The environment is very work friendly.  Love seeing and meeting new customers. Hardest part is organization.It is a good place to work but the pay is not good and the management.. if they start to pay employe more than u will see better result and also mangers need to be more trainedwould have loved to continue my work with this company but unfortunately my schedule had too much of a impact at the time. job always kept you on your toes, never did the same thing ever day. would recommend this job to the right people any day!They lay off people every other year. Finally they moved most the work to China. That just goes to show how cheap of a company they are. If they want to pay Chinese $.5/hr of work, what do you think they will think of your wages?Not a secure job place to work at.Great company to work for!! Been there for over two years and have had no major issues. Great job work life balance, compensation, and job security.  The management and job culture is pretty good as well.Work/ life balance is good, the company is diverse and my manager is great! The overall company is good. They are not robots, which is something I can appreciate.Very Productive in all aspects, paper work, management meetings, setting up events with local or big time celebrities. (yo gotti,fetty wap, cast of the empire, ect.)Learned to multitask & meet deadlines,learned a lot about the men fashion industry (urban wear) (brands I associated with Rockstar, True Religion, PRPS, Robin Jean, Bally, Louis Leeman, MCM, ect.Co-workers were amazing, uplifting high spirited, fashion iconist. Would love to work again with such amazing people.The hardest part of the job was meeting deadlines for a total of 46 stores, as far as getting advertisement done, buying merchandise for each individual store. Traveling to each region was starting to take a toll on me but I managed it & did what I was told.The most enjoyable part of my job was, traveling to different states for big time trade show. Working with great people, seeing celebrities. Highlight was picking out the wear everyone enjoyed the most. I'm glad I was apart of this company.I worked in Radiology.  The management at this hospital is excessive.  I would say that they need to cut the fat at the top.  Too much duplicity in the management arena.I like the the great opportunity to make changes if that was for improvement.great schedule to work.In summer time was low that give as opportunity to be with the family and enjoy the summer.I learn a lot about organization and lean Manufacturing and be self motivated.the management was open to new ideas and implementation of them.I like to work with a different people from many culturesMake people to change ways to work and implement lean manufacturing but in the end all the people was into it.The fun part was the opportunity to implement changes and facilitated the job of the people making his job easy and more productive with less effort.Learned to work great with others and run a prodoctive line with a team players. had a great supervisor to lead us. they were willing to help us out always.I currently enjoy my current job. I help transport employees to and from the train station in a timely fashion. My passangers and I have formed a good relationship over the years and really enjoy serving them. The most difficult part of my job is driving in the snow. I am very skilled in this regard, so its not too challenging. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work for and with. We get along very well.Great environment, managed office network, devices, and company website. Learned more about Apple OS and devices. Hardest part of the job was meeting the demand of the staff and customers. Most enjoyable part of the job was editing website.I had a good time at ICON when it started, that being said, it turned at the end. The CEO talks alot about how great the company is doing but they never really want to promote. Some of the managment in the Chicago office is lackluster and can actually be alittle bit of a bully and mentally abusive. i still have PTSD from the blond lady who looks like an orangutang.Very friendly co-workers, they helped me out with using a cash register. The manager made you feel like part of their family.not at this time, I do not feel like this is something I would like to talk about at this time.  If I get hired at this company then I will tell more about my back groundHigh energy workplace with a tight-knit group of co-workers. Management cares about individuals as well as pushing business growth. The majority of my fellow employees are counted as friends after having spent time together at work. The hardest part of the job is balancing life/work balance. Late nights do not always help in having a normal daytime existence. The most satisfying part of my job is seeing new guests returning after a positive experience and continually growing the business.","5,001 to 10,000",New-York,New York,NY,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/3848b0ef-25ba-4152-bcda-937434a1ac09?mescoid=1900255001001&jobPosition=12,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Co-workers are all very friendly.The environment is pleasant, friendly and professional. I learned a vast amount of skill sets which helped me towards my management career. My co-workers were very efficient and diligent in working as a team. The most difficult part of the job was the internal politics, lack of planning, limited knowledge in managment from a production standpoint. Unfortunatly, there wasn't clear/consice descision making inwhich affected the direction of projects. There was 2 sets of 'laws' and alot of internal turmoil between groups. The most enjoyable part of the job was being sucessful reaching deadlines enlight of the time constraints/challenges.AECOM is a great place to work and learn Construction Management.  As a Construction Superintendent, I was able to interact with different contractors on a ""work order"" basis"" and learned more about RFP procedures and contract timelines to complete projects to final closeout.Friendly atmosphere and good team experience. Good work culture and enjoyed working with management and friendly co-workers. Enjoyed extra-curricular events and celebrations.The job has a lot of room for improvement. I was told that there would be sufficient training. That wasn't the case. The procedures are all reliant on who is in the room, if the manager is in the room all t's are crossed and I's are dotted. When the supervisor was in the room, incidents were deliberately ignored on their order. If this was ever caught the supervisor would place the blame on the operators. The pay is ok for what the job involves. The benefits were very expensive. Overall this job would be much better if the management were replaced, and better benefits were includedThis is a company so filled with red tape and beauracracy that it can't get out from its own way.  The culture and day to day work environment is horrible unless you enjoy fulfilling non-engineering related tasks that are tied to meeting accounting requirements imposed from a corporate management that has no knowledge of day-to-day operations performed by the engineering staff of professionals.The company has been focusing on Employee development and satisfaction in recent months. benefits could be better. not very competitive. Management can also be improvedBenefits are a thing of the past for this company. Health insurance benefits are doubling in price and the coverage is going down. Look to spend 20-30% of your salary for health coverage. In 2017 you will be penalized for having a working spouse on your insurance plan.Would be a great place to work if there were any hope for pay increases.  The job itself is very satisfying working along side with various  government officials,  There is no room for advancement, but much training is provided to ensure that everyone is the best that  they can be at their own jobs.The company offer a variety of benefits and paid above average compensation.  The costs were average in the industry.  There is constant change coming from Corporate leadership which resulted in a stressful work environment.  No work/life balance due to long hours.Collaborative. Forward-thinking. Dynamic. Our culture mirrors our work product. With a diverse practice and projects that span the globe, AECOM is an ideal place to build your career and develop skills in entrepreneurship, project delivery, leadership, and life.Good company and people,nice atmosphere, flexible on start and end times. There are many online training platforms, just need more practical application and direction for the long term. Benefits are decent, just raised rates.great co workers, really made me feel like part of the team. Very knowledgeable and eager to help and new grad/hire like myself. Inconsistency from top down management. Furlough and layoff cycles made for very stressful situation visa v job security.Working with AECOM is a great company for advancement. Great working environment with co works. Good Team work within the company. Management gets back to you in a timely manner.Excellent employer with great benefits and management.  A team approach to construction projects is beneficial for all and is followed very well by co-workers and management alike.Tried to do the best I could with little training. Management was puppet to the host company and would throw us under the bus to make themselves look better.No raises, no weekends, no room for advancement, high turn around rate, poor corporate managers, and micromanaging. Not to mention the horrible benefits!Ive been with the company for eight years and overall they are a great company but there is no advancement within the company. Management needs to improve.Most people seem to get hired because they are friends with management or related to them in some way. There is no room for advancement. You never get recognized for the hard work you put in. Management is horrible, way too much favortism on this contract. Benefit are a joke!!! Overpriced health insurance with an over inflated deductible. Sick days and jury duty days you pay for out of your Health and Welfare Benefit. They change the way you receive your Sick days and Vacation going back and forth from accrual to front loading different times through out year. This is the contractor to avoid whilst looking for a job at Fort Bliss.I prefer not to answer this as the last 4 years has been the worst I've ever gone through. To begin with the job was fun and I learned a lot.  But 4 years ago, we became a service center with a new manager who changed the entire atmosphere of the office and our jobs. And then 2 years ago we went under a different division of the company and URS was bought by a company named AECOM and things just got worse.  People were being laid-off until it got to my position and then 10 of us lost our jobs.  In the last 4 years I went from 9% raises to 1% and 0%A typical day of work as a Logistics  Analyst at AECOM were both challenging and rewarding.  The challenging were to remain flexible and engaged in the procurement and tracking of product. I learned that the Integrated Logistics Support documents requires constant update and your co-workers/team member must be supportive of each other to include management to meet both the customer and company needs.  The most rewarding part of the job were delivering  the end product to the customer and properly trained.",201 to 500,New-York,New York,NY,2016-10-23T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/6428c107-0b5d-471c-a5ca-13a659cf97e6?mescoid=1900265001001&jobPosition=18,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

246,2660.0,Analytics Developer,Mitchell Martin,4.0,21.0,"they are good reliable company very professional, give your chance to grow. I am able to communicate with staff and very good customer service  and very helpfulOverall, it is usually, fun, challenging, pleasant and busy.  The management was very informational, the staff was a pleasure to work with and the company always provided employment with companies that I was able to learn from yet provided what was needed to the team.They offered good compensation for contract work and good benefits, but were of little assistance with finding a position when this contract was finished.I worked for them just over a month and from day one of my assignment everything was a mess! My original start date got delayed 2 days because of my cubicle and computer not being ready, and when I do finally start it still wasn't ready because of a ""mix-up"". I also had to meet with security to get an additional background check and drug test completed for the client I was working for and they didn't even have any idea that I was coming! Training was horrible and inconsistent and didn't even have any work to do for weeks when I started! Then finally I was let go with a few other people with no reason given at all! The only thing that was good was the hourly rate. I would never work for this company or their client again!Mitchell/Martin was a great contract company to work for!!  I had difficulty securing employment when I was moving to NYC.  MMI was recommended by an Occupational Therapist who had positive experiences with them.  MMI placed me at a great hospital in the Bronx with a full time position that started as soon as I moved.  In addition, my contact at MMI was always quick to respond to questions and I always got paid on time!!The best Health Recruiting Company in New YorkI learn good experience to work many different nationality!My co-workers like me and we like to work together without any gapsA typical day at work would be checking patients in & out of the health center via EMR, Performing 20-80 phlebotomy procedures.By working with MItchell Martin I learned that patience is in fact a virtue when dealing / working with others. Management in my opinion from a scale of 1-10(10 being the highest) will be a 7, As far as my co-workers I would have to give them a 5. I honestly can not pin point a ""hard part"" of the job I would say that every part of the job was just a learning experience. The most enjoyable part of the job for me would have to be actually working with the patients hands on I really enjoyed that part. Overall I would consider MItchell Martin to be a well organized & productive environment!Good place to work.Friendly people.    a typical day at work    what you learned    management    your co-workers    the hardest part of the job    the most enjoyable part of the jobI like working with therm .. they have upscale clients ,and the keeps me busy. the pay on time, good communications. their pay rate is average.Unprofessional people. I was told about the placement and resigned from my job. I have submitted all the requirements and forms needed, even the physical exam that I have to shoulder. Suddenly, they became so quiet and didn't bother to follow up on what's going on. Until such time that I didn't hear from them completely.MMI is making the attempt at starting a new office in Dallas. There is a lot of opportunity with the organization as they are an up an coming IT staffing firm. There is a lot of growing pains that are going to come with this process. I have nothing bad to say about the organization. I feel that I would be better suited in a different environment.Formatted resumes for recruiters. Entered jobs into inhouse database. Prepared contracts for new consultants. Handled all paperwork for background checks and drug testing. In charge of all new hire packages.good place for new grad to add to their resume, friendly reliable recruiters....great work experience, everyone is well organized and effective in their task. dealing with people from all ethnic background all with one common goal patient care that is effective and within your scope.Like working for this company its really nice  been to different locations and I honestly love working with themthe delay of ICD-10 has resulted in the client not having enough work for me.Friendly and supportive staff, driven to help their clients. Fantastic work environment if you live in the NYC metro area. Their branches are not as reliable.A typical day at work consist of project meetings sponsor updates on high profile projects.Over all good relationship. 8:30-5:30 pm weekdays. Co-workers all got along.",,New-York,New York,NY,2016-09-15T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/25bcdc25-ac76-4cec-a218-ba307812e9f0?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Supervisors were very nice, always held thanksgiving party for all staff.College Assistant typical work life is like working as hotel doormat.Management is a joke! They don't care about you. All they care about when is their next paycheck! Co-workers/students are a joke, they are smart in their academics but lazy as F$#K! You can literally not show up for work and get still get pay, and not get fired.Most enjoyable part of the job is leaving end of the day!In theory, CUNY is a good place to work.However the demands of the job supersede the compensation provided. My colleagues are helpful. The commute is awful.performed numerous transfer evaluations for transfer students using the BOSS and TES SystemAssisted students with undergraduate admissions and transfer related issuesMet with students to discuss their evaluationsprofessional work atmosphere hundreds of transfer caseloads per semester in addition to the case files from the previous semester that need to to be evaluated and updatedI worked in the CUNY SEEK department as part of my school's work study program in order to pay for my classes and books.  It was enjoyable and gave me additional experience working with the public.Wonderful people and greate place to work. Recommended to all cuny students to work there. You can meet various people throughout the entire CUNY system.Best place to work, professional development guaranty, Fun environment, flexible and prosperous. Working in that place made me a better person in terms of learning and capacity buildingCUNY campuses have been nationally recognized as culturally diverse institutions of higher learning that foster a profound appreciation for different cultures, languages and world perspectives.go in, do the job, leave at end of shift.  best part: possibility of studying while working. hardest part:  when classes canceled but school not closed, still expected to go to work.not a good place to be. no chance for advancement. whatever job you do will stay the same so will your salary. managers pressure people into working crazy hours for free. some make sexist racist and homophobic comments all the time . one of the executives of the school said that arabs were not even human beings to the new york times. a lot of the people are just awful . incompetent and lazy are rewarded with big salaries. hard workers get taken for suckers and punished for it. some high level staff are convicted felons who were hired anyway .google it . a lot of nepatism. know somebody and get hired don't and you wont. if you are good at that go for it. if you are a woman a minority (other than asian) or lgbt stay away from this place. you will be treated like garbage. the amount of waste and fraud is very very high. this place is corrupt.relocated assets for 23 collegesreconciled cash and bank statementcollected data, coded computer entriesprepared quarterly and annual reconciliationsIts a typical day at work but has you own your toes literally, don't sit and help students with there technical issues. the co-workers are nice though.Working for any government agency you obtain a great amount of experience only if you choose to work hard.internal promotions are always available but compensation never meets the amount of resposibilityoverall very good just some problems with contract being renewed due to this being a city job. The management is well rounded but the really good people don't last long since the compensation for good work simply isn't there.Prolidase is a metallopeptidase that is ubiquitous in nature and has been isolated from many different organisms such as bacteria, archaea and fungi.  Prolidase specifically hydrolyzes dipeptides. It requires zinc and/or other metals for activation. Routinely used laboratory isolate of C. albicans, ATCC 36232 produces significantly reduced amount of prolidase. We investigated to determine the enzyme level during different phases of growth in minimal media. The data for prolidase activity yielded negative results. It was also concluded that DBP/Tween-80 mixture was not toxic for the respective strains. All toxicity assays performed with cultures of the chemical dilution were positive indicating the absences of toxicity at the concentrations utilized. For the whole cell assay, MnCl2 was used for activation of prolidase. The qualitative assay of this whole cell was also negative. We assume that the amount of time affected our results. We can conclude that an appropriate future strategy with a time course spanning from 12 hours to 72 hours or longer may yield better results.I have been with this company for 25 years and I enjoy working with them. I love my job. The benefits are great but the salary is not.On the campus that I was employed it is somewhat laid back atmosphere except when employees that have been at the campus for many many years try to sabotage newer younger employees that may help the institution by introducing positive changes. There is no regard for authority for those older employees, some of them believe they are above authority because they have tenure. Sometimes employees who do no work outlast employees who work really hard.on the positive side for the most part everyone is very friendly and there is a sense of community amongst most employees making the work environment very pleasurable leading to high employee morale. Benefits are really good too!!The job was okay. You have to deal with people that are crazy and rude on the phone. Management cares about how quick you can end the call. Doesn't feel like people are actually being helped.My typical work day consisted of various clerical duties such as typing, data entry, filing and retrieving, answering telephone/providing information/relaying messages, serving as a receptionist,opening/sorting/distribution of mail, providing photocopies. I worked under the direct supervision of the College Office Assistant. Assisted the professors, adjuncts, counselors/advisers with open enrollment/registration of incoming freshmen and continuing students. My co-workers and I had a great and wonderful rapport. The fulfilling part of my job was seeing those students you helped graduate and move on successfully. The hardest part was leaving...I enjoyed working at CUNY.  It was a great experience.  I love the interaction with staff and students, which was positive.  A typical day would be meeting with students to assist them in identifying an internship in their career interest or lecturing a seminar (Critical Reflections or Fundamentals of Career Advancement).  The hardest part was finding an appropriate internship for a student at the last hour.  Fortunately, the student was able to secure one.I enjoyed the flexibility of my schedule.  For the most part, it was a nurturing environment as well as a supportive.I love working at CUNY.  Although you may have the same title as some other employee, your task may be triple theirs and nothing can be done.  You can get lucky and get in a laid back department or you can be placed somewhere, and become the manager and paid as an office assistant.",,New-York,Brooklyn,NY,2016-06-20T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/11244644-5bcf-4e04-b9cd-0f16c9b45eec?mescoid=1900287001001&jobPosition=11,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

271,2685.0,Chemist II,Teva Pharmaceuticals,3.7,263.0,"Local office, not so good. The rest of the company based out of MA and out of the United States provides better management and a bitter work environment.I work from 8:30-5pm at my current position at Teva, Mon-Friday.   I have learned how to use Oracle, Image Now systems in the almost 7 years here.   I am a team player and value my job and have a strong worth ethic.    The most enjoyable part of my job is working on resolving issues that arise from internal and external customers.Teva Pharmaceuticals is a great company to work for..The benefits are great, vacation time is generous, and work/life balance is pretty solid. However, advancement opportunities are available seemingly only in specific departments.Great people, culture, compensation. The dual business model of generics and branded products has provided stability during the industries ups and downs.very quick paced environment, great people, great opportunities and great pay. They offer great benefits and compensation depending on what shift you work. Great leadership as well. The company has a bright future.Not a good place for bluecollar workers. Always under pressure to perform and always worried about losing your job. Management is too concerned about their own survival to be concerned about their direct reports. However there are quite a few nice people there, but as the saying goes, ""nice people finish last"".Very good work environment. Not sure about job everyday. Family environment.Overall very good work place. Management very good and good benefits. Co-workers very helpful.The company has great benefit for yourslef and your family. It was a little strict but it was becuase everything has to be in people ready.Teva Pharmaceuticals is a great place to work.  Good work life balance.  Accurate balance between base salary and bonus.  Management team that considers sales force when making decisions.I was appalled by the culture. Falsification of documentation was a daily occurrence. SOPs and approved process rarely followed. Compliance and patient safety was an afterthought. Hired as a ""GMP Specialist"", but quickly found out GMP was not at all a priority. Tried to address it with management and HR. Big mistake on both counts.Very good company to work for. The work load is very reasonable. Management do change usually, however it is just titles, the people stay the same. Great coworkers, the environment is not at all toxic.most enjoyable part of the job is the team is very good at being international, a global company feels much smaller due to weekly meetings.The leadership at Teva has grown ever more evil over the last few years - there really is no other word for it.  The HR department in the US is run by clowns who were fired from their previous companies.  The corporate headquarters in Israel wants to get its hands in the daily business more and more, even though they don't understand American tax, compliance, or operations.  They continue to cut headcount so that they can keep investors happy.  That's great if you're an investor, but it's terrible if you're an employee there.  You will be required to carry your iPhone everywhere and respond to emails immediately, doesn't matter if you're at a funeral or if it's Christmas you're going to suck it up if you want to keep your job.  The pay and benefits are amazing which is why most people stay there because the compensation is difficult to match.  But make no mistake, you are selling your soul and your health if you stay there.  If you get an interview, be sure to ask how many US employees have committed suicide in the last year, and how many have had heart attacks, or stress related illnesses.  Do yourself a favor and run away from that place as fast and as far as you can.it was a good company to work at and gain valuable experience in the pharmaceutical industry. The hours were good and the compensation was good.Horrible experience interviewing......manager from PA wanted to prove something and was visciously trying to degrade me during our meeting.  Asked such irrelevant questions should have reported her....this place not worth the culture.....very bad wrap.  Manager wasn't even professionally dressed.  Glad I ended the interview abruptly...lolTEVA is a top pharmaceutical company and treats their employees the way a top pharmaceutical company should.  Going to work was a delight and compensation was on par with most major pharma companies.Changed managers 4 or 5 times while I was there. No security.  Morale of the employees and many leaders at a very low. Pay is low with very little raise each year, benefits OK. Appreciation is not shown often. The work is not hard but full attention is necessary to eliminate costly mistakes, which makes it stressful.I've been with this company for about 2 1/2 years. Since the beginning I have learned a lot about pharmaceutical medications, FDA regulations, and mostly safety. This company's main concern is their employees safety. This specific plant in Utah is still growing and has the potential to grow bigger. TEVA is a huge worldwide company and is very successful being one of the top producers of generic medicine, which means job security. As the company grows there is new regulations, new rules and new processes but that comes with every growing company.Teva Pharmaceuticals is a great company with great benefits. Employees stay there for years and still walk around with a bright smile on their faces.  Interaction among everyone is encourages and appreciated.  Working at Teva has allowed me to learn the importance of being even more detailed and achievable person.I work hard daily to ensure all duties and task have been completed in a timely manner. The location is great. The people are great and the benefits are awesome. They care about their employees.No chance for advancement,cheated out of raises each year,90% of managers don't know the job and lean on employees to pull their weight.No training program whatsoever.They make you sign off on computer based Sops and barely give you a chance to read them.I ran products several years without being signed off on anything.The only time they worry about following rules and plant cleanliness is when there is company coming.Supervisors and Leads sign off stuff without even checking it and are too lazy to gown up and go in the rooms to check stuff.Wonder how the FDA would like that!There are many valid reasons for the high CNE turnover rate as I will outline below:1) Integrity/ Teva values: They love to talk about it at meetings and in communications; but in practice, integrity is sorely lacking among the program manager and others in upper management. You often see a sugary sweet persona on the outside, but underhanded and deceitful behaviors in practice. Inauthentic and robotic interactions are the norm. Integrity comes naturally to the CNEs in the program, and in general is part of the genetic make-up of true nurses.It is the management that does not practice what they preach in terms of integrity and Teva values.,2) Advancement: Many highly qualified CNEs are groomed for management positions but are then overlooked for promotions when positions become available. Long-time Teva employees with Sales and Marketing backgrounds are selected over well-qualified nurses to manage CNE teams.3) Sales people managing clinical staff: Why are managers with absolutely no healthcare or clinical experience/background allowed to observe and/or participate in patient trainings and interfere with the sacred patient/nurse dynamic?  This is out of their element and they are not qualified to participate in any way.4) Common sense is nowhere to be found. If you have a brain and like to use it, think twice before you sign on because your ideas are not appreciated or welcomed.5) Poor communication: Things change all the time but new information does not always make it to everyone who needs to know about it. Processes are not enforced uniformly.","10,000+",New-York,Elizabeth,NJ,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/9dd2240c-282d-4b04-9642-8e50a68a2ae0?mescoid=1900259001001&jobPosition=14,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I would highly recommend this company to anyone.NSLIJ made me who I am today, the constant help for co-workers and colleges helping each other, motivating each other, being polite is what molded me to be the employee I am today, Now a days is very hard to find a job environment like that.This company is a fun and productive place to be. I have been working for this agencies for the past four years and have had wonderful experiences.A typical day consisted of meet and greet new hires and candidates.I learned the HR applicant tracking system. My coworkers were very helpful and friendly.The hardest part of the job was the environment.Great place to work but is not offering full time position. Co-workers are hardworking and pleasant and management is very helpful in educating their employees.Clock into work and read emails of the day ,check messages & begin to see patients, either individually therapy sessions or group therapy sessions. I've learned that I enjoyed working inpatient as opposed to an outpatient clinic setting. I've worked inpatient for many years and I am not used to micromanagement. My Social Work colleagues are experienced and experts in the field of Substance Abuse. The hardest part of the job were the hours, 1PM to 9PM 3 days a week & then switching gears into 9 to 5 midweek and on Fridays. Understaffed. Low moral of employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the patients, especially when you realize you've helped them to become well.A typical day at work included of: participating in meetings with interdisciplinary staff team, conducting an intake, conversing with social workers, RN's, MD's, psychologists, psychiatrists, nurse practitioners and MHC's. leading/co-leading or observing group therapy sessions on a variety of topics, conducting a private one-on-one therapy session, writing and formulating session notes from group and personal therapy as well as receiving supervision in a relaxed and no-pressure environment.Vocational Services is a wonderful department.Supervisors and staff are always willing to go above and beyond.Working in vocational services I have learned different skillsVery Busy, productive, under staffed.  My most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help patients.  I am a team player and love to assist Doctors during procedures and examinationsSince working at North Shore I've learned a different methods of talking and working with people. The team-work is amazing this the true meaning of team work. When i ask for help I actually receive it from my fellow co-workers. My patients are the best part of my job. A typical day for me is getting my patients ready for a relax evening after working so hard in therapy, taking temps, giving showers, just making sure my patients are as comfortable as possible.From intake to discharge the patient is given world class service, as the nurses are provided with world class education and leadership from management.During my years of service as a ward clerk I was able to apply and learn new skills.  Which gave me the opportunity to move on into other avenues within the North Shore Facility.Train by excellent teachers. Great thorough demonstration followed by repeat demonstration.some managers are to young and unexperienced  can feel ""less than""  un acknowledge most of the time. some floors are great team players.South Side Hospital is working within a community for a community. My coworkers were like family. Residents are fun, it is always good to learn from them and with them.",,New-York,Manhasset,NY,2016-11-29T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/61cdaf93-ed43-4d8b-8500-6a9e90bb218a?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

275,2689.0,Tech Svc Scientist (I),NBTY,3.5,134.0,"The employees didn't help as often. Some of the employers were self motivated in getting a group effort job done. But overall I enjoyed working for the company I'm a self starter so even though I didn't get as much help as I was suppose to there were other individuals on different lines that did come help outGreat place to work,learned very quick most of the jobs on the packaging floor.Only problem is the hiring process.I literally have 2 supervisors pushing to get me hired because i already know almost every position and am just a great worker overall but still nothing.Not to mention alot of perm employees limit themselves to one position.This is a company with a lot of potential but due to unfit senior Mgt the company has gone downhill for some time. Unlikely that the brands will get back to their old glory anytime soon with current leadership team.NBTY has not only been a place of work it has been my second home. The experienced and knowledge acquired in in the years working for NBTY is incredible. Definitely a great place to work!Management plays a huge role in an associate not being able to balance work and home.  Very stressful and demanding.  Limited resources for the associates to do the task at hand.  Outdated equipment with difficulty retaining parts.  Limited amount of staff to complete projects as scheduled.I really never knew what I was going into on any day.  I've learned various differences between pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals which were very interesting to me.The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the associates and getting to know them on a more personal level.  I've always had a hands on in all that I do.  I can personally relate to the typical associate because I started my career the same way.Is a nice place to work, good enviroment and clean. People are friendly. The job is easy and the management care about associates. Its a safety place to work.NBTY was a great company to work for a few years ago. It was full of optimism, creativity and growth. Typical day was productive and efficient. It is best suited for recent graduates or entry level positions looking to get your feet wet. It now has become top heavy by made up CO positions and they keep trying to reinvent the wheel making all parts of the company work less efficiently and productively. I truly did love this company and was happy to go there. Now myself and coworkers dread each day that goes by and the company continues to drag us down. There is so much speculation that the company is going to be sold and slowly the brands are breaking down. Who knows what the future holds for this company but as of right now it is incredibly unstable. I wish there was better outlook but I have yet to see a positive change.I have worked for this company for 8 years. I have done lots of things. It is a bit crazy at  times where you do not know what is going ot hit you from one day to the nextin  my years at nbty I learned a lot I can run a line set up the line and also take lead of that line. my co workers respected  me when I was lead.. shift change over was very hard had to get ready for my own shiftvery unhealthy working enviorment the job status is not very secure constantly switching departments not to many workers in each departmentA typical day at work consist of me going into a morning meeting, then going into the office and releasing products or evaluating products.Good company good hours, my coworkers show a lot of teamwork . I learned how to run the machine, how to read work orders  I think is a great company  good benefits  and  and I'm looking for something to match itbest company to work, professional management, international acclaimed company,diversity of products - vitamins, minerals, herbs,supplements.good working environment. moderated benefitsManagement can try to keep a better eye on the supervisors for those of who are not favored cause the threats are getting a little old.I've been trained in sop's, Gmp's, and  Oshawa certified for sit down, stand up, and PE lifts, nice environment to work good coworkers and great management teamWas a great job 10 years agoHas gotten worse after new investment firm came in and took over Every building was different on how good it was or wasn't to work inAfter the sale of one of their main buildings there is no sure thing there. people are giving added responsablities without any promotion or pay raise. Not so bad except some of them are forced into managemnet roles, but kept as regular workers. Mandatory can be called at the end of shift the day before, giving you very little notice to change plans. There is a lot of internal fighting going on.Good place to work; recommended, you ll have a lot of fun there, I think is a good experience that will help you to develop new skills.Hard working, enjoyableCommunicate well with public & employeeesI was very punctual & always willing to work on call. Employee of the monthEnjoyed working as a three man team. The hardest part of the job is continuously monitoring equipment throughout day with minimal downtime. Enjoyable part of the job was making improvments.Not a good place to work. Management is very poor. They tell you lies and false promises. They have a lot of temp people. They tell temp people they going to make them permanent and they don't. They like to use people. Many people have quit. Management has bad communication with its employees. They have had many great people work there but they end up leaving for better jobs. If you have experience this is not the place for you. There is much better out there.","10,000+",New-York,Leonia,NJ,2016-11-14T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/8ad6011f-1070-4607-827b-838f02ab8130?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Rowe has many paths to travel. management is open and helpful.Best company I have worked for!  Great work environment, co-workers, management team, and numerous opportunities for continuous learning, training, and education.  Solid work/life balance as long as you were efficient and a good time manager.  Easy to move up if you network appropriately.Advancement is more time driven than merit driven - regardless of your skill set, you will not be considered for a promotion until X months/years in your current role.Work life balance was solid with relatively flexible hours and a decent company culture.There is a lack of accountability though, so employees are able to skate by without any risk of punishment.Great benefits, and an awesome atmosphere. The management and compensation are lacking, and not up to par with other companies in the financial industry.There could be more vision in terms of their strategic technology plan, but overall the firm is a good place to work.  They have good benefits packages, and for the most part are good about work/life balance.Great company to work for with advancement opportunities and generous benefits. It can be challenging in the beginning to understand the IT infrastructure and to establish yourself. But the coworkers are very helpful.Prosgreat non-monetary benefits, easy company mobility, excellent work-life balance, and really nice people. overall, a really solid company to work for.Consin order to move past a certain level, you definitely need a solid education background or significant professional experience. hard to break through into the trading environment, similar to many competitorsAdvice to Managementtake smaller bonuses and reward employees at the bottom making less than 50k a year. no reason someone should be making $10 million a year when others at the same company are just trying to stay afloatManagement is okay and stay off your back if you do what you are supposed to. Easy to slip through the cracks if you don't lobby for yourself. Management path is the best way to advance in other areas of the company- nearly impossible to get a promotion out of operations unless you are on the management track.My days here are really enjoyable. I really like the people and the atmosphere. Work/Life balance is really important to the management.T. Rowe Price is an excellent company to grow and develop your skill and knowledge in the investment world. I highly recommend anyone who wants to start somewhere in the investment world to apply for T. Rowe. However, the company has a lot of catching up to do with industry standards and trends.great company to work for. Really good benefits including large 401k contributions. Just have to be able to deal with many different projects and responsibilities at one time. Opportunities are there, you just have to go after and get them.Good place to work but very little communication through teams. There is little to no communication between teams working on the same project. There is even less communication between management to the teams.Company taught me a lot about corp culture - great place to . I learned alot about how a company can teach you about life. Nothing in life comes easy... you must put in the work to achieve your dreams.T. Rowe Price is an absolutely great place to work.  Employees are very friendly.  Fringe benefits are very good.  Leader was great.  Very helpful.I like the job. Not a fan of doing the same thing everyday but if you don't mind talking on the phone to customers, and looking at computer screen while on a recorded line to ensure compliance then this job is nice. Not much room for growth though until you get your series 7. You get two 15 minute breaks a day and an hour lunch.It was nice working with T Rowe Price. Warm Culture. Co workers were very helpful specially Manager. Though there is still some discrimination between contractors and Full Time but I didn't have to face this in my team. Team was supportive and helpful.Good and stable company to grow your career in Finance domain. Nice work environment and people to work with.It was very corporate and quiet. Every weekend there was work and never had a day off. Management was never seenThey have a fitness center at both locations, Owings Mills and Baltimore.  There are two in Owings Mills, one brand new. The management at T. Rowe is great. There is room for growth and a lot of wonderful opportunities to advance.From my perspective, it seemed the only avenue to promotion into leadership was to be a part of the crony crew. Most members of general management were very close friends, in some cases connections dating back to High School. Promotions seemed to be honored based on friendships and not previous professional experience or true talent.  Friendships and being a part of crony club should not be a compelling reason to promote an individual. These high school antics have contributed to my decision to seek employment in a professional environment, where promotions are based on merit and not likeability or one's ability to mesh with a homogenous group.There is also no life/work balance with mandatory overtime. 8 hours is plenty of life to contribute to work. Family and health is more important. If you are not a crony, you will not experience organizational agility anyway.I worked for a group of writers who were a very interesting.  I met some great friends there, and learned a bit about stocks.  I made travel arrangements for the writers, kept vacation requests, etc.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the fact that everyone got along.","5,001 to 10,000",New-York,New York,NY,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/c031eba2-7e13-48b3-93cf-454629a96237?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=28,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

As a team, we've recently started to break the glass ceiling of implementing arts within the STEM work environment, learning every step of the way. Combined, the arts and STEM can help to engage more US learners and help our economy grow.Good workplace environment for longterm employment. Good place for internal organizational job changes. Management varies depending on the organization you support. Co-workers can either be team players or non-team players. It depends on your organization. Hardest part of the job is figuring out what management's expectations from day to day. Working for the federal government was an enjoyable employment opportunity.Coming to work everyday at NASA is never a stressfull day. People are very professional and work oriented.

It is a mix of people of different backgrounds and cultures that made NASA what is now.I interned in the Finance Department at NASA Ames Research Center the summer before my senior year of high school. Having been my first internship and exposure to a real work environment, NASA taught me a lot and influenced the career path I have taken. A typical day at work began around 9 AM, ending at 3 PM. I learned Ames' internal control procedures for accounting and analyzed financial statements for accordance with NASA's Continuous Monitoring Program. My co-workers were friendly and were happy to assist me with whatever issue I encountered. The hardest part of the job was familiarizing myself with government accounting protocols, as it was my first exposure to the field. The most enjoyable part of the job was having access to recreational facilities during my break times, such as the basketball court and the gym.A typical day at NASA was very relaxing and hard working. During my time at NASA I learned how to create a phasing plan, communicate with others from different departments, and lastly I learned how to manage multiple financial accounts. My co-workers were very patient and straight forward with the task at hand, they were friendly and very hard working. The toughest part of my job that I had to overcome was having to complete a full financial report before a given deadline. The best part of my job was that I had the opportunity to work for NASA and the fact that I got the chance to work and live in Florida for three months.NASA is in the news every day for absolutely awesome accomplishments.  As Senior Organization Development Consultant and executive coach at Headquarters, I get to guide leaders as they build environments that foster such success.Typical days may include working on space hardware, research aircraft, exact models, to testing in wind tunnels, You learn to accept additional responsibliities, work to completion deadlines, deal with scientists, reseqrchers, contractors, vemdors and researchers as well as management and other technical staff. hardest days mat require to climd 28 flights of stairs outside in all weather condtions to complete testing of experiments The most rewarding is watching test complete sucessful, models so exact they become standards for future projectsFirst Rated place to work with unlimited benefits and opportunities.  Excellent working environment.  This is all for nonw.A typical day at work would range from watching the Shuttle land to stocking office supplies. Working with a wide range of people...astronauts to NASA nerds. Hardest part of the jobs was ensuring & training new or changing procedures to staff. Change management was a constantI was given the opportunity to learn cutting edge technology before it was introduced to the public. The staff and management were always there to help.NASA once was a place to work where brilliant ideas met hard work in order to achieve the impossible.  Those days are long gone.  Mostly due to budget cuts over the decades.One of the more disappointing aspects of working for NASA is the lack of job security  Due to repeating term hires, you can be let go after investing too many of your earning / research years.  The only individuals who are protected, are managers.  If I could go back in time, personally I would have not accepted a position at NASA, and instead pursued a career with DoD or DoE.Working for NASA was a rewarding experience in that I got a chance to see what the environment was like there, as well as a look into the levels of government security, types of technology, and main objectives of the Armstrong team.  The most enjoyable part was interacting with quite a few very pleasant individuals at various levels of command.  The hardest part of the job was meeting the ever present increasing demands for productivity while facing obstacles such as customer availability, and seriously corrupted systems.  Overall we managed to meet the overall goals of the contract.I really loved this job.  Management was wonderful and the staff was wonderful as well.  My co workers were wonderful.  They really cared about each other and they helped one another any way they could.Great place to work. Family Orientated environment. My day was busy, learned something new each day in regards to customer relations and support of my group. Management was understand a not difficult to work with.  I supported a great group of guys and we worked together as a team. I can not say that I remember any hard times unless it was trying to meet a deadline that was short.Planning events and helping all of the wonderful groups in the building. I truly enjoyed working at NASA, plus it is only 5 minutes from home.Excellent work/life balance, average pay and benefits, no bonus, no profit sharing, management seems not appreciate your hard and quality work.The project was not that easy to build, wire, test and rebuild. There was 15 member to work in the project and found/solve the problem. The management of the team was not really good because some people want to work in their own which is not a team work idea. People lame each other about not doing anything or do work in their own without referring to the design drawn. The hardest part of the work was when we have to rebuild and rewire the whole robot because of some mistake people did. Rewiring was because some of the electrical component was old and did destroyed.The daily work changed from day to day, keeping things from getting tedious. People were friendly and interested in their work, and willing to listen to ideas no matter who had them. This feeling of inclusion and importance, combined with a air of mutual respect regardless of position, helped keep even the hardest work from being frustrating and boring. I learned new things every day I was there, and even the worst day there was better than the best day at some places I've been.NSSC in Bay St Louis is a great place to work.  Friendly people and helpful Management.  Lot of training opportunities and the NSSC promotes from within first which is a plus.Amenities such as Post Office, Day Care, Cafeteria, and Mini Mart.I felt very welcomed. Being an intern at NASA helped me obtain great technical and soft skills. A typical work day is coming in to work saying good morning to everyone I see. While also meeting with my managers and supervisors and completing the worked that has been assigned to me for the day. While working I'm learning and experience what the do's and dont's are in a professional environment. I'm learning so much in so many different fields of work at NASA. NASA has helped me to become very proficient with the Microsoft office. The hardest part about the job was learning how to use Microsoft Excel. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to be in a flexible position to where i can work with many departments and deal with more than one type of work duties.I enjoyed my work its variety and for the most part the folks I worked with and the challenges they regularly place before me. I was encouraged by my NASA management to mentor younger individuals and was actively involved with our documentation deliverable s.pros:plenty of tech fairs and talks by leading scientists and researchersairshows and daily fighter jets roaring over youlunch yummost sites open to visitknowledgeable technical managers and employeescons:takes too long to get equipment (legal and HR department bureaucracy and power dynamics)restricting budget makes many projects fall short, especially for interns","10,000+",New-York,New York,NY,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/6388f959-5764-4811-89ec-7470531b6bc0?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=29,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

It was a great working environment and they were also very friendly.My typical day at work would be face paced, hands on, and cautious. Everyday there was always something new to learn. My coworkers were very friendly and handy. The most enjoyable part of the job was that i got to experience making beauty products for women/men and making them feel better about themselves.A typical day at work is to meet, greet and engage each customer. Ask about their concerns or questions, if any. My Job is to assist each customer with their desired product as well as introduce and market new products to them.Management is fully structured and organized at L'Oréal.  Co-workers are very supportive and act as a collective unit. The best part of the job is, it forces me to challenge myself to be a better employee each day. Another great thing I like about his job is, I get the opportunity to try new products first hand before the public.Was an excellent experience. I saw the world and worked with amazing people. I enjoyed working for L'Oreal until I witnessed hair product technologies being shared between the brands. I felt that brand identity and proprietary technology had been sacrificed for their bigger picture.You work diligently for what you get and what you get is good. No complaints except I had around 30 comp days due me when I left. No time to take them. Lots of work. You would be happy to get a 6 month project off your plate because the plate was over-flowing. No time to celebrate or feel a sense of accomplishment for the amazing work you did. Otherwise...no complaints. Excellent work environment and amazing people in the organization as well as the clients that loved the brand. Had more fun than not...perhaps thats why I didn't take the comp days due me. Just saying'...Very good company with a lot of benefits, and they give away a lot of extra incentives just for working their. The only thing that i did like  was the pay raise was not fair. If the pay raise was better then that would help.My recent experience in Packaging, Replenishment, Stocking, and Full Case has been an opportunity to learn the mission of the distribution center in providing customer products to meet their demands in deadline.Typical day at work involved SAP interaction and excel reporting and macro creation. Most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with, and the biggest challenge was facilitating the necessary answers I needed from co-workersPoor management.Good Benefits and trainingsCan only advance if you are in with higher ups.Promotions happen to fast and under influence of high turnover.Not professional.•	Managed the global project ‘ERGO ATTITUDE’ •	Analyzed the ergonomics of 18 workstations•	Presented the results to the CIO The Active Cosmetics Division brands•	Supervised three working group of 5 employees each•	Coordinated actions' plan for the reduction of the ergonomic risk•	Reduced 25% risk of ergonomic injuriesgood place to work, met a lot of people. big numbers place so very few fun days. good money but they trap you there with the money they start you out at. didn't care for managementhave to work multi taskinglearned a lot about retail, sales and operationlearned how to handle people, adjust and get a long with diff peopleenjoy on learning new thingsAs a Full Time Key Holder I have learned a lot and I am constantly given new material to learn.My boos set me up with great tools and advice so that I am more confident to carry out my job and excel even further.I got to work right below a director of the company. I had one major job and would do other little tasks that my boss asked me to do. The major task was a three month project in which I was designing a new system. Gave me a different experience than I have had before.Typical day at work is starting off with a groupmeeting and finding out what machine you will be working on. You could be working a 8 or 12 hour shift depending on the job. You really won't have any problems with co-workers if you keep to yourself.There is allot of gossiping going around so keep your personal life to yourself. Management is ok but sometimes do not know what goes on around the work place to make it a better enviorment. If your machine is broken down or multiple you could be sent home. Depending on how long the machines are able to be fixed you could be out of a job for weeks with no pay.I've learned the diversity of the company.The most enjoyable part of the job is that they ensure that you have career advancement and flexibility at work.There´s always something new to learn everyday.  The diversity of culture makes the work environment a good place to work.A very fast-paced work environment which requires you to be very flexible and ready to resolve any issues that may arise. Great learning experience.For the most part nice people too work with. Good day off plan. A bit of dislike for short notice; of overtime. Safety was preached not always practiced.Job Culture is great. Everyone is nice and most are willing to help.  Depending on the department pretty good work/life balance.L'Oreal became is one of world's largest beauty company with32 global brands , came we say no more with such name recognition","10,000+",New-York,Clark,NJ,2016-08-24T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/d9a66376-58d4-41de-9d2d-57a423b4d582?mescoid=1900259001001&jobPosition=4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

313,2727.0,Senior Statistician,Jet,4.0,75.0,"a typical day at work was grabbing a scanner and a cart full of boxes, scan each box and find the items through out the warehouse to pack into the orders. once all order were filled you returned the cart to be packaged properly and shipped. the hardest part of the job was walking for 10 hours a day but the fixed hours and pay were well worth it. all of my coworkers were very friendly and would help you with any questions you had. the company was very fun and very relaxed when all your hard work was done.Hard work pays off. Good things happen to good people and bad people go to work too work be a positive person at all times .Why complain about your job or doing it when its easy as a light exercise. I myself was the top preformer.Day at Jet Starts off first with getting to work you come in and you immediately get started. Employees are great people. One of the most enjoyable aspects is the atmosphere.It's a great place to work ...has a good family work ethic.they make it a fun environment to work in. Alot of fun.anyone would enjoy working for jet. Apply to them.Work was great at first. They are a new company that doesn't have it together yet. My coworkers were amazing, but the management was iffy to say the least. The hardest part of the job, was how much I didn't like it. I wanted to advance faster than they would allow me. I had all the qualifications to be a lead, but wasn't given the position.A typical day at work is entering work with a positive, going to either pick up the money for my cash register or the folder for inventory or either both. Also, i set my stand up in a timely matter and stating that means counting for inventory, putting money in the register, making lemonade and popcorn...etc, I also greet my customers and begin the day for the came, when its time to leave just recount for inventory clean up my stand and count the money i have made for today and turn everything in,really nice place to work but they pay was not good enough to keep me working there, i had to move on to a better paying companypretty good and easy joblots and lots of walking. very hard on the body after 2 days of working. pay is pretty decent and theres room for growth. all types of people and races working thereWorking for Jet has been a very enjoyable experience. You get to meet and work with different people from different backgrounds.The scheduling is extremely flexible and the job is only hard if you make it hard.Good place to gain experience and further your skills in Welding/Fabricating. Can further skills in laser/water jet cutting and machining.Pros:Great people, easy to move up and to different places. They definitely show their appreciation by catering, and offering advancements to other positions. Cons: A lot of management is clueless. They have strict time policies which make you think they are trying to push people out. They are such a new company that they are still finding their way so there is constant changes.New company just starting up and they're not organized yet. Communication was sporatic & didn't get paid for a month. Hopefully they'll get this worked out over time.Taking phone calls, managing a queue, problem solving, placing orders for clients. I have learned many new systems, procedures, company is constantly changing.Management doesn't communicate with employees or supervisors, there is a big lack.I have some very great coworkers that I work with on my team.The hardest part is how drastic and frequent changes are with no communication.I love working with and being apart of a growing and developing teamHe went out of  business due too lack of funds.. I did like the experience and working with client and the warranty companiesShifts were PRNAttended to medical injuries for young athletesSolo medic for football, soccer, volleyball games and trackAssisted management with sport physicalsI was able to get hands on work where I learned a lot coming out of school.  They let you explore new ideas to help improve products and expand markets.Good work environment with friendly employees but it is a small company with limited resource so you may not be able to implement your project even if there is a good opportunitynot a bad place to work, however, it seems that not everyone is treated fairly based upon the work completed.Great job for extra income. This job has proved to be a great part time job that i have been grateful to have three different cities to work in. It is a great experience because i get to work sporting events, concerts, and other cool events.i would usually be in avert buggy welding the verist all day intill it was time to add another ring. i learned pulse welding is way better and easier to weld with.hardest part was jumping the scaffold boards. easiest part was welding the floor. most enjoyable part was finishing the tank.Wonderful room for advancement and career growth.

314,2728.0,Engineer Analytics and Optimization,JetBlue Airways,4.3,407.0,"A company that takes care of both inside and outside customers and has a lot of values caring safety passion intrgrity It is a 13 times in row a JD power winner Adding more flights and growing fastI absolutely love the company and management. It's the super low hourly wages that has me disappointed with the company. Yes you get the perks of flying for free but that means little to nothing if you aren't making enough to take care of your family. The company is growing wildly so for big stations (JFK, MCO, BOS, FLL) hours are plentiful HOWEVER if you are in a small station like BNA with only 3 flights you are only going to get 20 hours a week MAX is you work mornings and 25 hours if you work afternoons.This is a very flexible work environment once you are able to work from homeFor the first few months one needs to travel to the facility, but once one is over the initial training working from home is a great experienceThe travel benefits are alright, but trying to get a flight could be stressful when one has to fly standbyAt work on a daily basis you were met with challenges due to the lack of support because of staffing.  To be a supervisor you had to know how to multi-task. My colleagues were very supportive at all times team work was a day to day practice with our team of leaders.  However there were times that upper management could have been more supportive. Hardest part of the job was when you couldn't get support from your upper Management. So I learned  to be confident in my decisions based on my knowledge and experience.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the flight benefits, the crewmembers and profit sharing.One of the best jobs I've ever held. I enjoyed my 13 years at JetBlue and although I never try to look back, I must admit I miss this one tremendously. Management at all levels always made sure that all crewmembers were empowered by ensuring constant training and support was always available. Opportunities to grow within the company was supported with mentorship and shadowing programs for those with a vision and the desire to succeed.Excellent place to work, staff is amazing. Travel is available for all qualified staff.  The Pilots are very supportive and helpful to Inflight Crew Members.  Training was grueling but necessary and the Trainers were exceptional.  If you have never experienced anything as it relates to Aviation, you must be prepared for an in depth training curriculum.This is a great company to work for. The culture is relaxed , open, and fun. Innovation and willingness to try new things is the norm here. My only critique would be the lack of a clear career trajectory. It is not consistent across departments. Some departments have very clear paths for career growth, while others have employees that seem to be stuck in some sort of purgatory. Also, the process for reviews has changed several times.Management was horrible, definitely picked and choosed favorites, which made work life very difficult. Management never let you know how you were doing, or how you can improve. Only talked to you when did something wrong. Then wouldnt tell you how you can do it right the next timeJetBlue is a good place to work. However, I am looking to leave the airline industry and pursue a new career in a different customer service field. I have grown tired of all the traveling, living out of a suitcase, staying at hotels and the overall environment of the airline industry. On the upside, I have made many great friends, seen a lot of places and adapted to the fast past lifestyle. The one thing that I really dislike about the job is that I live in Charlotte but I am based out of Boston. My job requires me to commute by plane weekly. My life, family and friends are all here in Charlotte and this is where I want to be. Thank you!Has its moment, it can be really busy and really slow however the most excitement comes when things are busy because it the time everyone meaning customers are angry. I-rate customers are sometimes upset for something that has nothing to do with the airline but its still exciting dealing with themWorking at Jetblue is a wonderful experience and allows an avid traveler or adventurous explorer to be able to explore and see the world while working or enjoying the perks while off work at incredible discounts and rates.The people are great and are very passionate about what they do. Days and people are difficult and challenging. Delays affect not just the airline and passengers but you as well, so making sure you have a good balanced diet and food prepared and brought with you for those times you don't have the option to grab food anywhere really comes in handy and gives you that needed energy boost. However, meeting people from all walks of life and all around the world is wonderful and truly makes you realize the world is so big and there are so many people trying to live their day to day lives as best as possible with what they are given.Jetblue is a great company to work for.  They have a heart of gold in which they show to their employees and customers.  The pay is great and competitive which is a plus.  Some times the hours get to you but thats part of the job.  Senior leadership is great, very supportive of their employees.My typical day at work is very easy because of my past work experience and solid years of experience in Customer service,Management,Sales,Budget control,supervision,Time and Leadership.What I have learn while working at Jet Blue for the past 3 years is multiplying many daily flights, while leading ground crew to have a smooth operation. My co workers are super wonderful and like our company motto "" Caring""The hardest part of my jobs is a delays of flights where sometimes customer have to wait for a while.The most enjoyable and wonderful thing about my is I get to travel the world.I love working for JetBlue. I am trully blessed to be a part of this great company. I enjoy going to work everyday. This is the first job i am happy about and proud to consider myself a part of this growing company. I trully am very grateful for this opportunity.JetBlue was my last job. It was productive and fun work place. I worked from home, that was the best, that was the most enjoyable part of the job. Typical day at work, woke up, had breakfast and work in my PJs sometimes. I have learned a lot, how to deal with customers, learned new systems. Managements are excellent, but supervisor are not typical I like her to be. I liked most of my co workers, but I don't get to see them because we all worked at home. The hardest part about my job is the expectations. We have to stay focus and keep working all the time, no inactivity what so ever and we have to meet the criteria and goals. They monitored us all the time, watched and listen to us work. Worst part is lack of training. I enjoyed the most was my flight benefits and able to stay home and enjoy my family.Outstanding organization to work for. Great Health care  benefits for part time employees as well as full time employees, and free flying privileges.Stock options etc.Great place to work, caring management, options to learn more, educated and move on!JetBlue has a proud tradition of supporting dedicated community organizations through partnerships, donations and crew member volunteering.Very exciting company to work for. Not only does it take care of it's customers and openly takes excellent care of it employees. Upper leadership is very in tune with employees and also very willing and able to help when needed. Excellent choice to work for.I have been with the organization for over 6 years and at times it has been great at other times very challenging.  Direction can be unclear and lacking. Work life balance is a challenge, expectations are you should be available all day every day.  But if you enjoy being in a team environment and working hard than it is a magical placeIt was a stay at home job.  It was difficult because you were constantly on the phone, call after call.  We had Co-workers who were above us and helped us with any questions or concerns.  The hardest part of the job was when customers would get upset with you when you had no control over it.  I loved being a part of JetBlue but had a hard time using the benefits because of the schedule.Jetful is an amazing place to work. CEO and higher management really care about employees and are always finding ways to compensate for hard work and effort. Everyone is friendly and always willing to help. Growth options are achievable and promotions are always encouraged.","10,000+",New-York,New York,NY,2016-10-30T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/9eb97849-8810-40b6-979b-9b87cc5e9f49?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=24,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
315,2729.0,Research Scientist,ObjectWin Technology,3.9,21.0,"I enjoyed the Placement/assignment that I got in Starwood Hotels, but I thought Objectwin could have Tried a lot harder to get me a New assignment when it Ended!!!My experience with ObjectWin has been very positive. Once placed in my contract position, ObjectWin has been hands off unless I have questions for them. They are prompt with replies. I do get weekly reminders to submit my timecard which I don't need, but the connection is nice. I do get health insurance benefits, but they are not great - a very high deductible. No vacation and no holiday pay.Good pay / hour.  401K 3% match.  No vacation.  Standard medical / dental.  All hiring and paperwork are handled remotely.  Most of the company is out of India.Joined as an Executive in Pre-Sales Department. Learnt a lot about the market. Very friendly staff and encouraging Managers. There is always a healthy competition among the employees.This place was my first to work in USA, I was quite worried about how I will learn and work there. But my supervisor was so patient and friendly, helped me in every step when I was in learning processs. The management was helpful as well, how ever like every place there were some areas which needed some attentions. The best part was I was given all the independence and resources I needed to resolve the issues. I loved working there every moment. Had wonderful and relaxing  lunch time, when we used to discuss the ways how to improve the policies as at that time my supervisor was working on make a HR Handbook.We had a bad experience with this company. They hired an employee and terminated him without giving any reason that too in a week. No compensation was provided. The company is extremely unprofessional, just a slaughter house.  They do not accept calls, they do not answer mails once they terminate the employee. If you are hired by ObjectWin, you are doomed!Watch out if you have to sign up for any contracts with them. They are sneaky. Not reliable! Another exploiting Indian company!They find you an assignment, once assignment ends they don't try to find you another assignment.  You call and you have to leave a message on vmail.  They never return your calls.  They don't  communicate.  Very unprofessional people.Participate in daily scrum meeting, share with the team what I've worked on the previous day and what I'll be working on today. See, what all the other team members are working on which includes other    developer, and SMEs. Making sure to update my status in Agile Mgr. and continue to work on my immediate assignments.Poor physical work environmentMany systems and procedures to learnManagement very hands offTerrible work conditionsSmall Consulting company and I had good experience considering where I was in my career at that pointObjectwin technologies works very hard to locate a place of work for potential employees. I never had any trouble with pay, taking off, emergencies, tc. Thex were always available and there to help meet my direct needs. I woukd reccomend this company.Great place to work. This is smaller company with unlimited potential to grow.Great people to work with, Everyone was really Friendly and supportiveCo workers were hard to work withDays use to start late and ended early.",,New-York,New York,NY,2016-10-26T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/03588204-fc88-4616-a9c6-a33a2dcf9595?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

317,2731.0,"Medical Science Liaison/Sr MSL, Pulmonology, Rheumatology, and Ophthalmology - New York City",Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals,3.5,51.0,"Radioactive pharmaceuticals is a very challenging job and can be very demanding.  There are a lot of good folks working at the site and  a lot of experience with radioactive materials and sterile manufacturing.Mallinckrodt is a decent place to work with collaborative management. Work life balance is good, but future is uncertain since company is changing directions.Working under a contract in IT & enjoy working here.  It's a nice campus & they have plenty of work to keep you busy in IT.I've been trying to take on additional technical work (my level), but have been doing a lot of what I'd previously used summer interns for.  Inventory, Asset Management, Decom, etc.I don't mind easy tedious work to help clear backlog, but would like to put my experience & skills to better use.I have been here for a year and love it! The people are great, very diverse, lots of god perks including tranquility room, concierge, great pay and benefits.My typical day at work involves a continuous flow of projects from Production Floor manufacturing issues to Product/R&D assistance. I typically have a list of priorities as well as being on call for any production floor issues that arise. I do everything from data collection for engineering projects to electrical and mechanical component design. I assist the technicians and quality inspectors to resolve any issue beyond their skill set.           I have learned a great deal about medical device design and verification. My current position enables me to work with a wide variety of employees with varying levels of knowledge and experience and participate in many cross functional team projects.      In most cases, management provides room to work. We are usually empowered to manage our own time and projects with management support or intervention when needed.      The hardest part of my job is the increasing workload. When I was hired into the Engineering Office, we had a nine engineers. The office has been streamlined to three engineers and a technical specialist. Additionally, I am constantly on loan to R&D for technical support and special design projects.      The most enjoyable part of my job is being constantly on the move. I have never went to work and couldn't find something to do.We were acquired by Mallinckrodt and therefore based on the merger it wasn't really enough time to make an accurate assessment however during the short time I worked for them it seemed good.  My manager was responsive and listened.This company has a very dysfunctional corporate culture.  Management does not care about employees and layoffs come at a rapid rate.Company is very knowledgeable of USP standards.  Very well kept.  Quality is very important to company.  Quick turn-around for testing compared to needing shipped,Mediocre management, poor culture and disappointing business results. Reversed all the best things about Questcor since the takeover.The R&D group that i worked with were incredibly knowledgable in their fields.  The group that I was involved with was like a family.  The senior management is currently changing focus and doing away with R&D.I loved my position at this company. However, the company had just recently acquired another pharmaceutical company and there were a lot of issues with the management, i.e. no training, behavioral issues, etc. I trained myself in my position, and I absolutely loved it. I wanted to have a stable, permanent job with benefits and longevity, so I voluntarily resigned.My job duties were as follows:Processing educational grant requests, ensuring that all paper work is submitted by grantee, and coordinating meetings with grant committee for approval or declines of submissions. Processing financial awards for educational grants, fellowship grants, and investigator initiated studies.Processing all expenses and invoices for medical affairs department and following up with checks.Tracking finances and making sure they are paid out in an orderly manner. Coordinating events for MSLs—-booking venues, arranging transportation, food, etc. Ensuring that training certificates for MSLs in certain therapeutic areas are up-to-date.Work assignments were given on a weekly basis.Testing was completed on a day to day basis ending with a notebook write up and final results were entered into a sample management system.  Project work was also included.Learning was a continual process at Mallinckrodt with training updates that where to be completed within 30 days.I also continued to perfect my use of the Chromeleon data acquisition software that was previously updated within the company.The management team I was associated with were extremely supportive and encouraging to their direct reports.My co-workers were very professional and supportive, as well as some of the best people that I have ever worked with.My career with Mallinckrodt was very enjoyable.  I have to say that the best part of my job was the type of work I performed as well as the people I worked with.It was an all around great place to work.Provides good training and fair management.  Advancement opportunities if you work hard.  Has been proactive in buying companies for more opportunities.A great place to work and advance your career.  A pay for performance culture focused on delivering results and increasing shareholder value.I great place to work if you work in pharmaceutical manufacturing and a good stepping stone to larger pharmaceutical companies.  Management is very helpful and supportive if you show initiative to grow within the company.  Unfortunately the imaging division is downsizing and morale is very low with a high stress level among staff not knowing if they will be laid off.  There is a true spirit of team work among workers and will do what needs to be done to get the job done well.It's a fun working place. One of the good pharma companies in Saint Louis area. Management and co-workers are also good. Nice place for someone to start a career.Provided educational environment with the possibility of advancement.  A challenging company that encourages innovative solutions to technical challenges.  Co-workers were fun and interesting and provided support and assistance when needed.Job provided the ability to pursue additional areas of interest such as .net programming and XML and encouraged advanced development techniques and approaches.Questcor Pharmaceuticals was acquired by Mallinckrodt and the chaos began: layoffs, downsizing etc. The base compensation package stayed the same but bonus potential was slashed.The company has terrible management and incredible turnover.  The flagship products: Exalgo and Pennsaid 2% are great.Acquisition intensive, growing company based in st louis with companies spread around the country and a few internationally.Great company with great compensation and benefits.  Very horizontal structure with management.",,New-York,New York,NY,2016-10-13T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/b5447956-480b-466e-a3ef-7982ce2d6de2?mescoid=1900254001001&jobPosition=27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

325,2739.0,Geologist,Golder Associates,3.6,103.0,"Golder is a genuinely good place to work. However, the company recently tried to grow too quickly while not maintaining their original ideals. More specifically, they're management structure became more linear and top heavy.The people or friendly, and you can really work toward your professional goals. The location is in an expensive location, so it's hard to live close enough to not have a bad commute.Growing company and a great place to develop technical skills. Golder has a reputation of producing high quality technical consultants spread across the globe. The company is setup in a way that allows all employees to share expertise and advice across the globe, truly making it a world of capabilities delivered locally.Golder Associates is a global Geotechical/Environmental Company. The company's core values has an in depth emphasis on Health and Safety management,Manpower Training and Development to help attain success on employees career and lastly is the Customer Satisfaction through a Total Quality Management of the organization.Working relationship with my peers is an exiting and enjoyable one especially when everybody is doing their job diligently. A full coordination and cooperation by everyone shall be  expected and a quality product can be delivered in due time.Golder Associates was a place that I would work again in an instant, the work environment was busy and always changing.  If you are looking for advancement you must have an engineering degree,Fascinating work. Good collegian atmosphere in some groups and offices. Opportunities to do most anything anywhere in the world. Long leash given to hang yourself or achieve great things. Very pleasant work environment, despite all of the layoffs and turmoil.Work/Life balance working at Golder is very good. The last year has seen a decline is management personal. Junior to mid-level employees will be in a great position moving towards the future.I liked working for this company but the management is way off. They do not promote those who deserver it only those they like and then do very little work. I just left and heard the SW ops manager was let go so it looks like they are heading in the right direction.Company is employee owned and has an excellent culture that can proved a good work/life balance (most of the time) and a very relaxed casual office setting.  However, 2014 was a very poor financial year, and after numerous layoffs and compensation/benefits cuts this company often will not meet the standard for compensation or benefits.  Job security has dwindled and advancement opportunities have shrunk drastically as well.This was a fun company to work for with supportive management that want their employees to grow and develop within. I was the first point of contact for all employees and felt that we all worked well together on a variety of tasks.Unfortunately due to global economic issues my position was eliminated. Would definitely work there again if the opportunity arose.Golders website indicates they are big on training their employees. They believe if you have done it once, you are an expert and can do it on your own. I was constantly promised training and no training ever was done. In addition to that, I felt blacklisted from doing field work due to the older associates biased opinion I wasn't cut out for it. Simply untrue. Management is awful. The PMs do not come by and talk and ever check if you need work. If you have it great, but if not, you will be wasting a lot of time. There is a lot of false promises on incoming work. The company did not turn a profit last year and has really started to decline (How does an environmental company with mining as its' largest group, not see the decline occurring and not plan for it?? Same thing with oil, and yet no one did anything or prepared for the crashes.). I was told by multiple people Golder is not the company it used to be.  I should have seen the trend ahead of time, but was blind. A guy left because of the poor quality of work my first week. 3 months later, they laid off another person for not having work, and an engineer a month after being hired quit. They make promises but do not make good on them. There is major favoritism in the environmental group and some of the people are team players at all. Watch out. Oh and if you are an engineer, you better love landfills as that is all you will do.Good day at work, remediation stuff, managed personnel and projects, had co-workers, work was hardest part of job and technical aspects were the most employable aspectsGreat place to gain experience in materials testing, drafting, reading reports, preparing engineering graphs, preparing quantity takeoffs for landfill liner systems.I have learned so much about geotechnical data and geosynthetics just from working here a year now. There is so much room to grow if this is your field of study. A great environment to work in and great co-workers. The company is international and amazing to work for.Some talented professionals to learn from.    Lacks management direction for business growthGood company but compensation lower than competitors. Work can be interesting but sometimes slow.Golder Associates is a great company to work for.  A typical work day is 8 hours.  The co- workers are great to work with and very knowledgeable.Productive organization coupled with efficient processes to produce a product with quality and accuracy.A typical day at work is 8:00am to 5:00pm, good co-workers, good management.I was able to work on a variety of projects around the U.S. and around the World.Management is severely lacking in knowledge of proper Project Management practices/processes.  Engineers are regularly appointed PMs and have no education on how to do the work, how to make a schedule or do any sort of cost control.  This leads to no one knowing where anyone is on a project, what comes next, or where the budget is...until a month or two down the line.Flat structure is great, but it leads to management by committee.

355,2769.0,Chemist II,Teva Pharmaceuticals USA,3.7,263.0,"Local office, not so good. The rest of the company based out of MA and out of the United States provides better management and a bitter work environment.Very good company to work for. The work load is very reasonable. Management do change usually, however it is just titles, the people stay the same. Great coworkers, the environment is not at all toxic.most enjoyable part of the job is the team is very good at being international, a global company feels much smaller due to weekly meetings.Horrible experience interviewing......manager from PA wanted to prove something and was visciously trying to degrade me during our meeting.  Asked such irrelevant questions should have reported her....this place not worth the culture.....very bad wrap.  Manager wasn't even professionally dressed.  Glad I ended the interview abruptly...lolA world class pharmaceutical, with no sight of slowing down. There is an emphasis on the Opex (Operational Excellence) initiative. All employees are encouraged to put forward and initiate projects to enhance the overall experience at TEVA. From my hire date till present the site is almost unrecognizable. Love working Here.I work from 8:30-5pm at my current position at Teva, Mon-Friday.   I have learned how to use Oracle, Image Now systems in the almost 7 years here.   I am a team player and value my job and have a strong worth ethic.    The most enjoyable part of my job is working on resolving issues that arise from internal and external customers.I have enjoyed working in the Procurement industry for 20 years, however we are nearing site closure by year end. When the site closes I look forward to opening new doors to experience new opportunities.Great people, culture, compensation. The dual business model of generics and branded products has provided stability during the industries ups and downs.very quick paced environment, great people, great opportunities and great pay. They offer great benefits and compensation depending on what shift you work. Great leadership as well. The company has a bright future.I learned a lot working here.  I had a great supervisor which to this day I am still friends with.  I really developed an interest in quality control after working at this specific temp job.Teva Pharmaceuticals is a great company to work for..The benefits are great, vacation time is generous, and work/life balance is pretty solid. However, advancement opportunities are available seemingly only in specific departments.Ten hr day,  where I had to mix large bins of chemicals.  I was only there for a short period because the chemicals affected my breathing.  However, there are other departments.Not a good place for bluecollar workers. Always under pressure to perform and always worried about losing your job. Management is too concerned about their own survival to be concerned about their direct reports. However there are quite a few nice people there, but as the saying goes, ""nice people finish last"".No advancement opportunities or employee mentoring. The leadership is always afloat when it comes to everyday activities and makes decisions without thinking ahead. Only to satisfy immediate need and not consider the long term effects.Employees are the given the impression of been involved but its far from the truth.It is a place where the people are awesome and the environment is motivating. The days fly by at work and you get paid well. the company performs well and is in a great industry.Love the company it's amazing all around and they do everything the way it should be done and have the best management and go by there own values to keep the environment welcomignTeva is an excellent company with hard working dedicated employees.  The work days are long and fast paced, but the teamwork makes it all worth while.  The hardest part of the job was the downsizing required after each of our multiple acquisitions.I am an independent contractor and have the ability to create my own work schedule. Within this position I have had the opportunity to strengthen my interpersonal skills. I am able to in interact with different patients on a daily basis and train them on their therapy. It can be challenging to at times to enter patient's homes although, it not only has strengthened my skills as a nurse but in turn has strengthened my communications skills.Very good work environment. Not sure about job everyday. Family environment.Overall very good work place. Management very good and good benefits. Co-workers very helpful.Pay is good. Not a secure place to work if you don't want to worry about your job every two months. If you want to find out more try and work there I guess.I love my job there. Always some thing new to learn and share with my colleagues. I have learnt a great deal of knowledge. Management is pretty flexible and cooperative.Very good and nice company . I leave this company because my school i love it and they have very good management . You alway's happy to be part of the team .","10,000+",New-York,Elizabeth,NJ,2016-12-03T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/423a8dd4-18c4-408c-815e-c16c4c521e57?mescoid=1900259001001&jobPosition=30,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
356,2770.0,"Instrumentation Chemist, Fairfield, NJ",SGS,3.7,288.0,"This is a company that puts the well been of its employees first.The site I work at was on 8th street location in Deer Park, Tx and the Assistant Manager wanted me gone from the jump. I started as a Contract worker to Dow Chemical in Bayport, Tx which was a horrible experience. The Operators there ran the show and if they wanted you gone they would make it difficult for you. Or they will make it their business to get your Fired. The Lab Manager at SGS was fair but I feel like she was oblivious of what was going on and her Assistant Manager at the 8th Street location in Deer Park was manipulating her to take her position. I was let go because of what someone else say. A fair investigation with both parties were not conducted. I realize by past experiences with this company it was the planned. I eventually was able to received my Unemployment benefits.I'm enjoying my time working for SGS. I performed various ASTM methods on various petroleum products. I trained fellow employees in the proper techniques of various ASTM methods. I've had the cooperation of supervisors reporting results to clients and have built good relationships with clients and fellow employees.However, of late, we have lost half our staff to better opportunities. I have decided it is time for me to pursue better employment opportunities also after 9 years with SGS.I learned after working at SGS for a few years that the company really cares nothing about their employees. They will work you to death if you let them and they want you to feel grateful that you have a job. You won't get paid enough for amount of work you have to do. Managers and employees are allowed to talk to people horribly and never have any repercussions.  Every administrative process is tedious, repetitive and ridiculous. It takes a room full of people talking through jobs to get them invoiced because the process is lengthy and the instructions given to you can be interpreted in so many different ways. I've never seen a company have so many errors with invoicing in my life. The building I worked in had so many OSHA violations; wasps and mosquitos flying in the kitchen and offices, leaky windows causing mold and mildew on the carpets. The air conditioner never worked; in the winter the temperature in the office was 50 degrees. These things were reported and nothing was done by management because they could never get approval from corporate to spend money and fix the problems. The health benefits are astronomically expensive for employees.  Stay away!Although SGS is a multinational corporation, compensation and benefits weren't similar to engineering like companies I've worked before.I tried to take a certification class that SGS itself offers to external clients. The discount for being an employee was way less that I expected and they would discount from my salary the time I was 'off-work' :'(Very demanding career as you sample coal from trains, barges, stockpiles and mining pits. Great way to start out of highschool to learn basics on working in real world. Very dirty and dusty at times as you crush and prepare coal for lab testing.SGS is the world's leading inspection, verification, testing and certification company. They provide lots of training to staffs, with high efficiency.if you are looking for a low end job then this is place for you. if you want a real job keep looking. they cant even take right amount of taxes out your pay!! new training program is laughable. computer and phone system are outdated. there is no advancement. they pay new hires more than people who have been there for several years. you dont even have own desk. so if you wanted to make up hours you cant.starting pay is way above what you can find anywhere else they have good benefits, your 401 starts just after 90 days some companies it starts after 1 yearIt was like working with family. We all worked as a team and cared for one another. Productivity, learning and integerity was the overall goal. I would work there again anytime they needed me. Best Job I ever had.SGS North America is a good company overall to work with. As long as you know your role and do a good job, they will notice.  The co-workers are great and that's what I like most.  Right now there are some managerial changes, so it's difficult to say what's in store, but I think it's headed in the right direction. Work-life balance could be improved a bit more and sometimes dealing with Corporate can be tedious.  Overall, if you put the time and effort in, and willing to learn....SGS is a good company to be at!It was great to begin with, but the culture changed. I retired from there. My job went from tech support to sales in addition to the tech side. They had very little regard for their employees, due to the amount of folks looking for a position of any sort.While working for SGS I learned a lot and had a lot of opportunity to learn. I enjoyed working with most of my co-workers and enjoyed the early schedule. But the Management was a joke. They treat their employees extremely poorly and are very much based off of favoritism. The site manager was horrible to deal with and cannot personally run a lot of the equipment.Poor management. No adequate training performed. Stressful work environment. Poor communication between management and staff. Used to be a great place to work until SGS took over.SGS is all about the bottom line.  Promises were made when they bought Accutest Labs. and nothing has been done. They plan on closing more labs.The company took care of their employees. Safety of their employees was top priority. As long as you did your job the way it was required to be done, no one hassled you. Provided you with your entire uniform except boots.no rain outs, how to work as a team, management team good, good people to work with. Walking threw mud when it rains. a complete work day.During my two years at SGS I acquired new knowledge in the developmental side of the automotive industry. The company offered outstanding benefits, including a 401K and accumulating vacation time. I met some wonderful people and had the opportunity to work side by side with engineers from all over the country. Overall i enjoyed my co-workers and the duties of the job. Unfortunately management had poor communication between themselves and the employees which led to mistakes. When mistakes were made an unforgiving, unprofessional response was gave to employees, which led to there high turnover rate. If clear direction was provided and treatment of the employees by management was improved, this would have been a life long career.This position is a very similar to my last review. The hours dedicated to on the road and in the office are the same . The exposure to clients is a very important aspect of this job.I work in the Deer Park lab for 5 yrs. I work my tail off to move up but the lab manager was all about favoritism.  If she didn't like u she made it known to everyone. She is a condescending mean woman and   will treat you miserably. The other staff are no better or just follow along even if they disagree with her.  And if u try and go to HR they don't do much to help you feel comfortable. The raises are only given based on how much you can such up rather than performance. Also everyone is always in your business. Nothing u do goes unseen by someone.Decent Job, I've had a lot worse.  i was a loader, tank trucks and railcars.  Very procedure driven company.  Safety was always top priority.  Good entry job for plant work.","1,001 to 5,000",New-York,Fairfield,NJ,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/a795703d-757d-49ab-9344-f2103d24db25?mescoid=1900259001001&jobPosition=31,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Very flexible schedule to balance work and personal life.They will scam you out of your money.  Go to the official acorda website to apply for a position. Horrible work environment. Unprofessional. Waste of my time.This was a contract position, but the job culture was uplifting and exciting. The staff was very helpful and always willing to go the extra mile to assist.It was always a full day but fulfillingThe leadership and staff are very dedicated to the pursuit of a cure for spinal cord injury and MSThe most demanding part of the job was trying to meet a deadline for grant funding-plan and coordinate special corporate events -assist senior level management with projects and assignements-research and learn about various pharmaceutical productsNice Environment Overall, Some Management restructuring needs to happen ASAP before excellent talent leaves the company.Fantastic, effortless communication line.Very accommodating, compelled me to be extra productive and double efforts in response to their ‘no problem, let us help you’ nature.To illustrate this, I miscalculated my holiday allowance and booked a ski holiday for a day too long. I was prepared to return earlier, but was given another convenient option.I supported the entire companies needs from a creative standpoint, i reported only to the creative director, She believed in me and gave me a lot of creative freedom and gave me opportunities to learn and grow and present.I became known as the go to guy for being fast reliable and easy to work with.I even produced funny movies.Very busy, dedicated staff.

Within 9 months, it became clear that this was not going to happen. Daily responsibilities include responding to customer emails and requesting standard FDA documents for flavor production. The atmosphere within my department is pleasant, however I would like to advance.Very wasteful environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you are allowed to come up with ideas independently and be a part of the driving success for the future of the firm. The hardest part of the job is just seeing the waste of product, talent(s) are not being put to good use and waste of resources.On a typical day I work with colleagues in nearly every department on site to understand our needs and any limitations (warehouse space, labor, etc.).  I work with vendors worldwide and colleagues outside the facility to ensure materials arrive in a cost affective way just in time (JIT) for production.  I enjoy the fact that, although I run the same reports on a daily basis, I never know what is going to happen or who I need to work with to reach my daily objectives.  I like that Givaudan is a large international company and that I can work with people from all over the world on a daily basis.  I also enjoy working with SAP, and appreciated the extensive training Givaudan provided.  Givaudan is a very innovative company and they value the input of their employees regardless of their role.  Givaudan also offers a great benefits package for its employees.My on site managers are receptive to my communications with them and work to implement requests that my coworkers and I make.Great organization to work for overall. They really strive to understand how their employees feel and make their work life a positive environment. I enjoyed working for Givaudan as they are a robust and stable organization.Givaudan is a great company to work for. It offers great benefits, job security and stability. Management is friendly and competent and the industry is very fascinating.A very matrixed organization with wonderful benefits. In terms of pace, the organization moved very slowly. However, every day could be spent doing productive work.This was a great place with wonderful medical and dental benefits.  However you will spend many hours due to demand and workloadnot bad enjoy what i do just looking for more pay and better opportunity for growthforklift operation/chemical experienceIn cincnnati they backstab and fight to get to the top only there is no top and florence the management makes so much money they can be on there cell phones texting all of the time and asking their rats hows everything going their safety is terrible and they pay you 14.75 an hour and expects you to do more work than people getting 26.00 an hour yes slavery is not dead its working at givaudan.Great strong firm with  a great reputation in the industry.  Room for creativity, ideas and growth.  Long hours, hard work but, if you are committed to the field, you will love it.It was wonderful working with the residents and getting to spend time with them.  Sad to see some residents had no family or friends as visitors.  Sometimes the staff wasn't the kindest to the patients.Be careful, East Hanover has lab Supervisors and Managers that play favorites. And the Manager keeps nothing confidential.Company is very employee and customer focused.  I learned a lot about the fragrance industry as well as learning development.Prepared orders for shipments , followed purchased orders and pick list , Followed regulations to ship orders by air, ocean and truck freight.Coordinated freight pick up, Inspected all deliveries for completeness ,quality and accuracy. Sampled and inspected goods entering warehouse by logging and scanning into system .Very face-paced, high fashion and high production. Loved working there.Seeking a challenging position in the field of Production in a multinational company with a challenging environment where I can apply my training, studies, interpersonal and communication skills.I created life long friendships with some I worked with. It is a fast pace environment that required hours of overtime.Givaudan, is my first permanent job as a lab tech..

Company is old and big, I have lot of to learn.My job is checking form, fit and function. I found those jobs I checked were designed by competent people. When I found an over-site, they were most often agreeable to comply.To many changes that are not beneficial to run a successful operation, they have created a very stressful environment to work in, to far to travel to everydayday started out with changing into your uniform, going to the board to see what blending room you are working in and seeing where they were with the blend. it was a great place to work. the hardest part of the job was the lifting and dumping of drums and other ingredientsA company with poor management and no direction . Like a concentration camp with pay . No job security . You can be fired for the tiniest thing . Management has no grasp of reality , they just want what they want . People leave and whoever is left must take up the slack.I learned to work as a groupThe management and supervisors we're helpfulThe co workers we're like familyThe hardest thing was looking at the tiny pills coming down the lineand being on your feet all dayCompany is changing its focus and moving away from the longer term research to put most resources on product extensions.  If you are not part of that focus update your resume and start looking.I always have had fun at my job and have made great relationships with my clients and co-workers. I have been very successful.- Creative problem solving.- Technical trouble shooting.- Encourage creativity in work environment.- Leading group discussions.I have thoroughly enjoyed my R&D colleagues and the work challenges put forth over the last several years with complex drug product matrices for extended release and abuse deterrence. Some belaboring challenges come with bureaucracy of controlled substance products. Unfortunately, recent upper management is now more focused on short-term high-profit limited market drug products obtained through acquisitions rather than on long-term and sustainable investment in R&D for new internal products.After having had the opportunity to experience Questcor and the feeling that the Specialist in the field that provided the customer facing were of great importance, its been very difficult to understand the direction and the focus of Mallinckrodt.  I'm unsure if they undserstand the value of 1 patient and the impact that Acthar and the role that it plays within the MS Franchise.I'm proud of the fact that for 3 years I never missed a quota and I finished each year within the top 5 of the Neurology Sales (ARD) Team.  The southern Nevada market has grown from a 100,00K market to more than 13 million yearly.Management is still in transition. It's not the same with the new management.  A lot of the original people are jumping ship because the culture is changing.Downsized with 150+ reps and managers on a phone call.  Had been there 7 months.  They made us buy cars one month before terminating  all of us.  Some of the reps had just gotten out of training the week before.hard to review, the company is changing very fast.  I am not sure what a  typical day there is because each lab is different, I think you need to check back in a couple of years to see if it's still here or if maybe it merged with another company.Being a part of the data management group at Mallinckrodt for 13 years was very rewarding.  I had wonderful co-workers within clinical data management as well as other functions in clinical affairs.As a production superintendent I am responsible for overseeing the manufacturing of three main production lines.  Operations require a collaborative and strong work ethic with my staff as well as with internal support groups.  The team is heavily production orientated with a strong understanding of safety and quality.   Along with being production orientated, I lead the team in championing cost savings and process efficiency drivers.I typically have a project to work on.  I develop experiments to conduct and transfer the final process to manufacturing to validate.  I then follow the production data to compare results from the changes made.the pay,benefits, and vacation time is really good. Most of the people where great to work with.

495,2909.0,Advanced Analytics – Sr. Statistician,Merkle Inc,3.4,16.0,"Merkle is a place where you can learn a lot in a short time period, so it is a great place for new graduates to build up experience.  However, it is very challenging to find work life balance here.Took this role on when no one else would.  Good company, good co workers but manager was an ego maniac.  Different rules for different folks.  Hiring was at a high while there, mostly young people making good money however long hours.The role wore a lot of hats!  Very fast paced, sometimes not always appreciated the extra mile that was given.  Great location!!  Near Columbus Circle, pay was decent.What makes this job enjoyable is the compassion and fun natured people who worked there. Even though we have set work to do, with information technology, each day presents new challenges. The people I work with at this job were awesome and my direct management was also awesome. What this company is missing is a connection between the people doing the work and the upper management chain. They seem to make decisions without thinking about the ramifications. The company is also offshoring to China, so IT people watch out.Good working environment, close to home, friendly coworkers.  Got along with management extremely well.  Nearly all operational work transferred to offshore.Merkle Inc. is a mail processing plant that deals with monies from around the country. Most deal with donations that have to be counted, re-counted, then sent to the bank for confirmation. As a Check 21 clerk, I was able to work with some of the hardest clients that Merkle Inc. had to offer. The co-workers were friendly enough, however, there was a lot of drama that went on, and reminded me a lot of high school. Management was horrible, they never told you anything positive. If you messed up, you got told about it. The hardest part of the job was making sure the monies went to the bank at a certain time every day. Honestly, the best thing: they're closed on weekends, which gave me time to spend with family and friends.This is a fast pace company with no training; upper management does not have a clue on what is going on day to day. There is no work life balance in the company. The job expectations are unrealistic.Hectic and busy day working with executives and candidates to schedule phone or onsite interviewsManagement is amazingMerkle is a fine place to work with many good attributes such as hosting team building events, etc. One of its downfalls is its work-life balance. This is because it can be overly demanding at times.Merkle is not a great place to work.  The company is very focused on the bottom line at the expense of their employees.  They do not invest in developing their employees at all.  They understaff every account and expect employees to wear 3 to 4 hats and work more than 50 hours a week.  It is definitely not a family friendly environment.Get into work and start working. I am on  the computer either researching client's names or address for other people in other departments through email or phone.  Print out certain letters or reports which are needed for that day.  Help out other people on your team with their work when you run out. The hardest part of the job is when you have to get certain reports or letters and either the computer is not being cooperative or the printer stops working in the middle of the print job.•	Managed new client on-boardings through Merkle’s eight step process•	Planned and ran meetings dealing with new client on-boardings, existing clients, or solving IT problems •	Developed spreadsheets of company and client data, for easy department analysis•	Assisted in the development of Virtual Machines for clientsThis company has smartest people I've ever worked with - not to mention great culture and blue chip clients - great opp to grow and develop next generation marketing skillsPeople in Merkle are nice to each other. Willing to help and committed to work. Need improvement on work life balance though.They terminate people right to left for unknown policies that were not mentioned in the training. Literally my second week at Merkle my manager was fired. The training was immediately getting pushed into the job field, I am guessing it was meant to be a hands on experience. The only issue with that is errors can also get you terminated which was ridiculous. I learned that factor through training later in my employment for Quality Control analysis. Some employees love the place some had a very hard time with working at Merkle. This review is specifically for the Merkle in Hagerstown Maryland. If you could not stay the mandatory 10 hours you were getting marked up. Some people there had emergencies and children and still were marked up for leaving. They had a system called "" seven occurrences""  you only can get seven mark-ups and you were terminated. the bad thing is they do not tell you when they were giving you occurrences and if they did it was normally when you had two left. The system would have worked out well if occurrences were for reasons that were insubordinate toward the policy. However it was not, you came in a minute late , half a occurrence, came in a minute late from lunch which was only 30 minutes you were eligible to receive a full occurrence. Had to leave early no matter how severe the complications were you would receive an occurrence. You get too many errors when typing in data you got an occurrence, you were not allowed to get errors and if you did it literally could only be one or two mistakes. In that case I did not understand the job of the Quality Control  more... if errors could not be corrected. Merkle literally did not have any empathy for their employees whatsoever. I watched a man who worked for Merkle over 12 years get terminated. I worked there almost a year and was training for a higher position and they still terminated me over occurrences. In my opinion and this is not because I was terminated this place was terrible! and at worst unjust. I pray that the standards and policy has changed for the sake of the employees.  lessProductive company with great employeesA lot of learning possibilitiesHelpful coworkersSome communication issues between departmentsStartup company feel, with ping pong tables, in office gym, dogs at work, no rules vacation policy.

I met several people in my community and have remained friends with a few of them. I took pride in providing an important service to my city, state and country. The pay was very good and the hours were flexible.Great place to work, very independent job, management can be a little out of touch with how things are supposed to be done, and what the different laws regarding prosecution actually are.As Assistant Manager for Administration it was important that I communicated with my co-manager to assure all operations were completed in a timely manner. Working for the U.S. Census allowed me to interact with a diverse group of people and understand how our difference would also allow us to work well together. The job was not hard, but you must be precise in the actions taken to complete projects in a timely manner.

Must have great time management, writing and organizational skills.the work here is amazing. most of the work is individual and its at your own pace. most workers here are middle age professionals. hardest part of the job is staying focus.I worked with fisheries ( NMFS) Doing on task for other employees, copies a lot, Data entry, etc. A lot of things to do by myself till I am retired 2016.I never went to the actuall DOC while workign for NOAA, it was downtown and I worked inthe suburbs of Maryland. Although I did speak to a lot of the folks daily regarding acquisitions.The U.S.P.T.O is probably the best place I've had the pleasure of working for. The diversity of people and the career opportunities are great as well.It vary according on the need, I did anything from filing, answering the phones, entering data, verifying cost of commercial, verifying personal information on our employees. It was a busy environmentwith people from all nationalities. It was a rewarding experience.To process the paper work of the Executive of the branch. While setting up meeting rooms and travel arrangements for upper management to travel around the city.Great company to work with as a  Administrative Assistant .I learn a lot about Veterans. I gain a lot of experience in travel and using there Concur travel system.I have learned a great deal about the demographics of the Houston area while on this job.I would gladly participate in future campaigns should the opportunity present itself.This was my first real exposure to the real world during my undergraduate years and I am so thankful that I was able to experience it.The job was really interesting, but I didn't seem the mesh with local office culture. I would consider going back if the cost of living in DC wasn't so high.Opportunity for promotion and training.  Great health care packages. Nice 401k. Job rotation to learn something knew outside of your branch.

499,2913.0,CHEMIST (AIR/RESPONSE),Alion Science and Technology,3.6,103.0,"Day-to-day tasks are to just do what the government client wants. There is no room for suggestions or creative ideas whether for process, product, or office moral. There is no room for even anonymous suggestions and/or a human resources person to talk to on site.The company itself is average. The office culture is mundane at best.I was a telework employee, but everything at Alion made me feel part of the team.  All support staff were easy to get in touch with and any issues, when they did arise, were addressed quickly.Alion had a great health insurance plan for their employees. Unfortunately, over the 3 yrs. I worked their, out of pocket cost got higher and the match for putting away for retire went away, due to poor management in the corporate headquarters.Employees treated like cattle.  All profits go into the pockets of the highly compensated 10%.  Questionable use of govt funding for company overhead expenses.The company is now owned by a financial firm solely focused on revenue and low bids to win contracts.  Often salaries and benefits of current employees are reduced in order to stay employed on a new contract award.Overall, I would say that this job taught me how to stay on task, even when I did not enjoy the work every day.A typical work day changed on a daily basis. It was the same type of work, but the parts that we worked on changed every couple of days. We assisted in building a radio system to place on the back of military vehicles. There were around 200 pieces that fit on each pallet so we were tasked with putting them together. The job tested my motivation but I was able to push through. My co-workers were good people that were pretty easy to work with. We did not develop any outside of work relationship. The hardest part of the job was doing the same thing about 200 times per day but I learned to persevere. The most enjoyable part of the day was that the day-to-day duties changed.A great working environment full of intelligent professionals. But company leadership has made many bad choices over years, and this has led to hard times in the current industry environment. Two bad quarters and many lost recompetes have led to several hundred employees leaving the company, many involuntarily. Key management has been stripped out so critical thought leadership needed to grow the company is non-existant. Wait a couple of years before considering a job at Alion. They need to turn their ship around first.I have been employed at this company for 11 years there is great opportunity for advancement I have been promoted 3 times in those 11 years, I started off as a temp for 1 year then hired permanently for the past 10 years nothing but growth there are some management who gave me the ability to learn new things I love everything about my position and manager. The most enjoyable thing about working at Alion is the ability to advance and free educational classes.Always a different challenge everyday. Work with amazing people. Personally rewarding due to the fact that we were able to help soldiers regarding fuel, and safety. Cutting edge of technology.Management sometimes makes it feel more like a staffing agency.  High turnover has been constant, management is more concerned with filling a billet for a low rate than anything else.Provided onsite SETA support to Air Force Acquisition.  So, there was limited direct interaction with the company.  Role involved navigating three ISR programs through the Programming, Planning, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) cycle for obtaining funding for these programs.Management does not value or reward employees with a strong work ethic. The most enjoyable part of the job was lunch break and going home for the day.  Management also stressed ""teamwork"", but would allow certain employees to get paid for doing nothing all day.It pays the Bills- Other than that, I would avoid Alion at all costs.  Zero benefits and an imaginary advancement plan.  Not sure if this is twenty words or not.Collaborative work environment with both internal teams and Government customer. Excelling place to gain leadership skills and expertise in your domain.The best part of the job was my contract work for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The work was interesting and provided for the acquisition of new techniques in my profession.It's a good place to get your foot in the door. My coworkers are kind, personable people who gp the extra mile to mentor juniors like myself. The Navy programs that I work on serve as challenging, interesting work.Everyone was focused on customer satisfaction, so there was good teamwork to do the job well.  Upper level management ran the ship aground.A typical day at work was very busy doing multiple tasks throughout the day.   I was in charge of running the facility at every level which I started doing back in 2013 and learned quite a bit on how everything is run.  Management was very supportive and the co-workers were very pleasant and easy to work with.The most enjoyable part of the job is working with highly skilled people in their respective fields.  Co-workers are top notch and create a very enjoyable work environment.Although an ""Alion employee,"" this is in name only for pay, benefits, and tax purposes only.  Am really an employee of the contract.  When the contract ends, employment with Alion ends.  No opportunity for advancement.  Have never discussed future growth opportunities in Alion with any Alion leadership.  Lost over $40,000 when Alion stock tanked and Alion was bought at $1.25 per share.  Think Enron.  Pay frozen for past 2+ years.  Cut out of government award fee bonus.  Would not recommend Alion as a place for employment unless it's the only option until find something better.The company has complex business models and is quite challenging in many aspects. The most enjoyable part of the job are the people, everyone seems very nice.","1,001 to 5,000",New-York,Edison EPA Reg 2,NJ,2016-10-06T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/c60f5529-0933-4446-bba0-05624efb1f30?mescoid=1900259001001&jobPosition=34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

GC-MS,  LC-MS,  HPLC,  GC,  wet chemistry  FT-IRThe company makes biocides and fungicides for the personal care industry.  I learned a lot about surfactants.Troy overall is a very challenging place to work. There is no work life balance at all. Your career will go no where here. There is no advancement at all at this privately held company.I have been a recruiter here for 8 months and I am treated with respect and given the flexibility I need.Sadly Troy has no consideration nor appreciation of it's employees. If one can put up with daily humilliations and back talk from an under qualified manager and/or lazy co-workers, while few work hard to keep dept running some just keep browsing their texts or internet. If one does not care being scream to in front of others and be threated lower than trash then this is the place for you. The many hard working employees still within receive not appreciation nor even a pat on the back for work well done. There is not room for growth or to go up the ladder (unless?) as one is told when interview, benefits are increase every year, health insurance is completely un-affordable. Help is non-existing so there is not point in bringing up your complains or concerns on the contrary they will pick a shovel to make it 7 feet under instead of 6.I saw how an employee of more than a decade was put down on daily basis by new management, written down,made fun of and literally the whole company knew about it, this employee was exemplary, hard working and dedicated, knew the company in and out literally, gave Troy 1000% if this person could, yet at the end sadly was shown the door.I did not work there long, only for the summer as a clerk. The whole day consisted of filing papers and writing up deposit slips.The employees and my co-workers were great people. They will feel sorry for you after you have been hired and find out how bad it really is. It is the management that needs to be replaced. Not all management is bad, but my director was counterproductive, conduct unbecoming of a manager. My director and his sidekick manager did not want to work with you, was always against you...Always second guessing me..the lying, sneaking, I was always getting written up for stupid reasons...The most enjoyable part was leaving...What I learned from working there was that my other managers and directors were not as bad as I thought. In retrospect, I actually learned from my past managers and directors especially from their constructive criticism...Stay far away as possible!!!

Co-workers treat you like famly, along with management.Open and inclusive company culture.Benefits and compensation for jobs are better than average for the local area.20 PTO days to start plus company holidays.Work/life balance is very good depending on department and immediate manager.Opportunities to learn via inter-company site as well as tuition reimbursement is available.Even though Mondelez is a better than average company to work for they are constantly changing by shifting jobs from one place to another. Cost cutting measures have resulted in jobs being shifted off shore and lots of layoffs or strict job cuts here in the US.Job roles and department responsibilities have changed as well. So if you get hired, don't plan on staying in one spot for too long.I've worked for this Co. for over 36 long years and I've seen many changes which I was able to adapt. The Co.has enjoyed many year of profitable success products that sold to the consumer good products. But then the formula changed and the consumers became aware of it. Management has changed there was a lack of communication between the labor force and management.  What was once a family affair it became just business. Overall the Co has endured so many obstacles and it's in business and making huge profits.Do a quick store review to check current display activity, sell in opportunities are competitive information.  Meet with decision makers to see if they have anything to cover are anything that i should be aware of.Discuss and sell against objectives,Merchandise delivery and write a shelf /display order.I learned how to build relations, listen and sell to the customers needs/and how to be a valued sales representative.Management was knowledgeable, informative ,and understanding.Co-workers were them players,Positive, and fun to be around.Hardest part of the job building  huge displays and merchandising large orders.The most enjoyable part of the job is selling and making your objective.Overall, Mondelez is a fair place to work.   The Sales and Marketing Organization is World Class.There is huge Financial pressures to deliver Quarterly Earnings Results which is consistent with a Publicly Traded CPG Company.  Senior Management is obsessed with cost cutting facilitated by broad workforce reductions.  Invariably, these Organizational Reductions come with promises of working simpler and more streamlined.  The Company is great at delivering cost reductions but has a very poor track record in alleviating what are at times unbearable workloads.  They have consistently reduced employee benefits cutting Pension, Health Benefits, Travel Expenses, downgraded salaries and have outsourced many positions overseas.  In the HQ Location in East Hanover, NJ, Sales, Marketing and Operations Management is top notch.  The Finance Leadership Team  are not very good at motivating their employees and collaborating with cross functional business partners. Finally, due to ongoing headcount reductions, there is very limited career opportunities for motivated professionals particularly in Finance, Marketing and Sales.A typical day as a Sales Rep for Mondelez International starts at around 7am. The rep goes from store to store to stock the shelves with Nabisco products and ensure the product is executed properly, then the rep writes an order for the next delivery and communicates any changes in the ad with store management. Sales Reps for Mondelez do not usually get to work with other employees, they are out on their own in the field on a daily basis. All company communication is made through emails and phone conferences.As with any large corporation there isn't any room for advancement if you do not have a 4 year college degree AND agree to re-locating.  This company is under going many changes especially within the DSD business.  Making many lay-offs and management changes.As long as you do your work ,they do not bother you. They respect your views and your work. My co-workers were fine. Management was great, Some of the work was back breaking but for the most part it was fine. The most enjoyable part of my work was knowing my job responsibilities and doing it well.A typical day at work is putting out fires caused by a culture afraid of change. I learned that most people want to just go with the flow. Management wasn't consistent in enforcement of change and discipline. Most of my co-workers wanted to do a good job, but didn't feel they had proper support. The hardest part of the job was getting the support need to make change. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning the process.Some of the best brands on the market that almost sell themselves. Still a lot of good people even though many good leaders and employees have left the organization through all the mergers, acquisitions, restructures and downsizes during recent years.  Top leaders are very focused on international growth and are implementing a lot of cost cutting measures in the US to get the business model more in-line with other countries.  The DSD sales force will continue to be be challenged as resources are increasingly leaned and it becomes more difficult to make the customers needs a top priority.  Company is a huge promoter of diversity.Great brands, good people, safe and clean work environment, great benefits, very strong senior management team, co workers distributed across the globe, work varies, based upon assignment.  Impressive commitment from the employees and a very innovative company with product lines, e-commerce and otherTerrible management,long hours,equals about 7 dollars an hours,customers only citizens and yell. no real schedule to plan things w/ family.The company really only cares about sales,do yourself a favor and look else where.Not your typical micro managed company if your self motivated, like fast paced work, and being around people.    My management is great to work with and for.  Nice being able to work and use your organizational skills.Mondelez International is a place of employment where an individual can provide a life for their family because of the great pay and benefit package. It is the type of employer that a person can retire from. The environment is helpful and management seems to be willing to listen to hourly input.Stable company, work independently, good benefits, dental,medicalvision and time off, short and long term disabilities, paid holidays. Minimum supervision, good management.MDLZ has a great corporate reputation and is an extremely ethical and responsible company. Like others in its industry, it's been under constant pressure to cut costs and streamline operations, and the ongoing restructuring over the past several years has taken a toll on people--but company has been delivering better performance in the past few years as a result, and it's clear there's some culture change happening.I enjoy my job and working for Mondelez International, but I need to have a more secure full time job with benefits.  Working independently and with stores and their managers is a rewarding experience.  The company is well established and growing and I wish I could receive full time employment only it is not being offered at this time.A typical day at work is going into big box retailers and grocery stores, doing deliveries, re-stocking, displays, etc.  Since Mondelez took over after they split, has not been that favorable.  Part time employees are treated like they do not matter, the hours are often cut without warning. We do not get bonuses like the full time merchandisers too.  You can be the best part time merchandiser with the best reviews from the company and stores and not move up the ladder.  It is a sad reality.  The raises are minimal at best. And the corporate culture needs to be overhauled.  There really is no hard part about this job, it is a no brainer. But one thing I would change is letting part time merchandisers know about products coming out.  Give us the same respect that the full time merchandisers get. We work just as hard, we deserve that too.The work  assignment are given, such as what line to work , what  job you are to perform at that line.  And how long to work there before going to another position on that line. I've learn to operate industrial machine / equipment. Stock machine with supplies, inspect product for defects  and verify code dates and labels are correct.Management did their job controlling the company, and making decision that they felt  was best for the company.The workers was great and we worked together as a team, helping out were needed and assisting. The most difficult part was remembering the loading ordering for each different cookies after learning that the and increase your speed for feeding the job became less complicated.The enjoyable  part of the job was working manually, and at your own speed or when working on the, line  every hour you switch to another job on that line  .This is a great company to work and grow with. They really care about their employee's. You can advance your position with the company based on skills not seniority. Their sales department train program is very detailed.As with any large corporation, there are many positives and negatives that go with a job in their Sales force.Positives include great benefits, opportunity to grow and advance within the company and bonuses and financial awards that compete with any company in its specialization area.One negative is that a work day is never done in Sales, depending on the region you work in the workload can be very heavy at times. Since I was in a densely populated area, I would spend all my time in the field dealing with shelf conditions and selling to managers. This would leave me having to do most of my extensive computer work at home after work which was not fully paid for. While these sacrifices are normal with any job, they were a little bit excessive.","10,000+",New-York,East Hanover,NJ,2016-05-11T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/61f6f53d-9e1a-421f-82a5-8044211c2f11?mescoid=1900245001001&jobPosition=14,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

551,2965.0,Fixed Income Quant Developer,KCG,3.8,14.0,"KCG was an overall great company there were a few minor problems that i had when it came to communications due to the overall manager of the job sites i was tasked to work with but besides that i was really enjoying the environment of the job and my Co workersKCG services really takes pride in their employees.  By doing this their employees are more willing to go the extra mile in whatever their  position may be.  This job keeps you on your toes because you are dealing with multiple people to ensure that the job is completed appropriately.It was a good place to work prior to Knights trading error and takeover by Getco. 2 different cultures needed to be merged and a sell off of all Knights subsidiaries has been the roughest ride ever. The biggest secret is what the future holds for its employees.It is very enjoyable to work with like-minded professionals.

553,2967.0,Quantitative Developer,Royal Bank of Canada,4.1,1300.0,"Busy office but manageable. Management and co-workers were great to work with. Very enjoyable job!It was such a great experience to work for RBC Wealth Management. I learned to work in fast pace environment and to managed competitive priorities. I was helping a team of two financial advisors with all the administrative tasks, calendars, communication and financial transactions. The managers and supervisors were great allies to help me grows within the company. The team I worked with were mainly reactive rather than proactive and it made it very hard to learn a structure and organization. However, I always felt appreciated by them. I was able to remain myself and still belong to the team.Enjoyed working with my clients and prospects.Reasonable commission schedule.Nice office and location.Office closed due to lack of recruiting on part off management.Royal Bank of Canada offered a professional and comfortable work atmosphere. Salary and compensation levels were competitive. Personal were very Team orientated.Very comparable in terms of compensation and work-life balance with the bulge bracket banks, but still lacks top exit opps. Culture and management varies widely between different groups. Great place to learn a lot.RBC was a great company to work for that allow for growth and personal development.  I worked my way up from middle office to front officeRoyal Bank of Canada is a very sound financial institution. I worked for the Bank for 10 years in the Futures division located in Chicago. They are very responsible to there employees and create a comfortable work environment.It's fun and rewarding to work for RBC. The culture is open and inclusive.  Senior management communicates and keep employees informed about the direction and strategies of the firm.RBC is a good company to work for.  The benefits are good, the pay is competitive.  You do want to make sure that if you pick a career path (operations over business line) that you stick with it however.  Once you get too high up in one or the other it is hard to switch over.I worked within the trade support team for just over 7 months on a contract role. The role support the equity sales traders. I was located in London..I have worked here for 14 years and have found that the culture has increasingly become very toxic. That being said the benefits are good and there is a decent amount of job security.RBC works hard to provide affordable competitive benefits.  However, they determine employee salary by analyzing industry averages and meeting, not exceeding, the average.RBC is a terrific company to work for and love that there are options for growth if you are willing to make changes.  Just like any company there are differences in opinion and management but overall this company is good to work for long term.Excellent leadership.Learned about banking.Excellent training.One of the best companies that  I have worked for.They give you all the tools to be sucessfulMy day begins with updating reports, checking for errors and preparing for closing calls. The rest of my day is all about making sure all deadlines are met. Towards the end of the day we make sure  that all account are balanced and if we have to  assist each other to  get issue that demand urgent solutions.Lots of hours for little outcome. Depending on the group you could work on some M&A deals but mostly you will be pitching a lotThis company is a small but nice place to work at, They show appreciation. The contribute to your success. You really work as a team to in a good way.Support 40+ executives with a variety of requests including travel, creating presentations/org charts, answering phones, faxing/copying,Enjoyed coming to work.  I like to keep busy and help other employees if need be.  I enjoy talking to client on the phone and developing a personal relationship with them.Great intern projects and responsibilities. Company and people really care about your professional growth. Good work/life balance is actually something that is stressed on employees, depending which department you are in but overall it's the company's culture. Really great people to work with especially within the Project Delivery Office (PDO). I would love to come back and work here full time.like working here because the days seem to go by fast. This was a very high stressful Job because it was about the stock market and other people money.","10,000+",New-York,Jersey City,NJ,2016-07-26T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/e0155459-48e2-4a3c-8868-c7ce41970fc2?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=18,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

556,2970.0,Microbiologist,Unilever,4.2,2200.0,"I love working for Unilever . I was enjoyed making ice cream and work with good co-workers work as team and make job much easy. I was very sad when we got laid off from job and the plant shut-down.The culture is great and the company does fun things for their employees. The management and HR are horrible though. You are never working hard enough or doing enough for anyone there.  They like 22yo's and like to groom them so managers are 26 and have zero management or life experience. They are all about the metrics not having a happy work/life balance.Unilever is a great place to work if you like being part of a global corporation. The company has great benefits for salaried employees, and encourages personal development.fun fun fun place to work.  Lots of challenges, if I had a question, someone was always there to assist.  Great place to work.I wished I had stayed living in NJ, I would have loved to retire from this company.Scope of roles have great depth and breath. Colleagues & Work Environment are positive natureGood Products and Innovation pipelineGreat Diverse CultureToo much to accommodate within a small amount of time, pushing one to either work consistently during off-work hours or fall behind.Lack of appreciation for work done stemming from a fundamental lack of understanding of effort involved in accomplishing tasks.Cleaning offices the hardest part of the job climbing three flights of stairs 8 to 10 times a day. the most rewarding part of the job was meeting new people.I liked working for the time I'm workingGood Person's And I learned a lot for My supervisorsThe Good Crew and Support the staffI've worked at Unilever JC for 17 years.  It was a good place to work up until the last 4 years.  New management & HR sucked the happiness from lower managemt & production.  Poor raises like 1%, or none at all.  Health insurance is at an all time high, making it difficult to takie family members to Dr.  Point system : 8 in one year, getting point for being one minute late.  Even if your in a car accident.  Better be on time if the roads are ice covered, no lea way at all.  4 years ago, they would work with you on issues such as these.  Running lines under staffed is almost an everyday thing.  Making it a risk to work safely.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this job to my worst enemy.My name is peter pan and this site requires a test. So I will type a long winded sentence talking about how things could always be better. I was happy getting a job with unilever then depressed by how silly things can get.I have no complaints working with Unilever It has been a pleasure to work for this staffing company. Manpower has open plenty of doors for me making sure I get sufficient pay, a good working experience and have made me feel valuable as a worker.I really dont disapprove of Unilever, but I dont really recommend it. The turnover rate is outstanding. The people are okay, but the wear and tear this job puts on your body is unbearable. Great experience though.It was a union job so all the eeoc laws were enforced. Nothing is perfect, but this was not far from it.Safety meetings were regular. Seniority was used to before skills but this meant an opportunity for advancement was offered but not given. If the person failed that tests, the next level of seniority was then given a chance.The human resources department is horrible.  They never have an answer to a question.  The job itself didn't seem too difficult but the employees made it so.  They weren't welcoming of direct hires and would love to always sit back and watch you fail.  I left due to medical reasons and was let go.  In some way I've never been so happy to be fired from a job!I enjoyed working at Unilever.  Beautiful campus and a diverse population of employees.   I was lucky to have a manager that encouraged and supported me in my work.Work day goes by very fast with keeping equipment running and performing maintenance on equipment. Very positive work environment and extremely clean facility.Challenging opportunities in the field of foodservice and retail production. Always changing to keep pace with markets.  Wide spectrum packaging and formulation processes.Even though i work 3rd shift, everyone still comes in with a positive ready to work attitude. Mostly every Unilever employee is willing to help in their own way.Unilever was my first job. I began in Q.C. since there were no openings in R&D. However, the learning form my Q.C. experience helped me more effectively commercialize products that I developed as member of R&D group. I had the opportunity to work on consumer products related to both skin and hair. For my advancement, I was given the opportunity to take a substantial number of professional courses, which helped me advance my career. This additional knowledge also benefitted the company, because I was able to develop more advanced and innovative products, which met/ exceeded consumer needs and expectations.I would recommend for anyone who wants to be part of a large global organization.  To advance beyond manager level the competition is strong and you really need to be flexible on location.  Need to be ready to stay 3-5 yrs and move on.  Proud to work for a company which invests in our society.I was hired here just 6 months ago being told that the work schedule was a 12 hour day with 3 days on & 4 off one week & then 4 days on & 3 off the next. Occasional overtime would be posted to cover vacations & such as needed. This was an outright lie. Yes we do work 12 hours, may be forced to a 16 hour shift with almost no notice & you get 1 day off on a long week & 2 non consecutive days off on the short week. I work anywhere between 60 & 80 hours each week. This has taken a severe toll on my family life & health. The work itself isn't too bad but the hours & no set time off make it impossible to do anything but go to work.","10,000+",New-York,Englewood Cliffs,NJ,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/d4783a52-3932-4b98-9928-c2975fea9630?mescoid=1900242001001&jobPosition=21,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

My boss and co-workers are very nice, helpful, and understanding. However, it is not my career path, it is simply a job i keep during the semester to keep myself motivated.It is a great place to study and work. It gave me a great learning experience which was very different from my past experience.It made me understand the working culture in United states.Great place to get an education and learn the knowledge required in the current competitive job market. Great career servicesStevens Institute of Technology is an honored college, its rigorous scholarship shaped my simple, stable and innovative traits. Work as research assistant in Stevens again enhanced these traits.An easy job for a college student. Everyone around the store is nice and friendly and the whole environment is very friendly. It is a Federal Work Study job so the compensation is just minimum wage, but the job is very nice and an easy way to make some money.Stevens is the best place to be as a graduate student. Location is the best and even opportunities. Since it is very lose to New York it provides lots of full time and internship opportunities fro graduate students.I had to work with many employers and each one added a new experience to the work culture. I worked as data analyst for a few projects where I had to produce results based on comparison. My key role was graduate assistant and I had a proper balance of time for my work and studies.Grear Place to work at. I work remotely as a teaching assistant. Responsibilities are oaky. Relaxed work environment, few deadlines and good work if you are a studentThis is fun place by the banks of river hudson!!! Enjoyable work place :)I work here as the Graduate Student Assistant. This has been a great experience working here.It's an open minded university and willing to collaborate with other research facilities. Good work and life balance.this job really depends on which advisor you have. if that is a good person, it is good enough. if not, you can taste the bitter of life.I really like working at Stevens.  We have a competitive athletic department and everybody is helpful. The employees have a selfless attitude that trickles down from our superiors.I appreciated the atmosphere that the company had and was able to learn a lot about chemical process reactor engineering.While actively working on process modeling since last two months, I have built various financial workflow models and Research Tasks models with information I gained from Mr.Christopher Klesges. My objective in the project is to provide you suggestions that aims to reduce resource consumption and increase cost efficiency for which I require certain information like how much time does each task performer takes and how frequent the task is performed. I have scrutinized two simple step which can help me gain progress in the process. 1) By building a questionnaire for each task performer with respect to the work culture.2) And by object tracking in which I will track all tasks in the workflow process. In addition to this I'm involved in data analysis project with Mr.Christopher working on hospital outcomes in the state of Tennessee using data analysis tools like R, Mplus and STATE 14.Very good place to research. There are enough equipment and good people to work with.
