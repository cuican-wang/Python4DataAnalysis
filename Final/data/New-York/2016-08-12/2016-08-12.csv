Their facility is run smoothly and professionally.Their many aspects of business including a in-house cadaver bio-skills lab is just one aspect that makes them so unique and a valued asset within the medical industry.It was fantastic working different events for fusion staffing. I enjoyed it a lot and met a lot of really great people! Although the you must be on your feet for many hours, the high pay/hour was very well worth it in my opinion. I loved how you got to choose the events you apply for so that it doesn't mess with your schedule at all.Fusion is awesome. They always have jobs available for you to choose from. I really love working for this company. Very nice and polite staff that are very helpful in assisting you.Low stress atmosphere to work at. Due to the oil and gas slump also a non-productive atmosphere as well. Other than that not a bad place to work, well established and personnel are knowledgeable. Technology is up to date.At Fusion, weâ€™re in the business of connecting customers and online retailers to highly optimized ancillary products in real-time. While many would consider us a marketing technology company, we like to think of ourselves as a people company.Family friendly environment. Heavy focus on work life balance and CSR.Fusion was great when I first started with them. But they changed their managers and staff; after that no one called or communicated with me. As a Consultant that made it difficult.I serve as a key resource to ensure all aspects of the maintenance of numerous scalable and highly available eCommerce system environments are available 24x7x365. On a day to day basis I liaise with vendors, internal clients and partners to resolve problems in a timely mannerWorking here has let me gain high experience in customer service and helping others to chose what is fit for them. Great work environment and always very professional. Always busy and always a good vibe with this company.I loved working their but they dont secure you with a stable job. They are very easy to work for and make it fun to be their. They need yo train people a little more on what they have to do.Fusion was an excellent organization to work for. I gained more confidence with my business skills with meeting with large companies and communicating via email to procure Auction donations. I learned great time management skills with working independently or in a group format along with my resourceful and helpful co-workers.Not being able to help customer with getting health insurance.Co workers were fun and foced employees. Learned to be an active learner .Fusion in Monroe is a busy work place. As  a bus boy it took a lot to prepare tables each time someone would leave as for there was always another group of people waiting to be seated. Other than that it has great management and great cooks.Love trying new things like the taco dinner we had back in November 2013Wasnt a very good enviormenti was the only worker besides the managerOn a typical day at work I answer inbound calls, make outbound calls and value each customer and provide satisfying solutions to their request or issues. Ive learned the importance of customer service from working here. Management and co-workers here are fine.Was a normal day after you left the shop, when you got their it was a day of the unknown.I learned things about wiring houses that the inspectors wanted too see.The person in charge after someone left was not the person for the job as that person knew nothing about wiring or building a house or what it took to do the project at hand.The hardest thing was dealing with the manager that was put in the position.The best part was when we got to leave the shop and the coworkers were fun to work with and we didn't have to deal with management.Great Company, nice people, great bosses and employees. Always something to do. You are able to use your creativity.Very fast paced environment with great full time hours. I've learned very much about anti-aging skincare products and the benefits. Co-workers are a joy to work with. Management is very reasonable. The hardest part of the job is not satisfying every customer. The most enjoyable part of the job is providing exceptional customer service and great skincare advice to amazing customers.Good ambiance .Always different media It's always fun to meet new peopleI was a flight attendant on reserveVaried each day when on Reserve",,New-York,New York,NY,2016-08-12T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/5b5498e9-5d2c-475d-ac31-44dd7b8776c5?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=35,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
