I did notice that communication from the top down, as well as from team to team seems to get lost.The last company I worked at had a very old school state of mind. Slacks, cubicles, closed door policy, no happy hour, zero team bonding, etc. It is such a relief to be at Unity where I have the opportunities to grow, try new things and really expand my horizons. I've been here for almost 3 months and the responsibilities I have been given are amazing. I'm learning things here I would have had to beg for the opportunity to try at my last job.Excited to be apart of this journey and see where we as a company arrive!This place is going downhill culture wise. There seem to be layoffs every 3 months, they are slowly removing all of the perks, and the culture is becoming more stringent and less fun.

252,253.0,Survey Researcher,UCSF,4.2,75.0,"Good research resource and environment for health science. But research facilities are not organized and centered. It seems that excellent research product come from individual scientist capability and fund.Typical day at work depends from the lab you are in. Learned a lot of life experience, got clear with research in California in general. Management, again, depends from the lab. Hardest part of the job is to publish, again depends from your PI plans. Enjoyable part must be free scheduling of your day.Great place to work if you are looking to gain some professional experience.Management needs to improve considerably in the areas of communication, education, and use of new technologies.Independent yet collaborative workplace; great work-life balance; great benefits; Learned various skills and enhanced my abilities through challenging and exciting day to day duties.UCSF has the best benefits in Northern California, Union, and job security. However the management is most often poor, although organized, and no job advancement unless you are in good with the right people- the who you know type of deal.This job was written poorly and was determined to be too much for one person especially considering the title and compensation.I got a good training in UCSF. Thereare lots of seminar from academy and inudctry, give well-known scientific environment . Also, it's a good place to balance work and life.Excellent team work and opportunities for career advancement.  Fiscal year end has been the busiest time of the year but we managed to closed the accounts in a timely manner.I came from Europe to do my postdoc at UCSF. I found it challenging but very interesting at the same time. People, generally, are very open minded. However, as a high profile institution, expectations are high. Throughout my time at UCSF I had great pleasure to work here and to meet people with highest professional skills.I made also good friends and established a connection to other people around the world.UCSF is a great environment to learn and start out a career. Jobs are entry-level however room to grow and expand is almost non-existence if you are not part of the medical team.working with providers regarding note compliance. completing missing information regarding providers notes for billing/trending reports/must meet lag daysNice place to work. Management very inefficient.I was very good at customer service and had a lot of wonderful remarks from patrons to the hospital.I administered the Capital Asset Inventory for the company. I enjoyed working with all the department Asset Custodians. I enjoyed being in full command of the Equipment Audit function. There was nothing difficult about this job as my qualifications perfectly match the accoing maturity required to handle all accounting hurdles.UCSF is a great company to work for. They have all sorts of jobs and employ a ton of people from all backgrounds and cultures.Arrive before Chief, print out all Branch staff daily calendars, schedule meetings and conference rooms, review and/or revise documents for approval, enter status of all documents into database, help Chief stay on track, prioritize meeting requests, coordinate assignments with Division, Director's, and State Secretary's staff, advise Programs clerical support on preparation of certain items, contact IT when needed, assist Branch staff with desktop issues if possible, prepare Purchase Requisitions for supplies and equipment when necessary, process invoices, rotate supplies and inventory, compile next day or weekly meeting agendas and/or presentations. While working in California Department of Public Health (CDPH) I learned the importance getting monies and information out to the public in a timely manner. I worked with a great team of dedicated public servants who were all passionate about their duties to aid society.The hardest part was when budget cuts would come and the Chief would work 24/7 trying to prevent cutting benefits to our staff and the public. The most enjoyable moments were when the Branch Chief would somehow make it all come together and we would meet our assigned objectives from higher ups.A great experienced to be able to handle and managed the grants in our department with different faculty members and researchers.Supportive and fun staff who enjoy team building and working together to offer solutions and assistance. Management is supportive and provides expert guidance.I loved my time at UCSF and am hoping to get another job with them. Working in a learning center with some of the most talented people I have ever met is wonderful.My day at work was always busy.I increased my medical knowledge and skills.Management the first 10 years was perfect, the communication was open and appreciated.  My last few years with UCSF I experienced managers that did not leave their office,had a shut door policy and did not want input or opinions. Decisions were made and not communicated. I hope they work this out and know we all work better together as a team.My typical day at work consists of reviewing open tickets, following up with customers and scheduling my day to utilize my time to provide maximum efficiency in resolving tickets. Through my time at ITFS, I have obtained a vast amount of experience and knowledge in the field of Information technology (these details can be discussed in person). Management has changed 3 times during my employment which made it difficult to excel in my position, but did not affect my ability to perform. The hardest part of the job is coming across issues that require extensive amounts of time and effort to resolve as oppose to known issues that can be fixed on the spot. The ""most"" enjoyable part of the job for me was the opportunity to meet so many  people.Throughout my career, I have met over 3,000 people and have made so many friends.UCSF is really a nice place to work as a postdoc, benefits are good, and scientific collaborations are awesome here.UCSF truly operates in its core values of pride, respect, integrity, diversity and excellence.
