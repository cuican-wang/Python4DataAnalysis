262,263.0,Research Statistician,Roche,4.2,657.0,"My role in this job ranged from documentations expert to data manager to bio-statistician. Entering with a background in applied physics, I had a diverse and strong skill set, and this job required me to preform at all levels nearly all the time, whether I was networking with colleagues overseas to develop a testing procedure that would yield strong statistical power or to give an open presentation on our team's progress and statistical results. As my contract approached its end, my time was spent on data management and documentation.The company provided ample support and cross-department assistance. The atmosphere was largely amicable and the employees were incredibly friendly, which alleviated the stress that came with the workload. I was given the space and guidance to learn R, quickly becoming our office's expert, and developed statistical analysis modalities for verification protocols. I learned quality control procedures and how to produce adequate scientific publication for FDA submission. Learning is my favorite part of any job, and my role at Roche allowed me to absorb the knowledge and experience I need to become a stronger industry scientist.Our company was approaching launch when I joined, so my employment was restricted to a contractor position which did not grant vacation nor holidays. This was an issue for me, having missed out on holidays for the previous 6 years (4 during undergrad, 2 grad school), impacted by the high-intensity requirements of the job as we approached 510K/CE-marking submissions. These are the only qualms I had.If you don't agree with anything, make sure to keep it to yourself.  You'll by walked out the door so quickly that it'll make your head spin. HR...cluelessRoche is a very stable place to work, it provides great health, 401K and maternity benefits and job security. It's an international company with lots of growth opportunities internationally and locally.The work/life balance and benefits are far superior to other employers in the area.  The overall attitude of all leadership is to be learn from you as they teach you and prep you for the next stage in your career.  The most difficult part of working for an employer like Roche is having corporate headquarters in another country.  It can tend to cause some angst in getting through red tape and the fact that things are ran differently in Switzerland vs the US.  In short, a great place to land and settle in for the long haul.The direct reports control your outcome of your performance. The cafeteria is decent and the place is full of people who have worked more than 10 years. It is very difficult to win with the constant harassment by your reports and constantly going to HR to create havoc for the Manager.Roche is full of intelligent people who are always striving to better themselves, their company, and their products. I worked as an intern in the Technical Transfer Team and could not have been happier with my experience. I was encouraged to learn as much as I could during my time their and everyone I met was enthusiastic and helpful.Stable organization with great benefits and compensation. Generous profit sharing with full time employees. Plenty of activities and causes to join through the organization.Good. Nice working environment. Good working culture and good balance of work and personal life. Would recommend working at a great company. Great benefits as well.This was a great company to work for.  Management helped to foster a learning environment where anyone willing could grow.Roche is a great place to work. They have a clear direction as to where they are going and want to be. They are very supportive of your career goals whether with the company or not.Every time I got to work everybody would greet you with a smile. My co-workers were friendly, my supervisor was friendly and my work space was the best.Typical day at work consisted of me locating the shortages/overages of premium payments sent in from bail bonds agents who are writing under Roche by comparing our sales report to theirs, and notifying them of such differences. Also creating state needed documents specific to each state the bail bond agent resides in so they are able to legally start writing bail bonds. I wouldn't recommend working here, as teamwork is not a top priority at Roche Surety. Every man for themselves is basically the atmosphere I have come to learn over the past year. I learned how to better organize myself through all the chaos. The hardest part of the job was communication amongst co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job is the one friendship I developed with someone who has been with the company for about 10 years. At a moments notice, you can be let go without any notice of the termination or a legitimate reason as to why.I was really happy to work for this company, by mornings we started at 7 hrs and continue working until 12 hrs, that was the lunch time for my type of contract person, then 1 hour lunch and back to work from 13 to 16:30 hrs. but Friday, job on Friday end at 13:30 hrs.My co workers were very respectful of our privacy but anyways there were group activities after work.The hard part of the job is that I didn't have a permanent contract with the company, for the annual Christmas party I was not invited, and some other important meetings I was not required.The facilities were awesome, and the working life enjoyable.I mostly engaged as an overnight machine operator with the company. I inspected deficiencies in the glucose measuring strips that they manufacture, produce, and distribute. After that, I graduated to being a machine operator. I was trained to troubleshoot machine stoppages, errors in the coating process, and the quality creation of a well inspected and manufactured product.At roche, my coworkers had positive attitudes. The job kept me busy, but it was not physically strenuous at all. I really enjoyed my time there because although the work is not the most exciting thing, I know I am making something that someone out there truly needs, which brings me joy.There are very few cons about my job at Roche. One of these is that in the management, there is much unfair favoritism. Another thing about management is that they walk around and observe the employees almost constantly, which made me a bit uncomfortable. Over all, though, I loved working at Roche!PROS - Work/life balance. Plenty of events that encouraged camaraderie. Family like environment. Very regulated organization that leads to great professional development.CONS - Contract based for more than 50% of their manpower. No benefits if under temporary contract.Great company to work for. Love what the company does. Am glad to be part of a company that is innovative and truly cares for it's employees. Would recommend this company to anyone.I enjoyed everything about working for Roche. The company is well organized and diverse. It had a very positive impact on my life.Consulting:•	Assisted consultants in giving suggestions about the design of the clinical trials and providing R and STATA code.•	Employed multiple imputation method to solve the missing values associated with clinical data.Data Analysis:•	    Project #1: The first clinical trial research was jointly conducted by Johns Hopkins Hospital and University of Chicago to discover the relationship between the levels of depression of patients and 14 other demographic variables.•	    Project #2:  The second clinical trial research was to investigate whether patients who lose smelling function having higher odds of being delirium in clinics.Currently i am working in Roche Pak Ltd as Senior Service Engineer.I am gaining knowledge day by day and my professional skills are also enhanced as time goes, i am very much satisfied with my professional growth. The only thing which bothers me is the work/life balance. That is not balanced and i couldn't give proper time to my family.The co-workers are what makes this company very unique. They are positive, welcoming and always willing to lend a hand when asked. The company allows growth professionally and management is supportive if communicated. The company has great health benefits and safety is a high priority. The work/life balance is hard to maintain.","10,000+",San-Francisco,South San Francisco,CA,2016-08-22T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/fd67eeeb-e1c4-4a04-9717-46a826f5f912?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=28,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
