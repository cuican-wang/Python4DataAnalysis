89,90.0,Sr. Data Scientist/ Data Analyst,Mindlance,3.5,72.0,"Good company, but no job securityOnboarding team disorganizedHR very professionalPays bi-weekly as apposed to weeklyHardest part of onboarding process was lack of communication between onboarding team.Working with staff was a bit challenging at first due to language differences. As soon as I presented my difficulties to my main point of contact they intervened and helped to complete my onboarding. Overall the expereince has been pleasant and I have thoroughly enjoyed the work I've done as a Multimedia Specialist.Mindlance is a horrible agency to work for!!  I was employed for 2months was in a bad car accident reported it that night to my boss and due to my injuries I wasn't able to work and 7 days later they fired me because I was in a car accident. Now trying to get them to sign a wage loss form for a lawyer is impossible they claim they don't know if I was suppose to work. Won't returns emails, hang up on me.Mindlance found my resume online and contacted me for a temp position.I loved working for the client, but would have wanted a long term commitment. I had no interaction with the management of Mindlance.My co-workers were of that of the client, so I had no Mindlance co-workers.The hardest part was the interview possessor with Mindlance, everything was communicated via e-mail.Friendly,family-like,very productive working environment and I have enjoyed working with them. It is very good management,respectable and helpful working environment.Company assigns employees to contract work with other organizations. Low pay with benefits, based on contracting business. Little contact with company after employment.It depends on the company you work for or assigned to.  For the most part working for Mindlance is great.I have learned new software contracting for Anthem Healthcare.Management has been wonderful and helpful.I have yet to work with other Mindlance employees.The hardest part of the job has been working for a company I cannot locally visit.The most enjoyable part of the job is working for the contractors I am assigned to.Great work environment. Co-workers were friendly, helpful, and collaborative. The most enjoyable part of my job was the research and development.Effective and complaint bridge to the client company.  They are a temporary agency.  That's all that counts.  They are compliant and communicate well.assembled pc boards for 8 hours. learned how to work with small hand tools  .also to use a soldering iron. management  was nice. co-worker nice. nothing hard about the job. i have working and staying busy.Communicating with the staffers in the location at Morristown, NJ i believe. Offered very low pay. Came off as very insincere in my communication with theses staffers. I was not comfortable doing business with themIts was a laid back job I learned so much from Dr.Bowden she is willing to help you be successful at whatever you trying to accomplish she will take the extra mile as longs she see you trying to help yourselfGreat people and company make contracting a little easier. Alwasy quick to get the things I need or answer questions I haveContract worker for them for a year. Terrible; no benefits, no support, nothing. Didn't even make contact as my contract came to an end. Only spoke to them about twice.Mindlance located my resume online and hired me over the phone.  It was one of the most thorough and professional opportunities of my work life.Co-workers and team leaders are easy to work with but company benefits are pretty poor.  HR manager is easy to contact and responsive to concerns.worked with company in Tulsa and home office in Houston did not have a enough time to train.  Had to train one self and work through computer issues on your own.loved the atmosphere and the workers were nice and friendly. the managers in the training class did not monitor the class room activity very well.I enjoyed working on the assignment Mindlance sent me out on. I worked at Cigna Healthspring. There you work all the overtime you want as long it is available.I corrected pharmacy claims. The assignment was easy but tedious, the hardest part of the job was the lack of supervision.A typical day on this assignment was setting up depositions, medical appointments, updating attys calendars with hearings and depositions, opening mail and filing documents into EAMS as appropriate.I learned that I am productive and needed by the attys I assisted and loved working with them.Minimum supervision which was lovely because it allowed me to do my work without distraction.Co-workers were helpful and kindThere were no ""hardest"" parts of the job just tedious tasks which were essential to the job.I enjoyed preparing letters, pleadings and notices and gathering documents for medical appointments.",,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-11-15T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/f70ddd6f-2917-4032-a007-6949cf9de8c8?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=28,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The expectations are high in order to get quality orders to customers.There isn't a typical work day, each day is filled with new challenges and difficulties. Each day ending in satisfaction.I would never recommend this place to anyone to work. They treat their contractors like objects rather than people. They segregated us by colored badges just like the early 1900s. The 'Blue Badges' wouldn't even look at the 'Green Badges'. It was very discriminatory.- Everyone is there to help!- Friendly Coworkers-Very Fast paced and challenging-Transparency throughout the whole companySquare's work environment makes it really exciting to go to work every day. The people are so nice and it's a great place to learn and be more developed day by day.get company with diverse people. great benefits and the customers are awesome. family community. sincere, genuine people. awesome place of employment, i enjoyed my time with them.Three week training on products, hardware, troubleshooting, credit card processing, and company history. Then a few sporadic online training. Daily notifications and alerts of ""all hands on deck"" to say please work as fast as possible and avoid creating internal tickets and emails to focus on phone calls. Very difficult to get answers to questions from managers and other team members.The people are very friendly. Worked on a team with highly capable people. Managers respect your input. Changes and input to software is genuinely considered and evaluated.The company is fun and takes care of their employees. I enjoy my time working there through my recruiting group. Fun place.it really nice place to work it is great management, but hour is less for me at least I am looking for 40 hours a week and if possible ot that part.I value the time that I spent at Square because I I grew a lot in my own personal development. Square fosters a fun environment and carefully balances fun with working hard. It's a company that you can work for and be proud of the product.Great company with lots of talent.
