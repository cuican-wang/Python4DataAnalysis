162,163.0,Lead Data Scientist,Glassdoor,3.9,14.0,"Glassdoor used to be a great company to work for. Unfortunately, they have made some significant changes within the last 12 months that has created a sour culture in sales. No one is getting paid, no one is happy, and most are looking for other jobs.I hope they can turn it around as I truly believe in their mission and extraordinary executive leadership.Welcome to SD. Prepare to have all your basic labor rights violated.  Sexist, racist and a general scumbag the owner is constantly in court.  After starting work there thats when people laughed at me and told me the nick name Revolving Glass Door since the staff is always changing.I always felt like I was making a difference in the world.The leadership is great, the people are great and the culture is great.Just had to move continents or I would have stayed forever!Glassdoor wants to believe it treats its staff like a family, but it is incredibly dysfuntcional. In the beginning, they seem to treat their employees well, but then arbitrarily eliminate their roles or let them go for no good reason. I have seen it happen many times. Also, their strategy changes so often that is there is no true job security or opportunity for advancement. The management team is inexperienced and immature and often make decisions that lack real thought or analysis.Glassdoor's product team lacks innovation. They merely copy the market leaders - like Indeed and TripAdvisor.Good people are being let go, and a lot of other good people are leaving. Glassdoor is not managing its growth well, and the ""family"" is falling apart.*note: wrote a similar review on Glassdoor, but (surprise) they did not post it.Company had a great opportunity to growth, but lacked in upper management.Amazing place to work with lots to do everyday, I learned a lot during my internship. The con's would be the distance from the city, if you don't have a car its hard to get to the office everyday. But besides the the distance it's a great place to work.Worked as a temp for 2 months and was not hired in perm. even though they were hiring, read reviews on companies and accepted, rejected or escalated the reviews. The employees were great and the job was easy.  You could work from home if you were hired in perm. The hardest part was reading a computer screen for 8 hours a day. Loved the way you were treated there, always willing to help if you could not make it in.I love the company and what I do, being able to be helpful and apply knowledge and learning is a good opportunity  for me, people are very nice and helpful, I enjoy working during the week and I miss being with my friends during the weekendsGood place to start your career. The CEO definitely built a strong company with solid values. Also the B2C component is the best out there and the B2C side is growing too. Awesome culture, people and work. I get to learn a lot of new things every day. What more do you need?Best company I've ever worked for and an awesome product that can't be beat!",51 to 200,San-Francisco,Mill Valley,CA,2016-11-10T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/21b0e361-f7db-4fe1-97d8-2524b35b9c3c?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=32,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

It is a strong selling environment and the National meetings definitely get the fires burning.The people you work with are great! Being around such smart, focused, hard working, kind and funny individuals is what will keep some people there long after they are ready to go. The money and benefits are good. The leadership development is great. The culture and ethics of the company are outstanding.Friendly and Helpful staff. They are always there to help and guide you whenever you needed any assistance.You can only advance in this company if you are liked, and being liked has nothing to do with job performance.
