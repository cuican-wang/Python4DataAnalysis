110,111.0,Data Scientist,Wal-Mart,3.6,75800.0,"Great and friendly management. The pharmacy is a great atmosphere to work in and competent support personnel is provided on a daily basis. Competitive salary.I worked putting New Fabric away in the morning as well as carts that were left from the night before.  All day long waiting on customers and helping customers get what they need to help with their problems and accompise  what they want as the end result. I would help put freight away as well. When new modes came down i would help if not set new modes until the last of my working there then they had a mod team that did them at night.  I always took the old patterns in our file cabinet out and put in the new ones that came in.Walmart was attempting to implement a new inventory management system for stocking and back stocking. Unfortunately, the hand-held devices were outdated and malfunctioned often. Additionally, there was not enough space in the back room for proper and safe storage of products.I like working at Wal Mart because they do not laid off. I dislike  Working at Wal Mart because it's open year round and it is closed only Christmas. This is a retail store which involve working all the time. Everyone must work as team in order to complete a job. The hardest part of the job is working Management and customers. Worker are required to please both customers and Management. The most enjoyable part of the job is employer discount and worker can transfer from one state to another.A day at Walmart consisted of breaking down the newly deliverd product and restocking shelves making sure they stayed stocked throughout the day while at the same time helping coustomers.Walmart had a very interactive managment team that was always willing to show how things are done or help you out if things where running behind. My co-workers at Walmart where my life line, we worked together like a well oiled machine to get through the day.The hardest part about working at Walmart was the fluctuating schedule while the best part of the job was interacting with the coustomersThe managers rarely communicated with the supervisors which made it hard for them to communicate with employees. The managers assumed that the supervisors were mind readers when it came to certain task. Most managers didn't help with checkout when the store would be really busy. They would pull employees from other departments of the store which then put those departments behind with getting their own work done.. check email for recalls/ shipments for the day/ call ins.check sales reports from the day before.check status of stores condition.follow up with department manager to follow up on work load for the day.. morning meeting with store staff to go over previous day sales, report due and associates on anniversaries and birthdays..The most enjoyable part of the day is knowing that you turned a profit from the previous day and your hard work was well worth it..As a People Greeter, in Conroe, Texas, and Anchorage, Alaska, I enjoyed meeting the people and assisting them, by answering questions they might have.  In Anchorage, I was also, a People Greeter, but transferred to Automotive, and Hardware as a clerk in those departments.  Excellent work ethic, and attendance.Report to work 15 minutes early, check duties, learned new concept and how to utilize new data listed on the wire (information system), Check with management to see if any additional duties need to be completed, work as a team with co-workers to complete all tasks assigned, the hardest part of my job is keeping the area straight after customers leave a mess, the most enjoyable part of my job is assisting, satisfying and making customers happy.Meet the target set by the company, provide good after sales service, Look into the complaints made by the customers as they help in improving the overall product, researching and survey customer satisfaction, Give ideas regarding offers to boost sales, maintain accurate records for sales which help in deriving the right figures, give feedback to higher management about the product.At Walmart we had a lot of worker and for the most part everyone got along and tried to make our days at work as easy as possible. i learned how to drive an electric pallet jack, how to work with other people. the hardest part of this job is when someone is not present, someone else has to cover the shift which means double work but other than that it wasn't really hard. i enjoyed the workers and the times we had.*Upper management lacks respect when speaking to other salaried management employees and hourly associates. *Company wants ""more for less."" (requiring salaried employees to work more than 15+ hours per/shift)*The hardest part of this job is assigning tasks to a shift that is always short-staffed, and dealing with disgruntle employees.* Motivating the associates and seeing their end results is the most enjoyable part of my job.The work conditions are deplorable when your hours are not being cut. Upper management is of no support and the things corporate sends down clearly looks good on paper written by a bunch of people who have CLEARLY never done the job. There is a sign that hangs in every Walmart for all employees to see that states the employees are on the front lines so they're whom should be listened to. Most employees understand it's just for decoration.People who work terribly are treated better than people who work hard, and if you work hard and bend your back for your managers they will continue to add more and more work and ask for more and more favors and will not consider you, your health or your personal life if something occurs. They don't treat you as humans beings. You're an accessory to them, a slave that gets paid (not nearly enough) to do everything for them.My time at Wal-Mart was something of an experience. My co-workers were more interested in trying to find ways to trick the system into letting them pay $5 for a new game that just came out rather than actually doing their job. Also management has this ability to completely ignore your school schedule and have you scheduled to come in to work 10 minutes after your class across campus from your dorm let out and would get mad about me being late. They didn't understand the fact that school came before work to me so I left.At Walmart a typical day would be me cleaning the toy department and getting it cleaned up for the next few customers. I have learned how to provide correct customer service and provide good advice and further information for my customers. My managers that worked for walmart, could have handled their jobs better then how they did. But I must say that my job was cool. My co-workers were amazing , they were easy to work with and they were very funny, the hardest part of my job was dealing with angry customers. But the most enjoyable part was getting to work around such amazing people.I loved working here most days. I was let go due to unfortunate events that got int the way. Sadly, there is some unfair treatment from certain salaried managers. Some of them will treat you poorly if you can't be with them or do them favors, if understood properly. I noticed I was frequently getting spoken to or getting in trouble shortly after refusing someone. Just watch out for that. Aside from this issue, the pay is eh. But you'll love who you work with. They make it easy for every day to be a good day.Can be a fair place to work if you are attending school. They try to be flexible with employees if they have children by allowing you to work day or night. The work is not hard work for the most part, but it can be very busy work. Most of the management are pretty fair with employees. The co-workers tend to be friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job is having to stock a double truck of merchandise in a short amount of time. The most enjoyable part of the job is receiving bonuses.This position keeps me very busy and allows me to get to know a lot of people and work with others.  Although I do really like this job, I don't see it as an end all beat all position as it doesn't provide me with many challenges except for that of having to find a way to get all things done with a limited amount of resources.Going in to this job can make your day a better day if your day isn't going to well you'll get to interact with others,having good co-workers can really be fun also having someone to talk to someone you may learn to trust and in companies such as this one we was more like a family.The hardest part of the job for me was when an associate would call out so therefor i would have to go harder to keep my department looking good.What i loved the most about the good was when our customers are satisfiedA day at Walmart consisted of breaking down the newly delivered product and restocking shelves making sure they stayed stocked throughout the day while at the same time helping customers. Walmart had a very interactive management team that was always willing to show how things are done or help you out if things where running behind. My co-workers at Walmart were easy to talk to and we worked together like a well oiled machine to get through the day.The hardest part about working at Walmart was the fluctuating schedule while the best part of the job was interacting with the customers.","10,000+",San-Francisco,San Bruno,CA,2016-10-19T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/fd4ffbdd-eeee-409e-9d9b-df84613da8cd?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=14,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
225,226.0,"Scientist I, QA/QC",Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc,3.7,1000.0,"The co-workers are interactive and ready to give an helping hand where need be. The managers are understanding and very much considerate and accommodates each an every team member. They also allow us to have flexible schedule as they don't micro manage the team. The hardest part of the job is being is when you find a mean customer.This is straight up the worst place I ever worked. Managers would insult employees right in front of other people which made for a very uncomfortable environment to work in daily. There is small select group of people and if you are not in that group they do not care about you and you will not be there long. I got text messages at home while I was trying to sleep to let me know what time to come in on a daily basis because there is no organization. Got hurt pretty bad because of faulty equipment and dangerous workplace and they refused to give me x-rays and sent me back with an injury and threatened to let me go if I didn't go back. All in all just a terrible place to work, only thing good was money.Life is dynamic and fast-paced here. One day you are laser-focused on routine technical issues with a small customer and the next you are presenting to healthcare C-Suite around initiatives that will move them forward clinically and financially. The only constant is that we aim to help make the world healthier, cleaner, and safer for our customers. The support from co-workers is tremendous and the opportunity to use your existing skills while learning new ones is great.This was my 1st time working in a warehouse the experience was great! I worked the 2nd shift I would start my day by filing it would be a slow pace when I start then I would go to the floor and greet my coworker that worked on the line. I work well with others so I did have any issues with working with them. The hardest part was making was remembering Hazard Mats UN numbers but I made sure everything was correct for all Carries.The  culture of Thermo Fisher differs from department to department, so this only pertains to the department I worked within. My department hires people early in their careers and doesn't do much for them other than give them a job. The job provides extremely little training from inexperienced workers, is run by tone deaf management who literally avoid eye contact with people working below them, and demands intense physical commitment (working 10 hour shifts on your feet moving nearly constantly) while offering very little in return. Coworkers can often be great, however, and can help you through the job if you choose to work there.The silo approach between groups and divisions impedes Thermo Fisher's ability to be successful in the long run. The HR function that drives salary, promotions is relatively ineffective.  It is a nice place to work in that people and culture is positive but there is no sense of urgency or accountability.  They don't get things done - there is no corporate strategy on where the company is headed.It is a toxic culture at this place, the work environment is extremely poor, it is a good place to stay away from. They will treat you nice when you start then after a while they will change for no reason, they will start to watch you, not trust you, try to embarrass you or blame you for things you  did not even do. It is a shame that they do this.1  days at work are hectic and stressful2 i have learned a lot about the screen printing industry 3 management has changed in a negative way.4 for the most part co workers have been nice except for a few bad apples. 5 demands have increased and teamwork is diminishing 6 when things come together to give everyone a nice quarterly bonus.Working from home no office hours. my day at work was mainly checking and relying to daily emails, planning customer visits, working on sales plans, promoting the product. Management very dynamic changing constantly. too may layers of management. Met coworkers every quarter during sale meeting in Austin Texas, US hardest part...no immediate support being away of the country with 9 hours time deference. to many management changes, most enjoyable part was meeting with customers and promoting the productA typical day we have daily meetings. Management discuss the productivity of the company day before and what's needed to be done to complete for the day. Topics are discuss about the expectation of some individuals. Each co-worker is assigned to a duty for that day. Our job is enjoyable when others do their part but the hardest part of the job is lack of communication between management. Alot of times managers are nowhere to be found when something is wrong and much cant get done when that happens. Alot of responsibility on co-workers but that's counterproductive when they don't give alot of training to people.Work days can vary from 8-10 hr days and its only two shifts. I learned all of the basic job needs to fulfill the material handler 1 role. Management team doesn't have an understanding on warehouse needs and they are very experienced when it comes to warehouse work. They only care for themselves and don't at least try to take cares of the problems employees face each day. They tend to blame the employees for any kind of reason possible. They don't Acknowledge how hard you work and how the team works. Co-workers come from either a temp agency rarely hired on. Fun cool people easy to work with. The hardest part is dealing with management and trying to have them understand certain things. The most enjoyable is the amount of teamwork you do with your co-workers.In my time there I learned how little a corporation can care about its employees. There is very little chance of internal advancement, the pay is ok to start but the raises offered do not keep up with the cost of living increases. Other than that they have no issue shipping jobs oversees, treating their customers like cash cows and ignoring any kind of work life balance.The R&D culture at the Austin Thermo Fisher site is very inclusive. The employees are welcoming and collaborative, and frequent group meetings and presentations keep everyone's work in progress, by celebrating the successes and crowd-sourcing troubleshooting ideas when needed. This was my first industry position, and I have learned a great deal about business in my time at Thermo Fisher, and I think it has made me a much stronger scientist overall.A well run company that cares genuinely about its employees, who show consistent dedication to the success of corporate goals and each other.  It provides a supportive environment with sufficient resources (internal services such as market research) and tools to enable effective job growth and achievement.Calm, slow paced work environment, great supervisors and friendly work place. Due to Thermo Fisher Scientific being such a large company, I find that the top brass don't really care about their workers. They take way too long to hire temps on permanently and don't pay enough for the work we do. I don't necessarily like the way they do things here but the environment makes up for that a bit in the sense that it's very comfortable and everyone here is friendly.it a basic customer service operation where there is very little advancement opportunities as is dominated by individuals with the most years of service vs. knowledge and preparedness, even if you have higher qualifications the next best option in their network is the person who has the most yearsI have worked at this company for over 10 years. In that time I have seen management come and go. This round of current management is just deplorable. Treating employees like they are in a prison is the only description I can come up with.  It seems that this current batch of 'upper management' is obsessed with bending the company policy only when it benefits them. I would strongly urge folks to look elsewhere if they want to be happy with their job.A typical day involved conducting productions and reviewing results as well as logging data. I learned how safely and effectively work with hazardous chemicals. The management was fairly good. I enjoyed working with co-workers. I enjoyed the science and processes. The hardest part was the lack of competitive wages especially considering the hazards of the job.Documented success in leading various technical and non-technical team membersSkilled in influencing key stakeholders at all levels (peers, senior leaders, employees), demonstrated success in building and maintaining relationships, collaborating with others across business, function, and geographical boundariesA typical day at work begins with recording one's production goal for the day. After that, solutions that will be used throughout the day will need to be prepared. The assembling of chromatography columns will then begin, as well as the packing of them with specific types of resin. After the packing, the different methods of testing start. At the end of the testing, data is interpreted and analyzed.Great benefits, growing rapidly. Employee concerns addressed actively. Opportunity to make a difference. Actively embraces diversity in workplace. Supports community through service and contributions.","10,000+",San-Francisco,South San Francisco,CA,2016-10-19T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/0381f1d7-8fe2-4349-b763-d7190aa70a4a?mescoid=1900306001001&jobPosition=25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
