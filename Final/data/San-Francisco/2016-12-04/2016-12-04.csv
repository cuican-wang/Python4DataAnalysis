209,210.0,Senior Scientist: CAR T Cell Biology & Engineering,Pfizer Inc.,4.2,1900.0,"A typical day at work - checkin with your team on any issues affecting the working environment for the scientist and set priorities to get the facility back up to standards.What I learned - I learned to be a leader on a few projects and take on some responsibility on improving energy efficiencies. My co-workers were great, we had a softball league that we participated in.The hardest part of the job was when the company had to reduce staffing.After I graduated form the Pharmacy School, I work for Pfizer as a medical rep., as the policy in Saudi Arabia mandated to have healthcare background. The workplace, the system is exceptional and you well interact with the finest workforce in the industry among the companies. The firm policy is strict, either internally or at the market, the resources you have to achieve your goal are the best among other companies. However, the advangates come with a price, as the market leading position of Pfizer in the market required an exceptional performance in utilizing the resources provided to maintain the leader position, in which it will too tough at the begging, but it will be easier and funnier when you acquire the experience.Great benefits, great coworkers, and emphasis that all contribute to ""helping to made medicines""  which will in turn make a positive impact in the world. Emphasis on a ""healthy Pfizer"" - free flu shots for colleagues,  fitness center on site.There is plenty of room to grow within the company, if you are related to someone who works there. Nepotism is a problem at the Pearl River site and upward mobility is difficult with unqualified managers and employees. Discrimination exists in certain groups, as pregnancies seem to be a hassle for some team leaders. It is a shame because there really is potential here at Pfizer.I love working with Pfizer Company.  The benefits are great and the pay is wonderful.  The people are full of love and dedication.  I really enjoy being apart of such a wonderful family. I learned how to communicate properly and the importance of staying focused to get the job done right the first time.  Management is always there to help and motivate every individual.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the education and training, you can always move up.  As far as the job being hard, anything worth having is worth working hard for.Do to the take over,  the company had to downsize. Unfortunately my department was among to downsizing. I was hoping to spend many more years with this company.I was in charge of up to 40 mechanics a day and supervised demand and preventive maintenance. My group was tight an fun to work with but there were too many people we had to report to and we were very micromanaged at every turn. I lost all trust in management after the termination of my superior.I learned quickly to ""go with the flow"" which i had a hard time doing.Our schedule was ridiculous and they didn't care about family time.great co workers to work with management knows how to handel there workersbenifits are great great location to work at great pay rate.learned a lot working for pfizerManage and Prioritize all administrative tasks including scheduling meetings, conference calls, web-ex and video conferences, arranging international and domestic travel, obtain visas and passports as needed,  Responsible for generating reports from Business Warehouse in Citrix system.Coordinator for the E-room for both regions. Share Point Coordinator for Process & Information Management in Global Logistics Supply Network.Working with other admins learning different software and developing yourself for promotions. Filling in for other admins when necessary. Meeting last minutes deadlines to complete assigned tasks.Flexible working hours. Meeting people from different cultures learning their values.I love working here, keeping busy, but being a contractor for 2 years I do not see the job going anywhere. Everything that I do here is what I went to school for, and enjoy it.The culture changed after several over reaching acquisitions and the sales force was bloated in the mid 2000s. Several products in the pipeline never made it to the market. For the first time, in 2007, Pfizer had a lay off of sales personal that has conmtinued to this day.I am currently employed at Pfizer, I would rather not write a review. The compensation package is adequate. The work/ balance is below average due to mandatory overtime.I enjoyed working for Pfizer.  The compensation package was amazing.  I enjoyed working in the field and spending time with my family.  Unfortunately, my time there was too short.  In 2009 my territory was dissolved. Looking to get back in the industry!Worked there 28 years as my brother worked there 42 years, management was great and there were always compensation for your work and just being part of the ""Pfizer Family"" Really can not say enough...except GREAT!A mature company in the healthcare industry. My experience with Pfizer has been very positive.  Great benefits and internal support system.  Treats employees with respect.Workplace culture is great and you will be kept busy. It is a fun environment, but the work can be pretty demanding. Continue to learn and expand skills on your own time because you'll mainly focus on a couple of skills. The work is rewarding at the end of the day, but it is very easy to get lost in the trenches of the daily grind.I enjoyed this position for numerous reasons. I was able to design, develop and deploy an in-house patient registry enrollment program for heart valve patients per the requirements of the Safe Medical Device Act of 1990. I successfully educated 100,000+ patients/physician worldwide regarding product lines, medical, legal and regulatory issues. I was also given the opportunity to locate 896 patients at 14 institutions (U.S., Canadian, and European Hospitals), develop protocols, study requirements, case report forms, budgets, contacts and feasibility process for a IDE follow-up program complying with FDA directives. I enjoyed working with all of my co-workers which included the engineering and legal staff. Even though our projects were very stressful and challenging, we always found time to enjoy our jobs and each other's company.Nice place to work. No work was ever too physically demanding and I worked with a lot of experienced and helpful individuals. I learned a lot about production while I worked here and would recommend it to just about anyway. The hardest thing about the job was just learning to get into a rhythm of checking everything  on the machine to make sure everything was running ok. I did enjoy everybody I worked with though.Work all shifts. Leaned a lot about pharmaceuticals. I enjoyed work with Management and my Co-workers. A typical day at work consisted of: First have a meeting to inform on how processes are going (problems with equipment and status of process).  Second I would see previous operator too insure where process was.Easy work for the pay you receive. Great benefits with 401K and Vacation package. Highly recommend working for the company.The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to do a product to safe  people lives. The hardest part of my work was when the company closed.","10,000+",San-Francisco,South San Francisco,CA,2016-12-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/5cc51c43-ecad-4597-8389-fa028c3df633?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
