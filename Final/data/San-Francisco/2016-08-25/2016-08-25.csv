136,137.0,Senior Data Scientist - Speech,AVA,3.6,19.0,"I'm a hard worker and very flexible. I would like to use my current skills to work in an organization where i can enjoy my job and to move up is possibleGreat company  I'm still employed ,great bonus .Very easy going laid back office, Very concerned with their clients,its more than just the money .good company to work for.My typical work day was to cash out all customers and maintain a clean store.  When it got closer to closing hours I would check my gas levels and document them, clean the store, stock the cooler and do all paper work for my shift then lock up and go home.  The most enjoyable time was the interactions with my customers and I would have to say the hardest part would be cleaning up the entire store before I closed.  My boss and co-workers were easy to get along with and easy to make arrangements with for work schedules if needed.The work was strenuous, being that it is a start up entrepreneurship.Often worked 12-16hrs days, but it was well worth it. The entire company made you feel like you were an integral part of the whole teamTypical work days are from 4am t0 3pm or 2pm to 11 pm. Management doesn't know how to communicate well.Good place to work but Bad Management, Company went Bankrupt. Co-Workers were great",,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-08-25T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/c8b55bc2-ccaa-48ea-8ebf-c3ca47477aa7?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
137,138.0,Data Scientist,SPIRE,3.6,16.0,"A strong presence in several niche markets has kept the company profitable and successful in an industry that is suffering some growing pains. Continued success due to strong development and technology capacity looks to be strong.The changing nature of the industry puts more focus on 'in the office' time for Account Executives, making presence in the Boston office the better part of most days a factor in continued success. On a personal level, living in Central Massachusetts is not a great fit for my current position and the commute (which was not as frequent based on the initial scope of my current position) has become the hardest part of the job.Management is 'hands off' style for the most part, affording individuals with the ability to self-motivate, a strong opportunity to work independently and achieve success.Spire Corporation was a great company to work for. I managed the marketing and design functions of the company for 16 years.Spire had great pay for someone coming right out of undergrad however the company culture of passing the blame and speaking to each other in ways that are inappropriate to a professional work setting (including managment) is what sent me running.100% commission split cannot be beat. The company has a database of rental listings, a supportive management team, a friendly atmosphere and a great location in the heart of Manhattan.SPIRE Institute is an Olympic training facility that houses a full time academy in which we develop the future of high school and post graduate students through sport.I work directly with the students in regard to their total well being during their time at SPIRE.A company with a lot going on. Always an eye on the future. Interesting co-workers  and people managing.This was a job that just did not work out.Just did not get along with my boss.I just wasn't a good fit.",,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-08-25T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/585c43d2-1482-4bdb-ba9d-1617f122a74b?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
