152,153.0,Data Scientist,Jawbone,3.5,12.0,"Spent two years watching management run the company into the ground while I enjoyed working alongside some very talented people. I would not advise signing on to work for this company today, no matter what the offer.Great idea company with great products just too bad that they did not get a better management team in place sooner.Great group of employees, very talented and determined. If they were given better direction that would have been much more productive and less frustrated.Fun and relaxed place to work. Supportive management ( professional and personal growth). Feeling comfortable with the people you work with, getting to know them knowing they are good people and good at what they do.Company lost focus on product development and establishing needed processes to follow.  Executive team does not communicate with employees and the direction of the company.  Lack of funding and no future for bringing company to IPO.I like working for this company the Management Team is very friendly and understanding and great with assisting your with any issue you may have .Work environment is great, many great and talented people.  Product ID is unbeatable with museum type of design.  Free lunch, drinks, snacks, + birthdays and work anniversaries celebration is fun.A normal day includes checking in, the computer, as well as the store manager on duty. Being the field operation specialist you don't have no other co-workers, but you do teach the other employees in the store on the products you sell. Everything has it's challenges, like a day when there isn't anybody interested in hearing about your product, which happens, but to overcome that I tend to relocate in other areas to find more customers. The most enjoyable part of working is interacting with people, and selling products.Jawbone benefits from their great talent but has a serious lack of Management. Jawbone suffers most from the lack of direction.Own product structure and delivery into manufacturing.Work one-on-one with engineers and product managers to create BOMs and required support documentation.Bit chaotic. Executive Management are a bit scattershot.Fun products to work on but the development process needs a lot of help.Good food and health coverage.View of the river and baseball field. casual work environment",,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-05-20T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/1976eb98-cfe0-4365-bee3-a4c62d3eed17?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=21,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
