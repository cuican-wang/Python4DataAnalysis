102,103.0,Senior Data Scientist Job,SAP,4.3,416.0,"Good place to learn new skills. Big company with lots of opportunity provided you are working in the West Coast where most of the Dev work gets done.Coordinate trade shows, contacted and maintained SAP's editorial calendar.  Set-up interviews with Software Analysts and editors for future press mentions in magazines that were appropriate for our industry.The hardest thing with this particular position was getting the group to send in their updates on what they working on in a timely manner.The best thing about my job was everyday was different.  Always something new and you had to be prepared for anything that came my way.SAP is located in Los Altos, CA.I'm looking for a workplace where the people and company values honestly, integrity, family friendliness and exhibits true morals.It's a pleasure to work for SAP, you have the change to learn a lot and you have good work life balance. It's a company where you can have a career without wanted to leave, however for personal reasons I'm going to move to US, therefore I might need to leave SAP.Great management that leads with a proactive strategy that leads to great sales execution in almost all of their business units. Constantly adapting to newer customer demands and the ability to satisfy these demands with newer cloud based technologies that are typically more efficient for businesses to adapt and cheaper.would help visitors and employees out on the daily about questions they had about the campus, had to go to multiple office buildings for each department. Helped on side projects and would break relief the receptionistsWe were bought out by SAP. It's hard not to notice that they put most of their primary investments behind Sales and to a lesser extent Marketing.  Software Developers and Engineers typically take a back seat. While they may pay more across the board, they overwork the development staff.  Understaff software, overstaff sales.The movement in this job is great. Never the same position more than twice, always something new going on, the excitement at a San Jose Sharks game is fantastic. Coworkers are honest people always willing to help out, hardest part is knowing when to ask for assistance in a difficult situation with an unruly guest. Best part of the job is the hockey games for most of the year.job Work/Life Balance IS GOODCompensation/Benefits IS GOODJob Security/Advancement IS GOODManagement IS GOODJob Culture IS GOODGreat company to work for. If only head count is there, I would continue working here as Full time EE. I love the work culture and the challenging atmosphere.This was really a great job, however travel exceeded my expectations. I traveled by air, more that 100,000 air miles each year and it became awful after 911. I learned a lot from this company regarding adult education, in which we taught classes to 26+ adults each week, both at the home office and customer locations. We were required to teach more classes than the job requirements called for and that was unfortunate. The company also had a preference of hiring German instructors.You have all of the knowledge that there is right at your fingertips.Management will always support you on achieving your goals and for you to become a better resource each and everyday.Working at SAP is like flying in your dream.There is always work, but not always good support to get all work done and done well.  Not possible to get fired, but could be downsized at a whim. Flex hours don't truly exist, which is silly in the advanced tech world.Good PTO and bonus programsGreat co-workers; love to wordsmith. Hardest part of job was dealing with highly technical collateral written by developers. But I managed!Great co-workers.Small Company with great management.Always a fun to place to work.Learned to deal with clients from all over the world.If you are looking to find a nice cushy place to work for a long time, SAP is it.  Management is long tenured, opportunity for advancement is fairly difficult.  A great environment if you want the corporate feel with some of the start-up perks.Heavy workloads, days seemed to fly by.SAP is a very large, professional corporation.  I learned so much it's hard to pin down.My Team Lead, Manager, Director, etc. were located in Downers Grove, IL.  I worked on my own, but could always make contact  with someone when questions/situations arose.Co-workers were great!  However, everyone worked so hard there was rarely time to talk with them.Hardest part - the amount of workEnjoyable part - Working with the sales people I supported, working with customers, problem-solving.A great firm to work and learn from experts. Customer focussed.Leader in SAP HANA, Big Data, Cloud and IoT. S/4 HANA is game changer today for Digital Transformation.Lots of challenge with team members at the leading edge of the SAP technology. The fast-paced environment totally appealed to meA typical day involves a two hour preparation period in which all employees are made aware of and practice their roles for the event.  Each employee is assigned a position, be it signage, playback, audio, etc and work together to ensure a seamless experience for event-goers. When the event is over, all A/V employees meet for a debriefing in which feedback of the event is offered.It is an enjoyable experience, but the work is gig-based and shifts are few and far in-between.Everyone is doing great thing professionally and personally, great environment! Great benefits, fun on-campus events. work what a lot of different industries using the products so that a plus!","10,000+",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-10-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/0fe6b2f0-35e0-4648-a773-110f9e902e10?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
251,252.0,Principal Research Scientist,Accenture Inc,4.0,7200.0,"I have spent 10 and 1/2 years with Accenture and they have given me many SAP Basis skills that I did not possess when I joined them.  They are a hands on company and employ only the most qualified people.  They value work/life balance and live up to that promise.  I always worked for managers that I enjoyed working for and respected which made me only want to do a better job for them. A typical day at work could vary from day to day as I learned quickly that some tasks take priority over others and at a very quick pace. I enjoyed all of my co-workers and worked well with them as a team.  Hardest part of the job was leaving after such a long time.Day-to-day project experience varies with your delivery lead.  Senior leaders try to create an engaging, nurturing culture, but that often comes secondary to delivery leads' efforts to over-deliver.Enjoyed working with the firm. They maintain a certain work environment which caters to the needs of their employees in an appropriate manor.If the management of project is ethical then one can find opportunities for growth. If not, then it can give one a challenging experience. Pay scale is decent.When you work at Accenture, you are moving very quickly but you are also exposed to so many new opportunities. If you like a big company and have an entrepreneurial spirit, you'll really enjoy it.My review of Accenture was that in my dept we were extremely understaffed which in turn cause A LOT of frustration and stress in the environment. In my time being there management was changed 3 times which cautioned a red flag in my mind. The management staff was very rude and non helpful. I even reported them to HR upon my departure due to the fact of the unfairness and treatment I would constantly receive at my time there on several different occasions.A typical work day is would be managing a Scrum team of 7 members. Attending daily standup meetings, grooming sessions, and Review & Retrospective meetings for 2 projects. The team is very productive and work as a well oiled machine. We have a nearshore team and they work with us during our timezone which makes them professional. The most enjoyable part of the job is that there is a lot of team work involved and we knock the requirements off the park during every sprint.I enjoy working for Accenture however it is a world wide company which makes it very difficult to get a quick answer from your supervisor when they work in a completely different state.I have worked at Accenture for 4 yrs and have had a great range of roles which have definitely help improve my over all skills but the salary and bonus are not good.In general, Accenture is a great company to work for.  They offer good benefits, decent compensation and have a strong company culture.  The people that work for Accenture are highly motivated and work well in team environments.  I never have felt threatened that someone was trying to take my job or through me under the bus.At first, the company would look rather really harmless, and full of fun. But when you get into a project, that's when the nightmare starts. You have to work longer hours even when it's not really necessary; and sometimes even work on Saturdays and Sundays just because the manager told you so. One time after a long day at work, I was still only parking my car in my garage (I haven't even turned the engine off yet) when my mobile phone rang and it was my manager calling me asking me to come to work EARLY the following day! at 2AM in the morning! Another gripe I had was even when the workplace is supposed to be full of software developers, for some reason, it's was always so noisy. You have to struggle focusing on your tasks. And since it's a very competitive company, you'll be lucky to find people to help you in case you get stuck in something - especially if it needs their specialty. People are so insecure with their positions that they often see you as a threat when you ask them for help.My time being here has been pretty good for the most part. It's a great company to work for. Great place to grow within the company.Good health and dental. Flexible with vacation time in my experience. Trouble growing in some career alignments, understand where you are in the company and how the group is prioritized.provided opportunity to create and seize business opportunities in formulation and preparation of proposals and ideas for new service offerings. Forged and leveraged positive relationships with key client executives, drove value by maximizing benefits / value for clients and Accenture, and coordinated and directed complex work efforts by planning and coordinating work ensuring achievement of multiple commitments and quality expectations. Restructured work in response to changing client needs, define and / or reinforce standard methods and processes delivering high quality services, as well as, balancing relationship among budget, staffing mix, and project milestones including work-plans and schedules.Excellent People, Environment challenges you to be your best.  Many different opportunities to grow your career.  Many roles require travel Monday through Thursday.Accenture is all about the bottom line.With Accenture there are no such thing as work life balance. The Company is mainly focus on it is bottom line.Only downside I experienced is when you change roles and the next role is clearly more difficult, a promotion and a pay raise should accompany as well.  This did not happen.Working in Accenture I started to understand about to work in a different level of business, was a gret job. I worked with people of many countries, different languages.Working on latest in technology. Great place to develop network, learn and progress if you are interested in consulting. Very open work culture in terms of moving to different areas if needed.Its very good work environment. Work Life Balance and Compensatio, Benefits are very good. Co- workers are really helpfull. And leadership is very friendly. Training are very good.Regular busy day, meetings , team management. I have learnt lots of testing management activities from my day 1. Hardest part of my Job was the project where i worked as test manager where I was responsible for all the testing activities of the project. Interacting with the new people while working with different clients.","10,000+",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-10-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/19869c3e-4b23-4e1a-b6f3-a3a2e196bf62?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
