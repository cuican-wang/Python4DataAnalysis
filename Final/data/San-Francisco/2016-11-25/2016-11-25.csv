2,3.0,Data Scientist,The Judge Group,3.4,82.0,"The recruiter always called me back whenever i had any questions during the time of the contractTypical day at work was very much unsatisfying.I learned that you can't trust this organization at all.Management treats you like a dog!Co workers are back stabbers.Hardest part of the job was never being thanked for all the hard work you do.Can't say I enjoyed working for this company at all!!!a lot of turn around not too much job security, hardest part of the job is to build your client data base. management lacked a bitGreat company, great people to work with. There is a ton of opportunity to earn a good living if you work hard and dedicate yourself. There is a great work life balance and a work hard play hard culture. Very good opportunity for people who want to learn how to be a recruiter and do it well. Very strong support system and grade A training program. This company will provide you with all the tools to be successful.I only worked for Judge briefly. I started in the month of January and by resigned by May. I quickly realized how much I despised this place. By February I began looking for a new job. The office I worked in was very tiny (the size of a small closet). I worked with 3 other people in this closet. The girls I worked with were very mean and extremely rude. They would talk about you the second you walked out of a room and would stop the moment you returned. They were fake nice when you would try to talk to them. I never in my life felt so alone and excluded. I made every attempt to get along with them but they simply wouldn’t have it. I was often pulled into HR to discuss my work attire. There was a strict dress code there but only for certain people. I was in trouble for wearing black suede boots and a military style jacket yet my coworker was permitted to wear a denim jacket and cowboy boots. A lot of the women there would also wear micro miniskirts where I could see more than I wanted to yet my dresses were too short according to HR cause they didn’t cover my knees. The place was very “clicky”. It was like being back in High School. You were either a popular kid or a nerd. I tried to fit in but was pushed out every time I tried. It was very hurtful. I couldn’t get out of there fast enough! And if you like to have time off from work, forget about it! This company does not allow anyone to take unpaid time off and the accrual rate of time off is a joke. Your 1st year you get 3 days! Also, the benefits are probably some of the worst I have ever seen. For a large company,  more... they have horrible health benefits. You will literally be working there for just benefits but never get to use them because the deductibles are so high.  lessLoved the position I was in and really enjoyed working with the group of people I was with.  I learned quite a bit regarding Healthcare that I hope to use in the future.  I was very disappointed when I was told that the company I was working with did not want to keep me on past my 6 month contract date after I was pretty much convinced that I would be kept on through the next contract with the same company.I would definitely recommend this company for the college graduate or anyone who is in the market of looking for a job. They look to fit you with the best job to fit your experience.Onsite management needs improvement, high turnover in leadership resulting in job security for potential growth with job siteThis office has a great work environment! Everyone is wonderful and the director is the best. It is best to be confident in what you say and be prepared to make a lot of phone calls. You must definitely enjoy talking to people to succeed here!Good communication, responsive to employee inquiries, fair pay. Managers respond to inquiries concerning, job assignments, hours of work and pay issuesGood company to work for.  I like the fact that they pay weekly.  The beginning pay process I think may need some attention, and the fact that you have to track time in the assigned company's system, and also in Judge's system is a bit cumbersome and always involves coordination, etc.good first job out of college. not a lot of room for growth though. hours are long but you can make money at this job if you work hard. its a lot of luck so you need to be resilient.no work life balance and compensation is low for the amount of stress and hours you have to put in. Every day you have to come in and work on the same jobs over and over. Recently, they decided to stop using LinkedIn and Indeed as well, making recruiters lives harder.Worked from home on Insurance company's national project.  LOVED being a telenurse.The Judge Group was wonderful to work with -  Very Responsive, Well Compensated.  Would DEFINITELY work for them again!it seems the company as a whole has an ego problemthey are not about bettering themselves as a company but more about how they can kill one anotherthey dont even have good customersThe company is focused on metrics more than anything, and if you aren't hitting your numbers consistently then you're hearing about it.  There are a lot of jobs to be worked on, but the environment sometimes isn't very fun.  There is a lot of turnover and it doesn't show much stability.  Seems like the only successful people are those who have been there for 5+ years, junior recruiters have a hard time growing.All temp no chance for permanent.No matter what the recruiter says.Some what helpful but not a team surrounds.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxLove this company, the only problem is the Medical benefits, other than that it's awesome! This is a family oriented Company.Very skilled in matching employers and employees. I was placed in a position where I could shine.  I was able to learn quickly and cover many areas of accounting process.Most of the branches are pretty ok at judge, but working for healthcare in the corporate office (conshy) is extremely stressful.  In the past year alone they have gone through two internal recruiters which you would think is a bad sign since now the managers themselves are doing the internal recruiting.  Some account managers are very high strung, and those who run the office treat the recruiters like a number.  Most recruiters have to bend/break the rules to meet quotas mainly out of fear for being yelled at.  These recruiters work extremely hard, and at least 45 hours a week not including all the work from home to keep up with the cycle.They say the pay scale is competitive, however it is pretty basic compared to other firms, honestly 32,000 (about 13 bucks an hour...) after you get your bachelors is really low.  I feel like they are taking advantage of students coming right out of college. The commission plan is ok but its very rare to make anything noticeable in commission until after six months. The promotions they run are fairly difficult to hit, one recruiter out of thirty might get a small gift for hitting a quota. As recruiters we've been yelled at, and cursed at for things that we cannot control such as a candidate taking another job, not showing for their interview despite telling us they would, etc.  Again kicking you while you are down.  Since they try to motivate by fear, most people are too scared of losing their job to report anything.  If you are recently graduated and have few other options, then get some experience there and get out.  Hardest  more... part of the job - hitting the quota.Most enjoyable part - the recruiters and recruiting managers are nice people, but they are being taken advantage of.  The Judge family and executives seem like genuine people, though you dont hear much from them.  lessI enjoy my current position at Judge Healthcare. Lots of opportunity here to grow.I really enjoy the people and it is def a work hard play hard type environment",201 to 500,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-11-25T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/data-scientist-job-san-francisco-ca-us-176710549.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
