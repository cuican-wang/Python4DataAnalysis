148,149.0,Data Scientist,Stitch Fix,3.3,39.0,"the work environment is great for a person who is active and love multitask. The people who work here are friendly and they practice commutative skills. Different mixtures of cultures and management is very understanding and flexible with employees that are going to school or have another job.Unfortunately, i moved and had to leave the job otherwise i would've stayed there. Great environment and team effort all day. i learned a lot on how to style every women for their body type.The place don't appreciate temporary employee's whent home sick throwing up and I get let go the next day the people aren't very friendly free food really how long will it take before they hire a lot more people and get rid of the free food not longMy first day at stitch fix suck.the management is in their own world.Manager and trainer was playing and cussing the other employees.once they show you what to do .the trainer did not come back to check to see if I am doing the job right.at the end of the day manager and trainer had clock out before me.the new employee. they are very hood in the warehouse.don't like getting paid only twice a month.I have grown a lot as a person and learned a lot of great things! They don't believe in merit based raises and want to give you a lot of roles/not compensate you for it.I absolute love Stitch Fix, Everyone is very friendly, Managers will work with your schedule, you can listen to music, and they offer free snacks and drinks everyday!Stylists enjoy flexible hours with great management. There is a community of Stylists who work together fabulously. If you have a passion for fashion, you will thoroughly enjoy styling clients from across the United States!Management is really poor. They never communicate with one another, so the employee's are always finding things out at the last minute. You can see favoritism all over the place. I have been working there for almost a year now and I have never been given the opportunity to move up. I see new people with less than six months at the warehouse get promoted left and right. Managers run their department however they feel like it and they also make you come in early, but they won't show up until regular showtime or even later.Loser trash job stay away. Pure slavery in all forms like working in jail the worst job ever the people there are low class and management is pure garbage. Its like a chinese sweat shop if you are not a favorite then you will get treated like dirt!!This was my first time working at a warehouse.  I was a temp. The atmosphere can be very negative. Alot of the employees have attitudes and are hard to get to know. It seems like management changes policies and rules very often. I did see favoritism, which is not fair to the employess that work hard. Lots of Drama. Adults should act like adults, not childish brats. The amount of insubordination I saw was amazing. These people would have been fired somewhere else.  Not very flexible when it comes to family situations and your schedule. You'll get nowhere there if they don't like you. Free snacks  are great, but not worth working there.The job is easy, but I feel like the company is trying to make slaves out of theses workers. They say it's climate controlled, but the temperature is above 80, they have you stand in one place expecting you to pack clothes at a fast pace while trying not to collapse frm the pain frm your feet. They should provide you a chair if all you are doing is standing there. I realize that most workers breaking a sweat getting all the work done are black and hispanics and mainly the managers and the stylists who sits on their butts and doesn't do much yet get paid more are white. Its a major race issue within this company in my opinion, I feel like I'm a slave and us as workers that receive the clothes frm the trucks, put the clothes on the racks, pick the clothes frm the racks, pack the clothes and ship them should be treated with as much respect as the white people who sit down all day. Stop treating the ones that do all the work like slaves, I mean it's already hard for blacks and hispanics to find jobs so the only job we can probably get we get treated like slaves. I would enjoy it more if I didn't feel like a modern slave. I applied to be a stylist for this company and was denied for no apparent reason yet hired for a warehouse worker. Oh I forgot I'm not white nor have blonde hair to work in the cool part of the building. More people need to stand up for what's right and never let people treat you as if you are beneath them. Money is not everything REMEMBER THAT!!I took a job as a stylist part time to ease the transition into full time after having a baby. I was really excited about the opportunities that I thought the company might present down the road but I realized very soon that, even with a degree in fashion and 10 years of experience, I'd never be promoted even though I had very high statistics (they measure these very closely). As mentioned in many other comments, the management team is like a small group of sorority girls that choose favorites. I lost respect for the brand and the culture very quickly. That's what happens when you don't see and tap into your own employees potential and allow negative people to get settled into positions of power. Good luck fellow fashion majors- I feel your pain!This warehouse is very unprofessional. They play loud music with extreme content and profanity, like five different radios at once. The supervisors never speak to you or introduce themselves. All the supervisors do is stand there and talk all day. There is no air in the warehouse but in the offices they're nice and cool. Iv seen females pass out from the heat. Leads/trainers come to work with hang overs. We are always short on Saturdays because people call in. It's extremely ghetto so if that's not the atmosphere you like then I'm telling you right now this isn't the place for you.  If you have an idea they will steal it and take credit for it. All we do for 10 hours is fold clothing, wrap it and put it in a box. If it isn't to their liking then they send it back to you. Sometimes they sabotage your work on purpose so you have to do it over. The breaks are very very short. People have their cliques so it's hard to get to know do workers. Pay is alright and they have stocked drinks of every kind and different snacks. Over all I wouldn't recommend this company or at least the warehouse.Managementment team could be a lot more organized. They are very big on favorites. The don't accept doctors excuses or anything.I used to enjoy come to work everyday, but first they changed the schedule, second It's hard to get a promotion unless you are friends with the management, even if you are going above and beyond your required job duties your not getting full rise or even worse you get nothing, then you have to wait another year to get cents, the management is really poor, a lot of supervisor for just one department and they never dont know anything, they never can answer a question and will send you with other supervisor. I think every state its different so i guess they have to adjust to Arizona's not benefitsAs a stylist I helped women discover fashion through an online medium to deliver great customer satisfaction.-Remotely review client profiles to select garments for them based on their preferences-Write stylist tips on who to wear and accessorize current items as well as previous items delivered to them.-Communicate with team lead to stay up to date on current company news, changes or interactionsLove the styling process and ""interaction"" with repeat clients.Not crazy about some of the metrics by which you're measured. You can have the best metrics (total spend, client satisfaction, keep rate), and be totally in tune with your clients. But, if you're not fast enough and hit your per hour rate, none of that matters. To me that's unfortunate.Hardest part was managing time in addition to working a demanding full time job; created a situation where I had no days off and very little down time.It is nice to create your own schedule, but there are not many advancement opportunities and not much support from senior members.This place is shady i worked there they had me signed up for benefits the same day which i didn't sign up for.there was no time clock to monitor your hours they only choose certain people to work there which is ridiculous.a friend went there with over 20 years went through 2 interviews they said he wasn't qualified but yet there was people working there with no warehouse experience whasover. Human resource lady was rude also not a good company at all non professional.Love the people the culture the fun the food the stores the love that the company has for it crew members i loved my crew my boss and we always had great benefits and bonusesExcellent work environment to work in. The people are really friendly and fun to work with. The pay is competitive and the staff is great.","5,001 to 10,000",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-06-23T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/32f6ad5d-f408-44c2-818c-525a30e3b344?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
