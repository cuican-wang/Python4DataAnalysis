85,86.0,Data Scientist,AutoDesk,4.2,148.0,"Super smart people, world-changing technology. Autodesk have managed to raise the lowly engineer to the level of Geek Superhero - in fact, they were just named one of the Universum Top 100 Ideal Employers for engineering students.In the right role, one can change the future. Autodesk is a powerful enabler in many spaces, and smart, young people can truly excel in this company.Autodesk transformed drafting and design back in the 1980's, and they continue to lead the world in engineering technology, design, visualization and future techologies (e.g., additive manufacturing, green buildings and engineering simulation). Great benefits and above-scale pay. Super corporate stewardship for many sustainable efforts - Autodesk gives back to the world.In the right team, you'll have fun while changing the world. The average Autodesker is more than just smart - he or she is probably a fun-loving prankster / comedian, too. Seriously, the work atmosphere is intense but when this they take a break from their task lists, the majority of functional teams have a great time together. This alone can make work at Autodesk very, very worthwhile.Autodesk is a progressive software company with excellent benefits and compensation.  It's a great place to work for someone who wants constant change.Sync up statusDaily stand upWork on the tasks allocatedFriendly and supportive team matesImplementing APIsAWS SQSAgile methodologiesEveryone is very good to you and work space is very good. All the Co-workers are very friendly. Management is also very good to you. There is not much work stress here.It was a great place to develop skill and to have an opportunity to grow. Also the job allowed me to get a great I deal on how to satisfy the customer.Autodesk is recently expanding into the world of manufacturing. They have little experience with direct customer support which is making the next few years questionable from the standpoint of stability.Great organization.Management very flexible,accessible, and well informed about the work that needs to be done, and overall willing to give you the support the you need. Supervisors are not always looking over your shoulder and you are given space to implement new ideas about the processes.I was given the opportunity to use my knowledge and skills and also to learn from my co-workers. I got a lot of support from everyone around me with not hesitation or reserve.  Great working environment. Benefits are good and good work/job balance.Company held and promote workers-social gathering within the facilities or outside the facilities. The facilities are great (very clean and modern. Co-workers are always willing to help no matter in what part of the country (USA) or over-sea they are located.Some positions have the option to work from home or at the office.  This is a very technological oriented organization.It was a great place to work not much else to say. Everyone worked together and everyone's ideas were put to use. I traveled about 50% of my time with the company. The travel was almost always 5 days at a time and almost never 2 weeks in a row.I really enjoy my time working at Autodesk the environment is very open and the people to work with are very nice.My major complaint is it is very difficult to apply anywhere else internally. If you are working through a contract you could be let go at any moments notice without any notification ahead of time.Dirty politics played by bad management because they don't have the skills to do the job.Regular layoffs for people who don't cater to managment.Steady outsourcing increase so no job security.Upper management burning reserves buying incompetent companies.While the leadership of the support group seem to care, they in fact are more concerned with their spread sheets, than their employees and customers.Great people, great benefits and great products. The technology is cutting edge and you have opportunity to work with every type company manageable.Management teams are excellent.Co-workers work very hard.Company culture is focused on results.There is a lot of overtime available which is excellent for those with a strong work ethic. Overall, the company culture is evolving to build a better work life balance For those who are dedicated, there are a lot of opportunities for advancement.Great company, solid business model, but has too many changes with management & uncertainty in the upcoming times.Big potential if you survive through the changes.American multinational software corporation that makes software for the architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, media, and entertainment industries.Collaborative - Constructive - environment where team work and team culture are kings.Provided learning opportunities and career growth.Best job ever!I can't say enough good about Autodesk.  I loved my time there.  They treat there employees so well.  I was rookie of the year my first year in sales and was the only one of my team that was over quota.  Love Autodesk.Working remotely for Autodesk allowed me to work from my own home and study, which was a newer experience, but one I end up thoroughly enjoying. The day would start off with a general meeting over Skype or Google Hangout, to discuss what we had accomplished the previous day, and what to work on in the upcoming hours. After about halfway through the day, we would have another meeting about our progress so far, and if there were any issues along the way.I got to experience working with a small-knit group of 5, and being the only artist in the team, I was helping to direct the creative direction, and alert the team to any artistic aversions to the software. We worked with a soon-to-be released version of Autodesk Stingray, to prepare it for public use. I was also working heavily with virtual reality (VR) for the first time in a while, and it helped me get a better understanding of the development technology. The best part of this job was the ease of access I had at any given time. I did not have to leave anything at the office because my study became my office for Autodesk, which let me have everything at arm's length if I needed it.There were some technical issues with data transferring software as well as the newer implementation of VR with the pre-existing technology, but these were eventually remedied.Fun place to work great team and lots to learn. There is constant change to keep it exciting. Great Product that is needed in the market.Worked there for several years.  Back in the mid-1980's there were some fun, fun times.... but with the increase in need for more corporate structure, those days are sadly a memory... though fond memories :)Autodesk has a great product and employees can be proud to work for a company with such a good reputation.  The people are terrific and the space in SF is pretty awesome.  However, management is very uneven and not everyone is on the same page.  There are a lot of mixed messages.  Beware of younger managers and those who have been with the company less than 2 years. They are eager, ambitious, and have little-to-no training on how to manage people.  Loyalty and tenure are not valued at Autodesk, and the company does a major reduction in force about every 3-4 years, focusing on releasing employees who have been with the company more than 10 years.","5,001 to 10,000",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-11-24T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/795ba7d0-79a0-4094-8aaa-9c01bb308036?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
