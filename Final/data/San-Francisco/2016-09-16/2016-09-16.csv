173,174.0,Sr. Data Scientist,InsideSales.com,3.3,14.0,"I really liked the people I worked with. Everybody there is really smart. Lack of operational communication could sometimes cause confusion.I worked there in Provo as an Intern. Amazing company and amazing people. I went there last summer. Good place to be for internship.All of the employees are dedicated and ingrained into the objective of he company.I Hired people and managed the Human Resources.Do not accept a sales job at ISDC unless you are willing to be under thumb 24/7.The last couple of days of each month you will be the used car sales man issuing fire sales on anything and everything to get half baked deals in the door. Average sale is 4.7 months but mid-market sales is still run on a monthly cadence. Expect only a 90-day ramp and extreme pressure to close BEFORE the ramp is completed. Expect to self source 90% of your opportunities as Business Development is non-functional. In a year or two this might be a decent place to work but right now literally EVERYTHING is broken from sales on down to implementation and support. Customer retention is at an all time low. Do not believe the hype generated by the CEO. The predictive analytics they preach as the next big thing in sales is vaporware still. While the base they offer is decent, most everyone in mid market is starving to death and only 4-5 reps (out of 20-25) are actually hitting quota. Proceed at your own risk!Typical Day:Designs test suites Writes and executes test cases Automates test suites Responds/executes emergency ClientHotfixes. Utilized Html 5, Css3, JavaScript,Selenium, Selenium IDE, Jira, qTestManagement and Coworkers: easy to work withHardest: working through the night to meet deadlineExciting company to work for, fun, always changing. Great management team, experienced senior management team. Nice facilities.InsideSales.com is a rapidly growing company located in Provo, UT. The development team comprised about 20% of the company workforce. I gained valuable experience in programming in Apex/VIsualForce, Salesforce.com's proprietary language.Just like has been said in other reviews (and look at how many people found helpful rather than the fake reviews marketing and HR posted), the recruiters bait you with promises of ""opportunity"" and ""advancement"". This is only partially true, it only creates ""opportunity"" for you to advance within the company and get a few promotions to make your resume look good. Then you get out as soon as you can find a better job. Turn over at Insidesales.com is unbelievably high. If you perform, you will get promoted, and quickly. But these promotions come with very meager increases in salary. They are starting MBAs off in customer service at $12.00 and hour. After sIx months of that you get a big promotion to $14.00 an hour! The advancement and opportunity advertisement they hit you with is misleading. Although you can work your way up, when you finally get there the almighty CEO holds all the decision making to himself. You can't even get him to buy chairs for his employees without begging him for a year (still no chairs). People bring their own pens and chairs, and office supplies to work. This is a company with over 250 employees. The wall at the office have exposed studs and we all work in giant rows of IKEA desks. They attribute all this  to having a""scrappy"" culture, but come see for yourself, this place is a dump, it is a joke. The culture is toxic. Management does everything at the last minute and is completely disorganized. All power is held by the micromanaging CEO and his lackeys. Projects, purchases, anything waits on the CEOs desk while he goes on vacation or walks  more... around micromanaging every faucet of the company.I worked for the administration. So I had a lot of contact with these guys. They are all complete egomaniacs, except for perhaps the CMO, he at least has some credentials and he has direction for the company. Never in my life have I felt this way about a company or a job, I love my current position and get paid double. I also have liked or loved working in every other job I've ever had, but not this one.If you can't find a job, you can probably survive here long enough to get a little star on your resume, but then get the heck out.  lessI enjoy working for this company, they see hard workers and reward us for the hard work we put in! Environment is a blast! The CEO throws great parties to show his appreciation as well as regular raises! The president is a brilliant teacher giving continued teaching to all of the staff. If you want a great career, Insidesales is the place to work!The company is all about learning new things. They constantly change and update the product, work space, management, and their employees. This has its ups and downs, but they want to succeed and they want their employees to succeed. It's a good way to enter the sales world with a technology twist and has a lot of potential. I like working here. Sometimes I think management wasn't the best but overall good.I work as BDR as InsideSales.com. A typical day at work included dialing through junk leads that the marketing department provided. Typically they were 2 to 3 years old, and the person did not even work the the company. Aside from the bad pay and subpar benefits sales reps are constantly being screwed out of commissions for any reason management determines fit. Management says no one has been there for very long because they are growing so fast, but it seems most people move onto better paying, less abusive jobs.The CEO is excellent at selling, and sells our product well to new hires and employees alike. This creates a strong sense of cohesion and community in the company.A typical day starts at 8:30 am (and runs till 5:30 pm). Get in, review what I worked on yesterday to reinitialize mental state, prepare for the day's work, and then go to the daily stand up meeting for the team, where we all sit and share our accomplishments of the past day and plans for the day. After that it's headphones on and get your code on until lunch. Feature finished, log it in the bug tracker, commit and push it to git, pat self on back, and move on. Lunch I take in the cafeteria, and it's delicious. After lunch, it's back to headphones on coding until the end of the day.I've learned a lot about software teams, and how we can work together and spread out the work to get things done. I've also learned how to build things quickly when important, and continued to refine my ability to clean up things that were written quickly.On the whole, management tends to be easy to work with and willing to trust employees to do what they were hired for - being awesome. The best advice I've found about management is - if you don't have fun during the interview, you won't have fun working with them. That said, the CEO typically conducts (or did) final interviews for new hires, and he is fun to be around.Coworkers tend to be skilled and competent. There are outliers on both sides, but overall I have been quite satisfied with the competence of my coworkers.The hardest part of the job is dealing with the gobs and piles  more... of software that we've written, interfacing always in interesting ways. The most enjoyable part is pleasing customers - internal or external, making something awesome is a really enjoyable experience, and one that I've had the pleasure of often here.  lessWant to start out making 24,000? Then work here. They say they are about opportunity, not compensation nor benefits. Try retiring, supporting your family, etc off of opportunity. They brag about how ""awesome"" they are and yet they reduced my salary because it was too high.Only place I have worked where I actually heard other employees talk about mutiny. Very high turnover.The company is extremely unorganized. Everything is last minute. And they take pride in it because they are ""scrappy.""Terrible place. Apply if you are desperate, and then don't stop applying to other places.",,San-Francisco,San Mateo,CA,2016-09-16T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/ca9347b2-43f9-4c66-be14-04f746eef91b?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

686,687.0,Senior Analytics Development Engineer,Teradata,3.9,82.0,"I am new to this company for 1 week, too early to judge this company.  Will let you know few months later.The Teradata company is a very mature company.A job that provides opportunity to learn, progress and contribute to the organization.A teamwork-oriented environment in a company that empowers employees to create and take initiatives.A job that my skills are utilized to the maximum and allows me to grow within the organization.I interned in Teradata during this summer and I felt very happy when I worked there because I got many nice colleagues and my manager and mentor are really nice.Teradata pays well and allows growth for their employees however Teradata is a company that has been around a long time and is not adapting well to change.Very fast pace company. generous with vacation days. Learned how to managed stress and to prioritize workload.  Good opportunities for advancement within the company.  Some departments need to some management to take management class to learn how to manage people.Worked on a newer cloud product and Management has zero vision.  Avoid if you want to save your sanity.  They have no visibility into cloud vs on-premise and are still, completely reliant on large physical hardware.Good job as a big data consultant. Work with other companies as clients and perform data analytics and data science. Work with teams of other data scientistsGood oprotunities to work in different industries with international teams. The best of breed product, the best technology, and so onThe company is good if you are okay to take challenges.Management Good.Co Workers GoodTypical Day at work - GoodGood Good Good Good Good Good GoodMy co-workers were always extremely competent and knowledge.  Teradata always encourages the consultants to maintain their skillsets and encourages great performance.Horrible company.  Ran like the old NCR company.  In real financial trouble.  Find work elsewhere.  Management is out of touch with the changes in the industry.  Very old school company.Teradata is a good company to work for. With the pre-sale announcement that they were going to sell off their marketing applications divisions, many sales motions came to a halt. Hopefully, the new owners will take the old Aprimo products in a good direction.There was a nice laid back IT officevibe. If you did your work well and showed up to work on time, there was a decent amount of flexibility. The company recently has experienced a reduction in force with lots of uncertainty ahead. Top level execs have received multimillion dollar bonuses/pay outs meanwhile throngs of low level employees even with years of service will receive paltry in comparison severance packages. I wouldn't recommend pursuing a position here during this transitionary time.Need upward mobility for senior security architects.  Co-workers are close knit team willing to share experience and problem solving.Teradata is wonderful place to work with appropriate Job Work and life balance.overall job culture is best in industryI had a great experience working over there and people over there are very friendly and polite,the working atmosphere was awesomeGreat work life balance; Managers are very accommodating. need more diversity. The most enjoyable part is travelling to different states of the country.Engaging work with lots of opportunities to learn new skills. Employees are friendly and easy to work with. Enjoyable atmosphere.I was lucky.  At the right place at the right time.  My experience at Teradata was nothing shot of a great American story.  My experience demonstrates what can happen when a company looks at an individuals skills from a personal prespective and evaluates what that person could accomplish when given the proper opportunites.Enjoyed the people I worked for and with.  Typical business with good and not so good situations you deal with over 25 years.Most of the employees at Teradata did not have the appropriate computer educations to be working for this company.  It seemed as if they hired MBAs and tried to turn them into Technical Consultants or Watchdogs;  Upper management seemed OK, middle management was unprofessional to say the least and in my opinion a great reason for the downfall of this company.  There was ZERO logical reason for this downfall other than recruiting people with appropriate educational backgrounds and getting rid of DEAD WOOD long ago.It was an honor to work for this company.  Unfortunately, the place is ridden with unqualified employees who know nothing about computers and do not have any genuine interest in Teradatas products.  Managers were more like just money/recruiter people.","5,001 to 10,000",San-Francisco,San Carlos,CA,2016-09-16T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/37989609-3096-4c83-a678-d8ec8854eb29?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=33,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
