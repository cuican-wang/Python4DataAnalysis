168,169.0,Product Data Scientist,Tile,3.3,7.0,"I would get to interact with employees and customers would get to strategize for the high theft areas of the store would have to watch cash registers to make sure there is no theft.Learned a lot about setting tile.  My boss was a good teacher however, there was not much room for growth.  I was an apprentice for a little over two years and didn't advance any further than that,i felt as though i was being kept an apprentice because it was to hard for my boss to train a new one.Well currently I am a student at Portland Community College studying Medical Assisting. I haven't gotten into the program as of yet because I am still taking my general classes to get into the program.A typical day at work includes answering phones, making sure paperwork is accurate and filed properly. I've learned how to use MS Excel,and MS Office. The company is very small, the management consist of one person. He's very organized and well grounded, knows what he wants in life and strives to reach his goals.There is only one other person in the office with me, and a few men working with the boss.I think the hardest part of the job is that there's just not enough business during the day that by the lunch time, there's literally nothing else to do. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I actually have a job, and the fact that I'm developing a different type of skill rather than just customer service.operating forklift moving pallets of material, matching material coming in to what suppose to be there and making sure it get annotated. learned a lot about the logistics part and how important logistics is in the world.the hardest part of the job is working in a cold warehouse with no heat in the winter and no A/C in the summer. Working condition.Overall this job was good to learn a bit of everything. Management, inventory, warehouse, sales.I really enjoyed my time at Tile, marble and Granite works. My co-workers and i got along great.",,San-Francisco,San Mateo,CA,2016-10-18T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/7dd97c24-cee2-4263-80f7-5b394481cc5c?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
