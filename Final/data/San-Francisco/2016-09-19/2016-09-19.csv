128,129.0,Data Scientist,TaskRabbit,4.3,9.0,"Overall I have had a good experience with Taskrabbit. I love the variety of experiences it has given me. I have enjoyed interacting with clients all over the bay area from businesses to right inside peoples homes doing a little life with them, helping them. The clients are the best part of my job there. The struggle is that there are some seriously slow seasons so it has not been a sustainable position for myself. I think its a great job for extra cash for students, persons with disabilities, teachers on breaks, and anyone who would like some extra work on the weekends. The hardest part of the job is the instability of the market for work. My most enjoyable part was just getting to know the great people and businesses I have had the pleasure to get to know in the process of serving them.A typical day was meeting new people and a lot of learning on the job. The hours are great because it is all up to you, but if you do not work enough you will not make money. I learned a lot I don't think you can match the experience of working freelance work with a place like TaskRabbit. Every job had new challenges with individual pros and cons. Management was great they handled any situation and work with you. The hardest part of the job was not having steady work at times but if you had steady work you had good money.So many interesting tasks to work on as a Taskrunner. There are lots of opportunities to learn and grow in your craft. Every Taskrunner you work with is extremely passionate. Awesome executive team who is very open and transparent. Amazing perks and benefits, lots of fun events, TaskRabbit really makes sure that you're happy to be there.great job if you have kids. Discount on all store items. The funnest part is being around all the toys all the time. Even if your an adult its still cool.TaskRabbit is yet another labor app such as Uber or Lyft which takes advantage of all of the available loopholes in the labor laws in order to maximize their own profits while doing nothing to protect or support their workers.New age working. Its amazing. I thought I was stuck doing home care for ever. It really is a wonderful job. It so great to work with so many different people and going different places My clients enjoy my works as much as I love to provide them with service.A typical day at work involves me reaching out to my clients, driving to the job site and performing the task at hand. Since it is freelance and I am an independent contractor, there is no direct management and co workers.Challenging but most certainly rewarding.I love helping other people, costumer service has been a great part of my life. I love meeting new and interesting people.      I like working on projects that can make me think outside the box and not the usual routine. Problem solving on small as well as big issues at hand are part of this job and that is what makes it interesting everyday.I love to help others while on the Job and taskrabbit has been the best experience doing so completing thier task.",,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-09-19T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/b65813a9-4c7b-4edf-a570-6e4d6fdaa5c9?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=32,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
259,260.0,GIS Analyst On-Call Bay Area,ICF International,3.4,237.0,"training provided was exceptional, some management very knowledgeable, environment clean and organized, some company morale, pay should increase for the jobReading other reviews of this company indicate to me that it depends on what part of the country you work in as to whether it's a good place to work. In Martinsville, VA it was a rotten place to work. Management treated employees with very little respect, there were few advancement opportunities, and pay raises depended on who you knew and not what you knew. (it took me 4 1/2 years to get a pay raise of $1.00).You had to constantly be worried about being fired for insignificant reasons. It was a stressful place to work.There was a different set of rules and regulations for the Martinsville call center compared to the rest of the company. We got no holiday pay and only 1.54 hours of PTO time per month. Your schedule could be changed without notification or concern for how it might affect you. The work enviroment was decidedly hostile. Leaving this company was the best thing that could have happened to me.I worked full time hours for several months and was never offered full time benefits such as health insurance. There is a huge lack of communication between management and employees. I witnessed managers and supervisors disrespect and talk down to their employees and nothing was done about it.The worst place to work for. They do not value there employees at all. The pay is horrible. The do not offer pay raises but give you new titles and expect for you to be content and do it for the low pay. The supervisors are horrible!! There was only one decent sup in there. They don't know what they are doing. When you ask questions they make stuff up and when you show them they are wrong they still expect you to listen and do what they say. They contradict there selves a lot. Very hostile work environment. No benefits of perks of working with them. They constantly put you down. You can be an excellent performer and they will look you in your face and say. Now you need to perform higher. They recently had / training classes of 12 ppl and out of those two training classes there is probably 4 ppl still employed. I've never worked in a office were everyone hates the job and the managers. They don't allow u to speak to fellow colleagues. If they see you are getting close they separate you. You are not allowed to talk. I honestly could keep going on but I would be here for days.ICF is an industry leader in consulting. ICF provides excellent employee benefits and exciting job opportunities. With offices all over the world, ICF positions itself to be a global leader in consulting.Have you seen Office Space? It's kind of like that. You better get your billable hours in, but not too many to the same charge code, or you'll be hearing from someone... During the 2013 Government Shutdown, they made their employees use vacation and unpaid leave if they couldn't find work (which was most of us). Pretty much sums it up. Basically, all they care about is how billable you are, so there's absolutely zero office culture (until happy hour when people would bond over how awful it was), and their year-end raises were laughable. DO NOT WORK HERE if you can help it.-Provide good training-Nice Supervisors-Nice work environment-Work  load balance is good-Not enough salary -You can ask for work from home after you complete one year at ICF        but you cannot ask for Monday and Friday-No more opportunities to move aheadI spent 15 years at ICF in total. I left and came back...and left again.  If you are willing to work hard, you produce great results, and you're willing to take some chances, you can go far here. I and many, many people I worked with, built careers here with a lot of advancement over time. I could name 20 people who started out near the bottom and worked their way up to VP. ICF is known for having really smart people, so there is stiff competition to get choice assignments and stand out in the crowd. Salary increases are not always large, but if you stay the course and continue to deliver, you'll get promoted and the money will eventually follow. Plus, there are several focus areas and a ton of projects, so if you don't ask permission too much and just take on as much as you can handle, you can learn a whole lot about your favorite subject and management in general.1. Great coworkers2. Demanding schedule3. Managers need to be sensitive to employee needs4. Lack of guidance5. Poor communication from managersGreat place to work with good culture, smart people, strong passion. They also allow me to work from home. Unfortunately, they are too business-oriented and do not adequately support their staff with good benefits and salary increases.Senior management attention and leadership is outstanding.  Great benefits, co-workers, working environment.  Terrific opportunities to work on variety of projects and locations.Working in the accounting department of ICF has been insanely awful. Management seemingly has no idea what they want and care very little for employees under Director level. They continue to lie and let employees go saying that they need to downsize for financial reasons and yet will create new Director positions shortly afterwards. There is no advancement at all. They would rather hire outside the company than promote the people within. Raises are horrible. Fear and intimidation are used to ""encourage"" employees to do their jobs and more by my current manager. Despite eight people leaving because of her, they continue to keep a no nothing manager on board who has no government contracting experience who has managed to overwhelm and anger everyone she encounters.Very low annual pay increases (on average 1.5%). Autonomous work culture. Only great situation if you are at Principal or VP level...everyone else do not get pay raises.This is by far the worst job I have ever had. Training is very poor and when they put you on the phone they change their mind about what you can and can't say every 10 minutes. There is absolutely no consistency and management refuses to help you. One manager spends her time taking personal calls while the other one guesses at the answers. None of the phone numbers they provide as resources work and they are always asking you to do more with no additional benefits. There are no other job titles which means no where to move up . Supervisors refuse to take escalated calls and gossip about employees to other employees. They can't even provide a clear answer about included benefits due to being over budget,most likely from the ridiculous turn over rate. No training class makes it more than a few days,and new class is taught weekly and each time only 2 out of 12 makes it for more than a week. Worst of all management stifles your personality, They claim it's too ""flamboyant"". They don't want you to know your fellow coworkers but expect you to tell them all of your business. You can't even use your cell phone in the break room. They make up reasons to fire people and never provide a legitimate reason. They even broke contract with the temp company that recruited for them without letting them know.Their goal for employees : have no personality and take as many calls as possible without offering real assistance to customers.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!Working for this company one may feel like they are not part of the machine that keeps this company going. The culture within the company is ""do as you're told and do not go against the grain."" Entering work on a daily basis becomes a chore - basically coming to work to earn a paycheck and nothing more. Upper management consist of people who previously served in the military together and their attitude is to say ""yes"" to the site manager no matter what. Even though there is constant descension from the management team the workers on the floor make things better. There is no growth opportunity beyond team lead and unfortunately the pay has been cut drastically for any person the management team selects. If you are not a person to go with the flow and give a constant yes your time will be limited.I began my career at ICF 5 years ago and was an employee referral.  The company has grown by about 1500 employees since I began and has still maintained a strong culture.  I was hired as a senior individual contributor and have been promoted several times in the last 5 years.My review is the same as my previous review of the company. Management staff is very non-supportive of lower level employees. There is no room for advancement unless close with upper management (based on friendships).Established a new satellite office requiring the creation of many new relationships and having to determine what was supported by main office and what needed to be created for the new location. The expectation is you work to get your job done and this may require 60-80 hours or it may require 40. Your success is based on your role, the tasks at hand, and you ability to delegate and or manage the assigned tasks. ICF is forward thinking and involved in many of societies ""Hot Topics"" across government and social responsibility.Consistent, easy work for decent pay. Definitely keep to yourself and work hard and you could be promoted once ample time has passed.A typical day at work involved a good mix of project work and proposal development. I learned a great deal about consulting, project management, and the proposal process.Co-workers were great.Hardest part of the job was working remotely.Most enjoyable part of the job was traveling and working at a work site.ICF International provided an environment that promoted both professional and personal growth. Through ICF's mentor program, I was able to learn skills outside of my scope of work. This program was a major component in developing skills that resulted in promotions and pay increases.",,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-09-19T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/dafdb819-1fb5-45d9-a8a1-2c17a1a77f7b?mescoid=1500140001001&jobPosition=25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
