274,275.0,"Medical Science Liaison, Infectious Disease- Northern CA, OR, WA, HI",Johnson & Johnson,4.3,1700.0,"outstanding team atmosphereAll the tools to succeedteam helped each other succeedI enjoyed my time at J&J Basis to achieve surgical relationshipsExceptional benefits and compensation.    Great products.  Culture has changed over the years.   Legacy:  teamwork, management valued people's contributions, there was internal development of technical and leadership skills,  like family.  Current:  internally competitive, leaders figuring how to make themselves look good, ""what have you done for me lately"" mentality, very little loyalty,  have no problem cutting jobs or letting people go to bring in cheaper resources or obtain skills needed rather than development.Perhaps this is the way of the world everywhere.>Called on various departments within hospital accounts as well as clinics. Discussed clinical benefits and cost analysis which could potentially impact accounts positively.  >Learned the key clinical/fiscal factors my accounts desired and how to assist them in achieving these goals.>Management was a liaison between me and the company to help facilitate a positive outcome and achieve my accounts desired goals.  >Co-workers were useful as networking resources to show examples of successful implementation of ideas.  >Most challenging part of the job was securing complete buy-in from all departments.>Most enjoyable part was after securing the trust of key opinion leaders executing a win-win outcome for all parties.Great company that tries to value everyone including employees but cannot due to its need to produce to stockholders. They allow for advancement but very political. High quality product but streamlining to save money.Managements treat employee with respect.  Working hours are flexible. You can learn a lot while in the job. Co-workers are all nice and easy going. Very enjoyable working environment.Casual and positive culture. A company that truly cares about the patients and consumers they serve. Spans multiple business, sectors and locations making it possible to develop internally without leaving the company.too many realignmentsunwise upper management decisionspoor product pipelineletting go of good people via layoffsno real advancement opportunitiesGreat place to work.

Great training and development team.Excellent place to work. I would recommend anyone to Johnson and Johnson. Excellent pay, benefits , work life balance, job security, management advancement, etc.they has a lot of opportunities for temporary but too much positions available for get permanent job. Good employer great benefits for permanent people.Johnson & Johnson was a great company with good benefits.  I had good managers who were able to introduce me to pharmaceutical sales and learning the industry.Productive area with great benefits but not alot of room for advancement. Learned many skills while there and was a very stable source of work.Management supportive. Amazing people to work with. Good team work to achieving goals. A lot of training and development opportunities.I really enjoyed working at J&J for my first 3.5 years. Lately management has made changes to target certain talented people to leave which I feel is very unfair.The culture and work/life balance are by far the most attractive aspects of working at Johnson & Johnson.  Working in a fast paced environment for an industry-leading company has been great experience for my young, yet deep career.  What can be problematic is management's direction, view, or process in place that is sometimes challenging to revisit for improvements or enhancements.Productive environment, onsite benefits such as cafeteria, gym and store. And flexible hours but management tends to care only for themselves. Great co-workers. The hardest part of the job is there was not permanent seating; seating must be reserve via PC every couple days.It is a company led by a CREDO. Very dynamic.  The Leaders have an exceptional sense of management.  I enjoy my days giving my best to our customers.  My co-workers are very different, but we trust in the Diversity.  The company is very committed with the employees.  I had the opportunity to develop my professional and personal skills participating in many initiatives and activities.","10,000+",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-07-29T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/0cb84d4d-6961-46a9-af2b-8e66c6fa140a?mescoid=1900254001001&jobPosition=5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
