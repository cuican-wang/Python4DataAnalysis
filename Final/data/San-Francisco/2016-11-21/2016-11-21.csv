10,11.0,Senior Quality Control Associate - Chemist,Novartis,4.1,876.0,"Busy from start to end however I enjoy as I like to be busy. The people I work for and my colleagues are so much fun and I appreciate the opportunity to work with each one of them. I also love the Fiestas that Novartis through for Employees.•	Establish, maintain and develop strong relationships with customers and key decision makers within the practices;•	Implement current marketing strategies and initiatives;•	Manage the territory's assigned operating budget; ensuring timely expense management;•	Ensure all pricing and contracts are in-line and executed pursuant to company policy and procedures;•	Maintain accurate customer profiles and provide new customer data/sales data into company database; and•	Seamlessly communicate with the corporate sales team and account managers.High Tech , too mulch overtime ,very little appreciation, Management constantly shiftimg, 12 supervisors in ten years ,half of them come in and try to make a name for themselves. High integrity , people constantly getting fired, great 41k.Great work/life balance.Great atmosphere, campus and decent pay.I would absolutely come back to work again.  Excellent internal growth.Good company moral.I worked with the legal team.  I was given assignments that were tedious and repetitive.  I knew that no one else wanted to do this type of work, so because I love this type of work, it was a fun job.great company. had a good career run with them. great training and salary plus compensation. worked there for 14+ years and progressed in my career. launched  several great drugs and had great sales success.Wonderful and positive atmosphere with great people who enjoy coming to work on a daily basis, made this an incredible place to work. Family oriented environment.a good company, friendly work environment, career training opportunities. Decent benefits, work/life balance is OK.Traditional big pharma company which allows for numerous job opportunities to top performers. It also allows for a work environment of steady changes. The bad is generally less pay then the smaller companies as well as the small fish in big ocean feel.Many changes with moving to a BPO offshoring delivery for Fianance Procurement and HR.  Much transition but company trying to keep opportunities available and work life rewardingThis is a great company.  There's a lot of room for growth.  All that I have learned has been beneficial in other jobs I have had in my career in Manufacturing Production Department.As a Senior Lead Administative Assistant to the Group, I was responsible for the group of Administrative Assistant to the Department.  We use to meet once a month to discuss different aspects of their jobs.Depends on what group you are in.  Some understand the current culture and provide opportunities for growth, but others do not.  It can be really slow to get ideas moving forward if at all.I started with Sandoz and continued through to the evolution of Novartis, and truly enjoyed launching a new product every 18 months in the early days. Great training and support structure.Thrive in a collaborative setting and dynamic work environment.  Appreciate having that environment at Novartis, with many development opportunities available.I had a large territory, so there was no work life balance.Had several good managers that were realists.  Understood the territory and would do what they could to help me succeed.Hardest part of the job was overnights.  Home for 2 weeks, on the road for 2 weeks each month.What made the job enjoyable were the success stories from the physicians that I called on when they would tell me that my drug changed somebody's life for the better.High demanding job and still able to maintain a life/ work family balance. Comrade, relationships and ability to work together on projects keeps the workplace interesting.Interesting work; excellent pay and benefits; diverse work; currently tight expense management; diverse suite of products; focused on being an employer of choiceNovartis is a very successful company which is mainly attributed to its emphasis on innovation, research and development, retaining top talent as well as focus on safety and quality. The company is extremely focused on delivering results and the place can be intense sometimes. However if one is comfortable under pressure and is geographically mobile, the opportunities for growth are ample.Good market level compensation. 4 major layoffs over past 6 years. no promotions. Lots of great people.At the end personal experience depends on manager and department. I was lucky one.Micromanagement at its worst.  You can never trust anyone here because they will stab you in the back for personal gain.  Managers are bullies and know how to dictate only.","10,000+",San-Francisco,San Carlos,CA,2016-11-21T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/senior-quality-control-associate-chemist-job-san-carlos-ca-us-176492976.aspx?mescoid=1900306001001&jobPosition=6,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
11,12.0,SAS Programmer,Apex Systems,3.8,313.0,"Boston Medical Center was a great company to work for. Apex systems failed to properly contact me when my contract ended.I was very pleased with this service.   They landed me a job that I enjoyed and the pay was great.  The associate was really great.  He called often to check on me and make sure things were going wellMy contract with Apex was very productive. The company gave good instruction on how to complete your daily job tasks. My co-workers and I got along with each other very well, we supported each other. The job was not hard at all, matter of fact it was a very easy job. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing so many cities and States.After fourteen years of military service all I can say is that it was worth it.  They really take care of their soldiers and their families.  It is really a family oriented military now.  better than it was beforeCo-workers were amazing people to work with.  The company itself doesn't value it's employees unless the employee is making money for them.  They only want metrics.They made the contracting process easy.  Once I started working for the contracted company I didn't have much interaction with Apex.  Didn't have to worry about much, Apex handled everything.Working for Apex is an awesome experience. Having representation onsite at the clients location is an added value. They have exceptional training courses and provide a pleasurable work experience.Computer day varies depending on the level or issue that has to be taken care of with the customer. Some days where slow but mostly busy all the time.The workplace is nice. A good mix of stressful and calmness. The other contractors are also very enjoyable which shows a good hiring process.They don't have the abitly to get you in a job full time and are not ganentee a place with the employer they put you with.They are contract company so when your contact is up you are done.I enjoyed working for Apex. Again this is a recruiting outfit and the interaction day to day is limited.  They paid adequately and the recruiters were friendly.This company pays a great compensation for both hours and mileage. They are a contract service, so the down fall is when your contract is over, you have no more work, unless there is another company needing you in your area. I was sadden when my contract was over, the hardest part was I was doing computer work for State Farm, and had to drive all over Louisiana.I got injured on the job!!!!! and got the run around lied to !!!!! They do not care about you if you get hurt they just fire you and ignore phone calls and emais .  Very unprofessional would not recommended working for themA decent company to work for.  Traveling is about 75% of the time.  There were many times when no work was available.  Scheduling can be difficult as it is through the military.this place please stay away from them they lie and blackball everyone and their pay sucks you work in a unhealthy work environmentWork in aggressive environment to thoroughly test the application. Able to learn new software and procedures. Apex presented opportunity with growth potential.Nice company to work for, good and understanding management, they value employees and try all possible best to make sure you're  happy with your job•	Break / Fix Windows XP /7 operating system repair services•	Track issues through Vantive & Remedy ticket system•	Reimage of PC•	Blackberry Setup & Configuration •	Configuration via Lotus Notes, Outlook Setup•	Used Active Directory to change passwords and add software to client's account•	Deployment and Installation (Laptops and Desktops)You still experience college life while slowly transitioning into a semi-professional environment. Can be very cliquish but still a fun place to work.""They"" say you will be reimbursed for your expenses within 2 weeks. Not my experience, More like 3 weeks and you better make sure before you order that the restaurant has a point of sale machine that prints itemized receipts, has a good ribbon in the machine and you can get a good scan of the receipt. Really? No handwritten receipts are acceptable. So, local money to restaurants without these things is not reimbursable.This is on a $3+ BILLION HP contract with the Navy. Oh and BTW. They only pay 8 hours of travel each way so if they send you across the country and it takes 12 hours, you will be paid for 8.Depending on your HP supervisor, you will get 8 hours if you get their numbers for the day or you will get the hours you worked. Efficiency is not rewarded on a random supervisor basis.Worked at Dell as contract employee.  Poor hours, weekends and benefits were nearly non existent.Dell was hard to work with because of the Dell culture and metrics involved.  Call center work.","1,001 to 5,000",San-Francisco,Oakland,CA,2016-11-21T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/sas-programmer-job-oakland-ca-us-176517978.aspx?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
