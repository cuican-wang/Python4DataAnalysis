103,104.0,Firmware Data Scientist,Fitbit,4.1,8.0,"Fun office and nice people. Fast paced and exciting. Company is growing and processes aren't always in place. Management is establishing itself and becoming more like a publicly traded company.Great place to work. The people are wonderful. Great Perks. However, management can be a bit stressful. Overall, a great place to work.Not a good cultural fit.  The hardest part of the job are the hours worked.  Expected 24x7 including weekends.  Receive calls as late as 11:45 pm to address last minute needs.Fitbit is a victim of their own success.  They are hiring at it is getting crowded.  The work environment is youthful and vibrant.I absoultely addored working at such a progressive company.  The co-founders are creative, quiet, intelligent,friendly people.

104,105.0,Data Scientist,Yelp,3.8,130.0,"Too much time is spent attending to incidents or working around incidents from other teams. Many managers are new/first-time managers and lack the necessary skills to be effective at their jobs while others are handi-capped by the company's culture of super hands off management. Morale is generally poor-whatevs.Great company that sells a great product, but there's not many interesting positions to move up from entry-level.  Extensive sales training, and excellent benefits.Each day consists of a high volume of cold calls and emails sent out to SMB owners. Management varied, with some managers just one year out of the account executive role. Issues with that were panic when things weren't going well.Yelp is a great company. Employees are treated well with a fully stocked kitchen for breakfast and lunch, great health benefits, and great people. The pay is definitely on the lower side. The most negative aspect was the job itself. The day to day is strictly cold calling businesses to sell the advertising program. It can be very monotonous. Also many of the business owners are busy and do not want to speak to you. It's a hard job to find enjoyment in.I spent almost 2 years at Yelp. It's a rollercoaster. Full of great colleagues, awesome mentors, and a challenging job (but once you get the hang of it you'll pitch-on-the-fly and feel like a boss).You are responsible for the full sales cycle. From introduction to close. You will have difficult conversations about selling them Yelp ads with SMB prospects. It's challenging, but what you will also have a team, an organization, readily available for you to learn and execute with.I owe everything I know about my profession to this opportunity I got here.Thanks Yelp! :)Yelp is pretty cool.I would recommend it to someone if there was a job opening they were into.Great free snacks. Not so great compared to other companies in the area, but definitely above average. Beer! I've never liked hanging out at an office after hours before. I do that somewhat regularly here.Flexible Hours with the option to work from home when necessary.Sweet health benefits and they're pretty generous with stock even for us lowly user ops workers.Average good-ish time off/sick timeOverall company good about providing important updatesUnfortunately none of this is enough to make up for the crushing boredom that eventually sets in with moderating content. They tell you straight up when you start not to really expect this to go anywhere. It's kinda sad since we have a lot of talented, intelligent people on the team wasting their smarts. I can feel myself getting dumber from all the terrible punctuation and block paragraphs that I have to read all day long. Go on though, do it a year or two and then move along. It's a great job as one of your first out of college. You don't have to wear real clothes or show up at a specific time and that's all real real nice.""Fun"" environment for the most part. Though in our particular department there is a lot of forced fun that really gets irritating for a cynic like me. It's kinda silly since they actually advertise the position as being for introverts. It's a little tone deaf. Like the time they had us spin some Harry Potter sorting hat for assigned seats at lunch. Yep... actual adults arranged that forced  more... mingling situation with a group full of introverts. They also recently instituted music on Friday afternoons and it is the worst. There are a lot of management things that make the job really stressful. But I think I mostly just get petty and mad because I am so so bored. You'll have fun for a while doing this job probably. But it really does show you a bad side of humanity. There are some awful opinions that I was not used to coming across. That can be tough. But it's nothing awful like if you were moderating beheadings content for that popular video upload website.  less70+ outbound cold calls daily to SMB's in a assigned territory. Setting 15-20 minute appointments with clients to discuss and pitch the Yelp platform. These BO's already have Yelp pages that most likely have traffic to that listing. Pitch and close the prospects. Get to quota, make some decent cash. However, you must follow the process and be a quick learner. It's easy to fall into habits and not grind it out. Stand up. Take each call with a clean slate, but don't be afraid to mess up and quickly try out a new method again.  Yelp can be a great place for a couple years, but it's a daily grind and not for the weak minded.Great company to work for with a startup culture. Interacted with my peer on a daily basis to create a strategy to bring in sales for the online food ordering application.Similar to plenty of other reviews I have read, tons of kids fresh out of college who have no idea that there ARE better options out there. They lure you in with all the free food and music and games and stuff but dont tell you about the cold calling and if you dont hit these metrics on the head then you will be shown the door. Managers may ""act"" like they care about you or your home life but at the end of the day you are just a number. training structure is way out of order. They throw you to the wolves the second week on the job and then give you information in a training 2-3 weeks later that would have increased your odds of getting a appointment/sale. Lots of tasks to accomplish on a daily basis but not enough time to complete them all and then you are hit with the no excuses card when you are not pulling your weight. On the flip side, fantastic place to work, free food all day, game rooms and music, lots of stuff nearby.Great for younger kids with no responsibilities!!One of my favorite parts about my work day is that each day is unpredictable. I never know who I am going to talk to and as a result, I get to learn about so many unique and interesting businesses, people and meet a lot of entrepreneurs that educate me, too.The best perk is definitely the people and culture… and I suppose our brand new office with shuffleboard, ping pong and Rock Band. But truly, I get to work side by side with amazing, talented people every day.Yelp is a fun place to work with a youthful environment.  Through a combination of hard work and getting a good territory you have an opportunity to be very successful.No one likes cold-calling, but that's what you're going to be doing every day. Yes, you get the freedom to churn the whole sales process from open calling to closing, but managing that while handling objections is a tough sell. Co-workers are friendly, and management could be held to another standard. Hard to differentiate managers as friend or micromanaging sticklers, because people move up quick in this job. It can be very emotionally draining and dry, so mentality is everything in this job.I am given tools to be my own boss and impact my own small business. I am also able to change businesses in a positive light. Every work day was an extremely exciting opportunity.I used Yelp and the opportunities they had to further my experience in an office setting. Although the floor was noisy, we got a lot of work done!This company is laid back and very little stress as far as the Eat24 department goes. I mean super laid back...people were drinking on they're shift, smoking pot on lunch and a fist fight erupted one day. The floor managers show favoritism to the people in they're clique. If your looking for a career this is not the place to advance. If your fresh out of high school and just looking to pay your phone bill and money to blow on random stuff this place is your ideal job. The pay is minimum wage. In my personal experience it was not a company that I could advance in because there were no core values set by the employer and no advancement opportunities to further my career within the company. It does though have fully stocked kitches with every drink and snack you can imagine and the 7th floor has baristas that serve several different beverages for free along with fully stocked kitchen to make your own sandwiches. Very beautiful building in the financial/shopping district.I remembered being excited for the chance to find a job at ""Yelp"" in the heart of downtown San Francisco. Boy did I delude myself, Firstly this company (Yelp EAT24) feels so separate from Yelp its insane. I receive questions about Yelp that I have no idea how to answer since its a separate entity. Secondly I work in a glorified call center, it might have a fancy title and ""cool benefits"" like beer on tap, and free snacks, but all I do daily is apologize to people and tell them their food is on the way. Plus I work nights so they ""perks"" don't apply to me as I never have the chance to get beer. It so sad that someone with a college degree and three majors cannot find a better job and that HR cannot find a better fit for me. Lastly, and the most disheartening part is I was told it would be about a year to transfer to Yelp proper. Are you serious??? I have to take a year of working from 3 PM to 11:30 PM while simultaneously giving up my nights and weekends for a little over minimum wage. I applaud anyone that has lasted in this position because I feel myself dying a little more inside every time I clock in to start working.I applied to intern at Yelp and they ruined my summer. They kept me waiting for two whopping months and now it really made me mad. They have no respect towards low income students who are trying to support a family. The people who are in charge of HR need to be clear and not act childish when picking who should get an intern position. Good thing is that their office is laid back and happy.The fun atmosphere with music, ping pong and common chatting with other employees has made Yelps culture fun. The managers are super hands on in trying to help out to ensure the growth of each employee.start at 730 get yelled at by manager. Start cold calling, anytime you get up you get yelled at by manager to get back on phone. Make to many calls get yelled at again, make to little yelled at. Micromanaged and were put on kid teams (my team name was the queen bees).This is my first sale job and overall experience has been positive.You will go into training and be expected to learn and implement feedback. With each month that goes by the expectations will go up. It will seem fun in the beginning with the games, free coffee, open cafeteria, and a keg for after hours but it gets old and you just want to go home and relax. You will dial 70 + call a day and be expected to hit 2.50 hours talk time. The job can be high stress at times and if you close a deal directors, managers, and other people will cheer your wins. At times if your not closing it can feel disappointing and you feel forgotten and question if this is the job for you. Going into this job you have to have a thick skin, implement feedback, work hard, adjust to things that might not go your way because this is sales.Typical day is about 9-10 hours with an hour lunch break. If you want to be successful you have to put some extra time into the job. Managers are great and the sales curriculum is top notch. Honestly love the company, but cold calling 65+ times a day can become taxing.","1,001 to 5,000",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-10-27T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/daf4efc5-884d-47fa-ad10-52ef719d88a7?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The culture is incredible and although competitive, everyone collaborates to provide the best possible service. Everything is for the clients and First Republic truly takes fantastic care of their clients.Great opportunities to make a lot, great compensation.

I hit a home run with FRB landing my dream job.  Wonderful job in the Office of General Counsel.  Wonderful co-workers.  Wonderful culture.  Wonderful work/life balance. Awesome FRB employee referral program.If you need a good-paying job and don't mind sitting at a desk all day, this job is just fine. The company, however, asks for stressful scheduling and undervalues most employees.First Republic isn't a bank. Its more like a company that treats you like family. You are not a account number, but a face. Impressively, the banker know not only you, but you family, your dog, and your hobbies.Amazing company ethics, and such a great café. The food was awesome and an amazing price! Management of my particular team didn't really hold people accountable for the job they were doing. Many things flew by the manager. I would definitely  recommend this as a place to get a great start for your career.A typical day at work was preparing lunch for the customers. I learned how to make different foods many ways. The co-workers was very helpful and friendly.Management under pays and expects excellent work from each individual. Broken Promises and bad work life balance. They hire contract workers to do all the work with little pay and tell you they will hire you on as permanent but never get to it. They have a hiring freeze every other month which causes implications with employment. Too much work and not enough help.Lot of opportunities to learn and grow.Management is not easily accessible.More work pressure.Amazing colleagues.Great work culture and Good work life balance.First Republic banks keeps up with newer technologies.Awesome subsidized food cafeteria.Fun work environment with supportive managers.

Good management team; listen to your suggestions to make work more efficient.Super fun place to work with.  Everyone always do 110% to achieve whatever is best for the clients which retain high  customer satisfaction.I worked for FRB 6 + years. Terrible management, It is quite disappointing. I love the culture and customer service FRB is carrying however I will never work for them anymore!They have a great executive management team, the office environment was very high end.Be yourself. Have a conservation with the interviewer and a questions and answers meeting.i love my job duties but overwhelmed with emails and other duties. one person can't finish all the work. I can never get out the building on time. No social life with co workers.Employees were friendly, environment was not pushy, while working here I got the chance to be one of the first to work on their new in-house customer data system called FlightPathWorking at FRB is like being a bird in a golden cage.Great place to work if you want to stay at one location and do the same day after day and not move up.I learned a tremendous amount about trust accounts and actively managed accounts.  This position allowed me to analyze investments from many different angles.A great place to work.  The company does a great job of blending culture and work.
