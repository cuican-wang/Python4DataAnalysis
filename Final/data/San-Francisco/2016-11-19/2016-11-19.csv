87,88.0,"Instructor, Sr. Data Scientist",Galvanize,5.0,2.0,"Great place to learn data science.  The experience is like drinking from a fire hose, so be prepared.  You will learn tons, and most of the time feel like you don't know anything.  Then you have your first interview and realize that you actually know a lot.Typical day at work is relaxed and productive, setting up for events was fun. I learned a lot about how events are run behind the scenes. The management was awesome, very hands off and no micro-managing, super relaxed and made it easy to be motivated. The co-workers are also great; drama-free environment.
