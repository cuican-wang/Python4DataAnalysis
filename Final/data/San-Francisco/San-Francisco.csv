0,1.0,"Data Scientist - growth, marketing research - San Fran!",CyberCoders,3.5,18.0,"As a selection representative you figure out how to construct your business starting with no outside help. You buckle down putting in 10-12 hour days, yet it will pay off in the event that you keep at it. Try not to enter this occupation supposing you can bear to be lethargic else you WILL fizzle. Great commission setup is fine for a few people however unquestionably not everybody. Youthful air and positive vibes all around.Fun culture and work environmentGreat money opportunityGreat growth opportunityUnlimited SnacksAbility to work remoteGreat company partiesCyberCoders is a solid culture company. The people and most management are very strong and are willing to assist in any way possible. It is not a 9 to 5 so you definitely need to be ready to work long hours to be successful.Sink or Swim.  Management is very hands off, even if you do well you can get swept in layoffs.  Company is not going in the right direction and their approach is very bullish.  Plenty of potential clients/candidates would not work with me due to the ""stigma"" of working with Cybercoders.  It is truly a double edged sword.allstate is a fortune 100 company that is a great experience to gain professionalism and experience. Really fun coworkersAs a recruiter you learn to build your business from scratch. You work hard putting in 10-12 hour days, but it will pay off if you keep at it. Do not enter this job thinking you can afford to be lazy else you WILL fail. 100% commission setup is fine for some people but definitely not everyone. Young atmosphere and positive vibes all around.I managed a database of clients and candidates. I did all my own business development by cold calls, emails, linkedin inmails and referrals. I sourced for candidates and matched them with my client staffing needs. Negotiated pay and bill rates and coordinated interviews and placementsCyberCoders is becoming a giant staffing firm the industry - and rightfully so! They are surrounded with so much talent from everyone in the organization.Great place to work at! Company culture is great. Love the people and atmosphere.Like the saying goes""work hard play harder""!!CyberCoders is very unprofessional.Money hoardersthey will call you all the time just to make the quotaA good supportive company and they provide pay reflective of the level of experience of the candidate.I worked for Cybercoders for about 4-months. I had heard many good things about them over the years so I was excited to be offered a position to join the team. Unfortunately, from the day I started I saw a lot of red flags that reminded me a lot of another large, international recruiting firm (RHI) where I previously worked. CC has a churn and burn environment and they micromanage you - pulling up reports throughout the day on your activity. They have a TON of meetings - team meetings, company wide meetings, individual meetings - EVERY WEEK! Over the 4 months I was there people quit or were being fired practically every week. The 3 new people on my team that started the same day as I did, were gone within 4 months. Yes, they did have cool quarterly sales party's at an ocean front resort in Orange County. And a summer party that was a blast! But aside from that, the work environment was tedious. You had to achieve a certain # of ""CA's"" per week (Cyber Actions) that you earn by securing a new job order from a client, submitting candidates for open jobs and scheduling in-person interviews between your candidate and client. If you don't meet the required number of CA's, you must attend what I referred to as a ""dunce or disciplinary"" training session for each week you missed the mark...driving 1.5 to 2 hours from their Playa Vista location to Irvine for a 45 minute meeting. Basically, taking up your entire day of productivity when the reason you're having to attend this meeting in the first place is because of what they deem your lack of productivity. Unfortunately,  more... if you have several job orders open with different clients for the same type of position, the candidates you submit only counts for 1 CA, even if you submit the same candidate to 5 different clients. So you're constantly scrambling to meet your CA numbers. A lot of people found ways to trick the system into thinking they earned CA's in order to avoid disciplinary action. WE ARE THERE TO WORK, not to surf the net or mess around so treating us like children is unnecessary.I placed four full time placements within the first 4 months I was there at a profit of almost $100k for the company, but when I called in sick one day when I was supposed to attend one of these disciplinary meetings in Irvine, I was called that very morning and told ""this isn't working out"". Yes, I was fired. I was shocked and surprised. I reminded my manager that we had just met a few days prior and he said I was doing well and making good progress. I could tell he was annoyed I had called in sick rather than drive to Irvine. He just repeated himself ""this isn't working out"". I do not recommend Cybercoders to fellow recruiters. It's a cut throat, micromanaging, churn and burn environment. Plus, you're on a draw, so you may as well just work as an independent recruiter rather than share your profits with the company because you're responsible for 100% of your own salary anyway.  lessOver the years I've seen many many jobs from Cybercoders for which I felt I was well qualified, but have never landed so much as a phone screen when applying through them.Cybercoders reason for being is to insert themselves between you and any prospective employers and extort money from those who might find you a promising candidate. Your interest or potential suitability for a job makes no difference to them, your resume won't leave their computers unless they think they can get a commission out of it. It takes more legwork, but try to filter out Cybercoder ads, target job searches to only return actual employer generated positions and send them your resume directly. You won't get every job you apply for, but at least you don't have to meet some anonymous recruiter's commission checklist before employers see your resume.One word Resume Farmers! Read many reviews were people were contacted by their 'recruiters"", recommended the candidate apply for the job via their link and never to be heard from again.Excellent recruiting environment.  Collaborative, excellent management with top-notch tools.CyberCoders is the leader in full-time technology staffing nationwide for a reason.   You are working with real people working with some of the worlds best companies providing life changing opportunities that help thousands of people grow their careers and income every year.  I read one review that said we were a Spammer and owned by Experian?  Not true.  We are not owned by Experian and your personal information isn't shared with any agency.  Our job requires many phone calls and many emails to insure we reach our targeted audience, but we are no more a spammer than Groupon or Travelzoo when you ask to receive exciting updates that match your specific interests. If you have applied for jobs and are not getting a response, there is no interview request.  You could still be a very good candidate, so followup with us and we'll do our best to make a match.  Hiring managers are very busy and find it hard to reply to every resume, so some go without a response unfortunately.  Internally, all employees of CyberCoders are treated very well with generous compensation packages as well as many in house treats and fun catered events.  The culture is fun and casual, providing recruiters with unmatched marketing and software tools to reach thousands of new passive talent everyday.Nothing feels better than helping someone find a new position and helping a trusted client fill an important need all at the same time.  Ultimately, recruiters are your friends and can help you.  Try us!After swearing myself of not returning to the staffing agency world, CyberCoders came along and completely changed my mind. Their approach and constant dedication on investment to staying ahead of the curve with regards to their technology and how they approach the best way to service both their clients and candidates has given me a place that I'm very happy to say I work for.There is plenty of opportunity for growth and the organization is not flat at all. The company as a whole is on a pretty exciting growth path as well.",,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-12-01T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/data-scientist-growth-marketing-research-san-fran!-job-san-francisco-ca-us-176931443.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

2,3.0,Data Scientist,The Judge Group,3.4,82.0,"The recruiter always called me back whenever i had any questions during the time of the contractTypical day at work was very much unsatisfying.I learned that you can't trust this organization at all.Management treats you like a dog!Co workers are back stabbers.Hardest part of the job was never being thanked for all the hard work you do.Can't say I enjoyed working for this company at all!!!a lot of turn around not too much job security, hardest part of the job is to build your client data base. management lacked a bitGreat company, great people to work with. There is a ton of opportunity to earn a good living if you work hard and dedicate yourself. There is a great work life balance and a work hard play hard culture. Very good opportunity for people who want to learn how to be a recruiter and do it well. Very strong support system and grade A training program. This company will provide you with all the tools to be successful.I only worked for Judge briefly. I started in the month of January and by resigned by May. I quickly realized how much I despised this place. By February I began looking for a new job. The office I worked in was very tiny (the size of a small closet). I worked with 3 other people in this closet. The girls I worked with were very mean and extremely rude. They would talk about you the second you walked out of a room and would stop the moment you returned. They were fake nice when you would try to talk to them. I never in my life felt so alone and excluded. I made every attempt to get along with them but they simply wouldn’t have it. I was often pulled into HR to discuss my work attire. There was a strict dress code there but only for certain people. I was in trouble for wearing black suede boots and a military style jacket yet my coworker was permitted to wear a denim jacket and cowboy boots. A lot of the women there would also wear micro miniskirts where I could see more than I wanted to yet my dresses were too short according to HR cause they didn’t cover my knees. The place was very “clicky”. It was like being back in High School. You were either a popular kid or a nerd. I tried to fit in but was pushed out every time I tried. It was very hurtful. I couldn’t get out of there fast enough! And if you like to have time off from work, forget about it! This company does not allow anyone to take unpaid time off and the accrual rate of time off is a joke. Your 1st year you get 3 days! Also, the benefits are probably some of the worst I have ever seen. For a large company,  more... they have horrible health benefits. You will literally be working there for just benefits but never get to use them because the deductibles are so high.  lessLoved the position I was in and really enjoyed working with the group of people I was with.  I learned quite a bit regarding Healthcare that I hope to use in the future.  I was very disappointed when I was told that the company I was working with did not want to keep me on past my 6 month contract date after I was pretty much convinced that I would be kept on through the next contract with the same company.I would definitely recommend this company for the college graduate or anyone who is in the market of looking for a job. They look to fit you with the best job to fit your experience.Onsite management needs improvement, high turnover in leadership resulting in job security for potential growth with job siteThis office has a great work environment! Everyone is wonderful and the director is the best. It is best to be confident in what you say and be prepared to make a lot of phone calls. You must definitely enjoy talking to people to succeed here!Good communication, responsive to employee inquiries, fair pay. Managers respond to inquiries concerning, job assignments, hours of work and pay issuesGood company to work for.  I like the fact that they pay weekly.  The beginning pay process I think may need some attention, and the fact that you have to track time in the assigned company's system, and also in Judge's system is a bit cumbersome and always involves coordination, etc.good first job out of college. not a lot of room for growth though. hours are long but you can make money at this job if you work hard. its a lot of luck so you need to be resilient.no work life balance and compensation is low for the amount of stress and hours you have to put in. Every day you have to come in and work on the same jobs over and over. Recently, they decided to stop using LinkedIn and Indeed as well, making recruiters lives harder.Worked from home on Insurance company's national project.  LOVED being a telenurse.The Judge Group was wonderful to work with -  Very Responsive, Well Compensated.  Would DEFINITELY work for them again!it seems the company as a whole has an ego problemthey are not about bettering themselves as a company but more about how they can kill one anotherthey dont even have good customersThe company is focused on metrics more than anything, and if you aren't hitting your numbers consistently then you're hearing about it.  There are a lot of jobs to be worked on, but the environment sometimes isn't very fun.  There is a lot of turnover and it doesn't show much stability.  Seems like the only successful people are those who have been there for 5+ years, junior recruiters have a hard time growing.All temp no chance for permanent.No matter what the recruiter says.Some what helpful but not a team surrounds.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxLove this company, the only problem is the Medical benefits, other than that it's awesome! This is a family oriented Company.Very skilled in matching employers and employees. I was placed in a position where I could shine.  I was able to learn quickly and cover many areas of accounting process.Most of the branches are pretty ok at judge, but working for healthcare in the corporate office (conshy) is extremely stressful.  In the past year alone they have gone through two internal recruiters which you would think is a bad sign since now the managers themselves are doing the internal recruiting.  Some account managers are very high strung, and those who run the office treat the recruiters like a number.  Most recruiters have to bend/break the rules to meet quotas mainly out of fear for being yelled at.  These recruiters work extremely hard, and at least 45 hours a week not including all the work from home to keep up with the cycle.They say the pay scale is competitive, however it is pretty basic compared to other firms, honestly 32,000 (about 13 bucks an hour...) after you get your bachelors is really low.  I feel like they are taking advantage of students coming right out of college. The commission plan is ok but its very rare to make anything noticeable in commission until after six months. The promotions they run are fairly difficult to hit, one recruiter out of thirty might get a small gift for hitting a quota. As recruiters we've been yelled at, and cursed at for things that we cannot control such as a candidate taking another job, not showing for their interview despite telling us they would, etc.  Again kicking you while you are down.  Since they try to motivate by fear, most people are too scared of losing their job to report anything.  If you are recently graduated and have few other options, then get some experience there and get out.  Hardest  more... part of the job - hitting the quota.Most enjoyable part - the recruiters and recruiting managers are nice people, but they are being taken advantage of.  The Judge family and executives seem like genuine people, though you dont hear much from them.  lessI enjoy my current position at Judge Healthcare. Lots of opportunity here to grow.I really enjoy the people and it is def a work hard play hard type environment",201 to 500,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-11-25T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/data-scientist-job-san-francisco-ca-us-176710549.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

6,7.0,"Senior Scientist, T-cell Directing Therapies in South San Francisco, California","Pfizer, Inc.",4.2,1900.0,"A typical day at work - checkin with your team on any issues affecting the working environment for the scientist and set priorities to get the facility back up to standards.What I learned - I learned to be a leader on a few projects and take on some responsibility on improving energy efficiencies. My co-workers were great, we had a softball league that we participated in.The hardest part of the job was when the company had to reduce staffing.Great benefits, great coworkers, and emphasis that all contribute to ""helping to made medicines""  which will in turn make a positive impact in the world. Emphasis on a ""healthy Pfizer"" - free flu shots for colleagues,  fitness center on site.After I graduated form the Pharmacy School, I work for Pfizer as a medical rep., as the policy in Saudi Arabia mandated to have healthcare background. The workplace, the system is exceptional and you well interact with the finest workforce in the industry among the companies. The firm policy is strict, either internally or at the market, the resources you have to achieve your goal are the best among other companies. However, the advangates come with a price, as the market leading position of Pfizer in the market required an exceptional performance in utilizing the resources provided to maintain the leader position, in which it will too tough at the begging, but it will be easier and funnier when you acquire the experience.I enjoyed the work and I excelled quickly. However, the culture and particular consultant that I worked under was a micro-manager and did not allow for lunches, breaks, nor open communication among fellow team members. I learned how to navigate within a new database and how to work with the procurement team and other licensing departments. I used skills and techniques in order to update, renew, sell and support Pfizer clients and vendors with their newer software launch program.I was familiar with their software set up for the most part and ticketing system due to the many different applications that I used on a regular basis with my previous place of employment.I did a great amount of database clean up and worked to update the licensing information and manage the software contracts of the different clients and vendors that worked with and for Pfizer.The most difficult task of my everyday was overcoming the poor moral of the environment and the level of micro management that existed.Don't get me wrong.. I can handle some of the toughest scenarios and I have had my fair share of bosses in Corporate America that had some level of micro management. However, this woman and this consultant took it to new extremes. It was unhealthy overall and I should have been more cautious when she said that her turn over was high. None the less, I respect the nature of the position and I am flattered to have been chosen to work on her team and represent this company. I am grateful for all experiences that are put in my path, be it good, bad or indifferent.I believe  more... that nothing is coincidence anymore, rather what you choose to make of the situation. I am a firm believer that attitudes and behaviors drive success. This was the biggest hurdle within this situation. Therefore, out of respect for the team and my future.. I did not want to waste time pursuing a position that wasn't going to be a good fit and a permanent career move.  lessI worked remotely for the entire contract there. I had some travel involved, but not excessive. Due to expectation of evening change windows, it gave me flexibility to take time during the day to complete other activities.I loved my job and everything that came with it. I was a very dedicated worker and did my best with every assignment I was given.Very friendly and great place for learning      had a positive experience working at Bioclinica. I had great team and very supportive colleagues. I enjoyed working with my client.Pfizer is a great place to work it is a great environment to grow gain valuable knowledge and they always put family first and completely understand the difficult balance for family and work.A typical day consist of ISO Training, emails, and keeping the equipment running. Often the equipment is ran as close to its failure rate as possible to maximize production but at the cost of downtime to the equipment. I learned how these medicines are made and the importance for each and every one of them. I also learned that the challenges changed every day and that being able to adapt was crucial!Management has a few good ones within the fold but they are stifled by their upper management. Most of management is willing to listen at what you say, but often not willing to do anything to change it until it is well past its time to do so. There seems to be a buddy system amongst certain areas of management to keep the same contract companies when their are better ones out there.My co-workers were the best part of my career here. We worked well as a team to complete task. whether these task were in our specified area or not. We built bonds that ensured to one another that we had each others back.The hardest of part of my job was being hand tied by management. (i.e Not being able to fix equipment when it needed it but only to patch it up.) Management is the hardest part of the job.The most enjoyable are the family/ friend bonds that were created over time that allowed myself and my co-workers to grow. We accepted or challenges day in and out. The stress at times was high but we always got through it together!Excellent environment for innovation and research. Friendly and helpful colleagues and management. Most enjoyable part of job is constant learning. Typical day spent in lab and at desk.Often 16 hour shifts, every other day.In clean room for 2 hrs out to ours.Many SOPs constantly updated and reviewed.A lot of training, but not proper training. Poor decision making on management.Great learning experience, however the company has limited growth opportunities. Also the company is infamous for laying off colleagues and cost cutting.Goals are clearly identified and you can cross train in other jobs.Great mentoring program due to large talent pool. Good sense of job satisfaction and make great friends while overcoming the challenges of a highly regulated industry.I work at Pfizer for sixteen years with an excellent group of people. It was a great team work environment and outstanding leadership that encourage every employee to develop their skills and advance their careers.Very productive place to work  enjoyed working  with the people on my shift we had very good teamwork  The work environment was very enjoyable and peacefulNice place to work. No work was ever too physically demanding and I worked with a lot of experienced and helpful individuals. I learned a lot about production while I worked here and would recommend it to just about anyway. The hardest thing about the job was just learning to get into a rhythm of checking everything  on the machine to make sure everything was running ok. I did enjoy everybody I worked with though.Difficult to navigate the multi-layered, old school corporate ways in order to identify best path for career growth.  The culture can change from team to team.Was only with PFE for a short time, but my impression is that at the time PFE ws a ""my way or the highway"" company in their absorption of Pharmacy. We had many talented people and excellent process that they did not even consider when they purchased Pharmacia.Great life/work balance. Challenging work within a great corporate culture with perks of a fabulous cafeteria, gym, lovely offices and lots of collaboration amongst colleagues.I do not want to make a comment on this company, therefore, I wont say anything bad about it. The owner gave me a chance with an internship when I had no experience which allowed me to have the opportunities that I have today.good company to work for lots of great people, They have a lot of drugs going LOE very soon only issue.

8,9.0,"Staff Scientist, (Accelerator Directorate, Accelerator Diagnostics Department Head)",SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory,4.3,10.0,"SLAC is a wonderful place to work.  SLAC is a DOE laboratory operated by Stanford University, meaning employees get the perks of being Stanford staff and can also enjoy being part of the global accelerator community.  Employees generally stay around for many years, even decades, since they love the work, publishing papers, and attending international conferences.  Operating an accelerator 24-7 creates a job culture where people want to work long hours and often don't notice they're working late when they're working together to setup the beam for an experiment.However, affordable housing and childcare is difficult to find in the area, pushing more young families to commute long distances or move on to other laboratories.  The waiting lists for infant care often exceeds a year and long commutes put a substantial strain on the work-life balance.Used to be a great place to work and be immersed in pure science. The lab is compartmentalized into fiefdoms which are all different from each other. The best-funded division is LCLS and has a lot of potential.number of smart people to work with;  enjoy the work, but budget is unstable; origination changed frequently; in-consistent management;people are busy, don't have much time to chat.Great place to be exposed to desk work and business work. It is also a great place to get exposed to the financial part of a company.Great opportunity to work with a wide range of employees in developing new horizons in science provide profession growth and life balance.Stanford University is a beautiful place to work. Benefits are excellent. The company is very diverse and it was enjoyable working   with other people from around the globe.My typical day at work includes both office work ad experimental hands-ons. Learned a lot during my past four years here and enjoyed it! People are in general easy-going, proficient, and helpful here. The hardest part of my job is the flexible and sometimes unpredictable work hours.It is a good environment to come to work everyday. I've learned new things which the physicists had discovered during their experiences such as new atoms. My co-workers are very friendly. We have  gone out for lunch and talked about our social life. We have had a big gym in the lab. We can sign up for exercise classes or do on our own time during break, lunch, or after work. The hard part of the job is the funding from the government. If the DOE will not give us enough funding there will be some laid off. Over all, it is a nice place to work.It were many interesting projects. The team work was very fruitful, people were friendly and supportive.It was good time!I Enjoyed working there; people are nice and mostly cooperative. It has a decent benefits package. Commute to work is not difficult. For most of the positions, hours are flexible.",,San-Francisco,Menlo Park,CA,2016-11-09T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/staff-scientist-accelerator-directorate-accelerator-diagnostics-department-head-job-menlo-park-ca-us-175747345.aspx?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
9,10.0,Associate Scientist III,Experis,3.8,301.0,"Good experience.  Professional and helpful.  Submitting time sheet is easy.  They have employee appreciation days.  They work well with you when you need time off.so many clients and productive work. Management is reachable and good to work with them.Average Compensation with Poor Benefits.No relocation allowances and no paid leaves.I have enjoyed working as a Financial Consultant for Experis.  I am their employee, and have all the benefits of a full time position, and can be choosy about the positions that I accept.I transferred to Experis to be able to get back to doing technical recruiting and have been able to do so. However, the staffing firm culture where recruiters are competing against each other even though they work for the same company and where there is little to no work/life balance has left me with an overall negative impression of the company and the staffing firm industry as a whole. This company clearly values quantity over quality which is not a fit for me.If you are not concerned with work/life balance and have no recruiting experience they will hire you instantly. However if you are a Senior Recruiter like me and value quality over quantity than this may not be the place for you.High stress with metrics and lots of changes. Pay cuts and layoffs and taking away of benefits really has left me angry and overall I'd give them a 3 or 4 star.This company is amazing. Excellent benefits, excellent recruitment. Worked with the Office 365 Ambassador Team and learned more than I could have imagined.Worked with many good people, unfortunately it was just a year long contract, and changes in the contract position made it no longer worth the compensation level.  I would recommend anyone seeking contract work to try them.I have learned the way that many Engineers work and how short term it is with their projects.  If you work smart and hard, you will earn the compensation you want and deserve.Leadership could be better, but generally colleagues and managers try employees well.  Decent work/life balance.  Great training program for new recruiters and leadership mostly tries to set people up for success. Benefits are great and base salary is awesome for no experience in the field.  Flexible work from home and lots of vacation.Flexible working hoursFlexible scheduling environmentGood salarydesirable work loadThis experience stretched me in the realm of customer service and supportSince Experis IT is a vendor for Microsoft Studios games division, there are many down times at the company which means important people are let go from their position with no other reason than, 'Your project is coming to a close and we don't have anywhere to move you.' This is understandable to get rid of the excess work force that had ramped up during project heavy times, but they get rid of cornerstones of the company on a regular basis. The direct management of the game testing company is pretty solid - they are approachable, helpful, and always open to feeback - be it good or bad. Experis management, outside of our facility, does not understand the gaming industry and bases peoples performance on their bug output, without taking anything else into consideration.The atmosphere at Experis is a very fun and laid back atmosphere. The people that tend to work there, though some of them are quite young, are almost always a joy to be around. Coworkers are what make this place into a fun environment (that and the testing of video games). The people that you directly work with and relationships that can form because of that are most enjoyable parts of the job.One of the hardest parts of the job is that we are almost never given any sort of design/requirements documentation. We must files issues and reverse engineer documentation based on the bug resolutions (Fixed, Won't Fix, By Design, External).Another tough part of the job is that the developers almost never hit their milestone acceptance dates which creates backed up work in a Waterfall environment. Constant  more... risk and mitigation planning is what gets us through the times when delivery dates are not met.A typical day at work for a QA Engineer contains but is not limited to:Running bug triage to appropriately prioritize bug fixesEngineering tasksMentoring testersWriting test specs and test cases for deliverablesReporting to partners for transparent coverage detailsExecution of tasks createdRisk assessmentClarifying or expounding on results of testingRegression testing  lessThe company is absolutely terrible. They will say that the position is ""temp to hire"" but it ends up not being that way. They will let people go for performance but honestly that is not the case. If the company you are contracted to gives a raise for some reason they will immediately start analyzing everything you do to look for a reason to get rid of you. They will give you no notice of when your contract will end, they will extend it without asking you, and they are very rude. They treat you like a number not like an employee. DO NOT go to work for Experis. They are absolutely terrible.Overall they got me into a great opportunity and the rest was up to me.  Got me an interview right away a job shortly after.  Even considered going back for better pay long term and new opportunities.I have worked with a lot of agencies and by far Experis is one of the best.  My recruiter checks in with me on a regular basis and addresses any problems or concerns I may have in an efficient manner.  I would recommend Experis to anyone looking to fill temporary roles.Great place to work.  Very professional and the benefits are good for a contractor/consultant position. I would recommend Experis to individuals that are looking for a consulting role.I was contacted twice by a recruiter between May and September of 2015, and accepted a position as an Office 365 concierge ambassador on a contract for 18 months. In December we were called to a meeting and told that there were a low volume of phone calls and everyone had to accept a reduction in our weekly hours, from 40 hours per week to 27.5 hours per week.  Then towards the middle of the month we started noticing people going ""status unknown"" in Skype for business, which we use to communicate. From working with a previous company, ""status unknown"" usually means a person is no longer working with the company. It was confirmed that the company was hiring a large number of new employees while firing older, higher paying technicians. The one and only reason given for termination was and continue to be, performance. Performance based on surveys from sometimes angry clients who are more upset with Microsoft than with the service providers, these surveys are based on a five star rating,  one to three are bottom boxes, four stars are also bottom boxes, I was told by a not so friendly manager,  and five stars are top boxes. If an agent gets a bottom box and the client writes a letter of appreciation to management, it doesn't matter because, ""Strive for the top box guys, that's what keep management happy""Technicians who have been working with Office 365 when it was called BPOS have been fired for not being able to provide the proper support, that's just wrong. Another company did the same thing with many of the same people, get certified people to secure a Microsoft contract,  more... then fire those people and hire less qualified techs to do the work for significantly less. I started in October, and in February I was called by two managers and told that my numbers are down and improving but not fast enough, in the weeks leading up to this, I requested two days off to make funeral arrangements for a relative, my manager told me I can only take one day off, and explained that ""You are not the only agent who has had a relative die.""Manpower/Experis,  no matter how big or small, everyone gets what they deserve, eventually.  lessEvery Monday I would receive a list of new hires from JPMorgan Chase (nationwide; about 100 users per week) and would organize them into an Excel spreadsheet. I would then order software and applications required to perform their job. I learned great data analysis skills as well as organizational skills and time management. My co-workers were always very positive and motivational.Experis Finance has provided a rich variety of work experiences for a consultant in finance and accounting, as well as internal audit. It is a fairly flat organization. They are not at the cutting edge of technology, in that it has to be well-established before adoption for their consultants. Local management is very competent in leading their practice.When I first began working at Experis, my office lost three of its most senior business development managers and its IT director at the same time. They had all left the company after gas prices plummeted and there was a great deal of pressure for production from neglected accounts. Then, the managing director left the company, and there was no leadership whatsoever. A team member who was not at all prepared was pushed into an IT director role without the title or compensation, a new managing director was brought in, and gas prices continued to fall. For a year now, the office has been in a ""transitional stage,"" and without any change in direction or clear and effective leadership, there is an intense pressure to produce at an exceedingly high rate. This company has great vision and all the necessary potential to succeed and grow, but this particular office is lead with the most policy and least principle of any office in which I've had the misfortune of working.I would say its a decent company to start your career or during early phase of your career.This firm has a decent clientele and one can get some diverse experience.I was always treated with great respect and given every opportunity to express any personal issues with a placement and helped professionally by building my skills to advance in my professional career.","10,000+",San-Francisco,Redwood City,CA,2016-11-22T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/associate-scientist-iii-job-redwood-city-ca-us-176536917.aspx?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=6,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Family oriented environment.a good company, friendly work environment, career training opportunities. Decent benefits, work/life balance is OK.Traditional big pharma company which allows for numerous job opportunities to top performers. It also allows for a work environment of steady changes. The bad is generally less pay then the smaller companies as well as the small fish in big ocean feel.Many changes with moving to a BPO offshoring delivery for Fianance Procurement and HR.  Much transition but company trying to keep opportunities available and work life rewardingThis is a great company.  There's a lot of room for growth.  All that I have learned has been beneficial in other jobs I have had in my career in Manufacturing Production Department.As a Senior Lead Administative Assistant to the Group, I was responsible for the group of Administrative Assistant to the Department.  We use to meet once a month to discuss different aspects of their jobs.Depends on what group you are in.  Some understand the current culture and provide opportunities for growth, but others do not.

Great training and support structure.Thrive in a collaborative setting and dynamic work environment.  Appreciate having that environment at Novartis, with many development opportunities available.I had a large territory, so there was no work life balance.Had several good managers that were realists.  Understood the territory and would do what they could to help me succeed.Hardest part of the job was overnights.  Home for 2 weeks, on the road for 2 weeks each month.What made the job enjoyable were the success stories from the physicians that I called on when they would tell me that my drug changed somebody's life for the better.High demanding job and still able to maintain a life/ work family balance. Comrade, relationships and ability to work together on projects keeps the workplace interesting.Interesting work; excellent pay and benefits; diverse work; currently tight expense management; diverse suite of products; focused on being an employer of choiceNovartis is a very successful company which is mainly attributed to its emphasis on innovation, research and development, retaining top talent as well as focus on safety and quality. The company is extremely focused on delivering results and the place can be intense sometimes. However if one is comfortable under pressure and is geographically mobile, the opportunities for growth are ample.Good market level compensation. 4 major layoffs over past 6 years. no promotions. Lots of great people.At the end personal experience depends on manager and department. I was lucky one.Micromanagement at its worst.  You can never trust anyone here because they will stab you in the back for personal gain.

He called often to check on me and make sure things were going wellMy contract with Apex was very productive. The company gave good instruction on how to complete your daily job tasks. My co-workers and I got along with each other very well, we supported each other. The job was not hard at all, matter of fact it was a very easy job. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing so many cities and States.After fourteen years of military service all I can say is that it was worth it.  They really take care of their soldiers and their families.  It is really a family oriented military now.  better than it was beforeCo-workers were amazing people to work with.  The company itself doesn't value it's employees unless the employee is making money for them.  They only want metrics.They made the contracting process easy.  Once I started working for the contracted company I didn't have much interaction with Apex.  Didn't have to worry about much, Apex handled everything.Working for Apex is an awesome experience. Having representation onsite at the clients location is an added value. They have exceptional training courses and provide a pleasurable work experience.Computer day varies depending on the level or issue that has to be taken care of with the customer. Some days where slow but mostly busy all the time.The workplace is nice. A good mix of stressful and calmness. The other contractors are also very enjoyable which shows a good hiring process.They don't have the abitly to get you in a job full time and are not ganentee a place with the employer they put you with.They are contract company so when your contact is up you are done.I enjoyed working for Apex. Again this is a recruiting outfit and the interaction day to day is limited.  They paid adequately and the recruiters were friendly.This company pays a great compensation for both hours and mileage. They are a contract service, so the down fall is when your contract is over, you have no more work, unless there is another company needing you in your area. I was sadden when my contract was over, the hardest part was I was doing computer work for State Farm, and had to drive all over Louisiana.I got injured on the job!!!!! and got the run around lied to !!!!! They do not care about you if you get hurt they just fire you and ignore phone calls and emais .  Very unprofessional would not recommended working for themA decent company to work for.  Traveling is about 75% of the time.  There were many times when no work was available.  Scheduling can be difficult as it is through the military.this place please stay away from them they lie and blackball everyone and their pay sucks you work in a unhealthy work environmentWork in aggressive environment to thoroughly test the application. Able to learn new software and procedures.

Can be very cliquish but still a fun place to work.""They"" say you will be reimbursed for your expenses within 2 weeks. Not my experience, More like 3 weeks and you better make sure before you order that the restaurant has a point of sale machine that prints itemized receipts, has a good ribbon in the machine and you can get a good scan of the receipt. Really? No handwritten receipts are acceptable. So, local money to restaurants without these things is not reimbursable.This is on a $3+ BILLION HP contract with the Navy. Oh and BTW. They only pay 8 hours of travel each way so if they send you across the country and it takes 12 hours, you will be paid for 8.Depending on your HP supervisor, you will get 8 hours if you get their numbers for the day or you will get the hours you worked. Efficiency is not rewarded on a random supervisor basis.Worked at Dell as contract employee.

Recently, they decided to stop using LinkedIn and Indeed as well, making recruiters lives harder.a lot of turn around not too much job security, hardest part of the job is to build your client data base. management lacked a bitOnsite management needs improvement, high turnover in leadership resulting in job security for potential growth with job siteI only worked for Judge briefly. I started in the month of January and by resigned by May. I quickly realized how much I despised this place. By February I began looking for a new job. The office I worked in was very tiny (the size of a small closet). I worked with 3 other people in this closet. The girls I worked with were very mean and extremely rude. They would talk about you the second you walked out of a room and would stop the moment you returned. They were fake nice when you would try to talk to them. I never in my life felt so alone and excluded. I made every attempt to get along with them but they simply wouldn’t have it. I was often pulled into HR to discuss my work attire. There was a strict dress code there but only for certain people. I was in trouble for wearing black suede boots and a military style jacket yet my coworker was permitted to wear a denim jacket and cowboy boots. A lot of the women there would also wear micro miniskirts where I could see more than I wanted to yet my dresses were too short according to HR cause they didn’t cover my knees. The place was very “clicky”. It was like being back in High School. You were either a popular kid or a nerd. I tried to fit in but was pushed out every time I tried. It was very hurtful. I couldn’t get out of there fast enough! And if you like to have time off from work, forget about it! This company does not allow anyone to take unpaid time off and the accrual rate of time off is a joke. Your 1st year you get 3 days! Also, the benefits are probably some of the worst I have ever seen. For a large company,  more... they have horrible health benefits. You will literally be working there for just benefits but never get to use them because the deductibles are so high.  lessLoved the position I was in and really enjoyed working with the group of people I was with.  I learned quite a bit regarding Healthcare that I hope to use in the future.  I was very disappointed when I was told that the company I was working with did not want to keep me on past my 6 month contract date after I was pretty much convinced that I would be kept on through the next contract with the same company.Most of the branches are pretty ok at judge, but working for healthcare in the corporate office (conshy) is extremely stressful.  In the past year alone they have gone through two internal recruiters which you would think is a bad sign since now the managers themselves are doing the internal recruiting.  Some account managers are very high strung, and those who run the office treat the recruiters like a number.  Most recruiters have to bend/break the rules to meet quotas mainly out of fear for being yelled at.  These recruiters work extremely hard, and at least 45 hours a week not including all the work from home to keep up with the cycle.They say the pay scale is competitive, however it is pretty basic compared to other firms, honestly 32,000 (about 13 bucks an hour...) after you get your bachelors is really low.  I feel like they are taking advantage of students coming right out of college. The commission plan is ok but its very rare to make anything noticeable in commission until after six months. The promotions they run are fairly difficult to hit, one recruiter out of thirty might get a small gift for hitting a quota. As recruiters we've been yelled at, and cursed at for things that we cannot control such as a candidate taking another job, not showing for their interview despite telling us they would, etc.  Again kicking you while you are down.  Since they try to motivate by fear, most people are too scared of losing their job to report anything.  If you are recently graduated and have few other options, then get some experience there and get out.  Hardest  more... part of the job - hitting the quota.Most enjoyable part - the recruiters and recruiting managers are nice people, but they are being taken advantage of.  The Judge family and executives seem like genuine people, though you dont hear much from them.  lessgood first job out of college. not a lot of room for growth though. hours are long but you can make money at this job if you work hard. its a lot of luck so you need to be resilient.I would definitely recommend this company for the college graduate or anyone who is in the market of looking for a job. They look to fit you with the best job to fit your experience.Your day starts out with a conference call first thing in the morning to go over most recent job openings.  During the call, recruiters are assigned to work each of those positions.  Once jobs are assigned, the day is spent posting jobs on the company website, sending email blasts and looking through the job boards for qualified candidates.  There is another conference call in the afternoon to check on the status of job openings from the morning as well as assign new ones that have come out since.  Keys to success are time management and excellent organizational skills.  Definitely a highly competitive environment.Good company to work for.  I like the fact that they pay weekly.  The beginning pay process I think may need some attention, and the fact that you have to track time in the assigned company's system, and also in Judge's system is a bit cumbersome and always involves coordination, etc.This office has a great work environment! Everyone is wonderful and the director is the best. It is best to be confident in what you say and be prepared to make a lot of phone calls. You must definitely enjoy talking to people to succeed here!Love this company, the only problem is the Medical benefits, other than that it's awesome! This is a family oriented Company.I enjoyed working as a private contractor. My assignment was in clinical suppoort, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I have learned a great deal about health maintenance, gap remediation and medication uses and indications as well as diagnostic testing indications. I was disappointed that I was not brought on permanently to the position I was at. I was promised a position, but the organization suffered massive budget cuts.Good communication, responsive to employee inquiries, fair pay. Managers respond to inquiries concerning, job assignments, hours of work and pay issuesNot a bad job but stressful environment due to productivity standards. Hours are long and there is a lot of micromanagement. Reports come out daily with a list of phone call totals for each person, submittals, interviews and last placement.The company is focused on metrics more than anything, and if you aren't hitting your numbers consistently then you're hearing about it.  There are a lot of jobs to be worked on, but the environment sometimes isn't very fun.  There is a lot of turnover and it doesn't show much stability.  Seems like the only successful people are those who have been there for 5+ years, junior recruiters have a hard time growing.Worked from home on Insurance company's national project.  LOVED being a telenurse.The Judge Group was wonderful to work with -  Very Responsive, Well Compensated.  Would DEFINITELY work for them again!I enjoy my current position at Judge Healthcare. Lots of opportunity here to grow.I really enjoy the people and it is def a work hard play hard type environment",201 to 500,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-12-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/e5e51478-3fcc-4962-86ac-b9734b829c5f?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

39,40.0,Senior Associate Scientist Immuno Assay,"Amgen, Inc",4.1,510.0,"Checked animals for health and welfare, study support.  Management was not always aware of issues.  Co-workers were great.  My commute was the most difficult part of my job.  The work was fun and rewarding.The work as a manufacturing associate is very stressful, even though   you learned a lot about automated and manual processes.You are asigned to a partner ( it can be a different one every day) everyday so you have to get to know each person working system and communication is very important. The most difficult part of this job is that you dont have and exact time to go to have lunch or to eat. Everyday  can be unpredictable. In my opinion the management has to work really hard on that and take the associates in consideration. I know that production is very important but workers health and consideration is too.Loved the people that I worked with. I was able to learn and grow with the company. They offered a great tuition reimbursement plan for those that wanted to get an education.The culture at Amgen is very competitive, with favoritism shown to those who buddy up to management.  Individuals who do well in office politics are given more opportunity for advancement than those who master their jobs, particularly in the scientific roles.  Medical benefits are above average, as are savings plans for retirement.  Many layoffs have occurred over the last ten years, with staff being replaced by contractors.  Some benefits have declined in recent years, such as tuition reimbursement, which went from 100% to a flat $5K per year.  Child day care is available but is very expensive.  Cost-cutting since the 2008 economic crisis has negatively impacted the working environment and the company culture.Amgen was a good company to work for. Management overall was good but had issues removing poor management from the structures. Manufacturing seemed to be pushed beyond their limits. Good benefits and pay.My job experience at Amgen was very important of my life, because I adquired professional knowledge. A tipical day at work was very hard. In Amgen I work as co-worker, this job was my first official science job and my first experience at the pharmaceutical industry. I learned everything of the manufacturing area.Amgen is a great working environment with many different bussines units ranging from Oncology to CV drugs. If you are relocatable the options are great for upward mobility and your goals can be met if you clearly identify your direction.The company looks nice to an outsider but management culture is very protective of an out of control quality system and does not invite new process improvement ideas!I had the opportunity to lead several Supplier Quality initiatives.  Management and co-workers were solid, though there were many late nights preparing for and executing successful regulatory inspections.Great training programs for those that want to excel in the company. Management is always there and ready to assist. CO-workers are very helpful and happy. Office management is providing assistance to higher level staffgreat pay   working  conditions are  Terrible  very high stress environment and very long hours but met some great co workers.emphasis on doing anything to get ahead even if it means damaging a coworkers reputation.Amgen worker productivity seems to be diminished, and its culture appears to be conditioned by constant large-scale initiatives driven top-down.  Teams' ability to execute is impacted by a culture of job-protectiveness, and even excellent and essential ideas are delayed for years waiting for various reorganizations.  In a nutshell, Amgen does not foster ideation, invention, creativity; further, the company seems to reward passive-aggressive behavior.Amgen's headquarters are isolated in Ventura County, CA, and while the benefits are great, I do not recommend relocating simply for Amgen.  It frequently pays relocation benefits to new hires, but moving here could geographically block enriching opportunities from coming to you.Contracted in the Woburn, MA facility for two nightmarish months. I was told they had an open ear and welcome new ideas. Not even close. The safety dbag watched over everything you did just to tell you to do it different. Hardcore FDA regulated. Employees are told to fill out reports and ""dime-drop"" on others if they see you do something wrong. You'll be better off joining the army. It's run just like that. Big turnover and a lot of firings. Stay far away from this asylum.Excellent co-workers and team work environment.  Every day is a new challenge to manage the time to succeed and meet workload as well as giving support to other areas.  Excellent place to learn and grow as a professional.Good job, unfortunately just a temporary assignment, wish it was permanent.  Even though it was a bit of a drive there from my residence, I would have been more than glad to be a permanent employee of Amgen.Its the place where challenge own capacities since day one. The team member are in constante search of improvement. As it is each task, responsibility importan as it is the site facilities.Great products, great company. Teamwork environment and management try to be transparent to the sales reps.The most enjoyable part of my job is helping patients get access to the medication.The day starts with heavy calendar, email and mailbox maintenance and cross functional interactions and wearing many hats throughout the day.  Learning management system allowednfor unlimited and frequent task and role educationnfor growth. Teamwork and cross functional interaction was a plus.Enjoyed working here.  The project teams were awesome and everyone worked very hard.  The group included FTE's and Contractors and everyone worked as a team delivering results that was appreciated and recognized.Great place to work with an excellent lean manufacturing culture.  The company values are embedded in all activities we do.When I was a contracted employee Amgen was great. After I was hired it was totally different than what I was presented. Everyone there is depressed and complaining. Lack of communication between management and employees.","10,000+",San-Francisco,South San Francisco,CA,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/a622dbdf-e880-4fe5-a21c-b5f377cdf4b3?mescoid=1900254001001&jobPosition=7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

43,44.0,Senior/Principal Software Engineer - Analytics Platform,Workday Inc.,3.6,19.0,"I've worked for other software giants, and no one compares to Workday! Their comp and onboarding for sales rep is like nothing I've ever seen. The benefits dept is also making huge strides in the family leave policy for 2017. Can't say enough great things about Workday!!Workday provides a great work/life balance and the opportunity to grow your skill set.  I enjoyed working with a diverse group of individuals and look forward to new opportunities.Hiring spree has resulted in the standards falling especially for the way middle level managers have been hired.  Many of the junior level managers to mid-level managers do not deserve to be managers in the company.  This is fast becoming another Oracle.Workday is the first technology company that I worked for that allows me to use the technology daily and it is the exact same software we sell to prospects.I was recruited by Workday and ended up relocating to Pleasanton from the east coast.  I had hoped Workday a place where i could stay for quite a while but ultimately this was not a good fit for me.  As an SME with over 20 years experience in my industry I was very anxious to develop and delivery best of breed functionality into my product area.  Although the developers, qa and documentation people were great, I found to be the middle and upper management inflexible and stuck in their old ""ERP"" ways given most or previous Peoplesoft or Oracle employees.  If you have background from a best of breed solution and want to work for Workday make sure you get a demo of the product before accepting a position at Workday.Workday places it's employees first in all core values. from that fundamental discipline all other values fall into place and a superior product is developed.If you didn't work around the clock. You didn't get respect. New management that has been coming in has no respect. The culture was dead when I got terminated. However people acted as if nothing had changed. New management loved people who made spread sheets, but didn't care or turned a blind eye to those who really did work.I was terminated for being late when I was never given a warning. And in-fact some of the late was work related from being on call. I got sick of trying to make my manager happy when he was doing noting but lieing to me, so I accepted the termination with little resistance.Don't get me wrong. There is some good things still at workday. But don't expect the great place to work as solid gold. Managers ask you to lie to please CEO and management on the public best place to work surveys. I always told the truth. It was a good place for me, till about a year ago.Its all about the money because they went public.Working at Workday was complete go to market strategy for a subsection of prospects. This required multiple marketing strategies and specific communication cadences to help deliver the Workday message.Here is a CEO that is a billionaire and starts another technology company because he does it for the love and his ""passion"" for technology! I call him the ""Picasso"" of technology and the culture here is reflective of his love to this work. How many leaders can you say that about?Typical day read all emails and handle all priorities. Daily check of all kitchens and copy areas. Handle all service request and complete in a timely manner. I have learned how to time manage my workload and prioritize. I really liked my job there was no negative as far as workday. The toughest part of my job was my manager. I truly believe that upper management should not hiring family members within the same department.Great company to work for.  Customer Success is the key!  Good eye on the product. Long hours and they treat their employees well.Big ideas but no knowledge how to achieve them. Management is dated and clueless how to update their aging software. Want innovation but have no experience on the process to create innovative products. Be prepared to be blamed for their lack of knowledge. Have your resume ready for your next job interview.Great place to work but be ready to work more hours than there are in a day.Co-workers and management are all of high-caliberMake sure to get as much feedback from managementKnow who you have to impressFun and Fast moving environment with great leadershioJust know that yours and anyone's job is on the line everydayGreat top management, and bottom hard working level engineers. The middle management are full of politic. It has turn the company into political power house. The company double and nearly triple in size in less than a year and half, and created huge gap and confusion from top to bottom.I love working for Workday, unfortunately, my project is ending so I have to leave.  I love Workday for the following reasons:They like to use cutting edge technologyThey are completely professionalThey change around everyone's jobs every 6 months or so which keeps people happy.I had high hopes of success here, but it was not a good fit for me. I don't know why, but the overall energy is better for a young, just-out-of-school herd of eager folks, I think.On-boarding is the “mechanism through which new employees acquire the necessary knowledge, skills, and behaviors to become effective organizational members”Helps your ""new hires"" make the transition to becoming:• productive• well-adjusted• and a happy contributing members of your company/teamPost (Corporate) ""lift off orientation on-boarding"" ranked low on the list of hiring priorities – poorly designed and even more poorly executed if there was one in place.No on-boarding at multiple organizational levels post (Corporate) ""lift off orientation"" – spent a great deal of time operating blind.• On-boarding at ""Location Level"" was nonexistent. i.e., Next steps? Working From Home? Go to Local Office? Contact Info? Office supplies?• On-boarding at ""Departmental Level"" was sporadic at best. Very California ""centric"".• On-boarding at ""Team/Job Level"" – No real interaction or introductions if you were not in the California offices. No ‘Go-to Person’ as a contact/mentor. Experienced very little peer/colleague camaraderie. ""everyone out for themselves"" or ""got my own problems"" or ""no time"".• On-boarding at ""Individual Level"" was nonexistent. Travel Policy? Expenses? Emergency Contact List? Appropriate Contact Protocol? Department Manager failed to make expectations clear.- how would individual performance be assessed?- bonus and promotion criteria/opportunities?- clear and written “objectives” that stated accountable and measurable ROI were non-existent.- generalized discussions on “time to productivity” was all over the map depending on conversation  more... and WHO you were speaking with.- never presented with documentation as reference, guidance, expectations or accountability.Terrible, Terrible, Terrible!  lessVery happy customer base that helps with referrals.

Always ready to help out. provide guidance to gain your goal. Good ways to communicate with other employees.This was a high call volume call center for collecting medical record for several different companies, the objective was to schedule at least three on site reviews which was the hard part because some doctors office didn't like to have technicians come in so it was a very competitive job and you had to be assertive and persuasive in order to get that done. Sometime we would have races to see who get the most onsite reviews scheduled within a time frame. I enjoyed it i was always able to get five or more and that was the fun part.Work life balance is good. Good testing tools-Quality Center, Jira QTP, and In-house tools. Good testing methodology.The people at ECS was not professional at all. No one on the office side was helpful. I would go to a job site retrieve all the information that I was required to retrieve, upload the information, and think that I would be going forward to the next job. However; I would have to return to a site because they do not work together in the corporate office. It was a high turnover rate for the Field Tech Coordinators, in the 11.5 months that I worked there, I had 6+ Coordinators. The most enjoyable part of working for ECS was going to various job sites and working with different people every day.Working as your own supervisor was wonderful! It put great responsibility on me, but also taught me a lot. With this kind of job you need organization. The only downfall was there was not always work available. So when the cases slowed, so did the heavy paycheck that you relied on.A typical day at work is driving to site location all over New Jersey for chart retrieval. I learned how to maneuver Electronic Medical Record programs that I am using to retrieve charts. Management has been very good to me. They work with me with scheduling for issues that arise that causes me to miss work or change work times. I do not have contact with other co-workers because I work alone. Hardest part of the job is dealing with rude workers at some site locations. Most enjoyable part is working alone and only checking in through job website and applications.Upper management was very poor, Middle management made up for that, in how they interacted and treated employees. The company took pride in their adherence in HIPPA and continuously updated employees and quizzed them on information. Based in a call center environment, as a field tech coordinator, you are provided with a team made up of 10-20 individuals that were from the same general area in the United States. It was my responsibility to account for these team members to show up to their pre-scheduled job site and provide tier one technical support with our software that was sent out to them, where they scanned the pre-chosen medical records from the office they were assigned to. The company lost a few major contract and were forced to lay off 3/4 of the employed staff,Focus on client satisfaction with excellent service; enable the efficient knowledge transfer from the consultants to the client user so that the client end users can expedite the implementation and mastery of the system.Encourage the client users to take ownership of the implementation with advisory support and solution architecture.Travel  to site, transpose patient's medical record charts to electronic medical records (EMR). Send data to corporate office to transfer to EMR. Follow Medicare and Medicaid regulations.Great place to work, Contracts vary so each job will be different, Management is very supportive and the environment is a just do it type of place.Enjoyed work place and gained the skills  by dealing with complex business scenarios. Found lot of opportunities in working with various technologies and gained skills in short time.At ECS the work was really great and the doctors and staff were easy to get along with. My co-workers were very great friendly people and at times very helpful. The hardest part of the job is when you have to keep calling the doctors and there staff to let them know that they have past due medical records that need to be sent out. They start feeling harassed and pressured. Your job is to keep as calm as possible ans explain to them that you can allow them to have an extension. The goal is to keep them happy all the while make sure you get your job accomplished. The management was difficult. Due to them not acknowledging their employees. They don't speak to you nor do they even look at you. All in all i loved my job and wished that my assignment never ended there.A Typical work day varied; because it typically was often a different location. The exciting part of the job would be changes in the job locations. The most enjoyable part of the job was working independently. However;  management, whenever needed was awesome, they were just a phone call away. The hardest part of the job might be no full-time employment available. The position is just a temporary position; which is made clear before the position is offered. A GREAT COMPANY TO WORK WITH!It was incredibly easy working for this company. I worked off a schedule that was flexible to my needs. I drove to different cities and recovered medical charts from private practice physicians for Medicare insurance audits. I had the opportunity to learn medical procedure terminology and a feel for what a medical organization can expect with insurance audits. I learned how to carefully process sensitive information. Unfortunately I didn’t have the pleasure of getting to know any given person regularly due to me working at different sites daily, however it was nice to meet new people.This position enabled me to work with many different sales teams and see many different management styles. Providing true value to the field organization with strategy, fostering collaborative thinking and a consulatative sales approach incorporating all buiness lines. Leading presentatations for end user customers for roadmap planning.  Planning and development for new products to be launched globally. The most challenging aspect of this job was covering such a large territory so throughly. Most enjoyable was the company, people and level of expertise and size of projects delt with.The compensation was very fair and working from home allowed for autonomy.You will be working independently. I learned some valuable things about HIM and EMR. My experience with ECS landed my current job, which I love, for me. Overall a great experience, but not a lot of security. Great work if you are looking for a position in the HIM field.I enjoyed going to different clinics and seeing new people, management was good. I liked that you were almost your own boss didn't have people looking over your shoulder, there was a lot of trust.Consulting at Enterprise  Business Solutions gives good exposure to end clients. Get to work and gain valuable experience at end clients in different industries.Travel to scheduled Medical sites and retrieve specific requested documents for requested dates of service by either paper scan, print to scan or EMR flashdrive.I learned how to navigate through several different EMR systems.Management is friendly and easy to get along with.Hardest part of the job is traveling to unknown offices and working by yourself.most enjoyable part was meeting different people and seeing different Medical offices.Great opportunity if you enjoy working independently and mostly figuring things out on your own. If you are even semi tech savvy, it's super easy. I have worked nearly full time all summer and have exceeded the 12 week commitment required. This has been great, in that it is a part time job, thus you I have earned a lot of overtime pay. If you follow the guidelines/expectations, call in to your Coordinator as required, do daily reporting online, you will be be offered work. (If it is available in your area; it is all project based and you are informed of that upon hire.) There can be issues with communication, but this is the case with any company, and at least it is all via telephone/not in your face. The job is not permanent, no benefits, and some wear/tear on your vehicle, all of which you are informed of during the interview process. However, it beats drawing unemployment, and affords one the opportunity to network in different offices daily.I enjoy working with Enterprise Consulting Solutions.  If I need any extra training they tell me where to find it.  If I need help with uploading charts they have tech support to help with that.  Overall, this is a great company to work for.","1,001 to 5,000",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/f6a4bdfa-0960-4cac-86cc-f899be705150?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
67,68.0,Intern Data Scientist,Autodesk Inc.,4.2,148.0,"Super smart people, world-changing technology. Autodesk have managed to raise the lowly engineer to the level of Geek Superhero - in fact, they were just named one of the Universum Top 100 Ideal Employers for engineering students.In the right role, one can change the future. Autodesk is a powerful enabler in many spaces, and smart, young people can truly excel in this company.Autodesk transformed drafting and design back in the 1980's, and they continue to lead the world in engineering technology, design, visualization and future techologies (e.g., additive manufacturing, green buildings and engineering simulation). Great benefits and above-scale pay. Super corporate stewardship for many sustainable efforts - Autodesk gives back to the world.In the right team, you'll have fun while changing the world. The average Autodesker is more than just smart - he or she is probably a fun-loving prankster / comedian, too. Seriously, the work atmosphere is intense but when this they take a break from their task lists, the majority of functional teams have a great time together. This alone can make work at Autodesk very, very worthwhile.Dirty politics played by bad management because they don't have the skills to do the job.Regular layoffs for people who don't cater to managment.Steady outsourcing increase so no job security.Upper management burning reserves buying incompetent companies.Autodesk is recently expanding into the world of manufacturing. They have little experience with direct customer support which is making the next few years questionable from the standpoint of stability.I really enjoy my time working at Autodesk the environment is very open and the people to work with are very nice.My major complaint is it is very difficult to apply anywhere else internally. If you are working through a contract you could be let go at any moments notice without any notification ahead of time.Management teams are excellent.Co-workers work very hard.Company culture is focused on results.There is a lot of overtime available which is excellent for those with a strong work ethic. Overall, the company culture is evolving to build a better work life balance For those who are dedicated, there are a lot of opportunities for advancement.Great organization.Management very flexible,accessible, and well informed about the work that needs to be done, and overall willing to give you the support the you need. Supervisors are not always looking over your shoulder and you are given space to implement new ideas about the processes.I was given the opportunity to use my knowledge and skills and also to learn from my co-workers. I got a lot of support from everyone around me with not hesitation or reserve.  Great working environment. Benefits are good and good work/job balance.Company held and promote workers-social gathering within the facilities or outside the facilities. The facilities are great (very clean and modern. Co-workers are always willing to help no matter in what part of the country (USA) or over-sea they are located.Some positions have the option to work from home or at the office.  This is a very technological oriented organization.It was a great place to work not much else to say. Everyone worked together and everyone's ideas were put to use. I traveled about 50% of my time with the company. The travel was almost always 5 days at a time and almost never 2 weeks in a row.Autodesk is a progressive software company with excellent benefits and compensation.  It's a great place to work for someone who wants constant change.While the leadership of the support group seem to care, they in fact are more concerned with their spread sheets, than their employees and customers.Everyone is very good to you and work space is very good. All the Co-workers are very friendly. Management is also very good to you. There is not much work stress here.It was a great place to develop skill and to have an opportunity to grow. Also the job allowed me to get a great I deal on how to satisfy the customer.Great people, great benefits and great products. The technology is cutting edge and you have opportunity to work with every type company manageable.Sync up statusDaily stand upWork on the tasks allocatedFriendly and supportive team matesImplementing APIsAWS SQSAgile methodologiesAutodesk has a great product and employees can be proud to work for a company with such a good reputation.  The people are terrific and the space in SF is pretty awesome.  However, management is very uneven and not everyone is on the same page.  There are a lot of mixed messages.  Beware of younger managers and those who have been with the company less than 2 years. They are eager, ambitious, and have little-to-no training on how to manage people.  Loyalty and tenure are not valued at Autodesk, and the company does a major reduction in force about every 3-4 years, focusing on releasing employees who have been with the company more than 10 years.I can't say enough good about Autodesk.  I loved my time there.  They treat there employees so well.  I was rookie of the year my first year in sales and was the only one of my team that was over quota.  Love Autodesk.Worked there for several years.  Back in the mid-1980's there were some fun, fun times.... but with the increase in need for more corporate structure, those days are sadly a memory... though fond memories :)American multinational software corporation that makes software for the architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, media, and entertainment industries.Autodesk provides really cool technology to a variety of interesting industries.  A person beginning their career could really learn a lot here.  But executive management is erratic, with no centralized product management or strategy.  Too many products, some of which overlap each other.  Lots of territorial conflicts due to lack of leadership.After 18 years, it is sad to be part of the 10% reduction in force at Autodesk.  It has been the most challenging, exciting, and rewarding place I have ever worked.  The corporate culture is good, and the people are fantastic.  It's an innovative company with lots of creativity.  I've learned so much and I am ready to take my experience and knowledge to another great company.Pros: Benefits, Salary, Location, Facilities, Resources, decent/fairly interesting products, free lunch 2 days per week, work from home on Friday.Cons: New employees will struggle to be effective at times due to the large amount of ""backstory"" knowledge resident in the heads of existing employees. This is a very political place, Management is ineffective at driving initiatives to success. The company appears to be struggling with reconciling its culture from when it was smaller with the changes required to be efficient as a larger company. Its not uncommon to have conference calls at night during the week to collaborate with other ADSK offices in other timezones.Great company, solid business model, but has too many changes with management & uncertainty in the upcoming times.Big potential if you survive through the changes.","5,001 to 10,000",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/b52b96f1-0a08-4006-834f-3f54d804f9ca?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

69,70.0,Data Scientist,DNV GL,3.9,54.0,"A nice company that's going through a lot of changes.  Unfortunately, the European mentality (which can be great) is this company's biggest problem.Working for DNV GL was an experience of a lifetime. The work/life balance was absolutely amazing. And the opportunities provided by the company were amazing. There was a lot of room for growth. The company encouraged all of their employees towards individual growth. The management treated you like an adult, with minimal interference, while maintaining a supportive role in everyday activities.Recently after merger, things changed otherwise good place to work.New CEO is promising and expecting to bring commercial culture and get rid of old way of doing the business.The department was highly disorganized, employees over worked, demanding overtime, management problems.  Too many projects and not enough people to do the work.DNV GL comprises of the technical experts in the Energy Efficiency field and the culture has an open and collaborative environment. The company allows you to grow that is congruent to your work results. The employees are dedicated and solution oriented.Worked in the renewables independent engineering group, exciting work, however the company planned a merger very poorly and suffered with a poor accounting system, and horribly understaffed and burned everyone out.  Would have been nice if management could have executed their vision much better.Very friendly, hard working but fair company to work for. Nice offices in Singapore. Very international workforce, supportive management.DNV GL has high standards that are values based. Great opportunities for those interested in doing their best and exploring the world.Love environment and disciplines in company. Process oriented , and very driven environment. Management is ideal for work conditions .I love that I am being paid to do something that I am so passionate about. There is nothing I love more than being able to connect business owners with incentive dollars from the utility that they can use to reinvest in their own business.The effect of two mergers coupled with poor mid-level management practices are having a marked effect on the company's professionalism. In particular, their energy-efficiency evaluations have seen too many examples of unprofessional practices, as noted by customers and utilities. Business development is in decline, resulting in a sharp decline in moral.great place to work, and travel a lot, but difficult to be closer with the family. Nice benefits and friendly with the coworkers.Good place to work and just like all companies, there are some challenges.  They have a heart and want to do the right thing but at times are constrained by having to make a business decisions that go against the employees.  Overall, I recommend DNV GL.-Large company benefits with a small company atmosphere-Flex time-friendly group of people to work with- Great location in Dublin for lunch- over 300 offices world wide - multicultural work enviromentgood place to work, flexible, salary is not high, but it is fair enough. People are friendly to each other. The location is close to home.I work 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM and I've learned numerous skills.  I've had the opportunity to work on global projects and interfacing with upper management.Nice place to work with good benefit. Treating the employees well and professional. Learning new thing from colleagues through project work.I have enjoyed my time with the DNV GL family. This company is very fast paced, co-workers are very close. The company sincerely cares about you and your family with flexibility towards it when needed to be there for your family. This company is great to start off as a first place to work in the corporate world.Working as an intern for DNV GL involved a wide range of technical problem solving. There was a good balance of individual and team-based work. I gained a relevant understanding in corrosion science and enjoyed being able to directly apply my several years of engineering training for a useful purpose.The company's take is you learn 80% of what you need to know on the job, 10% thru training materials, and 10% thru mentoring.My most enjoyable part of my job is to make sure all customers are taking care on a daily basis.  If the customer is happy, I am happy.",,San-Francisco,Oakland,CA,2016-12-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/f12f5ad8-8179-4993-baa6-44b023f5c6e7?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Would like to see more stability and less change.  Micromanagement is everywhere and the next change is always just around the corner. It is hard to be effective in an environment where you are always looking over your shoulder.good balance of work. Director mgrs have positive attitude. difficult to get things completed. Overall there is a positive work environment.Good work-life balance; nice people. Good pay and benefits.  Nice and supportive culture. Management is supportive and company offers lots of opportunities for career and personal growthI worked there for a lot of years.No teamwork. Lack of cooperation. Bad decisions are common place.Management seems more interested in furthering their personal careers than making quality products.Casual depending on what location. Nepotism and Favoritism, Typical coworkers some you love to work with other. Constant change and learning. okay company to work for.Thomson Reuters set up yearly goals that make no sense which are mandatory. they do not assist in career development so employees are left confused by them.Tax and Accounting Department doesn't seem to be doing the things necessary to have long term employment for their sales personnel. Products are outdated and over priced, the way people sell them now devalues their prices in the first place, creating two seasons where you can sell products - q2, and q4. Pay was continually downgraded - they would up your base salary and completely soften your commissions. The third year of my employment I would have had to sell 150K more than I sold my second year to make the same amount of money. Pressure from management to make a certain number of dials a day, you're monitored, and if you don't hit your numbers - whether sales or dials you are on this ice. Out perform your team and go two hundred percent of quota? you're still there late at the end of the month, and management is extremely quick to forget your performance if you have a lackluster quarter due to their poor business strategy. The training here is top notch, and the managers are mostly good.Working here opens the doors to so many opportunities.  Their training for interns puts more emphasis on preparing you for the future you desire than a future with the company, and the VP of Customer Operations takes the time to learn everybody's names and get to know you pretty well.  Strong emphasis on work/life balance at this company.  They ask that you don't take your work home with you, and they are heavy on the coffee breaks.Overall great place to work!The benefits are declining, the management i always changing and their is always uncertainty as to who will be in charge the next week and if you will have a job.TR has a great company culture as a whole. I worked in the ONESOURCE Product Support as a contractor, your time there is obviously limited. Unfortunately, they have a habit of promising certain things and not following through with those promises. Management in my department was incredibly unstable, restructuring is needed. Managers are really just seeking to look good to their own bosses, everyone else is overlooked and is disposable. The job itself was great, I learned a lot and it's valuable information to carry in the future. My biggest complaint is the management consistently lying. Typical day at work is extremely structured, you come in, must be ready to go at 8am and not a second later. 30 minutes of break time for the full day, can divide it up into 15 minute breaks or smaller. I learned more about the tax process, it's information I know I can use later on. Management (read above). Coworkers are great, we're all in the mess together so they make it better to be there. Hardest part of the job is dealing with an unstable management team, the job itself is fine. I enjoyed the job greatly, learning a lot and feeling like you accomplished helping others.It's easy and you know what to expect going into work. There isn't much variety however the management team is nice and helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job is the quiet atmosphere and independent work environment. I learned more about excel with this position.Nice place to work , good work life balance . Good opportunities to learn new technologies and they have a very good management to support the latest trends.Management is pleasant, generally expects around 40 hours/week.Coworkers are pleasant and knowledgeable about the tasks at hand.Constantly learning and working with new programming paradigms.Thomson Reuters is a good company that has a lot of opportunity for growth but struggled to place the company in the correct vertical due to the type of business that we were part of.Most team members worked remotely so we had weekly conference calls to provide progress and updates on progress. We had the chance to work independently as well as collaboratively.My co-workers were the greatest--very supportive and willing to help out to meet deadlines if necessary.My boss held monthly information meetings to help us learn new skills that would enhance our job performance.Thomson Reuters is a top-ranking information services company with over 50,000 employees.  Senior Management did not hesitate to lay off as many people as they possibly could, but they never gave up on their bonuses.  Though, my working experience was great, but the phase was pretty rough.  I really enjoyed the technical aspect of the project, and don't regret the opportunity.Great company to work for, good people.  The management was great to work for.  The company provides a good workplace environment.  They provide many learning opportunities as well.TR is constantly changing management hierarchy which became a bit tedious and confusing. As with large companies of this nature, the bottom line is saved for the stockholders. Massive layoffs were expected on a bi-annual basis with very little domestic back-filling. Most of the technical development was moved to a consulting firm in India which had competing objectives with TR and made the job more difficult than it should have been.","10,000+",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-11-30T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/c41b38d4-1f60-447d-b300-f9f94112776c?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=10,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Company culture is sometimes not what it seems.Rosetta Stone is committed to making sure that learning languages is fun, easy and accessible.  The atmosphere is laid back and the teams all combine together to make sure the job gets done.Salesforce company culture, benefits, work/life balance and flexibility are pretty good.  There are certain areas within Salesforce that are much better than others (R&D/product side of the house, HR, etc) seem to be run very well, care about their employees and have great career development in place.  IT, has the same benefits, but lacks both the career growth/development opportunities, and positive management.

Tasks depend on the specific project you are working on. flexible on arrival time, as long as you put in your hours and get the job done.Salesforce is an amazing opportunity to learn about the world of information technology in the cloud. There is an incredible steep learning curve and bombardment of information however the longer you stay the more you start to grasp significance and advantages of each vertical. Salesforce is one of the best companies to experience and they have upward mobility for anyone willing to work for it.Great company with really good intentions. However, they want/need to expand exponentially and that leads to a little confusion. Lots of resources (maybe too much) and some overlap which can lead to confusion. I felt that it was almost becoming a production line and this left little room for creativity and also to ""find your fit"" from a personality perspective.Great company to work for. Great learning experience with trainings and company culture.Lots of room for growth and ability to move within the company. Employees are treated very well.Work hard and play hard attitude. They follow there 1/1/1 philosophy. The employees are well diverse. Everyone is nice and kind.A typical work day at Salesforce consist of emails, meetings, written communications, and networking. In my role, I learned about leadership such as event coordinating, volunteer coordinating, public speaking, and being resourceful. The work culture is very diverse by age, cultural background, and education level. The most enjoyable part about Salesforce is that it's a company that's an advocate on volunteering and philantrophy. They encourage employees to give back to their community or a nonprofit organization. I've never heard of that concept until I worked for Salesforce.It is a great place with very smart people. There are many opportunities in this huge and still growing company. Great 1:1:1 model and success platform.I implemented 5 Documentations to Sales and Marketing Executives  to understand Renewals Business Processes. I managed 7 projects on a tight deadline. Exceeded the pipeline expectations. I am a certified administrator. I have access to administrate customers and users profiles.Great work culture, snacks and drinks provided, great office buildings.management was disengaged due to being located in Ireland for follow the sun support purposes. He didn't communicate well with our US half of the team, focus and training happened in Ireland where most of the staff for our operations sat.great company over all!Salesforce is a good place to work. Fun, smart and energetic co-workers. Long hours and they expect you to get results. Lots of sales enablement training.","10,000+",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-11-30T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/27f0bd3c-9488-4886-ac70-16d673bc46b7?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=11,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

76,77.0,Senior Data Scientist,Verizon,4.0,11400.0,"Constant tracking of percent to goals to ensure you hit your quotas. Fluctuating targets and metrics skew commission month to month. Fantastic benefits.Everyday at Verizon the job is a puzzle to figure out how best to serve the customer. Employees who are wholly committed to customer service in every aspect of their work life will persevere and do well. Verizon expects employees to be knowledgeable of and work towards marketing all of its products, all of the time. Sales are a huge part of the Verizon effort and all employees are expected to participate.I was so happy and pleased to work for such a prominent company as Verizon Wireless. The staff and co-workers were the best people I had ever met. I didn't mind going to work everyday because we had a pleasant, cohesive work environment. Everyone helped one another, which is the way it should be anyway. Their benefits were so right on time for employees-health benefits, tuition and promotions just to name a few good attributes. You just couldn't ask for a better work place.Verizon business in Highlands Ranch Colorado is not a fun place to work.  like going to work in a prison, the management all had delusions of granduer and were not very helpful.  They don't tell you this but, this segment used to be the Failed company MCI, your sitting around all day on the phone trying to sell IT.  The job would not be bad but management only cares for themselves and had inner circles that they would funnel leads to, their old colleagues from other firms.  It was actually comical how they acted and the culture was very low class and NOT conducive to career development and growthA typical day at work is fast paced , I've learned patience , and how to better people skills. My co workers  are awesome , and we work as a team and help each other  out . Not all management were always on the same page and it became some what unorganized at times . The hardest part was learning how to deal with escalated  customers . The most enjoyable art  were the people here and  incentives  to show appreciation for the employees.While working at Verizon, I used and learned multiple different sales techniques and each day was different. It was a very challenging work environment, due to the wide range of customer and accounts that I touched each day. As a solutions specialist, I was to analyze each account for possible savings and up-sells. Verizon prides themselves on customer satisfaction and we were to make each customer feel comfortable and valued, while making sure to meet all their needs. I enjoyed helping customers and pushing myself to meet the monthly requirements.To be plain and to the point . The turnover rate at this location is extremely Hugh. 1st clue- when you're outfought in for a panel interview , you are interviewed by the director of this call center. , 2nd clue Warch the facial clues and expression of the people that work on the call center floor. ( Morale is awful) The Director is smug and insulting (deliberate ). Especially when you have more call center experience then he. Not worth the money offered.Hourly and commission. Great benefits. Hours are your typical retail hours. Very numbers driven. Your managers make or break your job experience. Sales reps have too many responsibilities. You are also tech troubleshooting, customer service, we even have to handle inventory now. It can be very overwhelming and quota can be difficult to achieve with more unrelated responsibilities are stacking on.I answered customer calls regarding billing& account information, as well as cell plans and cell phone offerings.I learned Verizons' proprietary computer program, and also how to deal respectfully with customers.My co-workers were always willing to lend a hand or make suggestions about how the call could have gone better.The hardest part of my job was explaining why some customers cell reception was poor in mountainous areas.The best part of the job was talking to people from all over the states.Basically I talk to people all day about technology. As with any retail job you see all walks of life, some more difficult than others and some have no idea how to work their phone at all. Coworkers are great and fun to talk to between customers, management is very lax as long as sales goals are being hit. Pay is great for retail and it's allowed me to better my financial situation immensely.Challenging workplace with a steep learning curve, but a very exhilarating job.  Management was outstanding and co-workers on my team were second to none- with highest integrity.  Hardest part of the job was leaving it at work and the most enjoyable part of the job was enjoying my co-workers and my customers.  The relationships built with the customers over the years and helping them was the thrill I looked forward to each year.My current position is being moved to another location but the option to transfer is there with 10K in compensation to make the transition. You won't find compensation like this available at any other call center position. Job security is great and the management will work with you. unlike other call center jobs their centers are not revolving doors.This company treated us very well, including generous compensation and amazing benefits.  This is a company where the ""open-door"" policy is actually carried out and almost any person you meet is actually going to live out the company's credo.  Every supervisor/manager I ever talked to listen to me, treated me with respect and dignity, and was truly invested in my success and happiness as a person.  I am only leaving because my center is closing, but even with that they have given us 5 month notice, help with our resumes, job placement programs, and a guaranteed job with the company if we are willing to locate and a generous severance package.Lots of training and ongoing help through supervisor meetings, sales incentives, bonuses, opportunities for advancement. Very professional and supportive environment. Very clean. I enjoyed being able to help customers through professional and courteous interaction and listening skills. My work at Verizon was very enjoyable. Fun meetings. Great team to work with. Great benefits and cell phone discounts for employees.Typical day at work was taking calls most of the day. I learned that it can be very stressful in a call center. I also learned how to talk to people and react to certain situations. Learned deescalation techniques. Management wanted you to be successful. Co-workers were interesting to say the least. The hardest part of the job was dealing with intolerant customers with no common sense and making them happy. The most enjoyable part was the pay checks.I really enjoy it this particular company unfortunately at the time I have been there over a year and was still a contract worker and needed stability as an individual and that's the only reason why I chose to leave that company to be hired in as a full employee elsewhere.I remained neutral with all the constant daily changes and the nit picking from upper management. At first things would really get to me and I would take everything literally and personally and then I just became numb to it all.  Reported to work like a robot, did my job as best I could, Collected a paycheck at the end of the pay period, paid bills and the cycle repeated for a year.I really enjoyed the concept of this job, taking phone calls and having conversations with people to resolve their issues but they place their entire value of their employees on randomly generated surveys that for some reason seem to favor the few bad calls you'll get per day. Once you get a few negative surveys and your approval rating drops below 90% the management expects you to recover quickly or you may as well have a countdown on your head till terminationWhile working at Verizon Wireless, I was continually impressed with the continual training and options for career growth. I had no problem moving in whichever direction I wanted my career to go, especially due to the willingness of managers to assist and guide. It was also easy to work for an industry leading company in the wireless telecommunications field as the products and services are best in class.The actual job was very interesting and I was able to learn a lot from by experience.  My supervisor was very encouraged with my professionalism and ability to grasp the techniques needed to perform my job well.Great paying job if you work hard. The environment was very unprofessional and you had to rely on your own resources to be good at your job. management wasn't always there for you, they would encourage manipulation as a means to sale.","10,000+",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-11-29T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/0b973024-240f-48c6-8b57-cecc11cf06c4?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

78,79.0,"Data Scientist, Growth Marketing",Postmates,3.6,114.0,"I turn on the app and start getting request to pick up food from restaruants. Then I deliver the food to the person at their home or office. I usually hang out near the colleges where many students and professional request deliveries.I like to work in clean and organized places. I work in a simple and efficient way, I fulfill all the demands that.   Postmates in transforming the way local goods move around a city by enabling anyone to get any product delivered in under one hour .it wasn't and isn't your typical job.you work when you want, which as awesome. but traveling around the city burns a whole in your pocket. every delivery was a challenge.  racing miles through the city to bring a customer there favorite food. metrocard fares ate through most of my profits so i had to let it go.I like how it's flexible and i can do this as a second job but can't find a phone number to call and talk to a live person. Does anyone know of a phone number ?  I'd like to do this but I have many questions unanswered.😞.I work for Postmates when when I need some pocket change. When you're ready to work you just go online on the app. Its pretty easy. The man that manages it here on the west coast is laid back and he's pretty good at communicating with us to let us know when he's not going to be in town. You don't see your coworkers because everyone works independently. Hardest part of the job is making lots of money.Postmates is an awesome App platform to work with I only have positive things to say about Postmates, San Francisco, it gave me a     sense of personal accomplishment it was just very rewarding end to end.Postmates is ok, if you want a no hassle side job then postmates would work for you. If you are trying to take care of a household then you probably won't do well with postmates. The main issue I hated was to get jobs you had to drive around town, jobs are dispatched to the closest postmate. So there can be a lot of wasted gas and time. Also, they would often send me miles away to get food from certain restaurants and no matter what I did it wouldn't be warm upon arrival. Which means no tip for me and an unhappy customer. Customer service is a joke too. Once as a customer my order was wrong and all the company offered was a discount on delivery for my next order. So I was left with no immediate resolution, incorrect food and a company who didn't care. All in all, I left for a better courier company that not only paid much better but treated its drivers and customers like they matter.After two weeks and 104 deliveries, there is no pay, the dashboard show the earnings, but no transfer to my bank account, and the customer service is only through  email that  they never answered.A good extra income job. Good because you work whenever you want by simply turning on the app. It worked great for me because I'm on a motorcycle in Los Angeles traffic. If your in a car probably not so good. I wish I got compensated for my quickness and I also wish deliveries were sometimes closer together when dispatched. Overall good if your a college student who rides motorcycles looking for extra cash.You can create your own schedule and are never required to work . The only downfall is not having health benefits. Other than that, the fact that you are your own boss is amazing! As long as you get those two -three jobs an hour your hourly intake is awesome!Steady Eddie definition. someone who will not hit it and quit it - he'll be there for you whenever you need to get the big o. This job was always there for me when I needed that extra cash.  Convenient for everyone involved.  Decent company.  Decent pay.Easy and fast way to ear money. usually pretty busy throughout the day! company works well in helping you out when needed.Being a food deliverer for postmates was straight forward. You create your own schedule and are able to go online whenever you wanted to. Everything needed was on the app. However, when an issue came up with the order, Postmates customer service was non existent. There's no number to call when an order was difficult or not going through. If the issue was not for an active order, a request has to be emailed to Postmates, but they would never reply. Even to this day, I never received any responses for my many requests.The reaponsibilities are high. i make my own time, my own schedule, and I am my own boss. I like the fact that customer service is still involved. I am a people person , so seeing the satisfaction in a customers face makes me happy.Working for Postmates has been a fun, enlightening and flexible experience. There is a lot of support within the company from colleagues but sometimes management can be slow to make decisions. Overall it's a great company to work for that offers phenomenal benefits, as well as flexible work/life balance.Fun, laid back, and driven individuals. It is a typical start-up company environment. The people are nice, and you can expect the kitchen to be stocked.My experience, while working for Postmates, has been great. This company provides opportunities for it's employees to make money and explore the city of Chicago. I use the time I spend at work as exercise; it's a release.Got lured in because of the start up culture and all payed insurance. But everyone here gets treated like a number and there is zero job security. I got hired on as a quality analyst and within six months my role was outsourced to the same phillipines representatives I would analyze. There was no notice of the business decision and barely a compensation for the unexpected lay off. Don't work with them. You'll end up looking for a new job very soon.Working as a Courier was an ok job. This job requires you to be dedicated to the job in order to make a great outcome money wise. You also had to keep your customer rating up above 4.5 stars.This was the WORSE place I ever worked for.They treat their employees like numbers, not like human At All!! Anyone who is  thinking about working for Postmates, don't!  I rather drive for Uber than work for this uncaring and ignorant company.They have no culture. Their pay is very pitiful.fleet support isn't good, but if you find a way that works for you it can be beneficial for you.. depends city to city what payment you will receive",,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/da81b43a-83a1-4e5d-b2e9-d0e1b1e995d3?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

From day one, everything was hands on. Each sales rep would do all of their own lead generation, outbound sales calls, sales closing, and account management.

A very hardworking team that believe in knowledge sharing. Typical days starts checking our emails and ticketing system. I learned how the entire IT network works in different locations of government. Management were a complete delight considering they hold all to a high level of accountability. Co workers have turned into life long friends, the hardest part of the job is learning quick and adapting to different set ups in the network. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing how appreciated you felt from management after a hard day of work,Loved it! Did that job twice, and would do it again, met great people, my supervisor was a great guy! I worked with the best crew I could have been with both times. Once October 2002 to April 2003 and again October 2013 to April 2013. Got one year experience there. Also did gardening at City College Of San Francisco in the Horticulture Department while I attended school, students job and Volunteer Gardening at Laguna Honda Hospital & Rehab. Center. At College June 2009 to December 2011, and Laguna Honda May 2009 to February 2012. I moved to the East Bay & had no way to commute to the City every day.If you would not mind working 60+ hours a week, with constant hand off trials and knowing other people are getting promoted because they donated money to the DA's campaign or have other ""connections""... Then this is the place for you.Majority of the hard working DA's ended up leaving to go to other DA's offices.  A handful of good ones remain.   Unfortunately there is no real training in the office, and commonly lateral DA's would have to correct and teach their superiors the law.  SFPD is not considered an entity that you work with, given all the poliical head butting.  Unlike other counties where cops are more than willing to help and do their job, SFPD puts in the bare minimal due their long and challenging history with the DA's office.Money is great!I used to train users in Office 2000, via class set up or individually one one one for over 12 years. I was the top technician to complete work orders (user requests) on desktop (PC and laptop), remote and server issues including printers & telephone systems for over 15 years. this government agency was 10 years behind in technology when I left in 2011. the most gratifying part of my job for over 15years was to be able to teach the drivers and users that had never used a PC to be able to help them learn and relief their fear from using a computer or a laptop. And to also walk them thru an application problem either on the phone or in person, this city department has over 50 sites with users on computers.When I was employed with the city & county of San Francisco I worked for a redevelopment company called Urban Strategies. It was an experience I will never forget. Everyone was so caring and it was like one big family. Helping others get on the right track and is always a great way to spend the day.The location was difficult to handle since it was in the heart of San Francisco's Tenderloin district..... It was a learning experience since their average clientele was not average.

The most enjoyable part is the high quality of people; the education, experiences and skills.The company has phenomenal culture, cares for employees overall  and an outstanding benefits as long as you have a good manager, sometimes, you might get a bad one, but those are very few.A typical at day work supporting the manufacturing floor and providing support to upper management. Coworker’s very friendly and hard working. Most of the management team was friendly and easy to work with. The hardest part of my job was supporting two manufacturing buildings.  The enjoyable part of my job was traveling with some of my colleagues.Genentech is an example of effective entrepreneurial initiative to create a wonderful company.  The pipeline is ample within the oncology marketplace, but limited on other therapeutic categories.Genentech has a rich culture that inspires workers to achieve their career goals and give back to the community.There is great support to grow your career and receive feedback for positive growth.Everyday is a new learning challenge.  No day is alike.  I've learned to utilize applications and systems and also becoming for technical.The employees are amazing.  Everyone is willing to assist in any way.  The resources provided are very helpful and they thrive for career growth.make rounds with partner to other buildings to check levels of supplies and glassware as well as labware.  bring soiled labware and glassware back to our lab to clean/ sterilize and bake before delivering it back out.> Roche/Genentech is a heavy data driven culture.> Focus on results through collaboration (team heavy).  > Management focus on not just the results by how we achieve them (process definition).I worked for GNE for a total of 3 years as a Case Manager and later as a Foundation Specialist. I worked in the Access Solutions department doing reimbursment services as a case manager. This  consisited of relaying insurance benefits to patients and doctor's offices and referring patient's organizations that can provide co-pay assistance for particular specialty medications. As a foundation specialist, I provided free medication for those who met our criteria. Management there are very flexible and do not micro manage. These roles are very team oreinted, everyone I worked with were very friendly.I love working in genentech however the lack of growing or room for growth I shall say isn't as easy. It is very competitive and within some departments there are favoritism. Once one is a contractor its hard to get out of the contractor poll. The company does this because they would like to save as far as FTE count.Acumed has some really skilled machinist and they make some of the best orthopedic implant parts I have ever seen. The machinery is great and the operations are nice.Genentech is a great place to work! There are always opportunities to move up or move on within the company. They do a great job of training up their employees and giving them all the information necessary to do the job.A great place to work and offers a wide variety to opportunities for full time employees. Since Genentech is a brand name of Roche Inc, there a frequent need for domestic and international travel.High level of work load with short deadlines, with that being said , it is difficult to get a hold of people. Typical day is on the run from start to finish. People are nice and work is interesting, but workload is over whelming.Great place to work at. Benefits are great. Management needs work. They offer many incentives. You will move up fast in the company as long as you know the right people.This is a fun environment. We are all team players. I have learned many programs. It is great job security. The hardest part of my job is billing and having so many days to complete it.Genentech is a GMP environment so it is very important that while at work we do everything correctly and to standards, it is also important because we make medicine for extremely important patients.  The company also takes care of its employees they believe in a work life balance and make sure we have fun when we can while at work as well as have team building events, family is also very important.  Managers help out in any way possible and will also sit down and have lunch with you, they treat you as equals.  Everyone I work with are encouraging and helpful.  The benefits are amazing and the scheudle is also a great schedule.With this job, you need to be really flexible.  The work hours are in shifts.  You rotate with your Co-Teachers.  At times, you may need to switch shifts with another Co-Teacher.  This is something that everyone should be aware of when they apply for a job here.An excellent work life balance culture. The compensation and benefits are great. Genentech takes care of its own and as a company, strives to put out the best in putting patients first.Great place to work.  Work life balance is felt.   It feels good knowing what you do makes a difference.  I think the company puts it's people first and this is a good feeling as well.","10,000+",San-Francisco,South San Francisco,CA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/c0860624-4500-42cd-8fa8-4d675d1bd48d?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=19,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Here are some additional things to note: -We have an ability to work on projects that have a global impact from anywhere in the company which makes for interesting and challenging work and you learn a lot in a short amount of time.-People are not only the best at what they do, but they're also super humble and down to earth (i.e don't be intimated by all the ivy league linkedin profiles, they're also really cool, genuine people and you don't need to come from an ivy league school to work here contrary to what others say).-Prior to joining, I thought the team was much larger and much further along than it is and as a result there's a lot left to do as we scale and grow.

Benefits and pay are competitive for SF.  Workloads are high as many people leaders are not competent at managing others.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with smart people.  The hardest part of the job is taking some executives seriously that have no business managing other people.  The HBO series ""Silicon Valley"" should do a future season based on this company.The perks of the job are way better than the job itself. Being security there can be boring if you're not the favorite of the supervisor. Work loads are Not evenly distributed. There's no room for advancement and no guarantees to anything promised. But the Benefits are awesome and its definitely worth it not having to buy or bring lunch everyday.Dropbox was behind on invoice processing so brought in 3 temps to catch up, using NetSuite software. They also use their own software for email management; and also Zendesk for task management. That was new to me, so was a good learning experience.They have a very young group at Dropbox, so wasn't as professional as I'm used to. My manager was very supportive and always available for any questions or suggestions on process improvements.Fun place to work. Great management, great bonuses, overall great place to workAt Dropbox, there are a lot of really smart people tackling interesting problems.The compensation is great, the food is better than a majority of restaurants, and management trusts you to figure out how to get your work done.","1,001 to 5,000",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/abbd788b-727c-4575-931b-6c507639776b?mescoid=1300087001001&jobPosition=20,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

There are no hour requirements.Your typical warehouse job, very bland work. They do feed you, but some times they expect more work than is physically possible.I learned more about how to work with and teach people who may be having difficulties with certain subject matter. This job has really helped me to hone my problem solving and interpersonal skills.The system requires students to post a question on the board, and the first tutor to respond earns the chance to answer his question.There was four application processes as a temporary position which was interesting. Working in telecommunications for the first time was an eye opening experience. I was able to get promoted to chat and do instant messaging full time with a small pay increase.

I was not mentally challenged. I did not have a bad experience, but knowing that it was only a temporary position I felt a lack of motivation. I would have also preferred a cooler climate.CHEGG is a nice place to work, friendly, but hardly anyone gets hired permanently. They said it was because it is seasonal and they only needed a few full time people because during off season, there are only the leaders and two or three supervisors. they didn't get 40 hrs. a week then, not enough work.receiving books and inspecting themlearned how to use different machineshardest part: standing on your feet for long shiftsenjoyable: payrateGreat place to work, enjoyed, balanced and flexible, enjoyed working hereGreat place to work. Fun friendly work environment the biggest problem is you come in as a temp and you may or may not get hired after you work 1,000 hours in a calendar year.GREAT PAY!! Very busy and can be a very fast paste environment. typical day of work for me was to pick books, stage them, then ship them back. Employee's are great with making team members well rounded by training them in every aspect of the warehouse.Everyday is a learning experience.  Especially in the field of Human resources.  There are a wide range of full time and temporary employee issues that all need to be handled in a unique way.  This job had afforded me the opportunity to learn and grow within my field.I'd go in and one day i could be picking books, the next i could be shipping books, and the next or same i could be shelving or relocating books.My day would start off projecting how many orders will have to be shipped out and how much product is coming in.  Once that is decided, then I would need to place employees accordingly to where I would need them to meet the deadlines of the shipments.  My co-workers were great, they knew what had to be done and always knew they had to do whatever it took to get the job done.  The biggest thing I have learned while working at Chegg is that ""never ask anyone to do anything that you aren't willing to do yourself"".  I enjoyed going to work everyday, it was an atmosphere where everyone was happy to be there.This place was such a mess. Millions of books misplaced. No one seems to care about the organization.Not wanting to be there.I have not learned anything at Chegg. I walked in on my first day and knew how to do most of the jobs do to previous warehouse work.Unprofessional and favoritism.

Contribute to a constructive work environment by consistently treat all Gap Brans workers and shoppers with respectThe typical day at work, for my position, is fast paced. I learned how to think on my toes and to merchandise in unique ways to sell product to customers. The management team is diverse, with a specific work ethic that all follow. The hardest part of the job is to complete shipment on time. The most enjoyable part is having control of all inventory, knowing what's in and what's out for the store, and talking directly to management about all the exciting things that will happen for the company.I worked for this company at the height of its popularity and found it to be a great place to work.  I would definitely go back to work for them if I wanted to get into retail management again.It was very exciting and fun job. I learned a lot about the retail business and had the ability to apply those skills in my future jobs. Management was poor and there was a lack of communication, but your coworkers were your family and the atmosphere was usually positive.Management gives you the opportunity to grow and get involved in other areas that make up company. I've had the opportunity to do so and I have to say it pays off.good place to work great benefits, peak season are long and tiring with long days and multiple days worked without a day off. Would recommend for hourly employmentGap was a short seasonal job. I absolutely love the atmosphere because it is so lively, but the pay was very low and there was literally only 4 to 8 hour weeks.A typical day at work requires us to sell and know about the products we are selling.You have to learn about the items and know what is best for each customer.

The job was not that hard its just frustrating working on holidays.the people are great very fun for a first job very outgoing people, gets busy during holidays so expect to be always moving, loved where it was located because at lunch or after work you have the court yard or can go shopping in the outlet, and the discount you get is great.I love this place, I love the people. The job is so easy and fun and I enjoy working here. A typical day at work can vary from shipment to fitting room to cashier and its always different and fun. I love my coworkers most of them are very nice and fun to be around. The hardest part is dealing with messy costumers and being on my feet all day.Great place to work with the people that is around you as they help you develop skills. Be prepare to work hard and always greet the customers no matter.Gap is a great place to work. The employees are like a second family and it doesn't even feel like work.

They are willing to work with me on my schedule.The location, I worked at specifically, had an amazing management team and sales associates were just as great.

Autodesk is a powerful enabler in many spaces, and smart, young people can truly excel in this company.Autodesk transformed drafting and design back in the 1980's, and they continue to lead the world in engineering technology, design, visualization and future techologies (e.g., additive manufacturing, green buildings and engineering simulation). Great benefits and above-scale pay. Super corporate stewardship for many sustainable efforts - Autodesk gives back to the world.In the right team, you'll have fun while changing the world. The average Autodesker is more than just smart - he or she is probably a fun-loving prankster / comedian, too. Seriously, the work atmosphere is intense but when this they take a break from their task lists, the majority of functional teams have a great time together. This alone can make work at Autodesk very, very worthwhile.Autodesk is a progressive software company with excellent benefits and compensation.  It's a great place to work for someone who wants constant change.Sync up statusDaily stand upWork on the tasks allocatedFriendly and supportive team matesImplementing APIsAWS SQSAgile methodologiesEveryone is very good to you and work space is very good.

Also the job allowed me to get a great I deal on how to satisfy the customer.Autodesk is recently expanding into the world of manufacturing. They have little experience with direct customer support which is making the next few years questionable from the standpoint of stability.Great organization.Management very flexible,accessible, and well informed about the work that needs to be done, and overall willing to give you the support the you need. Supervisors are not always looking over your shoulder and you are given space to implement new ideas about the processes.I was given the opportunity to use my knowledge and skills and also to learn from my co-workers. I got a lot of support from everyone around me with not hesitation or reserve.  Great working environment. Benefits are good and good work/job balance.Company held and promote workers-social gathering within the facilities or outside the facilities. The facilities are great (very clean and modern. Co-workers are always willing to help no matter in what part of the country (USA) or over-sea they are located.Some positions have the option to work from home or at the office.  This is a very technological oriented organization.It was a great place to work not much else to say. Everyone worked together and everyone's ideas were put to use. I traveled about 50% of my time with the company. The travel was almost always 5 days at a time and almost never 2 weeks in a row.I really enjoy my time working at Autodesk the environment is very open and the people to work with are very nice.My major complaint is it is very difficult to apply anywhere else internally. If you are working through a contract you could be let go at any moments notice without any notification ahead of time.Dirty politics played by bad management because they don't have the skills to do the job.Regular layoffs for people who don't cater to managment.Steady outsourcing increase so no job security.Upper management burning reserves buying incompetent companies.While the leadership of the support group seem to care, they in fact are more concerned with their spread sheets, than their employees and customers.Great people, great benefits and great products. The technology is cutting edge and you have opportunity to work with every type company manageable.Management teams are excellent.Co-workers work very hard.Company culture is focused on results.There is a lot of overtime available which is excellent for those with a strong work ethic. Overall, the company culture is evolving to build a better work life balance For those who are dedicated, there are a lot of opportunities for advancement.Great company, solid business model, but has too many changes with management & uncertainty in the upcoming times.Big potential if you survive through the changes.American multinational software corporation that makes software for the architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, media, and entertainment industries.Collaborative - Constructive - environment where team work and team culture are kings.Provided learning opportunities and career growth.Best job ever!I can't say enough good about Autodesk.  I loved my time there.  They treat there employees so well.  I was rookie of the year my first year in sales and was the only one of my team that was over quota.  Love Autodesk.Working remotely for Autodesk allowed me to work from my own home and study, which was a newer experience, but one I end up thoroughly enjoying. The day would start off with a general meeting over Skype or Google Hangout, to discuss what we had accomplished the previous day, and what to work on in the upcoming hours. After about halfway through the day, we would have another meeting about our progress so far, and if there were any issues along the way.I got to experience working with a small-knit group of 5, and being the only artist in the team, I was helping to direct the creative direction, and alert the team to any artistic aversions to the software. We worked with a soon-to-be released version of Autodesk Stingray, to prepare it for public use. I was also working heavily with virtual reality (VR) for the first time in a while, and it helped me get a better understanding of the development technology. The best part of this job was the ease of access I had at any given time. I did not have to leave anything at the office because my study became my office for Autodesk, which let me have everything at arm's length if I needed it.There were some technical issues with data transferring software as well as the newer implementation of VR with the pre-existing technology, but these were eventually remedied.Fun place to work great team and lots to learn. There is constant change to keep it exciting. Great Product that is needed in the market.Worked there for several years.  Back in the mid-1980's there were some fun, fun times.... but with the increase in need for more corporate structure, those days are sadly a memory... though fond memories :)Autodesk has a great product and employees can be proud to work for a company with such a good reputation.  The people are terrific and the space in SF is pretty awesome.  However, management is very uneven and not everyone is on the same page.  There are a lot of mixed messages.  Beware of younger managers and those who have been with the company less than 2 years. They are eager, ambitious, and have little-to-no training on how to manage people.  Loyalty and tenure are not valued at Autodesk, and the company does a major reduction in force about every 3-4 years, focusing on releasing employees who have been with the company more than 10 years.","5,001 to 10,000",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-11-24T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/795ba7d0-79a0-4094-8aaa-9c01bb308036?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

As soon as I presented my difficulties to my main point of contact they intervened and helped to complete my onboarding. Overall the expereince has been pleasant and I have thoroughly enjoyed the work I've done as a Multimedia Specialist.Mindlance is a horrible agency to work for!!  I was employed for 2months was in a bad car accident reported it that night to my boss and due to my injuries I wasn't able to work and 7 days later they fired me because I was in a car accident. Now trying to get them to sign a wage loss form for a lawyer is impossible they claim they don't know if I was suppose to work. Won't returns emails, hang up on me.Mindlance found my resume online and contacted me for a temp position.I loved working for the client, but would have wanted a long term commitment. I had no interaction with the management of Mindlance.My co-workers were of that of the client, so I had no Mindlance co-workers.The hardest part was the interview possessor with Mindlance, everything was communicated via e-mail.Friendly,family-like,very productive working environment and I have enjoyed working with them. It is very good management,respectable and helpful working environment.Company assigns employees to contract work with other organizations. Low pay with benefits, based on contracting business. Little contact with company after employment.It depends on the company you work for or assigned to.  For the most part working for Mindlance is great.I have learned new software contracting for Anthem Healthcare.Management has been wonderful and helpful.I have yet to work with other Mindlance employees.The hardest part of the job has been working for a company I cannot locally visit.The most enjoyable part of the job is working for the contractors I am assigned to.Great work environment. Co-workers were friendly, helpful, and collaborative. The most enjoyable part of my job was the research and development.Effective and complaint bridge to the client company.

Alwasy quick to get the things I need or answer questions I haveContract worker for them for a year. Terrible; no benefits, no support, nothing. Didn't even make contact as my contract came to an end. Only spoke to them about twice.Mindlance located my resume online and hired me over the phone.  It was one of the most thorough and professional opportunities of my work life.Co-workers and team leaders are easy to work with but company benefits are pretty poor.

I worked at Cigna Healthspring. There you work all the overtime you want as long it is available.I corrected pharmacy claims. The assignment was easy but tedious, the hardest part of the job was the lack of supervision.A typical day on this assignment was setting up depositions, medical appointments, updating attys calendars with hearings and depositions, opening mail and filing documents into EAMS as appropriate.I learned that I am productive and needed by the attys I assisted and loved working with them.Minimum supervision which was lovely because it allowed me to do my work without distraction.Co-workers were helpful and kindThere were no ""hardest"" parts of the job just tedious tasks which were essential to the job.I enjoyed preparing letters, pleadings and notices and gathering documents for medical appointments.",,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-11-15T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/f70ddd6f-2917-4032-a007-6949cf9de8c8?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=28,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

93,94.0,Data Scientist - Marketing,McKinsey,4.3,173.0,"*Smart, hard-working people everywhere you look*Management invests in helping individuals develop professionally*Collaborative, supportive environment (if occasionally stressful)*Fantastic topics that matterFun environment where employees become a close knit community and become life long friends.  Employees are highly intelligent and have rock solid values.  The benefits are incredible, and work/life balance is a priority.  The only drawback is that there isn't any growth opportunity for the support staff.  As a non-hierarchical company, employees are all equal, so promotions do not exist.  Unfortunately, the job responsibilities never change, which can eventually create boredom in this position even though the position is very fast paced with a heavy workload.I have enjoyed working for this company and have gained a lot of experience in accounting, finance, HR, and office management. However, the opportunity to expand and grow in the finance field is rather limited and doesn't fully align with my ultimate career goals.Most management that work under Procurement- GPG- do not have experience in procurement. They are only there because they know someone higher up. It's a great company if you work on the consulting side and starting at the bottom will not get you there. They only hire consultants from top 10% in ivy league schools. If you work as an assistant in procurement, be careful who your managers are. Some will belittle you, yell at you in from of people over the most stupid thing and require you to take a test before being hired which doesn't apply to assistant work at all. Benefits are great if you are a full time employee and they won't let you take time off in the first year. Following year, approach with caution. This place is all about politics and favoritism. If you get on the wrong side of a manager, you won't get a promotion. They are experts are making you believe you will move up and when the time comes they will give you some excuse. They will try to give you the least amount of money and work you like a dog.Only good to put on resume because of the name.I need to put 150 characters here. It was a good experience and I learned a lot when working here. The culture and atmosphere simply fostered excellence.They really try to build you up and make you succeed in your time there, helping with advancement.They keep the kitchen fully stocked and have regular reviews to ensure the entire team understands where the projects stand and how to improve/lessons learned.Many e-mails.  Travel arrangements. Meeting scheduling.Learned to be extra pro-active.Management of support staff is fair.Great peers - always ready to help each other.Hardest part of job is constant change of schedules.Enjoyable part of job is figuring out complex travel arrangements and offering solutions.Exceptional workplace where you get to work with some really smart people. You get to do interesting work in a fast paced environment.  Limited advancement opportunities and professional development.McKinsey & Company is one of the top companies to work for but beware that this only applies if you have a career as a Consultant, Engagement manager, etc and working on the Client side.  However if you're working in Operations, Reconciliations, Card Service, Purchasing, Procurement... you won't have a life, you will be humiliated, yelled at and you will put in more than 50 hours a week. Yes you'll have great benefits and vacations but you'll work during your vacation or expect a call from your manager.  If you leave on vacation, you'll pay the price when you return.  It's a nightmare.  Some that have been there for several years, are use to this type of treatment and think this is normal. Leaving that place was the best thing I've done!!  The only positive thing was to have McKinsey in my resume which it landed me a great job with great people who actually treat me with respect. I want people to know so they won't go through the same nightmare I went through. If you land an interview, please ask the right questions, make sure this place is for you.  Ask the employees questions about their supervisor, manager, etc, ask them if there happy, ask about work & life balance. Think twice about it if you have a family and kids... because you won't be spending much time with them.Pros: fast learning curve; working with smart people; exposure to a variety of different topics/industries;good training programs and exit optionsCons: poor life balanceLarge variety of challenging clients & situations across the globe and incredible people to work with.  Plenty of opportunity and ability to forge your own path.A place where you can explore you area of interest. Good people. Daily you will learn new things . You can travel all around the Globe on various engagements.This company has many good qualities preferred skills and knowledge can be implemented in future job replacements to better advance your professional needs.Come in early and enter day in a very easy going environment.

Working around the strict budget placed on IT.People:-- Surrounded by some of the most talented, impact-driven people of any organization-- Contrary to most expectations, the people are interesting and interested, and much more interested in solving problems than career advancement or office politics.Lifestlye:-- Travel and hours can be challenging, but most of it is self-enforced. There is a tradeoff between location/lifestyle/sector for any project, and you can't always have all 3.Too many arrogant people... although others are very nice.Your life depends completely on your engagement manager.

Contribute to a constructive work environment by consistently treat all Gap Brans workers and shoppers with respectThe typical day at work, for my position, is fast paced. I learned how to think on my toes and to merchandise in unique ways to sell product to customers. The management team is diverse, with a specific work ethic that all follow. The hardest part of the job is to complete shipment on time. The most enjoyable part is having control of all inventory, knowing what's in and what's out for the store, and talking directly to management about all the exciting things that will happen for the company.I worked for this company at the height of its popularity and found it to be a great place to work.  I would definitely go back to work for them if I wanted to get into retail management again.It was very exciting and fun job. I learned a lot about the retail business and had the ability to apply those skills in my future jobs. Management was poor and there was a lack of communication, but your coworkers were your family and the atmosphere was usually positive.Management gives you the opportunity to grow and get involved in other areas that make up company. I've had the opportunity to do so and I have to say it pays off.good place to work great benefits, peak season are long and tiring with long days and multiple days worked without a day off.

The job was not that hard its just frustrating working on holidays.the people are great very fun for a first job very outgoing people, gets busy during holidays so expect to be always moving, loved where it was located because at lunch or after work you have the court yard or can go shopping in the outlet, and the discount you get is great.I love this place, I love the people. The job is so easy and fun and I enjoy working here. A typical day at work can vary from shipment to fitting room to cashier and its always different and fun.

It's a company where you can have a career without wanted to leave, however for personal reasons I'm going to move to US, therefore I might need to leave SAP.Great management that leads with a proactive strategy that leads to great sales execution in almost all of their business units. Constantly adapting to newer customer demands and the ability to satisfy these demands with newer cloud based technologies that are typically more efficient for businesses to adapt and cheaper.would help visitors and employees out on the daily about questions they had about the campus, had to go to multiple office buildings for each department. Helped on side projects and would break relief the receptionistsWe were bought out by SAP. It's hard not to notice that they put most of their primary investments behind Sales and to a lesser extent Marketing.  Software Developers and Engineers typically take a back seat. While they may pay more across the board, they overwork the development staff.  Understaff software, overstaff sales.The movement in this job is great. Never the same position more than twice, always something new going on, the excitement at a San Jose Sharks game is fantastic.

I traveled by air, more that 100,000 air miles each year and it became awful after 911. I learned a lot from this company regarding adult education, in which we taught classes to 26+ adults each week, both at the home office and customer locations. We were required to teach more classes than the job requirements called for and that was unfortunate. The company also had a preference of hiring German instructors.You have all of the knowledge that there is right at your fingertips.Management will always support you on achieving your goals and for you to become a better resource each and everyday.Working at SAP is like flying in your dream.There is always work, but not always good support to get all work done and done well.  Not possible to get fired, but could be downsized at a whim. Flex hours don't truly exist, which is silly in the advanced tech world.Good PTO and bonus programsGreat co-workers; love to wordsmith.

104,105.0,Data Scientist,Yelp,3.8,130.0,"Too much time is spent attending to incidents or working around incidents from other teams. Many managers are new/first-time managers and lack the necessary skills to be effective at their jobs while others are handi-capped by the company's culture of super hands off management. Morale is generally poor-whatevs.Great company that sells a great product, but there's not many interesting positions to move up from entry-level.  Extensive sales training, and excellent benefits.Each day consists of a high volume of cold calls and emails sent out to SMB owners. Management varied, with some managers just one year out of the account executive role. Issues with that were panic when things weren't going well.Yelp is a great company. Employees are treated well with a fully stocked kitchen for breakfast and lunch, great health benefits, and great people. The pay is definitely on the lower side. The most negative aspect was the job itself. The day to day is strictly cold calling businesses to sell the advertising program. It can be very monotonous. Also many of the business owners are busy and do not want to speak to you. It's a hard job to find enjoyment in.I spent almost 2 years at Yelp. It's a rollercoaster. Full of great colleagues, awesome mentors, and a challenging job (but once you get the hang of it you'll pitch-on-the-fly and feel like a boss).You are responsible for the full sales cycle. From introduction to close. You will have difficult conversations about selling them Yelp ads with SMB prospects. It's challenging, but what you will also have a team, an organization, readily available for you to learn and execute with.I owe everything I know about my profession to this opportunity I got here.Thanks Yelp! :)Yelp is pretty cool.I would recommend it to someone if there was a job opening they were into.Great free snacks. Not so great compared to other companies in the area, but definitely above average. Beer! I've never liked hanging out at an office after hours before. I do that somewhat regularly here.Flexible Hours with the option to work from home when necessary.Sweet health benefits and they're pretty generous with stock even for us lowly user ops workers.Average good-ish time off/sick timeOverall company good about providing important updatesUnfortunately none of this is enough to make up for the crushing boredom that eventually sets in with moderating content. They tell you straight up when you start not to really expect this to go anywhere. It's kinda sad since we have a lot of talented, intelligent people on the team wasting their smarts. I can feel myself getting dumber from all the terrible punctuation and block paragraphs that I have to read all day long. Go on though, do it a year or two and then move along. It's a great job as one of your first out of college. You don't have to wear real clothes or show up at a specific time and that's all real real nice.""Fun"" environment for the most part. Though in our particular department there is a lot of forced fun that really gets irritating for a cynic like me. It's kinda silly since they actually advertise the position as being for introverts. It's a little tone deaf. Like the time they had us spin some Harry Potter sorting hat for assigned seats at lunch. Yep... actual adults arranged that forced  more... mingling situation with a group full of introverts. They also recently instituted music on Friday afternoons and it is the worst. There are a lot of management things that make the job really stressful. But I think I mostly just get petty and mad because I am so so bored. You'll have fun for a while doing this job probably. But it really does show you a bad side of humanity. There are some awful opinions that I was not used to coming across. That can be tough. But it's nothing awful like if you were moderating beheadings content for that popular video upload website.  less70+ outbound cold calls daily to SMB's in a assigned territory. Setting 15-20 minute appointments with clients to discuss and pitch the Yelp platform. These BO's already have Yelp pages that most likely have traffic to that listing. Pitch and close the prospects. Get to quota, make some decent cash. However, you must follow the process and be a quick learner. It's easy to fall into habits and not grind it out. Stand up. Take each call with a clean slate, but don't be afraid to mess up and quickly try out a new method again.  Yelp can be a great place for a couple years, but it's a daily grind and not for the weak minded.Great company to work for with a startup culture. Interacted with my peer on a daily basis to create a strategy to bring in sales for the online food ordering application.Similar to plenty of other reviews I have read, tons of kids fresh out of college who have no idea that there ARE better options out there. They lure you in with all the free food and music and games and stuff but dont tell you about the cold calling and if you dont hit these metrics on the head then you will be shown the door. Managers may ""act"" like they care about you or your home life but at the end of the day you are just a number. training structure is way out of order. They throw you to the wolves the second week on the job and then give you information in a training 2-3 weeks later that would have increased your odds of getting a appointment/sale. Lots of tasks to accomplish on a daily basis but not enough time to complete them all and then you are hit with the no excuses card when you are not pulling your weight. On the flip side, fantastic place to work, free food all day, game rooms and music, lots of stuff nearby.Great for younger kids with no responsibilities!!One of my favorite parts about my work day is that each day is unpredictable. I never know who I am going to talk to and as a result, I get to learn about so many unique and interesting businesses, people and meet a lot of entrepreneurs that educate me, too.The best perk is definitely the people and culture… and I suppose our brand new office with shuffleboard, ping pong and Rock Band. But truly, I get to work side by side with amazing, talented people every day.Yelp is a fun place to work with a youthful environment.  Through a combination of hard work and getting a good territory you have an opportunity to be very successful.No one likes cold-calling, but that's what you're going to be doing every day. Yes, you get the freedom to churn the whole sales process from open calling to closing, but managing that while handling objections is a tough sell. Co-workers are friendly, and management could be held to another standard. Hard to differentiate managers as friend or micromanaging sticklers, because people move up quick in this job. It can be very emotionally draining and dry, so mentality is everything in this job.I am given tools to be my own boss and impact my own small business. I am also able to change businesses in a positive light. Every work day was an extremely exciting opportunity.I used Yelp and the opportunities they had to further my experience in an office setting. Although the floor was noisy, we got a lot of work done!This company is laid back and very little stress as far as the Eat24 department goes. I mean super laid back...people were drinking on they're shift, smoking pot on lunch and a fist fight erupted one day. The floor managers show favoritism to the people in they're clique. If your looking for a career this is not the place to advance. If your fresh out of high school and just looking to pay your phone bill and money to blow on random stuff this place is your ideal job. The pay is minimum wage. In my personal experience it was not a company that I could advance in because there were no core values set by the employer and no advancement opportunities to further my career within the company. It does though have fully stocked kitches with every drink and snack you can imagine and the 7th floor has baristas that serve several different beverages for free along with fully stocked kitchen to make your own sandwiches. Very beautiful building in the financial/shopping district.I remembered being excited for the chance to find a job at ""Yelp"" in the heart of downtown San Francisco. Boy did I delude myself, Firstly this company (Yelp EAT24) feels so separate from Yelp its insane. I receive questions about Yelp that I have no idea how to answer since its a separate entity. Secondly I work in a glorified call center, it might have a fancy title and ""cool benefits"" like beer on tap, and free snacks, but all I do daily is apologize to people and tell them their food is on the way. Plus I work nights so they ""perks"" don't apply to me as I never have the chance to get beer. It so sad that someone with a college degree and three majors cannot find a better job and that HR cannot find a better fit for me. Lastly, and the most disheartening part is I was told it would be about a year to transfer to Yelp proper. Are you serious??? I have to take a year of working from 3 PM to 11:30 PM while simultaneously giving up my nights and weekends for a little over minimum wage. I applaud anyone that has lasted in this position because I feel myself dying a little more inside every time I clock in to start working.I applied to intern at Yelp and they ruined my summer. They kept me waiting for two whopping months and now it really made me mad. They have no respect towards low income students who are trying to support a family. The people who are in charge of HR need to be clear and not act childish when picking who should get an intern position. Good thing is that their office is laid back and happy.The fun atmosphere with music, ping pong and common chatting with other employees has made Yelps culture fun. The managers are super hands on in trying to help out to ensure the growth of each employee.start at 730 get yelled at by manager. Start cold calling, anytime you get up you get yelled at by manager to get back on phone. Make to many calls get yelled at again, make to little yelled at. Micromanaged and were put on kid teams (my team name was the queen bees).This is my first sale job and overall experience has been positive.You will go into training and be expected to learn and implement feedback. With each month that goes by the expectations will go up. It will seem fun in the beginning with the games, free coffee, open cafeteria, and a keg for after hours but it gets old and you just want to go home and relax. You will dial 70 + call a day and be expected to hit 2.50 hours talk time. The job can be high stress at times and if you close a deal directors, managers, and other people will cheer your wins. At times if your not closing it can feel disappointing and you feel forgotten and question if this is the job for you. Going into this job you have to have a thick skin, implement feedback, work hard, adjust to things that might not go your way because this is sales.Typical day is about 9-10 hours with an hour lunch break. If you want to be successful you have to put some extra time into the job. Managers are great and the sales curriculum is top notch. Honestly love the company, but cold calling 65+ times a day can become taxing.","1,001 to 5,000",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-10-27T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/daf4efc5-884d-47fa-ad10-52ef719d88a7?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Overall a typical workday is not that stressful but the exciting innovating times seem to be a thing of the past.","501 to 1,000",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-10-26T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/98a1bfd2-706d-4c03-b2ed-aefabdd01db8?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Competitive salary.I worked putting New Fabric away in the morning as well as carts that were left from the night before.  All day long waiting on customers and helping customers get what they need to help with their problems and accompise  what they want as the end result. I would help put freight away as well. When new modes came down i would help if not set new modes until the last of my working there then they had a mod team that did them at night.  I always took the old patterns in our file cabinet out and put in the new ones that came in.Walmart was attempting to implement a new inventory management system for stocking and back stocking. Unfortunately, the hand-held devices were outdated and malfunctioned often. Additionally, there was not enough space in the back room for proper and safe storage of products.I like working at Wal Mart because they do not laid off. I dislike  Working at Wal Mart because it's open year round and it is closed only Christmas. This is a retail store which involve working all the time. Everyone must work as team in order to complete a job. The hardest part of the job is working Management and customers. Worker are required to please both customers and Management. The most enjoyable part of the job is employer discount and worker can transfer from one state to another.A day at Walmart consisted of breaking down the newly deliverd product and restocking shelves making sure they stayed stocked throughout the day while at the same time helping coustomers.Walmart had a very interactive managment team that was always willing to show how things are done or help you out if things where running behind. My co-workers at Walmart where my life line, we worked together like a well oiled machine to get through the day.The hardest part about working at Walmart was the fluctuating schedule while the best part of the job was interacting with the coustomersThe managers rarely communicated with the supervisors which made it hard for them to communicate with employees. The managers assumed that the supervisors were mind readers when it came to certain task. Most managers didn't help with checkout when the store would be really busy. They would pull employees from other departments of the store which then put those departments behind with getting their own work done.. check email for recalls/ shipments for the day/ call ins.check sales reports from the day before.check status of stores condition.follow up with department manager to follow up on work load for the day.. morning meeting with store staff to go over previous day sales, report due and associates on anniversaries and birthdays..The most enjoyable part of the day is knowing that you turned a profit from the previous day and your hard work was well worth it..As a People Greeter, in Conroe, Texas, and Anchorage, Alaska, I enjoyed meeting the people and assisting them, by answering questions they might have.  In Anchorage, I was also, a People Greeter, but transferred to Automotive, and Hardware as a clerk in those departments.  Excellent work ethic, and attendance.Report to work 15 minutes early, check duties, learned new concept and how to utilize new data listed on the wire (information system), Check with management to see if any additional duties need to be completed, work as a team with co-workers to complete all tasks assigned, the hardest part of my job is keeping the area straight after customers leave a mess, the most enjoyable part of my job is assisting, satisfying and making customers happy.Meet the target set by the company, provide good after sales service, Look into the complaints made by the customers as they help in improving the overall product, researching and survey customer satisfaction, Give ideas regarding offers to boost sales, maintain accurate records for sales which help in deriving the right figures, give feedback to higher management about the product.At Walmart we had a lot of worker and for the most part everyone got along and tried to make our days at work as easy as possible. i learned how to drive an electric pallet jack, how to work with other people. the hardest part of this job is when someone is not present, someone else has to cover the shift which means double work but other than that it wasn't really hard. i enjoyed the workers and the times we had.*Upper management lacks respect when speaking to other salaried management employees and hourly associates. *Company wants ""more for less."" (requiring salaried employees to work more than 15+ hours per/shift)*The hardest part of this job is assigning tasks to a shift that is always short-staffed, and dealing with disgruntle employees.* Motivating the associates and seeing their end results is the most enjoyable part of my job.The work conditions are deplorable when your hours are not being cut. Upper management is of no support and the things corporate sends down clearly looks good on paper written by a bunch of people who have CLEARLY never done the job. There is a sign that hangs in every Walmart for all employees to see that states the employees are on the front lines so they're whom should be listened to. Most employees understand it's just for decoration.People who work terribly are treated better than people who work hard, and if you work hard and bend your back for your managers they will continue to add more and more work and ask for more and more favors and will not consider you, your health or your personal life if something occurs. They don't treat you as humans beings. You're an accessory to them, a slave that gets paid (not nearly enough) to do everything for them.My time at Wal-Mart was something of an experience. My co-workers were more interested in trying to find ways to trick the system into letting them pay $5 for a new game that just came out rather than actually doing their job. Also management has this ability to completely ignore your school schedule and have you scheduled to come in to work 10 minutes after your class across campus from your dorm let out and would get mad about me being late. They didn't understand the fact that school came before work to me so I left.At Walmart a typical day would be me cleaning the toy department and getting it cleaned up for the next few customers. I have learned how to provide correct customer service and provide good advice and further information for my customers. My managers that worked for walmart, could have handled their jobs better then how they did. But I must say that my job was cool. My co-workers were amazing , they were easy to work with and they were very funny, the hardest part of my job was dealing with angry customers. But the most enjoyable part was getting to work around such amazing people.I loved working here most days. I was let go due to unfortunate events that got int the way. Sadly, there is some unfair treatment from certain salaried managers. Some of them will treat you poorly if you can't be with them or do them favors, if understood properly. I noticed I was frequently getting spoken to or getting in trouble shortly after refusing someone. Just watch out for that. Aside from this issue, the pay is eh. But you'll love who you work with. They make it easy for every day to be a good day.Can be a fair place to work if you are attending school. They try to be flexible with employees if they have children by allowing you to work day or night. The work is not hard work for the most part, but it can be very busy work. Most of the management are pretty fair with employees. The co-workers tend to be friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job is having to stock a double truck of merchandise in a short amount of time. The most enjoyable part of the job is receiving bonuses.This position keeps me very busy and allows me to get to know a lot of people and work with others.  Although I do really like this job, I don't see it as an end all beat all position as it doesn't provide me with many challenges except for that of having to find a way to get all things done with a limited amount of resources.Going in to this job can make your day a better day if your day isn't going to well you'll get to interact with others,having good co-workers can really be fun also having someone to talk to someone you may learn to trust and in companies such as this one we was more like a family.The hardest part of the job for me was when an associate would call out so therefor i would have to go harder to keep my department looking good.What i loved the most about the good was when our customers are satisfiedA day at Walmart consisted of breaking down the newly delivered product and restocking shelves making sure they stayed stocked throughout the day while at the same time helping customers. Walmart had a very interactive management team that was always willing to show how things are done or help you out if things where running behind.

111,112.0,Data Scientist (macys.com),"Macy's, Inc.",3.7,14600.0,"A typical day at Macy's consists of selling women's shoes to customers, while maintaining a positive attitude and openness to questions or concerns, while ringing up customers and making sure that there is a clean and orderly sales floor for people to shop. With this job I have learned to deal with the personalities of others and to be more open to changes and also to aim high in all that I do.  My co workers and I usually work as a team and cover each others shifts when needed. The hardest part of the job is making sure everything is done on time, due to the many steps and the doable responsibilities. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and being able to earn small token s of appreciation, like extra money and discounts. And of course Management; which is great. Management at Macy's understands that there is more to life than just the store. Allowing the needs of its employees to be met as best.Macy's is a company that i do not recommend staying in for more than 3 years. Managers are unprofessional and do not help the growth of their associates. They do work with your schedule to an extent. The managers are only concern with what benefits them as well as their Macy's card statistics. Again I would not recommend anyone staying passed at least 2 years with this company.Macy's is a great place to work as well as shop. I enjoyed being a salesperson. This job prepared me to working in a salesperson type atmosphere and helped with all communication skills.Working in Macys they gives you the option to have a flexible schedule , it may be minimun pay but atmosphere of store its pretty great. I liked working in Macys.Working for Macy's I personally learned and had complete access to the tools needed for success. Working here I received something known as a Macy's Stars which congratulates awesome customer service.The atmosphere is great to work in and the staff is really friendly and outgoing. its easy going and a great experience for retail.I did not like the way my job ended here. There was no notification from my manager in person, just a message on the scheduling thing that my employment would be ending because I was seasonal. With the closing of Cortana Mall's Macy's, their employees transferred, while I was replaced by a fulltime employee from Cortana.Macy's management team as well as the support team all work together to complete the goal for the day. Friendly staff whom all love thier jobs and etc.I liked working with macys, easy work and easy to learn. Poor management in my opinion. Different management would bring me to reapply.A typical day consists of marking down merchandise that has been scheduled by corporate.  Goal is set to have in the 90% completion by Wednesday of each week.Daily frustration is working by the inadequate and uninformative markdown sheets and unorganized stockrooms.Nice company with a lot of great perks. Really enjoyed my time here, it's just too bad it didn't last long because it was a seasonal job. Other then that the job is pretty laid back.I always start my day in the home dept. Working on towels and bed/blanket/pillow, and start off doing recovery work. The most enjoyable part of the job, is learning new things, and trying something new too! Like recovery work with the Christmas ornaments and decorations, recovery work in the Kids, Men, and Women dept. The hardest part is dealing with some customer myself, sometime I try my best to be independent, and try to help them by myself. Sometime I end up asking other co workers for help though. I learned how to tell the different brands of towels, beds/pillows/blankets, and different brands of clothes too!Its a very good company in which to advance but it requires allot of dedication and hard work requiring many hours of overtime.-Provided apparel sales and excellent customer relations.-Answered department phone inquiries.-Kept all merchandise displays in an orderly manner.-Reviewed cash operations for accuracy and restocked inventory.-Market & solicit customers to apply for a macy's card.-Provided detailed information on new products.-Determined a target market & revised a strategy to get customers to purchase different products.Overall Macy's is a wonderful company and they treat their employees well. They are pretty flexibly with your scheldule and are willing to work with you.♣	One of the main responsibilities that I had at my job was to provide excellent customer service. Customer service was a huge deal. Providing good customer service brings clients back to shop at your store. It is all about engaging with customers, making a connection, and bringing sales. ♣	Some of my responsibilities as a sales associate was to help customers, keep the floor nice and clean, stock the floor with new merchandise, inventory, fulfillment, and keep updated with new sales that were going on in the store.I learnt a lot of things like how to use the register for cashier and comfortable in counting cash. The co-workers are very helpful.There is no hardest part because everything is easy and i am a quick learner.I desperately needed a job so I accepted the Macy's job. I worked overnight almost 12 hour shifts for around $8 hr. I did my job a long with my supervisor's for the same pay. I was promised a raise but never got it.This was a holiday part time position. Cannot rate it right now. This is a very long application and I don't have time to spend on this all day.Macy's started as a holiday position in the Christmas department.I got to set up all the holiday displays and trees, I handled  all the ornaments holiday decorations sales. After the holidays they decided to keep me and i worked in the ladies department. I loved working there.I enjoyed the fast pace environment and helping my customers. The people that i worked with were friendly and everyone had a really great attitude.The opportunities for advancement werent numerous but you had the ability to transfer to many of the different departments so you were always learning new and valuable things that made you more efficient.Good working environment can be boring at times.  But very fun to be around and interact with different people. And it can be good cause you can develop your people skills.","10,000+",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-10-15T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/a952fc13-f9d2-4dff-8fab-f63f6f69e012?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=15,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Ticketing/e-commerce is now commoditized SAAS and the company's ""strategic"" projects has failed to deliver any differentiation. Both Product and Strategy teams have abandoned the marketplace mission as they struggle to make Eventbrite a destination page for event discovery. Instead the team executes multi-year efforts on refreshing the look and feel of the website to occupy time and without substantial metrics impact. The Engineering team moves at glacial speeds and mostly comes from other events-oriented SAAS companies (read: never worked at pedigree like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, etc). This breads an engineering culture that lacks real processes or documentation. The ""bench strength"" has never worked on large-scale services at aforementioned firms and thus many of its services/experiences have broken under larger loads. This lack of know-how also creates a fear of touching legacy code, building hack upon hack. Recent acquisitions have built off-shore engineering centers making it even harder to develop. With compensation well below market rate and and unknown equity value, more subpar talent is recruited.I loved my time at Eventbrite, I would love to go back to work there.  They have a contract with my staffing agency not to hire temps directly from themIt is a fab office with a focus on the individual, definitely not cubicle land.","501 to 1,000",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-10-13T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/cfd85f51-4e9d-4725-a5f6-c1395803d15e?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=18,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I worked for two years for this company as they kept buying the companies I was working for.Great culture and would encourage anyone to apply.Benefits are amazing, but there is not a lot of room to grow. Management does not try and help your personal growth and development.A Non-Sales Viewpoint:ZIllow has a great culture and is full of amazing and intelligent people.  If you want to work in a tech job with great work/life balance, amazing  benefits, while surrounded by smart people, you should work at Zillow.Hardest Part:  The technical challenges.  I think this should be the hardest part, because you aren't learning anything otherwise.Most Enjoyable:  Free lunches, co-workers, solving challenging problems.ps- The CEO is awesome, everyone loves him!!If you like competitive enviornments, sell or be fired, this company is for you. Jump in, and be ready for a cut-throat, dog eat dog world. The CEO is awesome!Amazing company to work for. Great hours with a fantastic work/ life balance. The people are amazing, everyone is friendly and actually happy to be at work.Trulia/Zillow was an amazing startup, with a great culture at first.As Zillow bought it and changed the dynamic, the culture started to resemble a corporate entity more.Many employees unhappy and made for a non positive atmosphere.  The benefits were by far the best of any company I have worked for.The job exposes you to a great company and bright co-workers and management. I do feel it is a bit of a treadmill type job. It's an open floor environment with heavy sales pressure. Its long days.It teaches and requires strong work ethic and thick skin.Job does have a high turn over and Zillow is OK with that because they are looking for the top 10% in sales. Any day could be your last. No big sense of job security.However, I do like the cheering and support from co-workers and the ability to learn from talented co-workers.This a perfect job for out of college but not necessarily a good long term job in inside sales. Burnout without a year.Pushes you to your daily limit. It's telemarketing and a stepping stone for something better.This is not the place for negative nellys or worry warts! If you are proned to doubt and fear, SALES in general is not a good fit.So There are some annoyingly competitive and negative ppl that work or have worked at zillow but they never last.The high turn over is due to the fact that at zillow you are given a lot of free and fun stuff but alot of work is required of you. If you have bad energy and hate to work hard this is not the job for you. The cream of the crop reps and management are awesome. Genuinely good ppl. Benefits are the best I have ever had and I have had GREAT benefits before. Also I love the entreprenuerial atmosphere and how you get paid large commission checks and bonuses for helping Agents make lots of money. I love getting calls from clients who follow protocol and cash big checks from zillow.Looking for a good career? Love Sales? Zillow is the a great option.Zillow is a great environment and company to work for. The CEO is always involved making it more personable and excited to work.Excellent work environment & culture.  Benefits are amazing with a fantastic management staff.  Your income is based on your abilities to operate your own business.Zillow is a company with an amazing culture that really knows how to reward and create incentive for its employees. Management is very good at what they do and help push you to new limits. The nature of inside sales however is very tough to say the least and incredibly challenging every day.If this is absolutely your last option take it.  Terrible managment, training and culture.  You'll see plenty of cool aid drinkers who review Zillow but frankly don't know any better. Do yourself a favor and keep looking.Move fast, make a lot of calls, culture is good, talented managment team,No strategic planningNo directionNo collaborationDiscouraged from seeking guidancesalary average, nice office, fun people.show me how many character is enough for me to be able to hit continue button. is this enough???great company but management and Hr are lack some professionilism. 80-100 cold calls dailyniche product, your only selling to real estate agents great trainingparty atmosphere, loudA typical day consists of at least 200 minutes of talk time and/or at least 200 dials to prospective Real Estate agents. Employees are encouraged to work 10-12 hours a day and stay until they either hit talk time or book deals to get to their quota. The training program is really full of information about real estate, salesforce, the Zillow Way, Realtors, etc. It is quite intense. The management is very performance focused, but (some) do what they can to help the employees succeed. The hardest part of the job is keeping high energy and a focused/good attitude dial after dial, especially when (and this is most often the case) the previous realtor just hung up on you. The best part of the job is seeing your agents have great success with the program.Zillow is a place where you are surrounded by intelligent motivated people and a great environment to come to work every day.  Zillow does not just pay lip service to the importance of culture and the management is continually looking for better ways to serve it's employees.  The best part of coming to work every day was knowing that I was selling something that would make a difference in the business of my customers and Zillow allowed me to run my business within the business.-Made a significant amount of calls to obtain new business-Over worked/ Under-paid-Management was not helpful in key situationsThe interview process with this company is really suspect in my opinion.  I come from a serious Real Estate Advertising background,  and this is what Zillow claims to do as a business,  but did not get a serious look.  Actually could have delivered large accounts to them with my expertise,  but just had the general human resources interview (which was the only good part about this company) and then a stock ""people more qualified"" rejection notice.  I do not know anyone more qualified then me for the sales position.

117,118.0,"Data Scientist, Market Strategy and Analytics","Williams-Sonoma, Inc.",3.8,801.0,"Day to day there is a lot to do and not enough time to do it. Most stores are short staffed because we have high expectations of who we want to hire. This job has taught me a lot and I know have a much better business acumen and a better understanding of the business overall. Management can be great some days and really tough the next. Criticism is not always constructive. My coworkers are actually quite great, we are a tight-knit group of friends at this point. Hardest part about my job is the hours worked. Most enjoyable part about my job is making a store beautiful and succeeding through my people.The training portion on this job was adequate at best.  The job itself is pretty easy, until it is not.  Meaning, as long as the customers questions are something  you know.... things are good.  However, the minute you need any assistance from a team lead, supervisor, etc...  things go downhill pretty quickly.  As you can imagine, when working at home, when you do need assistance it is pretty important.  I would be very hesitant in recommending any of my friends to apply for a job with Williams-Sonoma.  The employees, including team leads and supervisors, are all very nice.  There's just a lack of support when it is truly needed.During my typical workday, I am responsible to go through emails to make sure there are any updates on system issues the night before, credits cards not being able to process, orders not being filled because of a glitch in the system. Also any emails pertaining to any website issues. After the emails I begin to take calls from the associate and answer any questions they may have for the customer. I will also take calls from the associate if the customer has escalated.  Later in the afternoon I will go through the my emails answer any question the customer has sent me and and check my voicemail and do call backs.Williams Sonoma in Memphis/Olive Branch is a very difficult company to work for.  They are in the middle of changing upper management and the new regime is very young and inexperienced.  They are leading by threats and intimidation and always seeking to blame someone lower on any issues.  The moral is very low.  Williams Sonoma volume is 20% - 30% down in 2016, which will likely create more negativity in the coming year.A typical day at work is opening the building for the employees and ensuring that all systems are properly working for a productive day at work.  I have learned to resolve customer and employee concerns.  In management, I have learned all aspects of managing supervisors and associates.  There is nothing hard about the job when you give 110% of effort in completing all tasks and willing to learn other duties.  I truly enjoy working with the people while establishing a trustworthy relationship as this enhances their willingness to perform at a high level.Very high-stress job.  Emails come in non-stop - expect 200+ emails per day.  Very poor processes from top to bottom. Employees are not empowered at all - approvals are needed for nearly everything and if you don't have the proper approvals the process stops - even if it is an emergency.  Co-workers are great but executives either have no idea of how bad things are or don't care. Terrible corporate culture that produces high anxiety, resulting in very high turnover. The best part of the job was my co-workers.A typical at work, we load the delivery truck on Monday morning and we leave the same day to start making deliveries to customers and to the stores.I learned to resolve issues with customers, organize the available time to make all the deliveries on time, and assemble all types of home furniture.The hardest part of the job is to leave home all week and only spend the weekends with my family.I enjoy working under minimal supervision.Cheap labor don't be fooled!!!!! They advertise for management position but when you go in for the interview it's minimum wage and they offer seasonal because they want you to prove yourself! And probably lay you off after Christmas I can't believe they pay so little! I also went to pottery barn then realized this is owned by William Sonoma so I ran fast lolTraining is a month long, They don't teach you anything in that course except how to use the system. The trainer is very sarcastic and rude. The customers that call are rude and always upset about little things. I was a work from home agent and could never get in touch with management or a lead when I needed one for help. The pay is great for a Work from home agent, but you put up with a lot of Stuff so it is deserved. No insurance.I love working for them, they are good for seasonal positions , and the hours are excellent hours. Also they have great employee discounts, and depending on which store you work in your bound to meet famous people.Every morning if your early before your shift starts, you can enjoy your time in the break room, Clock in and turn on your assigned computer, and read email and depending the email you receive from preparing an order or put away orders that has been processed/   What i learn is that i learn to email back to sender and reply back properly and answer phone calls, and put away items to there designated location, The management is well organize and my co workers are exciting,fun, tons of energy, well mannered polite, respectful understanding,   The hardest is none and I enjoy the most is that twice a year theirs an event that the company challenges other company's for good cost and also the company has this outlet that the company sells item for  very low price.I would take call for customers wanting to place an order, or need help with and existing order. I learned so much at William-Sonoma on how to work two systems at a time. My co-workers were very nice everyone ones was there to help each other. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.If you like to take complaints then by all means work at Williams-Sonoma.  You will work from home and take very few orders but lots and lots of complaints.  The management is very hard to reach if you have a problem and I found simply calling another work at home agent the best solution for any problem.  Asking for days off is like requesting a pot of gold be delivered to your door.  It was a very bad experience and I am glad I do not work for them anymore.  Their computer is also antiquated and hard to work.Theirs a daily routine everyday. Very friendly environment .  people care about their job and very easy training. It is very useful. Everyone is willing to help to get the job done. Working there you will be happy to attend work everyday.Great place to work a lot of responsibility and fun while doing so .the furniture is very well made so you expect the delivery to be the same . Just not that much down time at home w friends and familytypical day consisted of impossible goals to reach,, unbearable work conditions, and mismanagement. co workers were typically ok, but mainly a younger class of employees. Hardest part was attempting to follow the directives of more than one person, and the extreme heat.I really enjoyed my time with this company. They really put quality products and customer service first. I had the opportunity work part as a manager in college which served as great experience later on.Overall - enjoyable place to work.Unrealistic expectations for floor set - expected to be completed during business hours.Upper management just cut a lot of store management jobs due to poor business performance.A typical day at work is smooth sailing, fun and  productive. Coworkers are very down to earth and everyday you learn something new from one of the managers. The hardest part of the job is being able to have thorough knowledge of all merchandise and services. Most enjoyable part of the job is gaining experience and learning about things and having access to a lot of people with great knowledge.I came in as a Full Service Associate, (C.S.R.) and in just 2 short months I was at the Command Center. Williams-Sonoma gave me the opportunity to learn new skills that include:-Troubleshooting our Work-From-Home Associates with their computer issues.-Reading 'Real Time' call volume.-Updating Associates schedules-Approving and Declining time off or overtime.-Sending hourly reports to Management.All these skills I did not have before I was hired at Williams-Sonoma.Experience at the store level is entirely based on the GM.  District Managers change to much to actually be able to accomplish anything.

My co-workers were great, we had a softball league that we participated in.The hardest part of the job was when the company had to reduce staffing.Great benefits, great coworkers, and emphasis that all contribute to ""helping to made medicines""  which will in turn make a positive impact in the world. Emphasis on a ""healthy Pfizer"" - free flu shots for colleagues,  fitness center on site.Nice place to work. No work was ever too physically demanding and I worked with a lot of experienced and helpful individuals. I learned a lot about production while I worked here and would recommend it to just about anyway. The hardest thing about the job was just learning to get into a rhythm of checking everything  on the machine to make sure everything was running ok. I did enjoy everybody I worked with though.As a Life Science Lab Instrument Technician, the most rewarding accomplishment I did for Pfizer on a day-to-day basis was delivery my services to so many wonderful scientists when their equipment went down in the middle of an experiment. I would stop my world and come to their aid and restore the operation of their equipment right away. This, in turn, allowed them to deliver their work to their team. As always, they would thank me, being relieved from this dilemma with relief on their faces. My customers would send emails to my managers, thanking me for my support to their studies.Pfizer is a nice company to work for. I work with very nice people. We had some wonderful time together. I am sorry that I got laid-off. A typically day were to do your everyday duties and keep your ISO caught up on a daily basic. I had a good relationship with my supervisor and the other employees.  The hardest part of the job was working 12 hours a day.Supervised staff of 6 in the maintenance and support of the Corporate Telecom infrastructure. Managed the policies and procedures related to telecommunications use, support, and security, global standards for use and operations. Worked with department managers to develop system solutions consistent with organizational objectives.  Created capital requests for new equipment when needed and approved payment for invoices and services.Most of the days are good days when we make production.I learned the reason for the Lot number and Exp date was so much important on the product. I learned how to read and write up the PID Board. The management and co-workers were okay they followed the rules and went by the guidelines. The hardest part of the job was Inspecting the products because the particulate can be very small. The most enjoyable part of the job was making unlimited overtime.Sometime we had easy days and other days were not so easy. I've learned to just be patient and just do the job as it is presented. Management was somewhat far. The co-workers was fun to work with at times. The hardest part about the job was when something happened you had to know what to do, but as time went by all the things that happened was second nature. The most enjoyable part about the job was learning how different things work and how to fix them.Goals are clearly identified and you can cross train in other jobs.Great mentoring program due to large talent pool. Good sense of job satisfaction and make great friends while overcoming the challenges of a highly regulated industry.Is a fast-paced environment placing emphasis on delivering a great customer experience. While working as a team to reach branch goals. You have to always come in with a smile greet each customer, make sure they are acknowledge. There are different roles to a teller, not just process transactions but work the lobby as well. Help customers use innovative technology for convenience.While working in the Active Pharmaceitucals Ingredients Lab, I was given the opportunity to get training in multiple techniques involving chromatrography and wet chemistry as to work in fast pace and customer service to the chemical plant. This has given me the knowledge and capacity to do a good job while maintaining data integrity and the plant moving. I have great co-workers who motivate me and help me if I am in need. My inmediate supervisor is approachable and pro worker.Pfizer offered numerous opportunities for advancement and professional growth. My knowledge of the healthcare industry grew significantly from a face to face interaction, to analyzing and developing regionally and national healthcare organizations, thought leaders, payers and providers.As a Senior Master level Manager, I was able to routinely work with Marketing, and Managed markets leadership to develop customer focused strategies to optimize sales.I started when it was Lederle Laboratories in 1981. When I go into work I turn on my computer and see if I recieved any Emails. I check to see what the work load day is going to be, so I can plan out my schedule of testing for the day and with my coworkers.My Managers I have had over the course of the years, if I had any questions or concerns work related they were answered.The hardest part of the job was saying goodbye to coworkers that I have built up a great friendship with and worked with for so many years. My last day with Pfizer  is Sept. 30th, 2016. I love challenges. I learned so much within the jobs I held. My coworkers and I always worked as a team.  I had met so many nice people in 32 years.Manage and Prioritize all administrative tasks including scheduling meetings, conference calls, web-ex and video conferences, arranging international and domestic travel, obtain visas and passports as needed,  Responsible for generating reports from Business Warehouse in Citrix system.Coordinator for the E-room for both regions.

Started the run. Standard run was good but the sample got failed. Result was out of Specification. The matter was reported to the responsible persons in Department and in Quality Assurance.One investigation was opened in the trackwise investigation system. Other test of identification was performed. The sample had the Infra Red profile not matching the standard. Looked like the sample is not correct. May be some different material or cross contamination. Buyer and planning was informed. These kind of issue come up some time.Formulated batches by utilizing mix times and filtering solutions.  Conducted regular and special cleanings on tanks, filter housings, and pumps. Weighed raw drugs, using scales and isolates. Standardized meters to test conductivity, pH, and oxidizable of substances.  Complied with cGMPs through adherence to SOPs.After I graduated form the Pharmacy School, I work for Pfizer as a medical rep., as the policy in Saudi Arabia mandated to have healthcare background. The workplace, the system is exceptional and you well interact with the finest workforce in the industry among the companies. The firm policy is strict, either internally or at the market, the resources you have to achieve your goal are the best among other companies. However, the advangates come with a price, as the market leading position of Pfizer in the market required an exceptional performance in utilizing the resources provided to maintain the leader position, in which it will too tough at the begging, but it will be easier and funnier when you acquire the experience.Was only with PFE for a short time, but my impression is that at the time PFE ws a ""my way or the highway"" company in their absorption of Pharmacy. We had many talented people and excellent process that they did not even consider when they purchased Pharmacia.Pfizer is closing operations here in New York and moving production operations to the country of Ireland. I will be laid off as of 09/30/2016.

It has also helped me to understand the environment of a large corporation. I enjoy my co-workers and learn something new from them everyday. Since we are scattered across the country, its challenging to not have hands-on training, which is the hardest part of my job. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to know my customers, being their support contact, and researching their needs.Oracle is good company to work. Offers a lot of opportunities. Learned about NPI process steps. Financially very strong.This required a lot of travel so if you do not like traveling this could be a problem.  There is not much office interaction and management is usually remote.My time at Oracle was tremendous. The products, services and people are truly amazing. I learned what it takes for an enterprise organization to function within the technology industry. Great co-workers, great leaders.My employment was through an acquisition. The company is not very friendly towards the customers or employees that it acquired. The processes only work well for Oracle and not so much for acquired companies. The internal processes are very difficult to navigate and it will often feel as though you have to fight to get things accomplished. Nothing is resolved quickly.This job was great to work at and learn but unfortunately I did not foresee much room for growth. My co-workers were always willing to lend a hand and so was the business manager. Sadly, many people would leave the company after a few years due to little opportunities in career advancement and compensation.Working at Oracle/Taleo I have learned the HR tracking applications.   Within this application, I am supporting existing clients, consultants with basic configuration questions and bug related issues.   Working on this application requires indepth troubleshooting skills, patience, excellent customer service skills.The company is a huge mix of millennials and a little bit of professionals. The pay is okay, could be better. After a Re-org and now the acquisition of NetSuite, the future seems dim. Seeking something new, bur taking my time as it is not awful here, just not settled in and really don't plan to do so.* dynamic work environment* inexperienced management* not so steady co-workers* frequent organizational changes* learned a lot on Oracle's engineered systemsIt was challenging, but people do want and need Consulting Services from Oracle.  It is more a matter of the sales setup, in terms of who gets credit for what, which turned out to be the most challenging part of the job.Set boundaries early as it relates to your personal life. Average hours worked were 50+hrs. Great colleagues - intelligent hard workers. High emphasis on automation.Oracle is a very good company to work for. I worked from home, and become very good at figuring things out on my own. Their intranet is where you find out what you need to know. Due to many mergers and acquisitions, there were always new products to add to our sales portfolio. With the move to cloud based technologies, ongoing learning is part of the culture. I enjoyed the learning experiences while working there, and the people are top notch to work with.Oracle provided me with a lot of amazing resources and opportunities. At the same time, the culture is a bit stale and management didn't seem to care much about our success.Good job advancement.  Benefits were good, but they were a little pricey.  I had the ability to work from home.  My manager allowed me to manage my own schedule.Friendly enviornment at workplace. You get more work-life balance, its like fun and work at your workplace with your colleagues. Apart from work, you get good social network with your co-workers and in other team members.Its a place you go to for a good work life balance. However, if someone is looking to work in a challenging and high growth environment - this is not a place for him/her.Oracle is a great company to work at if you want to save money in your 401K, not a good place if you want to enjoy your job. I can only speak for the sales department. It's easy, but not many people like it.Oracle is well established company with lot of technical and business depth and a stable place to work at. The company is in a process of going through change in order to respond to the changes in the industry.Excellent Work place, would def recommend working at Oracle. good team environment and a potential to make a good living.Company provides a lot of support for training, but upward mobility is limited unless you have a supportive manager. Patches are inconsistent. High turnover.Awesome people to work for. Great management and location. They work hard to allow advancement in the company.

121,122.0,Data Scientist,Yelp Inc.,3.8,130.0,"Too much time is spent attending to incidents or working around incidents from other teams. Many managers are new/first-time managers and lack the necessary skills to be effective at their jobs while others are handi-capped by the company's culture of super hands off management. Morale is generally poor-whatevs.This company is laid back and very little stress as far as the Eat24 department goes. I mean super laid back...people were drinking on they're shift, smoking pot on lunch and a fist fight erupted one day. The floor managers show favoritism to the people in they're clique. If your looking for a career this is not the place to advance. If your fresh out of high school and just looking to pay your phone bill and money to blow on random stuff this place is your ideal job. The pay is minimum wage. In my personal experience it was not a company that I could advance in because there were no core values set by the employer and no advancement opportunities to further my career within the company. It does though have fully stocked kitches with every drink and snack you can imagine and the 7th floor has baristas that serve several different beverages for free along with fully stocked kitchen to make your own sandwiches. Very beautiful building in the financial/shopping district.70+ outbound cold calls daily to SMB's in a assigned territory. Setting 15-20 minute appointments with clients to discuss and pitch the Yelp platform. These BO's already have Yelp pages that most likely have traffic to that listing. Pitch and close the prospects. Get to quota, make some decent cash. However, you must follow the process and be a quick learner. It's easy to fall into habits and not grind it out. Stand up. Take each call with a clean slate, but don't be afraid to mess up and quickly try out a new method again.  Yelp can be a great place for a couple years, but it's a daily grind and not for the weak minded.Yelp is a great company. Employees are treated well with a fully stocked kitchen for breakfast and lunch, great health benefits, and great people. The pay is definitely on the lower side. The most negative aspect was the job itself. The day to day is strictly cold calling businesses to sell the advertising program. It can be very monotonous. Also many of the business owners are busy and do not want to speak to you. It's a hard job to find enjoyment in.I applied to intern at Yelp and they ruined my summer. They kept me waiting for two whopping months and now it really made me mad. They have no respect towards low income students who are trying to support a family. The people who are in charge of HR need to be clear and not act childish when picking who should get an intern position. Good thing is that their office is laid back and happy.Simply put, I love working at Yelp. The training is unparalleled, and the people are amazing. There are several upper level sales opportunities that have clear paths to get to. Unlike many other sales positions, it is unclear how to get promoted, however it seems as though all managers' goals are to get their reps promoted.The recipe to success at this company is simple: work hard, be the obvious choice, and be a team player.  The hardest part of this job is the work itself, however Yelp is quite clear about what our average level of work is. Cold-calling is never easy, especially when dealing with small business owners, however there are several tools at our fingertips to improve our sales acumen. As long as your goal (as a sales rep) is to genuinely help a small business, there is no reason why you wouldn't succeed. All in all, would highly recommend. This is one of the few companies that allows college grads to develop a lifelong career with some hard work and dedication to the role.Great company to work for with a startup culture. Interacted with my peer on a daily basis to create a strategy to bring in sales for the online food ordering application.I remembered being excited for the chance to find a job at ""Yelp"" in the heart of downtown San Francisco. Boy did I delude myself, Firstly this company (Yelp EAT24) feels so separate from Yelp its insane. I receive questions about Yelp that I have no idea how to answer since its a separate entity. Secondly I work in a glorified call center, it might have a fancy title and ""cool benefits"" like beer on tap, and free snacks, but all I do daily is apologize to people and tell them their food is on the way. Plus I work nights so they ""perks"" don't apply to me as I never have the chance to get beer. It so sad that someone with a college degree and three majors cannot find a better job and that HR cannot find a better fit for me. Lastly, and the most disheartening part is I was told it would be about a year to transfer to Yelp proper. Are you serious??? I have to take a year of working from 3 PM to 11:30 PM while simultaneously giving up my nights and weekends for a little over minimum wage. I applaud anyone that has lasted in this position because I feel myself dying a little more inside every time I clock in to start working.The job itself isn't the greatest (phone sales). However, the culture of the company and those you work with are great! Really great place for people in their twenties but not a long term career path for many. Free food all day was nice. They pay for your gym membership and great health care benefits.Very fun culture, they hire well! Would not suggest taking a sales position at Yelp if you have extensive sales experience. You will be paid the same as someone with limited sales experience.Great company that sells a great product, but there's not many interesting positions to move up from entry-level.  Extensive sales training, and excellent benefits.Yelp is a great company to work for during your first year out of college, but beyond that I wouldn't recommend investing in a company that doesn't necessarily invest enough in their own employees.Yelp is pretty cool.I would recommend it to someone if there was a job opening they were into.Great free snacks. Not so great compared to other companies in the area, but definitely above average. Beer! I've never liked hanging out at an office after hours before. I do that somewhat regularly here.Flexible Hours with the option to work from home when necessary.Sweet health benefits and they're pretty generous with stock even for us lowly user ops workers.Average good-ish time off/sick timeOverall company good about providing important updatesUnfortunately none of this is enough to make up for the crushing boredom that eventually sets in with moderating content. They tell you straight up when you start not to really expect this to go anywhere. It's kinda sad since we have a lot of talented, intelligent people on the team wasting their smarts. I can feel myself getting dumber from all the terrible punctuation and block paragraphs that I have to read all day long. Go on though, do it a year or two and then move along. It's a great job as one of your first out of college. You don't have to wear real clothes or show up at a specific time and that's all real real nice.""Fun"" environment for the most part. Though in our particular department there is a lot of forced fun that really gets irritating for a cynic like me. It's kinda silly since they actually advertise the position as being for introverts. It's a little tone deaf. Like the time they had us spin some Harry Potter sorting hat for assigned seats at lunch. Yep... actual adults arranged that forced  more... mingling situation with a group full of introverts. They also recently instituted music on Friday afternoons and it is the worst. There are a lot of management things that make the job really stressful. But I think I mostly just get petty and mad because I am so so bored. You'll have fun for a while doing this job probably. But it really does show you a bad side of humanity. There are some awful opinions that I was not used to coming across. That can be tough. But it's nothing awful like if you were moderating beheadings content for that popular video upload website.  lessYelp is a great company and I am lucky to have experience working at Yelp. The account executive role in sales is very competitive. You make a high number of sales calls per day, trying to sell advertising packages to small, local businesses. You must be able to consult and engage with, educate, and successfully sell Yelp advertising to business owners, who may be unwilling to speak to you on the phone or reply any emails or voicemails. You must know how to quickly think on your feet, and recommend products quickly to suit client needs by handling the different objections that they will throw at you. Good for working towards goals, talking to people all day long, and if you have a passion for small local businesses.This is my first sale job and overall experience has been positive.You will go into training and be expected to learn and implement feedback. With each month that goes by the expectations will go up. It will seem fun in the beginning with the games, free coffee, open cafeteria, and a keg for after hours but it gets old and you just want to go home and relax. You will dial 70 + call a day and be expected to hit 2.50 hours talk time. The job can be high stress at times and if you close a deal directors, managers, and other people will cheer your wins. At times if your not closing it can feel disappointing and you feel forgotten and question if this is the job for you. Going into this job you have to have a thick skin, implement feedback, work hard, adjust to things that might not go your way because this is sales.Yelp is great for entry level professionals who wants to learn sales and account management.  They have an awesome training program.  However, the competitiveness and frat mentality may not be for everyone.No one likes cold-calling, but that's what you're going to be doing every day. Yes, you get the freedom to churn the whole sales process from open calling to closing, but managing that while handling objections is a tough sell. Co-workers are friendly, and management could be held to another standard. Hard to differentiate managers as friend or micromanaging sticklers, because people move up quick in this job. It can be very emotionally draining and dry, so mentality is everything in this job.Similar to plenty of other reviews I have read, tons of kids fresh out of college who have no idea that there ARE better options out there. They lure you in with all the free food and music and games and stuff but dont tell you about the cold calling and if you dont hit these metrics on the head then you will be shown the door. Managers may ""act"" like they care about you or your home life but at the end of the day you are just a number. training structure is way out of order. They throw you to the wolves the second week on the job and then give you information in a training 2-3 weeks later that would have increased your odds of getting a appointment/sale. Lots of tasks to accomplish on a daily basis but not enough time to complete them all and then you are hit with the no excuses card when you are not pulling your weight. On the flip side, fantastic place to work, free food all day, game rooms and music, lots of stuff nearby.Great for younger kids with no responsibilities!!The culture at Yelp is great. Lots of perks in the office and usually everyone is cool. But managers tend to breathe down your neck and instead of working with you to get better they just tell you that you better work harder. There is no acknowledging that bad days happen - instead it's 100% you for not working hard enough.One of my favorite parts about my work day is that each day is unpredictable. I never know who I am going to talk to and as a result, I get to learn about so many unique and interesting businesses, people and meet a lot of entrepreneurs that educate me, too.The best perk is definitely the people and culture… and I suppose our brand new office with shuffleboard, ping pong and Rock Band. But truly, I get to work side by side with amazing, talented people every day.I spent almost 2 years at Yelp. It's a rollercoaster. Full of great colleagues, awesome mentors, and a challenging job (but once you get the hang of it you'll pitch-on-the-fly and feel like a boss).You are responsible for the full sales cycle. From introduction to close. You will have difficult conversations about selling them Yelp ads with SMB prospects. It's challenging, but what you will also have a team, an organization, readily available for you to learn and execute with.I owe everything I know about my profession to this opportunity I got here.Thanks Yelp! :)","1,001 to 5,000",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-10-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/bf9040d2-ee5e-4de1-9bd7-e617dd2ba8c7?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

123,124.0,Data Scientist - Forecasting,"Rodan & Fields, LLC",4.4,48.0,"The job culture, the trainings, the team, the camaraderie.. it's definitely a dream come true! It takes time to plant seeds and advance, but the entire biz plan is worth the dedication.The Sales Support department is an absolute mess. Systems are always crashing, management is too busy or incapable of answering questions or basic follow-up. Other departments are slow to respond to important inquiries. Generally too much paperwork and red tape to go through to get anything meaningful done.The pay, benefits and company culture make the company a great place to work overall, but the Sales Support department is in need of a huge revamp.Initially, the company was fantastic and the job was pretty enjoyable. Then the company's consultant and client base grew exponentially, we were understaffed, short stocked, dealing with outdated and troublesome software systems, our resources for appeasement were limited, micromanaging us seemed like the goal because other departments were not performing adequately & then dealing with screaming phone calls -we were getting chewed on both ends, all stick & no carrot. The company kept wanting suggestions to combat the high turnover rate but they just didn't listen. Options for overtime & weekend hours to catch up on the backlog of emails or calls eventually became pretty standard or else it would become mandatory. Of course, there were impressive incentives offered but after a while, those dwindled in the direction of underwhelming. Promotions were available but competitive and sometimes those decisions were perplexing. Benefits (dental/health) were pretty top notch, 401k planning, and at the time, they were attempting to offer stock options but those couldn't be cashed until you had been there 3+ years. The only saving grace would be the coworkers who felt more like family and were wonderfully supportive while saving your sanity.Great culture, very poor mid management.  Growth outpaces the intellect in the building but hey, at least there is growth!  Good pay, good perks including a box at Oracle arena!If you can weather the storm of the chaotic management stylesand overall internal strife that has been happening over the change in the C level folks, then go for itYou work for yourself.  It is a multi level marketing company that sales skin care products.  A typical day would be trying to sign up customers to purchase the products, check on current status's of other orders.Love this company. I started two years ago and really impressed by the support and growth that is available. Highly recommend this company.Joining up with Rodan + Fields was the best decision I've ever made. This job has been such a blessing to my family. I am able to work without compromising my valuable family time.Amazing skincare that actually works!  I was hesitant to try it, let alone become a consultant for Rodan + Fields but now I can't live without the products. I love the skin I'm in!As an Independent Consultant for Rodan and Fields, you have the perfect work life balance. You work as little or as much as you like. The opportunities are endless. The hardest part of the job is just getting off the ground. The leadership is beyond what I have ever experienced.very social, but not consistent, when sales are good money is great, tedious almost all of the time and thats what i loved the most, pyramid company, not stable enough for my family especially financially hard with my special needs sons dr. billsFun work place, with wonderful people to work with. Growing and developing skills needed in a job force and real life.Wonderful experience of good skin care, learning to care for your skin and teaching others how to do so. It's wonderful to spread such a wonderful message and advice! Really does change lives.It is a wonderful way to help my friends and family with their skin complaints with products that work and a reputalbe company that cares about it's sales reps and customers. The difficult part of the job is trying to bring up the product in daily conversation and not pushing the intrested party too hard. But its keep the balance of sales rep and helpful friend that is key to being sucessful. Also learning useful marketing skills to help grow and expand my clients and awareness.The products are amazing, and it can be as structured as you would like.  I enjoy using the products and the people on my team which keeps me involved.I love meeting new people, the perks and just the fact that you can stay home with a flexible schedule, where if you have kids you can take them to their sports and school without a worry who can pick them up !!!Great community of people who are overall incredibly supportive and helpful.  Work when and where you want.  I love having extra spending money when I get paid and look forward to it being more than that.Work from home, set my own hours, I am the boss get to work with a fabulous team and product developers. I'm home with my son when he needs meGreat place to work. Great people. Make sure that when you apply, you apply for something you really want to do. Make sure you recognize your worth, so they can respect your work!A typical day is contacting individuals who I feel may be interested in purchasing skincare for problem areas.   I have learned being persistent and following-up is very important in sales and I can't be disappointed if someone is not interested.  I am an individual consultant, however, I work with a team who work together and motivate each other.   I love meeting new people and telling them about Rodan+Fields.  Typicially, a win win for everyone.  Better skin and I make money!Rodan and Fields allows me to work in direct sales on my own time. I can make as little or as much money as I want. Advancement is based on my own personal drive and willingness to succeed. I enjoy fitting my business in my life a few hours a week and I am my own boss.Doctors Rodan and Fields created Proactiv and from the success of Proactiv, they started Rodan and Fields.  It is an amazing company that offers continuous learning, advancement, and fantastic products to market and sell.  They provide all the tools and training to build successful teams.  I don't have a typical day at work because it is a business that it done on my terms and on my time, so it is very flexible.I have learned more about recruiting, leading, and building a team and profitable customer base. I manage a team of over 20 other consultants.The hardest part of the job is rejection.The most enjoyable part of the job is celebrating with people when they experience amazing results of our products or achieve financial security.",,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-10-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/38471eff-fcbc-4399-8d02-7a05cca3f4e9?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

In general, the people who visit are quite nice to have around.I enjoyed the challenge of remodeling my property transforming it into and 11 guest stay. Also, meeting all sort of people from different parts of the world and learning from their distinct cultures.Being an AirBnb host has been really amazing meeting new people and listening to their adventures. It also allows me to have an open schedule so that I am not missing out on other things in life.Great Environment. There are thousands of ways to learn and innovate in this environment. Allows you to take charge and oversee the many operations of keeping an Airbnb property afloat.an amazing place to meet an abundance of people. we worked together to give off the best ambiance so the clients felt the vibes. after moving up in positions, i became a floater to help any and every station complete daily tasks.Is such a great experience working with Airbnb, I can have my own schedule, I don't need to be at my place all the time, and I can know people around the world at the same time I make some money.Awesome culture to work in. Super friendly, community is very active, always a different day when I arrive at the office. Free food, I truly get to taste the world everyday!As a host, I got the chance to meet people from all different backgrounds with different stories.Most of the guest were super polite, kindly and be aware of me.Amazing experience meeting, helping hosting guests from Europe, Asia, Australia and Centro America.Provided professional and friendly customer assistant  and keep maintenance and guests need as a top priority.An awesome way to meet new people and offer services at reasonable rates. The job was very easy and has limitless benefits. I loved it. If you love people and enjoy entertaining this is the job for you.I love Airbnb. They have provided a way for me to bring in extra income and do what I love most which is to make my home an oasis and to serve guests with a pleasurable experience while staying with me.-Limited to no growth potential-Strong lack of work/life balance-Highly inexperienced management-Lightning fast pace-Burnout environmentGreat second source of income. Lots of freedom to manage your own way. I will continue to rent my home as long as I can. Great idea and I hope it sticks around for years to come.Great company and provides great backup for hosts. Super flexible and they are always there to help a host.  Super fast on response.There are a plethora of people who don't do anything and still have a job. I made one mistake and written up for it and then fired, which wasn't even a rightful termination. Loved the agents and the environment but the clients between 24-7 InTouch and Airbnb have no understanding of valuing their employees.Great work team. Very supportive. Great perks in travel credit I highly recommend working here.They were very flexible and I was able to work from homeI have worked at Airbnb as a Customer experience specialist for about a year.Airbnb is a great company to work for, they have amazing offices and great perks: breakfast, lunch, snacks, health insurance, happy hours, travel coupons every quarters for employees, laptop provided, etc.They take good care of their employees and they have a great on-boarding training.For this position, we usually worked in shift either from Sunday to Thursday or from Tuesday to Saturday.The only drawback while I was there was a lack of consistency between managers across teams but the issue was identified so I am confident that it is being taken care of.Overall, I am very satisfied with the company and its culture and I would recommend working for them.A typical day at work is unpredictable, considering  each case is different. I've learned the victories and difficulties in working with travel/booking. My co-workers are awesome for the most part, I get along with everyone and do not mind helping when needed. The hardest and most enjoyable part of the job would be balancing the stress depending on the level of difficulty behind the case, and the most enjoyable part is saving the day!Hosting and interacting with guests is fun and rewarding.You make new friends, build new relationships, and help people transition from one move to another.The system is easy. Guests see our profile on site and reserve a time. We confirm the reservation and take care of each guest dedicated to achieve guest satisfaction. Management includes collection of deposits for keys and house keeping, house cleaning and maintenance, and showing and guiding guest through residence.The hardest part of the job is receiving a rude guest who is high maintenance and the best way to handle the guest is to be calm and collected. If problems arise, we try to come up with the best solution and best service for that guest. The most enjoyable part of the job is making new friends that have lasted long past their stay.I was my own boss, so I only hosted when I had the time. I learned to manage my time, deal with people from different backgrounds, and learn about different cultures. Cons are: minimum security and could be more than a full time job as I was on call 24/7.It was a interesting complex due to the legalization of Airbnb in NYC.

I have enjoyed interacting with clients all over the bay area from businesses to right inside peoples homes doing a little life with them, helping them. The clients are the best part of my job there. The struggle is that there are some seriously slow seasons so it has not been a sustainable position for myself. I think its a great job for extra cash for students, persons with disabilities, teachers on breaks, and anyone who would like some extra work on the weekends. The hardest part of the job is the instability of the market for work. My most enjoyable part was just getting to know the great people and businesses I have had the pleasure to get to know in the process of serving them.A typical day was meeting new people and a lot of learning on the job. The hours are great because it is all up to you, but if you do not work enough you will not make money. I learned a lot I don't think you can match the experience of working freelance work with a place like TaskRabbit. Every job had new challenges with individual pros and cons. Management was great they handled any situation and work with you. The hardest part of the job was not having steady work at times but if you had steady work you had good money.So many interesting tasks to work on as a Taskrunner. There are lots of opportunities to learn and grow in your craft. Every Taskrunner you work with is extremely passionate. Awesome executive team who is very open and transparent. Amazing perks and benefits, lots of fun events, TaskRabbit really makes sure that you're happy to be there.great job if you have kids. Discount on all store items. The funnest part is being around all the toys all the time. Even if your an adult its still cool.TaskRabbit is yet another labor app such as Uber or Lyft which takes advantage of all of the available loopholes in the labor laws in order to maximize their own profits while doing nothing to protect or support their workers.New age working.

I would have to say the most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of knowing that i was doing my very best and making the customer happy and the comradery  of the other employees.Ticketfly is a music tech company that is reforming the concert going experience. They love live music and encourage all of their employees to attend as many shows as possible. The culture is music oriented, social and caters to everyone's talents. Since Ticketfly is still a start up company, things are constantly changing as management figures out the best ways to help clients achieve high ticket sales and provide great service to customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is being among the awesome people who work there. I respect all of my coworkers and don't mind going out of my way to help when I can.Had couple of excellent managers that guided me and empowered me to create successful teams, where my leadership and management skills got polished.They will grow and be more successful, my only recommendation will be management training for all their managers.",51 to 200,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-09-14T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/44886dcb-7865-44b6-8c9c-bfe6dd6f7272?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

132,133.0,Senior Data Scientist,Ancestry,3.6,35.0,"I felt I wasn't given the help needed for me to grow in this job. The management didn't want to be bothered with helping or answering questions to a problem.Ancestry used to be a great place to work for software engineers.  But is has continually gone downhill.  They used to give stock.  Now they don't.  The management said that stock was only for ""people like them.""  Management doesn't care about the people.  They are all just waiting to cash out.Why do you think there are so many job openings at Ancestry?A good company to work for--if you can meet the call time limitations. Good pay and benefits. Management does care--but there are metrics that must be met. It's great to be able to help people out, but sometimes there are customers who should not be around any technical equipment (computers, tablets, smartphones) and many struggle with the on-line services Ancestry provides.I came in and check the tickets that came over night. I maid repairs a go the servers back on line. I then moved to my three backup environment, and ran the Exchange Backup reports, The CDPE reports and Ancestry.com backup reports. Any restores that need to be restored that morning,  At Ancestry I learded Microsoft Office, and all Microsoft Operating Systems, (10years), CommVault Storage Backups (5years),Vmware and Hyper-V virtual environments (6 years),I worked here for five years. When first employed, Ancestry was a great company to work for. Management valued Member Services and created a great atmosphere for their employees. Over the years, they have turned member services into a typical 'call center' atmosphere with very scripted responses to their customers. It has since had a steady decline with over all satisfaction. There is no job security and no way of moving up within the company (other than staying just within member services).just don't like it answering to many phone calls in a short time frame and try solving a problem that the customer was having with ancestry productI couldn't speak more highly of this company. I am in a contract position and to be completely honest I'm sad this job will be coming to an end. You get great pay, they have incentives for doing well, you can also get benefits through the company. Overall I love the site I work at including the people and the job itself!Ancestry is the best place I have ever worked. Unfortunately, it is very hard to be recognized for your work and move up in the company.I really liked the company, they took care of the employees. They offered free breakfast for everyone each morning along with free fresh fruit and for those with a sweet tooth they had free soda fountains and frozen yogurt each day as well. The work was fairly simple and repetitive but still fun to do. Supervisors were always super helpful and very approachable.Great place to work if the focus is only Work life balance. If you are looking for a competitive place, this is not the one for you.A typical day at work can last at least 4 hours a day depending on the position you have in the company. I learned to pay close attention to detail and how to search for ancestors.Management was very friendly and they did their best to help me when I had a question.Co-workers I had there were very friendly and very welcoming.Hardest part about the job was the hours honestly. Like I said you can work at the very least 4 hours a day depending on your position in the company.Most enjoyable part of the job was the cafe they have for employees. During your break, if you get hungry, there is a cafe you can go to, to grab something quick to eat.Really great place to start internship and highly intelligent developers who will assist you any way they can.  Great benefits and wonderful learning process.  Will definitely help you to grow as a developer.You will be answering a wide variety of calls. You need to be very patient. There is a lot of emphasis placed on stats and handle time. You need to be abel to learn quickly and act on the spot. The web site changes rapidly and you usually find out when a member calls in. You need to be able to handle the call and quickly assist with the change and take feedback. It was enjoyable finding family records for the members. The billing is automatically renewed and the online cancel doesn't always work. Because of this you will be dealing with some angry customers.The job was a good envirerment and made it as good as possible for employees working customer service over the phone daily. The benefits were very good and important to me. I realized that I wasn't cut out for the type of work and knew it was time for me to do the most appropriate thing and resign from the company.The work environment is incredibly high paced. I've learned how history and technology work together for the greater good. My one major complaint is company culture and lack of communication between Ancestry's head quarters in Utah and it's satellite sites all over the country. There is a large disconnect which in turn causes negative company culture and confusion.Its 40 hours a week and the calls do not stop. 90% of the calls are cancel calls and we do not give refunds for monthly subs so customers yell most of the time. Ancestry does not verify email so if a customer enters .coom instead of .com its impossible to look up there account so the calls take forever. why they don't verify emails i do not know. the sales calls are alright and the support calls i like but like i said its mostly cancel calls.Ancestry.com is an excellent company to work for. I have never worked for another company that so greatly values its employees. This organization truly encourages an ""open door"" policy and feedback is delivered consistently. Members of the leadership team are always available to discuss performance and to coach employees about how to improve. Ancestry encourages promotion from within so there is a lot of opportunity for upward mobility.A typical day would include taking various types of content and scanning them into in house programs in order to enhance them for the company website. I think my favorite part of working here was my co-workers. It was a very fun and relaxing environment.Passionate and engaged employees and management that sincerely care about the work they do and the product they support.I loved my position as a work at home agent. Now that position has been eliminated. All agents are now called in. When I first began working with the company it was a breath of fresh air for a large corporation. None of the back stabbing, very high energy and positivity.Since growing, through the work of its agents, it's now cold, lacking in care of its employees and customers who literally make their business.A Typical day at work is very stressful and some customers are rude and abusive towards employees. They will make the issues personal towards you and then claim that you hung up on them. In all my years of call center experience they are the worst bunch of customers I have ever dealt with. I have learned a lot of important information on my ancestors. A plus is my family loves that I'm working for them, but on the other hand, not so much. I am not happy there.Management could use a serious overhaul!! They're not on the same page. I don't like feeling as if I'm being micromanaged by senior management. Employees get told that they have never fired anyone for their call time, but they write you up for it and put you on a final and tell you to improve or you're gone. Doesn't make any sense at all. They lie & cheat their employees out of their dignity and expect too much from them in a 3 week training and then slam them with everything you need to work on your own. They tell you they have only fired employees for attendance problems, another lie! Great coworkers. But the turnover is ridiculously high!!! They pack up your desk into a box while your super is firing you and escort you out the door like a criminal leaving a prison. The hardest part of the job, lack of support from the so called supervisors and they hold you accountable for the long hold time to reach support!!! The hold time goes against your call time, as if it's your fault in the first place for needing help. I have personally waited more than 10 minutes for any supervisor or support department to answer  more... my call. I see they all of them are goofing off in chat which is supposed to be some of our support instead of assisting you. It's a vicious cycle!! Their attendance policy is unthinkably stupid!!! VTO is non existent, but they tell you it's available if the call volume goes down!! Phones are poorly covered, hold time is a long wait for our customers. And employee don't get anytime to breathe!! They call themselves and Equal Opportunity Employer, but promote the newbies to positions without posting them for long time employees to fill. How is that equal? Exactly!! The most enjoyable part of the job is I'll find another one.  less","1,001 to 5,000",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-09-12T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/a097d29a-3917-4f0c-8a75-0ecde6366dcf?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

135,136.0,"Manager, Data Scientist - Consumer Marketing Analytics",Kaiser Permanente,4.2,3900.0,"Nice job culture with the kaiser team. The team is very small and they are very helpful. Nice team co-ordination. Management always give good support to the developer, which helped every developerI worked for Kaiser for many years. From college through my early professional career. A lot of politics among administrators at times but they treated me well. Kaiser compensation was far below what other hospitals in the community were paying back when I worked for them.  Eventually what  prompted me to leave. Not sure how they compare now. Very manageable workday. Teamwork among co workers. Hardest part of my job was the egos of certain physicians. Enjoyable part of my job was working with my co workers.We were and still are like family.After working at Kaiser for 10 years, I saw two different types of leadership. The initial CEO had a heart for the nurses, and Kaiser did very well in patient satisfaction surveys as well as staff satisfaction surveys. The current CEO has less interest in the staff from what I could see, the nurses' weren't being listened to. I was saddened to see this happen, the work culture felt much more tense.KP is a great place to extend your career. Employees are friendly, professional and willing to help. The culture promoted is one of togetherness with the patients first. There are some snags in management, primarily in Georgia. A typical day of greeting and serving some of the best people in the world and helping to make their health the best it can be. Overall I would recommend it as a stepping stone for the medical field. The providers are overall a great group, eager to listen and respond to their patients and internal employees. The hardest part of the job would be going home at the end of the day with so many people to help.My typical work day start at 6 and end at 2:30. I've learned how to process claims and to problem solve.  Also I've learned how to work with outside vendors in recouping overpayments on claims.  Our management team is very knowledgeable and willing to go beyond to help you achieve your goals.  The hardest part of the job is that what I do as a Claims Recovery Specialist is it's always busy, but I like the challenge of my job, it keeps you on your toes at all time, because day and day out you must know how to mulit-task and problem solve.  My job is a problem solving job.  The best part I enjoy is that I never get bored and there is a challenge everyday and you can come to work 5 days a week and not do the same job duty everyday.  We were many hats as a Claims Recovery Specialist.I enjoyed my internship experience at Kaiser Hospital because I was able to network with several Kaiser employees, and learned more in-depth about the culture of Kaiser.  In addition, I attained more knowledge and experience in Microsoft Excel and data entry.  It was truly an enjoyable experience and I look forward to any potential job openings/availabilities in the Kaiser Permanente Network.Excellent organization with excellent emphasis on preventive care. Great opportunity for improvement in career growthInvolve in staff development to ensure partnership and provide safety  and affordable care for patient To be able to work in partnership in a union environmentGreat coworkers who works coperatively with each other to ensure succesHardest part of the job is long hours to ensure efficiency and maintain the organization statusMost enjoyable to note the great and continued succes of the organizationThis Review is Solely on The EVS Department-The Pay is Good But It's Like a Secret Society.  Communication us HORRIBLE Between Management and Staffing. Alot of Favoritism Occurs, Unfortunately. Extremely Gossipy Co Workers. Get In, Do Your Work and Go Home.  Not Sure Why EVS Department Lacks So Much Comradery and Organization.  Plenty of O.T. if Wanted.  Benefits Good After 90 Days. Areas are Extremely  Large to Finish in an 8 Hour Shift. In Proper Training. I Would Rather Have The Work Culture Be Much More Professional and Unified in Another Department. Not Enough Pay for the Stress. Manager and Both Supervisors Left/ Quit/Transferred/ Got Terminated All Within Months of One Another.I worked for this company for over 10 years in the Sacramento Call Center. When I got sick I was let go. The work culture in the Call Center was abysmal and the management was unsympathetic to life needs. I started there to ""get my foot in the door"" and found that it was impossible to transfer out of the call center once I was there. There was no room for advancement. The job is highly stressful and the management made that stress worse. I loved being a Kaiser Employee but would never work in the call center again. I would love a chance to work in a different department however because the benefits and pay were excellentKaiser was a great company to work for if all i cared about was salary and benefits. I learned many things in my place of employment and grew a lot as a nurse. I learned to supervise different modules in our department as well as work with different specialties within pediatrics. However management was not kind to their employees at all and were only ever worried about numbers and not patients well being. My co-workers were overall kind and I got along with them well. The hardest party of my job was being able to talk to or communicate with management about any issues there were within work. The overall best part of my job was working with kids and being to help others in their time of need. Not only the patient was grateful at the end of the visit but the family members as well which was very rewarding.Kaiser is a great place for a steady career. Being a big company there are many reorganizations, especially in the IT space. The workforce is a talented pool of people who enjoy their work. The concern appears when new executives are hired which can has the potential to change the work/life balance.Most jobs were 4 10 hour days, which worked great for me.  My direct manager was in general very fair and knowledgeable.  I did feel like some of the upper level management made decisions that directly affected us without really understanding the consequences.  I felt valued and appreciated as an employee.  They do an outstanding job of communicating pertinent information such as policies, job expectations, and work systems to employees.  The care given to patients is in general very high quality, evidence-based, comprehensive care.  The dentists I worked with were humble, down-to-earth, and happy to work with staff as a team.  They seemed to check their egos at the door.There is not enough money in the world to get me to work here ever again. The work culture is lazy, people work here only for the money which is top pay because the place is horrible to work for. Top people leave, or are counting their days until retirement.Kaiser Permanente set the standard for providing top notch healthcare benefits to their employees.  As such, they expect and believe in each employee showing empathy while providing great customer care to all Kaiser customers; whether it's a vendor or patient.  Kaiser stays busy.  We consistently provide care to patients.  We work hard on a daily basis to make sure each & every patient is treated with respect, dignity and great customer care.  When working at Kaiser you run across employees who have been there 30 yrs or more.  So it goes without saying, Kaiser is great place to work!  Yes, it's not peaches and cream everyday but overall, you'll feel good about the care provided to patients here.A typical day at work is consumed by coordination of employees, providers, and patients, to provide a seamless experience. The hardest part of the job is maintaining a positive team spirit, and providing the best care for our patients. I find this challenging and enjoyable.This is the healthcare company you work for if you want to sell your nursing soul to the devil. Management beds the various Unions there & vice versa. Do not believe the union hype. The concepts of respect & trust are non-existent, and both administration, nursing leadership, and union leadership are tainted from the top down. Don't expect much from the physicians either. In my 20 years of nursing work experience, I would go so far as to say that the employment environment at Kaiser Fresno is the most hostile, uncultured and unrefined of its kind in the healthcare industry. Quality and safe patient care take a backseat to the ""great pay and benefits,"" and these are the only reasons why nurses stay. If you value your integrity, morals &  principles, and are willing to make a little less money to preserve them, take your priceless experience and skills elsewhere.Program executives are committed to Kaiser Permanente's mission to serve the community.  The three departments that I have worked in, and the dozens more whom I have collaborated with, are talented and interested in thinking about the impact of their work.KP is a great company to work for. The culture is one focused on patient care and over community  care. I would recommend Kaiser to potential employees. The benefits and work life balance are a plus.I can not say enough about the great place to work like KP. The employees are great and very friendly. Days are what you make them. Most co-workers are hard working and like their jobs.If you are non-union, you are treated like a third class citizen.  You work harder, pay more for insurance and prescriptions.  Receive lower wages, no salary increases, and held to a higher standard, due to KP ""honoring"" union contracts.  Union workers receive automatic non-merit raises annually and have a ""not my job"" attitude, which non-union EE must pick up the workload.  Middle management who run large departments with big union environments are corrupt. They will bend laws and contract to pacify Union and Upper Management.  Not all Kaisers are like this - but Roseville, CA is extremely offensive.Kaiser is a really good employer in that they want to see their employees succeed in Career and Home Life.  They do work tirelessly at ensuring that you are happy in your workplace and feel you have a positive work/life balance.","10,000+",San-Francisco,Oakland,CA,2016-08-31T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/10ff50c0-c572-42b2-a271-e02c13443055?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=4,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Continued success due to strong development and technology capacity looks to be strong.The changing nature of the industry puts more focus on 'in the office' time for Account Executives, making presence in the Boston office the better part of most days a factor in continued success. On a personal level, living in Central Massachusetts is not a great fit for my current position and the commute (which was not as frequent based on the initial scope of my current position) has become the hardest part of the job.Management is 'hands off' style for the most part, affording individuals with the ability to self-motivate, a strong opportunity to work independently and achieve success.Spire Corporation was a great company to work for. I managed the marketing and design functions of the company for 16 years.Spire had great pay for someone coming right out of undergrad however the company culture of passing the blame and speaking to each other in ways that are inappropriate to a professional work setting (including managment) is what sent me running.100% commission split cannot be beat.

140,141.0,Principal Data Scientist (User Data),Thomson Reuters Corporation,4.0,1600.0,"Thomson Reuters provides very good work life balance. The co-workers are good and it is a fun place to be. The salary is not bad and you feel fulfilled because of it.Working here opens the doors to so many opportunities.  Their training for interns puts more emphasis on preparing you for the future you desire than a future with the company, and the VP of Customer Operations takes the time to learn everybody's names and get to know you pretty well.  Strong emphasis on work/life balance at this company.  They ask that you don't take your work home with you, and they are heavy on the coffee breaks.Overall great place to work!Tax and Accounting Department doesn't seem to be doing the things necessary to have long term employment for their sales personnel. Products are outdated and over priced, the way people sell them now devalues their prices in the first place, creating two seasons where you can sell products - q2, and q4. Pay was continually downgraded - they would up your base salary and completely soften your commissions. The third year of my employment I would have had to sell 150K more than I sold my second year to make the same amount of money. Pressure from management to make a certain number of dials a day, you're monitored, and if you don't hit your numbers - whether sales or dials you are on this ice. Out perform your team and go two hundred percent of quota? you're still there late at the end of the month, and management is extremely quick to forget your performance if you have a lackluster quarter due to their poor business strategy. The training here is top notch, and the managers are mostly good.Great products, good company, pretty tough when it comes to work life balance.  I have worked here for over 3 years and almost every week I work 70 hours or more.  It's very tough to take a vacation and succeed.  If you are single and/or don't have a life, it's great because you can make a lot of money.  If you have a family and you are dedicated to your family, it can be really rough.  The health care benefits are pretty expensive.It has been several years since I worked here. When I did work there, they had a very family oriented work place. My wife was going through some health issues and they were very understanding, sometimes going above and beyond what most people would do. At the time I worked there, before the implementation of obamacare, they had outstanding health, dental and vision insurance. I am not sure what it is now. I saw several people move up within the company which was a really nice change from some companies I have worked for.Good work-life balance; nice people. Good pay and benefits.  Nice and supportive culture. Management is supportive and company offers lots of opportunities for career and personal growthThe management in this organization is extremely supportive and provide you opportunities to grow and thrive in a competitive environment. This company will drive you to be self motivated and will allow you to be truly successful.Enjoyable place to work. Would like to see more stability and less change.  Micromanagement is everywhere and the next change is always just around the corner. It is hard to be effective in an environment where you are always looking over your shoulder.Good idea of work/life balance, but very understaffed, so, typically 40+ hours week with a lot of stress and pressure of deadlines. Low salary. Very nice team members. Flexible schedule with possibility of working from home. Good benefits.At times the hours could be long, and there were some layoffs, but if you put in some effort there were many opportunities to expand your skills and learn new things. Compensation could vary a lot, but the benefits package was really good.Great company to work for, good people.  The management was great to work for.  The company provides a good workplace environment.  They provide many learning opportunities as well.It has been a pleasure to work at Thomson Reuters. Benefits and pay are great. Management is outstanding. The company culture is one of a kind. I would recommend Thomson Reuters to anyone.We're a huge OLD company that was the result of 100s of acquisitions. Compared to Google, a Software Engineer wouldn't want to be here. It's not tailored for high caliber engineers who are highly paid and who's time is highly respected. Bureaucracy is all over the place. From HR, to project team level.My manager is a great person, that's the main reason I'm still here. Also, our benefits are top notch, not our perks though.The benefits are declining, the management i always changing and their is always uncertainty as to who will be in charge the next week and if you will have a job.people here is greatcompany culture is not focused on technologymanagement is reasonable, but salary is stagnantbenefit is very badIf you are looking for a company with great flexibility and work/life balance, Thomson Reuters is the place for you. Perfect place to have a fulfilling career, but also time to enjoy life.Thomson Reuters is a great company for individuals with families and children. They have great benefits with excellent personal time off /vacation time.Nice place to work at, with a great work/life balance and competitive compensation and benefits. The environment is nice with a perfect mix of old school professional and millennials.If you're into chaos and enjoy a fast-paced, frequently changing environment, then this is the place for you.There is certainly a ""Work hard, play hard"" ethic here.  Many people work a significant amount of hours, but are also compensated for their efforts in the form of recognition, bonuses, etc.Management has a clear vision and is constantly trying to tune the internal engine to perform as good as possible.Overall a good place to work.The one downside is the ""Mothership"" mentality of the folks in Eagan, MN.   Although the CEO resides in New York City, the largest percentage of employees are located in Eagan, MN.   The Eagan folks have an ""Eagan First"" mentality and staff at other locations are all expected to fall in-line with Eagan's way of doing business.Lots of cold calls. Micro-management. Emails at all times of the day. Never seen a company with so many emails from management. It seems they justify their positions through the number of emails they send out. Quotas are nearly the same in all territories whether you have Silicon Valley, Manhattan or rural Nebraska. Management views any negative feedback as complaining or whining, thus stifling objective and constructive feedback from field reps.Great company to work for as far as benefits! I truly enjoyed my time working in their tax and accounting department. They also offer a substantial amount of PTO","10,000+",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-08-11T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/d8dc75bb-0dc9-446f-a709-312a2d1ccedf?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=9,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I make the powerpoint for the upcoming week and print out any checks needed to pay bills. I answer phone and transfer calls. I make copies of flyers and make new flyers that are needed for the upcoming church service. I enjoy my job here. The garden in the courtyard is a  wonderful place to eat lunch and reflect on my day. The pastor is so encouraging and I just love working for her. I dont believe there is a hard part to my job.Use to love going to work.  My coworkers were my second family.  A typical day at work is answering phones and processing a little mail.  Was great at multi-tasking.It was a Fun day for all the Seniors, I learnt that just because you in your 9o's or even in your 100's that doesn't mean you cant drive, work out and have a little fun too.my co-workers and I al had a different section in what we had to do and we all had fun doing it. The hardest part when I first started was answering the phones and putting it through to the person they wanted to speak to, But I must say now I am GREAT at it. The most enjoyable part is now answering the phones and looking at all the seniors talk to each other and playing uno and etc.My department includes hard working team players. We worked well together to get the job done. I appreciate all their hard work.I work as a bilingual customer care representative. I answer phone calls in both languages and reply to Spanish email from customers. I process the regular mail and handle subscriptions of our magazine, books, etc. There are 30-35 people in my department and we all work independently. The hardest part of my job is every other month we receive many phone calls (our magazines delivers once every other month) to order magazines. The most enjoyable part of my job is the friendly environment.It was an event we signed up for during school to do chair massages in the park. it was fun but difficult as the day was long and hot. but they didnt mind me cutting out for 30 minutes or so to rest and eat, enjoying the events at the park before getting back to give more massages.no day is the same with it's ups and downs, this type of work definitely requires alot of patience working with people of all ages that need our help with their daily bathing cares. I work with a great team of professionals that communicate and work well with each other. The most difficult part of this profession is dealing with death. I have learned not to be afraid of death, but to remember it as the start of another journey in life and the rewards of this profession is seeing a smile, a touch on the hand and knowing you made someones day better.The Unity Group uses local golf courses and golf tournaments to unite families and people in the local community. We are typically planning tournaments, searching for sponsorships for tournaments, recruiting members into our one stop golf discount plan. I am co-owner and CEO with the majority share in the company. The hardest part is getting a ""start up business"" rolling in this economy. The goal of this company is noble in nature, and is meant to create unity between people that might not otherwise meetA typical day at work would consist of daily shift duties and checking in with the previous shift to make note of any changes that could have been made for meds or any diet changes. I have learned to be patient with every resident and to take a step in their shoes and understand where they are coming from. Our management at Unity Group was excellent, always fair, understanding and fulfilled their duties well. The hardest part of my job, was dealing with extreme behaviors. The most enjoyable part of my job was developing relationships with the residents, you'll find out that they all have something special about each and every one of them. You can find them to be quite the comedians and givers themselves.I felt like during my time at Unity House it was clear to me that people were there for the betterment of the clients. We worked hard to provide the best care for our clients. Unity House does great work for the community and especially the clients they serve.I worked as a volunteer at Unity of Jacksonville. Initially I started working with the toddlers. I actually never saw myself working with children until this experience. It was most rewarding because the work help me to find the true passion fulfilling my purpose.The Experience with the youth was fun and rewarding. I was a volunteer but I treated the position and the youth as they were my own. Facility has changed in leadership since early 2002 but the team at unity worked lovingly together.I loved working here. But didn't like the staff I was working with. Always going against me and trying to get me into trouble for stuff I didn't do.Lovely place to be creative and independent and task and goal skill builder.Love doing my job. Management and co workers were great. The hardest part of my job was listening to grieving callers.This job will allow for the day to go by rapidly and keep you physically active.",,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-08-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/7b94e6c8-e6d0-452a-929d-c517df2a90c4?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

143,144.0,Data Scientist,Advantis Global,3.0,2.0,"- Management is great - enjoy working with my direct manager who provided constant support and guidance. - In technical recruiting you have 20% control of what goes on so it is not a stable work environment by any means. In this job you definitely have to be resilient and thick-skinned. - A lot of the expectations set for recruiters and account managers are unrealistic and in order to hit those goals you have to stay late (working unpaid overtime). - The Apple Account Manager is by far the meanest person I have ever worked with. Belittles recruiters and even management on a day-to-day basis. In the time I was with the company many recruiters quit solely because of her treatment and the hostility she brings to the office.I sourced and recruited highly skilled IT professionals into various technical positions, conducted 250+ calls, 75+ leads, and 10+ in-person interviews with candidates on a weekly basis, built rapport with both candidates and clients to ensure the best fit in a team, managed full cycle recruitment and fulfillment processes, and generated leads and cold called for new business development.I learned time management and consistency; time is money. Management was very easy communicate with and provided great tools to success; however, they did play favorites when it came to who was making the most money. My co-workers were great for the most part; however, because it is such a young environment, people tended to form cliques and judge alot. The hardest part of the job was to be consistent--there are good weeks and bad weeks.

Great environment and team effort all day. i learned a lot on how to style every women for their body type.The place don't appreciate temporary employee's whent home sick throwing up and I get let go the next day the people aren't very friendly free food really how long will it take before they hire a lot more people and get rid of the free food not longMy first day at stitch fix suck.the management is in their own world.Manager and trainer was playing and cussing the other employees.once they show you what to do .the trainer did not come back to check to see if I am doing the job right.at the end of the day manager and trainer had clock out before me.the new employee. they are very hood in the warehouse.don't like getting paid only twice a month.I have grown a lot as a person and learned a lot of great things! They don't believe in merit based raises and want to give you a lot of roles/not compensate you for it.I absolute love Stitch Fix, Everyone is very friendly, Managers will work with your schedule, you can listen to music, and they offer free snacks and drinks everyday!Stylists enjoy flexible hours with great management. There is a community of Stylists who work together fabulously. If you have a passion for fashion, you will thoroughly enjoy styling clients from across the United States!Management is really poor. They never communicate with one another, so the employee's are always finding things out at the last minute. You can see favoritism all over the place. I have been working there for almost a year now and I have never been given the opportunity to move up. I see new people with less than six months at the warehouse get promoted left and right. Managers run their department however they feel like it and they also make you come in early, but they won't show up until regular showtime or even later.Loser trash job stay away. Pure slavery in all forms like working in jail the worst job ever the people there are low class and management is pure garbage. Its like a chinese sweat shop if you are not a favorite then you will get treated like dirt!!This was my first time working at a warehouse.  I was a temp. The atmosphere can be very negative. Alot of the employees have attitudes and are hard to get to know. It seems like management changes policies and rules very often. I did see favoritism, which is not fair to the employess that work hard. Lots of Drama. Adults should act like adults, not childish brats. The amount of insubordination I saw was amazing. These people would have been fired somewhere else.  Not very flexible when it comes to family situations and your schedule. You'll get nowhere there if they don't like you. Free snacks  are great, but not worth working there.The job is easy, but I feel like the company is trying to make slaves out of theses workers. They say it's climate controlled, but the temperature is above 80, they have you stand in one place expecting you to pack clothes at a fast pace while trying not to collapse frm the pain frm your feet. They should provide you a chair if all you are doing is standing there. I realize that most workers breaking a sweat getting all the work done are black and hispanics and mainly the managers and the stylists who sits on their butts and doesn't do much yet get paid more are white. Its a major race issue within this company in my opinion, I feel like I'm a slave and us as workers that receive the clothes frm the trucks, put the clothes on the racks, pick the clothes frm the racks, pack the clothes and ship them should be treated with as much respect as the white people who sit down all day. Stop treating the ones that do all the work like slaves, I mean it's already hard for blacks and hispanics to find jobs so the only job we can probably get we get treated like slaves. I would enjoy it more if I didn't feel like a modern slave. I applied to be a stylist for this company and was denied for no apparent reason yet hired for a warehouse worker. Oh I forgot I'm not white nor have blonde hair to work in the cool part of the building. More people need to stand up for what's right and never let people treat you as if you are beneath them. Money is not everything REMEMBER THAT!!I took a job as a stylist part time to ease the transition into full time after having a baby. I was really excited about the opportunities that I thought the company might present down the road but I realized very soon that, even with a degree in fashion and 10 years of experience, I'd never be promoted even though I had very high statistics (they measure these very closely). As mentioned in many other comments, the management team is like a small group of sorority girls that choose favorites. I lost respect for the brand and the culture very quickly. That's what happens when you don't see and tap into your own employees potential and allow negative people to get settled into positions of power. Good luck fellow fashion majors- I feel your pain!This warehouse is very unprofessional. They play loud music with extreme content and profanity, like five different radios at once. The supervisors never speak to you or introduce themselves. All the supervisors do is stand there and talk all day. There is no air in the warehouse but in the offices they're nice and cool. Iv seen females pass out from the heat. Leads/trainers come to work with hang overs. We are always short on Saturdays because people call in. It's extremely ghetto so if that's not the atmosphere you like then I'm telling you right now this isn't the place for you.  If you have an idea they will steal it and take credit for it. All we do for 10 hours is fold clothing, wrap it and put it in a box. If it isn't to their liking then they send it back to you. Sometimes they sabotage your work on purpose so you have to do it over. The breaks are very very short. People have their cliques so it's hard to get to know do workers. Pay is alright and they have stocked drinks of every kind and different snacks. Over all I wouldn't recommend this company or at least the warehouse.Managementment team could be a lot more organized. They are very big on favorites. The don't accept doctors excuses or anything.I used to enjoy come to work everyday, but first they changed the schedule, second It's hard to get a promotion unless you are friends with the management, even if you are going above and beyond your required job duties your not getting full rise or even worse you get nothing, then you have to wait another year to get cents, the management is really poor, a lot of supervisor for just one department and they never dont know anything, they never can answer a question and will send you with other supervisor.

If they were given better direction that would have been much more productive and less frustrated.Fun and relaxed place to work. Supportive management ( professional and personal growth). Feeling comfortable with the people you work with, getting to know them knowing they are good people and good at what they do.Company lost focus on product development and establishing needed processes to follow.  Executive team does not communicate with employees and the direction of the company.  Lack of funding and no future for bringing company to IPO.I like working for this company the Management Team is very friendly and understanding and great with assisting your with any issue you may have .Work environment is great, many great and talented people.  Product ID is unbeatable with museum type of design.  Free lunch, drinks, snacks, + birthdays and work anniversaries celebration is fun.A normal day includes checking in, the computer, as well as the store manager on duty. Being the field operation specialist you don't have no other co-workers, but you do teach the other employees in the store on the products you sell. Everything has it's challenges, like a day when there isn't anybody interested in hearing about your product, which happens, but to overcome that I tend to relocate in other areas to find more customers. The most enjoyable part of working is interacting with people, and selling products.Jawbone benefits from their great talent but has a serious lack of Management. Jawbone suffers most from the lack of direction.Own product structure and delivery into manufacturing.Work one-on-one with engineers and product managers to create BOMs and required support documentation.Bit chaotic.

162,163.0,Lead Data Scientist,Glassdoor,3.9,14.0,"Glassdoor used to be a great company to work for. Unfortunately, they have made some significant changes within the last 12 months that has created a sour culture in sales. No one is getting paid, no one is happy, and most are looking for other jobs.I hope they can turn it around as I truly believe in their mission and extraordinary executive leadership.Welcome to SD. Prepare to have all your basic labor rights violated.  Sexist, racist and a general scumbag the owner is constantly in court.  After starting work there thats when people laughed at me and told me the nick name Revolving Glass Door since the staff is always changing.I always felt like I was making a difference in the world.The leadership is great, the people are great and the culture is great.Just had to move continents or I would have stayed forever!Glassdoor wants to believe it treats its staff like a family, but it is incredibly dysfuntcional. In the beginning, they seem to treat their employees well, but then arbitrarily eliminate their roles or let them go for no good reason. I have seen it happen many times. Also, their strategy changes so often that is there is no true job security or opportunity for advancement. The management team is inexperienced and immature and often make decisions that lack real thought or analysis.Glassdoor's product team lacks innovation. They merely copy the market leaders - like Indeed and TripAdvisor.Good people are being let go, and a lot of other good people are leaving. Glassdoor is not managing its growth well, and the ""family"" is falling apart.*note: wrote a similar review on Glassdoor, but (surprise) they did not post it.Company had a great opportunity to growth, but lacked in upper management.Amazing place to work with lots to do everyday, I learned a lot during my internship. The con's would be the distance from the city, if you don't have a car its hard to get to the office everyday. But besides the the distance it's a great place to work.Worked as a temp for 2 months and was not hired in perm. even though they were hiring, read reviews on companies and accepted, rejected or escalated the reviews. The employees were great and the job was easy.  You could work from home if you were hired in perm. The hardest part was reading a computer screen for 8 hours a day. Loved the way you were treated there, always willing to help if you could not make it in.I love the company and what I do, being able to be helpful and apply knowledge and learning is a good opportunity  for me, people are very nice and helpful, I enjoy working during the week and I miss being with my friends during the weekendsGood place to start your career. The CEO definitely built a strong company with solid values. Also the B2C component is the best out there and the B2C side is growing too. Awesome culture, people and work. I get to learn a lot of new things every day.

Its an emotional experience.Great people help make a great company. The open work environment took some time to get used to but helped foster collaborative working. The ability to work from home when need-be was a positive.Contract engineer performing supplier quality work.  Helped Philips & their suppliers get through remediation period and successfully ramp up back to normal production.I worked at lifeline not only for my paycheck ,but the rewards of helping the subscribers . There arn't alot of people that handle calls when the sub presses that phb for depression ,lonliness,anxiety,suicidal,robberies and confusion and just to talk and the typical I've fallen and can't get up was frequent,to hear a friendly voice that they may recognize. My coworkers had compassion,kindness and were monitored on a frequent basis. We left our life behind to help people.Snow,rain,sleet we were there.Good atmosphere and cool place.Good job and good compensation and good benefits and good security and good advancement and good management and good job culture.Overall, the worst experience of my professional career.  The beaurocracy is beyond compare, with zero important decisions delegated beyond the second level CEO.  That's right, there are three CEOs reporting vertically into one another, and even the Vice Presidents don't own their P&L.   There's a complete mismatch between accountability and authority, annual performance goals aren't finalized until Q4 or after the year closes, and the subjective nature of the reviews allow politics and relationships to vastly overshadow any objective measurement of success.  All metrics are kept at a total division level, so free riders can rejoice with a good bonus while hard workers are exploited and asked to continue to do more for the team.a fantastic company but specific managers make it ""less than appealing"". I would  highly recommend you work there, but you need to be able to tolerate managers (some) who only care about their paychecks and not about you.A typical day at Philips consists of me reviewing Global Complaints and trying to manage the complaints I already have in TrackWise our Complaint Handling Database.Temp: Customer Service for 2 years (original assignment was 6-8 mths). Company had no intention of hiring as direct.  Job was outsourced to India. Co-workers were very nice, fun, and helpful. There was no hard part of the job, easiest I have ever done. Not enough challenges.  Too many managers, not always available when needed.It is fun working in the company. I have dealt with complex troubleshooting issues of LAN/WAN. The management is very co-operative and friendly. The co-workers help us to understand the concepts.a day at work is usually the same depending on what department I am working in stock room shipping or receiving. mainly stockroomfor now between me and 5 other workers we all have different responsibility. the hardest part is when I receiving orders at the last minute that has to be pulled from stock and transacted and deliveredto production area before the close of the day management is good especially if you have a problem very is to talk to. most enjoyable part of the job is employee discounts .what I learned fire safetyspill control, hazardous labels of material and how to store themWork from home and Travel as needed to customer sites. Occasional weekend work and late night work scheduled as needed.Philips is a great company to work for, as with any large corporations, moving up could be quite slow.  However, in exchange you get stability, solid benefits, a great work environment and the satisfaction that you are benefiting society through better healthcare.Work/Life balances, focus on employee satisfaction, decent pay and benefits.  Diverse background of employees.Hardest Part - Levels of managers and collaboration to get things changedEasiest Part - strong HR involvement in employee satisfaction and listening to employeesPhilips is a good company. The products are innovative and well received by the public. The compensation is fair, but there is no room to grow as an FSR.I found Philips a very difficult place to work.  I was new to the team and no training was provided.  I had to learn my job by trial and error.  When I went to management with questions, they had no answer.  Had to work on holidays.Great company to work for. Great benefits and compensation packages. Philips is a leader in the healthcare industry with a majority lead in the market share. Diverse product set with quality manufacturing, engineering and customer support.The work is easy just very fast pace. When I first started, everyone was very friendly. Once you learn how to do the job you will have no problems.a good place to work how to make exit signs management was good coworker communication  was good inventory time  was the hardest part most enjoyable when we came together as a family at holidays before the day we get offa great place to be innovative in your approach to ultrasound and sales.

169,170.0,Senior Data Scientist - Commercial Business,Auction.com,3.5,43.0,"The staff level employees are great and I met a lot of wonderful people during the time I worked there. Middle-management needs a lot of work. People tend to get promoted based on who they know or how long they've been there and not based on if they can handle the job. There is a big disconnect between staff level employees and upper management due to middle-management not reporting actual problems that are going on to cover themselves. There is a lot of favoritism and nepotism. Room for advancement is virtually impossible some departments do not let you leave to work in another department. I think executive level management really needs to sit down and talk to staff level employees to find out what is really going on because they would be shocked. During the time I was there I didn't encounter many people that were actually happy working there most people felt stuck and were very unhappyGreat culture overall. Casual. Fun. Collaborative.

Overall the company is a good company to work for within the Real Estate community.Contract writing lots of phone calls Customer servicegreat working environmenteveryone is friendlyvery good support team great trainingroom for advancementAuction.com is a great place to work.  Management is changing for the better and we are definitely on a trajectory.  Non-performers are weeded out quickly and the culture is great.  A well established company with a start-up vibe, and many perks.  Perks include free lunch, game room, and many learning opportunities.I loved working for Auction.com.  They were great to their employees and provided a great work/life balance.Highly recommendBeing hired with Auction is a short term employment not long term.  Upper management did not care about their employees nor the long hours they stayed to complete the daily reports and work load.I love working with people and helping them. I got to speak with people from all over the world.What I learned is that it cost me nothing to me kind and pleasant to people. A lot of times our clients do not do their home work so to speak. Which meant al lot of questions I would have to go over with them. But the best feeling is when they understood and were happy I took time with them.This Company does a poor job at growing talent from within. Lacks motivation for employees to excel up in the OrganizationThere is no room for advancement within the company. You would have to kiss a lot of butt cheek to move up. Management is horrible, company is a joke, all the executive want more money in there pocket and treated the little guy as dirt.Not recommended for referral. No additional information can be provided. Located in Irvine, CA. Experience may vary by department. Company remains in transition since recent merger.Advancement is difficult at best. Almost never any openings. Bonuses are not based on your individual efforts for the most part. However, the atmosphere is great, co-workers always help one another. The work is always fast-paced, but almost never unbearable.Great Pay.Management is very poor. Company does not care for anyone. Hours very Flexible.I work as a Contract Writer at the monthly Auctions in Georgia. I've been with the company for about a year, but have only done a handful of auctions. The people are amazing, very friendly and helpful. Everyone really works as a team and carries their own weight! You also start to grow attached to the county that you work in because you begin to learn and become friendly with the people who attend the auctions (most of the properties are bought by companies that attend every month).The work is simple, but you do need to have an eye for detail. You are dealing with property transactions! Plenty of money that you will be handling. They hold training classes EVERY month the Saturday before the auction because it is crucial that no mistakes are made.They have started using an iPad app to do the contracts. While I love them when it works there are still quite a few things that can make using them a pain (if it goes to sleep in the middle of the contract it can delete all the info you've entered). As for the customers, like I said, they come every month. Some of them can be short with you and seem cold, but most of them are very friendly. I have a sneaking suspicion that some of them just come for social hour, lol! But they know what they are doing and don't play games about it, so make sure you listen well in training.However, as a bad note when I first started I did one auction. Then was placed on standby for almost 6 months. I guess they over-hired when I was hired, but then after people started leaving I was able to work more. Now I'm an essential part of my county's  more... team and doubt I will be placed on standby again. So be prepared for that possibility.Another bad note, when I started the pay was $25/hour. Then it was moved to $20/hour with no notice except when my paycheck felt lighter. Pretty unprofessional.  less","501 to 1,000",San-Francisco,Belmont,CA,2016-10-17T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/6911c89a-f39e-4c6c-a830-ea792a135aa2?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

173,174.0,Sr. Data Scientist,InsideSales.com,3.3,14.0,"I really liked the people I worked with. Everybody there is really smart. Lack of operational communication could sometimes cause confusion.I worked there in Provo as an Intern. Amazing company and amazing people. I went there last summer. Good place to be for internship.All of the employees are dedicated and ingrained into the objective of he company.I Hired people and managed the Human Resources.Do not accept a sales job at ISDC unless you are willing to be under thumb 24/7.The last couple of days of each month you will be the used car sales man issuing fire sales on anything and everything to get half baked deals in the door. Average sale is 4.7 months but mid-market sales is still run on a monthly cadence. Expect only a 90-day ramp and extreme pressure to close BEFORE the ramp is completed. Expect to self source 90% of your opportunities as Business Development is non-functional. In a year or two this might be a decent place to work but right now literally EVERYTHING is broken from sales on down to implementation and support. Customer retention is at an all time low. Do not believe the hype generated by the CEO. The predictive analytics they preach as the next big thing in sales is vaporware still. While the base they offer is decent, most everyone in mid market is starving to death and only 4-5 reps (out of 20-25) are actually hitting quota. Proceed at your own risk!Typical Day:Designs test suites Writes and executes test cases Automates test suites Responds/executes emergency ClientHotfixes. Utilized Html 5, Css3, JavaScript,Selenium, Selenium IDE, Jira, qTestManagement and Coworkers: easy to work withHardest: working through the night to meet deadlineExciting company to work for, fun, always changing. Great management team, experienced senior management team. Nice facilities.InsideSales.com is a rapidly growing company located in Provo, UT. The development team comprised about 20% of the company workforce. I gained valuable experience in programming in Apex/VIsualForce, Salesforce.com's proprietary language.Just like has been said in other reviews (and look at how many people found helpful rather than the fake reviews marketing and HR posted), the recruiters bait you with promises of ""opportunity"" and ""advancement"". This is only partially true, it only creates ""opportunity"" for you to advance within the company and get a few promotions to make your resume look good. Then you get out as soon as you can find a better job. Turn over at Insidesales.com is unbelievably high. If you perform, you will get promoted, and quickly. But these promotions come with very meager increases in salary. They are starting MBAs off in customer service at $12.00 and hour. After sIx months of that you get a big promotion to $14.00 an hour! The advancement and opportunity advertisement they hit you with is misleading. Although you can work your way up, when you finally get there the almighty CEO holds all the decision making to himself. You can't even get him to buy chairs for his employees without begging him for a year (still no chairs). People bring their own pens and chairs, and office supplies to work. This is a company with over 250 employees. The wall at the office have exposed studs and we all work in giant rows of IKEA desks. They attribute all this  to having a""scrappy"" culture, but come see for yourself, this place is a dump, it is a joke. The culture is toxic. Management does everything at the last minute and is completely disorganized. All power is held by the micromanaging CEO and his lackeys. Projects, purchases, anything waits on the CEOs desk while he goes on vacation or walks  more... around micromanaging every faucet of the company.I worked for the administration. So I had a lot of contact with these guys. They are all complete egomaniacs, except for perhaps the CMO, he at least has some credentials and he has direction for the company. Never in my life have I felt this way about a company or a job, I love my current position and get paid double. I also have liked or loved working in every other job I've ever had, but not this one.If you can't find a job, you can probably survive here long enough to get a little star on your resume, but then get the heck out.  lessI enjoy working for this company, they see hard workers and reward us for the hard work we put in! Environment is a blast! The CEO throws great parties to show his appreciation as well as regular raises! The president is a brilliant teacher giving continued teaching to all of the staff. If you want a great career, Insidesales is the place to work!The company is all about learning new things. They constantly change and update the product, work space, management, and their employees. This has its ups and downs, but they want to succeed and they want their employees to succeed. It's a good way to enter the sales world with a technology twist and has a lot of potential. I like working here. Sometimes I think management wasn't the best but overall good.I work as BDR as InsideSales.com. A typical day at work included dialing through junk leads that the marketing department provided. Typically they were 2 to 3 years old, and the person did not even work the the company. Aside from the bad pay and subpar benefits sales reps are constantly being screwed out of commissions for any reason management determines fit. Management says no one has been there for very long because they are growing so fast, but it seems most people move onto better paying, less abusive jobs.The CEO is excellent at selling, and sells our product well to new hires and employees alike. This creates a strong sense of cohesion and community in the company.A typical day starts at 8:30 am (and runs till 5:30 pm). Get in, review what I worked on yesterday to reinitialize mental state, prepare for the day's work, and then go to the daily stand up meeting for the team, where we all sit and share our accomplishments of the past day and plans for the day. After that it's headphones on and get your code on until lunch. Feature finished, log it in the bug tracker, commit and push it to git, pat self on back, and move on. Lunch I take in the cafeteria, and it's delicious. After lunch, it's back to headphones on coding until the end of the day.I've learned a lot about software teams, and how we can work together and spread out the work to get things done. I've also learned how to build things quickly when important, and continued to refine my ability to clean up things that were written quickly.On the whole, management tends to be easy to work with and willing to trust employees to do what they were hired for - being awesome. The best advice I've found about management is - if you don't have fun during the interview, you won't have fun working with them. That said, the CEO typically conducts (or did) final interviews for new hires, and he is fun to be around.Coworkers tend to be skilled and competent. There are outliers on both sides, but overall I have been quite satisfied with the competence of my coworkers.The hardest part of the job is dealing with the gobs and piles  more... of software that we've written, interfacing always in interesting ways. The most enjoyable part is pleasing customers - internal or external, making something awesome is a really enjoyable experience, and one that I've had the pleasure of often here.  lessWant to start out making 24,000? Then work here. They say they are about opportunity, not compensation nor benefits. Try retiring, supporting your family, etc off of opportunity. They brag about how ""awesome"" they are and yet they reduced my salary because it was too high.Only place I have worked where I actually heard other employees talk about mutiny. Very high turnover.The company is extremely unorganized. Everything is last minute. And they take pride in it because they are ""scrappy.""Terrible place. Apply if you are desperate, and then don't stop applying to other places.",,San-Francisco,San Mateo,CA,2016-09-16T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/ca9347b2-43f9-4c66-be14-04f746eef91b?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

176,177.0,Staff Scientist (Particle Data Group - Physics Division),Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,4.2,62.0,"The work at LBNL was very organized and well managed. The collaboration is one key point of my experience. The time schedule is flexible. Offices quite small.it's hard to have a developed career if you don't have a PhD at national lab. Stable but salary can't be high. You will have good health insurance and pension plan which is rare now.Good place to work.  Good benefits, and a great view.  Opportunities depend on the Division you work for.  Culture is improving daily.I moved to the Bay Area for a postdoc position at LBNL. I love working there and have good colleagues, but the culture of LBNL is different from most other national labs in that there isn't a well-defined track for advancement. You either get one of the rare staff scientist positions, or your out looking for jobs in 2-5 years. Overall, it was a positive experience, but I would have liked more stability.I worked on the Administration side of LBNL and unless you're a scientist, they don't really value you as an employee.  After being employed for a administrator position, I was relegated to a storeroom issued parts for 90% of my time.  My manager did a poor job of training me for the duties listed in the job description, pawning me off on other employees from time to time.  While this may sound normal, during the interview process I was told that I would be working closely with my supervisor, attending meetings and shadowing him to learn both his position and mine.Although there as a contract employee, this company is a great place to work. The company is diversified and everyone you work with is pleasant. Each of the persons in different departments supported HR and worked together as a team to ensure each Department at the lab were supported and each employee and student received the information needed to be a success.The Berkeley Lab is managed more like a university than other national laboratories, likely because of its proximity to UC Berkeley. This has some of the benefits of a university-like feel, but sometimes makes it difficult to execute large/ambitious projects that (a) require coordination between different departments/divisions, and (b) require some legwork before being able to publish results.If you're interested in building new capabilities instead of making slides about all that cool stuff you're going to do with your grant money, you might want to look elsewhere.I have been working with the scientists who work real hard to advance the current knowledge state of science to the next level. I am really inspired and motivated by seeing their motivation for the good cause of humanity. Typical job day includes a lot of computational work including scientific programming, simulation, data analysis, visualization, and above all sharing these information with the fellow scientists and colleagues. Also, there are a lots of enlightening seminars almost every day where we can learn the new knowledge of a research area. The work culture here is excellent and the people are very helpful and supportive. The most enjoyable part is how knowledgeable the people working here yet so humble. Hardest part is to keep publishing of cutting edge research papers which sometime takes years.Great place to learnGreat place to workGreat place to cryGreat place to laughGreat place to support leaders in scienceMulti cultural environment with top-notch research in various fields of science. Large opportunity to learn, collaborate and perform every step of the experimental process.love working as a Research Assistant at the Center for Research and Education on Aging Lab (CREA) in the Lawrence Berkeley NationalLaboratory division of Physical Biosciences. I'm part of a very interesting research were we are Investigating the causes and processes of aging through caloric restrictionwith the objective of improving and extending the human health span. Helped create an interactive map of the agingprocess based on thousands of published primary academic research.LBNL is a fantastic place to work. The people there are the most intelligent and creative in the scientific world. I am only an intern right now but it's obviously a great work environment.LBL is a fine place to work.  Pay scale is good.  The location and campus is nice.  LBL does a lot of important work that it is fun to be a part of.Tons of available resources, nice work environment and location.

The research setting is very nice, and the environment I worked in is collaborative, and interactions are generally constructive.Excellent and productive research environment, dynamic and truly international atmosphere.

Lots of opportunities to collaborate with people from different backgrounds. I like the management. Everyone encourages out of the box ideas.The best part about working at LBNL is the beautiful location. The lab is located in the Berkeley hills surrounded by nature with a beautiful view of the San Francisco Bay. The most enjoyable part of the job was serving new employees, taking their  photos for their badges and interacting with them. The hardest  part of the job was dealing with bureaucracy. Overall working at the lab was enjoyable.It is a good place to do science. Sometimes can be very bucrocratic. As a postdoc you can't apply to have independent funding which makes the transition to staff quite harsh.  Very relaxed environment but the salary is to low for the area.A typical day at work for me was pushing paperwork. I worked in the proposals department where I had to obtain signatures of scientist and then submit the proposal for funding. I learned the structure of a proposal and how to submit it for funding for different projects. Management and co-workers were very helpful and always worked together. The hardest part of the job was making sure I paid attention to detail because if one thing was incomplete or wrong on the proposal you would have to start all over because the proposal would get rejected. The most enjoyable part of the job was when our proposal were granted.",,San-Francisco,Berkeley,CA,2016-09-14T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/597a69e1-05d4-4ff5-aeea-17d842095c2a?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

182,183.0,"Senior Data Scientist, Big Data Products",Asurion,3.8,823.0,"This company offers lots of great supports to its remote agents. I enjoyed my team members and leaders. Supervisors and coaches were always available and willing to helpDaily routine varies based on the most current situation which could include system down time, weather or missing personnel. I learned several coaching techniques that provided excellent results.Management was reactive never proactive and is isolated from each other and staff.Co-workers are nervous, high attrition in the 12-14% monthly is expected. Employees making the 1 year mark or remaining after that point are becoming progressively rare. Training and recruitment are the most challenging, with the high attrition the requirement in a small town are taxing.Working with the associates and exceeding goals was extremely challenging and fulfilling.While working as an onboarding technician for Asurion, our typical work day was pre-planned with appointments for meeting new hires or existing agents. We would help install their work software or ensure their computers were meeting our current technical standards. I learned a lot of IT troubleshooting experience while there, and had a couple of amazing supervisors and teammates. The hardest part of the job was probably ensuring that our quality standards were met in a particular field where they were always changing. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to solve computer hardware/software related issues because a good puzzle is hard to beat.Asurion was a great work environment. My co workers and I worked as a team. Management is well rounded because they try to do everything they can to accommodate your needs. At Asurion, I was always on a set schedule from 2-11. I had Tuesdays and Wednesdays off. I was working full time. The benefits were great. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with rude customers over the phone. They would talk over you, curse you out, and really say harsh things to you. I just learn to tune them out and help them the best way I can. Working there was pretty stressful. I was in my own little cubicle, and  I didn't really have anybody to talk to. There really wasn't a way for me to socialize unless I met up with my coworkers on my off days. I love the fact that i had my own space, my own desk, my own computer, and everything. Unfortunately, I got to the point where I couldn't really take it anymore.  It wasn't enjoyable anymore.While Asurion states that it promotes from within, there's very little evidence of it.  Internal jobs may be posted, but they've already have someone in mind.  It's all about who you know and if you're in the 'click'.  You may be qualify, but you won't get the job unless you know someone.  Management just want to chain you to the telephone and expect more for less compensation.  It's merely a place to get a pay check while you diligently look for a better job.   Asurion will proudly claim to hire a lot of people in the area, but what they don't tell you is that they cannot keep good people, because they get burnt out, used and abused.Asurion is a great place to work and they are military friendly as well as diverse.  I picked up alot of management skills as well as my ASPECT training.    The hardest part about the job is adjusting to the ever changing world of technology and the way it impacts customers.  They have great benefits and will work with you to try and give that job/ life balance that you need to be successful at both.  Management is good, advancement in management becomes limited due to good leaders staying true to their position and wanting to improve upon their leadership/ management skills.When this place was NEW there was a great work culture  that was dedicated to taking care of the people that worked for the company. Since it has changed to Asurion it has been less about people and more about the bottom line. Has had so many policy changes its hard to maintain what needs to be followed and the tenure has been a revolving door.Atypical day at work is like talking to a million people, dealing with different attitudes and problems, and the environment around you is something you would have to get used to each day. I have learned at this job that certain things can make a person angry but its up to you to calm them down. Then once you calm them down the call flow will be easy. Management is really management type. They are really good people. They care for you as if it were them. Co-workers at this job can be some good associates and then you will find that person/people who will make you not wanna work there anymore. The hardest part of the job is dealing with people thru the phone and you can't help them enough over the phone and it makes you wish you were there to go ahead and fix the issue. The most enjoyable part of the day would be your lunch time and breaks. Also when you get that customer with so much respect and love that you could feel it thru the phone.Great place to work if all you want is salary and benefits. Terrible work life balance and no endorsement of advanced education. Overall I am glad for my time there as I earned my first Director title there. I still keep in touch with the people I worked with there although 99% of them have moved on as well.While historically known for its phone insurance and device protection, Asurion has turned into a tech-first company, with a focus on better customer experience and breaking grounds in the support and product fields. It was great knowing you are part of something that helps people every day, and having the freedom of a collaborative environment let me be creative and solve problems with fun, outside the box ideas. The folks are great, and you get to work with people from all disciplines and backgrounds and feel like your work has an impact on both the company, its clients, and the customers.Compensation is decent. Work life balance is terrible. There is no such thing as sick days and all bonuses are tied to the carriers ridiculous metrics. Instead of them grading us we get graded down if a customer would not recommend the carrier to a friend. Hmm, so because they have billing issues then thats our fault. The culture is ok, they try to make you believe its greater than what it is. Soon after getting out training those that have been there a while set you straight.   The turnover is so high, its basically a revolving door of employees. Your shifts change every few months. Basically if you don't rank high in the center you get what shifts no one else wanted. Management is unlike anything I have seen all based on favoritism and who chats up the higher ups the most. Tech leads have no idea how to provide support and the systems work when they want. I wanted to like it but at this point I am actively searching for another environment. It says something when only 25% of a training class sticks around and then of that within a month that gets cut in half. Honestly if you care about your work life balance and stress keep looking.You will find:-Many opportunities to earn incentives.-So-so management-Poor system infrastructure and support (things are always    freezing/crashing/or not allowing you to access them at all) be prepared to connect with the service desk, regularly.-Opportunities to raise your pay grade, quickly.-Inflexible scheduling-Fantastic benefits!The people I work with are incredible, and they make my work environment welcoming and responsive. The job has taught me valuable multitasking skills, as well as excellence and efficiency in customer service situations. My management team is effective and available for consultation on a consistent basis. The hardest part of my job are the short time frames in which to complete training exercises and simulations, but this has made me a more adaptable individual both in and outside of work. By far, the community at Asurion is my favorite part of the job.some managers are amazing some don't deserve the position. but you'll find that anywhere. if your a temp make every decision very carefully. if your full time you'll be fine unless you complain to HR about management then you'll be harassed until you quit.A great place to work that stands behind its philosophy of promoting from within. This was my first call center job and within six months of starting I was promoted to Supervisor. The opportunities are there for those who choose to take them. There are several in house benefits such as a fully loaded game room, snack bar, VIP lounges and weekly dress up days. The compensation is adequate and there are bonuses for performers.always job security, and great health benefits. Food for all the staff on weekends. Fun events like crazy hair da,y and jersey Thursday. Great incentives to get up to 600 extra on your paycheck just for doing your job correctly.This call center is like any other.  I have worked here for years and the culture has gone downhill.  You will encounter very unprofessional employees and the company is not transparent with what they say.   You get to work and count the minutes until you leave.  The monetary compensation and benefits are a joke.I enjoyed success at Asurion because I was willing to work hard and the company is great at acknowledging hard work and dedication.Asurion has been a great place to work overall. The pay and benefits are good. I work in Case Management. I started on front line Technical Support and advanced up to Case Management after 4 months of being on the job. I quickly moved up to Team Lead and was given a temporary supervisor position while another supervisor was out on medical leave. Some of my co-workers were great. I really liked the One Team effort of the majority. There is really no hard part to the position. I consistently made the top 10 of 180 Case Managers. The most enjoyable part is helping the customers resolve their issues. Management is decent. The worst part about the job is the Work at Home program for Directv is being cancelled by ATT.Like working for the company there always there when you need the help and they are always there when you need the help with the bad calls but overall good company to work for and the benefits are amazing.this company makes it pretty much impossible for you to have any type of work life balance. compensation is minimal for the area. i would never work there again.","10,000+",San-Francisco,San Mateo,CA,2016-06-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/1d0f8f78-2b7e-4b09-b50e-4d28a25225e6?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

It is a high pressure area but you still feel relaxed and able to do the work. I enjoyed every aspect of this job fully. It is such a fast moving environment, if you aren't quick on your feet, you can be left behind.Facebook is a great place to work.  The culture of innovation provides opportunities that many companies cannot.  This is especially true for security professionals.  The only downside is the lack of career path development for security professionals in this organization.Facebook kind of embodies the American Dream.  Once you're there, anyone can become anything they'd like if they really work at it.  Facebook holds high performance/product expectations, but they take care to provide everything you need to get the job done and more...Being a non exempt employee of Tesla Motors Incorporated is good. However, this company has one of the worse issues people have to deal and work with because the leads are not encouraging others for more morale, but instead insuinating their management to doing nothing or doing nothing about talk going on in the inside its very poor in that way. Furthermore, the company's assets going green is a great idea, but the best face the experience that Tesla just might not be a growing company, but a mistake. What do you guys think?-Job growth was extremely limited-Broader impact beyond core role was never recognized-Witnessed performance reviews become highly political as the company grew from 4K to 16K employees -Nevertheless, all was manageable and generally happy until my manager and head of function was forceably replacedThe work place is full of energy, it keeps you on your toes.  The personnel all well experienced and extremely capable.  The management is firm but helpful.  The team really wants to succeed and makes this understood from day 1.  It is also imperative to work together, teamwork is paramount.  Have truly enjoyed my time there and am looking to take what I have learned and accomplished and put it toward new challenges.At Facebook, the culture is a very healthy and stress-free environment. We are expected to complete our share of the work load without being micro managed. Co-workers are allowed to help and collaborate if needed. Some challenges may include making sure clients are satisfied, and that their business is utilizing Facebook to its full potential.Productive and fun workplace, we have restaurant on Campus, I love it. Transportation by Bus , it is great. It makes job very easy. sometimes I continue my work by VPN connection  in the bus on way home and at Home.I do not have anything negative to say about working for Facebook. The people truly cared, they gave me the tools I needed to suceed and there was not a glass ceiling for growth.Working at Facebook was an amazing experience. The culture there was great. The benefits were top tier as well. They fed us three meals a day. Supplied employees with their own personal computers for work.Love the culture, awesome coworkers and great opportunities to grow and learn and expand your career. I had a wonderful experience and made such great connections and friendships.Facebook onsite with PROUnlimited was an excellent opportunity into viewing corporate work life.  It gave an inside view of how larger companies work together to create a product that is end-user driven.  The culture is also top notch as they push to have users experience and attempt new ideas.  They certainly strive to set the bar higher for new entrants and individuals seeking a challenging work place.Don't want to go into too much detail about what happens at one of these offices, but to put it in a nutshell, words almost can't describe how much I appreciate the opportunity to work with this company. It is definitely an experience that I will never forget.The opportunity to network within the company is amazing! They provided me with a monthly amount of advertising money to promote my business for free!This is place is exactly what you would expect from an established Silicon Valley company. The people are smart and helpful, the management is flat, and the atmosphere is amazing.Weird horrible management and no room for growth. Great job to do while figuring out your career! Flexible enough and easy workloadFacebook was a great place to work, I was very disappointed when my contract ended.  The Co-Workers and Managers were awesome, everyone got a long and everyone wanted what is best for the customers.  Helping customers place ads with Facebook was a true learning experience.Do not like working for cognizant, they do not care about employees at all. Management is horrible, they are rude and do not respect employees.It was a great place to work because of the culture. The work becomes routine, and they don't promote much from within. It still tries to function like a startup instead of the tech juggernaut that it is.Was able to learn from a wide array of Chefs from different backgrounds and expand upon my culinary career in a large institutional kitchen setting.   Opportunities to create eight item menus based upon a theme or region and execute your personal menu for a large group of patrons.  It also forced you to be quick on your feet and adapt to changing environment.  For example, if you had a popular dish and it was running low, you had to be prepared to come up with a substitute dish on the fly.  Also very informative to learn how large scale kitchen production works.Great to work for a great company. Hard but you succeed. Great opportunity for growth within the company. Top experience of my life.Facebook is a great place to work. Great people, great perks and lots of fun.

190,191.0,Data Scientist,"TEKsystems, Inc",3.9,1400.0,"The Portsmouth NH office is good at matching you with their clients needs.TEKsystems was very happy with my performance at Sprint at all times.  They were truly a wonderful agency to work for.  They went out of their way to make my work experience at Sprint truly rewarding by stopping by to check on me.  They usually praise me in front of upper management.  That truly made me feel valuable.Even though I work for TEKSystems on a 3rd party global service contract as a Business Systems Analyst, the client is who we support with labor and our experiences. The client is disorganized and does not understand process improvement. They spend lots of time filling out FDS's and other documents that have no standards. Working for TEK is great but for the customer our group is underutilized.I would never work a contract position or use TEKSystems to place me into any position ever again.  Every opportunity they have presented me with was grossly underpaid, and the positions and work environments misrepresented.  Contractors are nothing more than a cash cow for them, and they treat them as such.  I was lied to about many things, such as provided parking (that actually cost me $11.50 per day) to the integrity of the managers at the client site.  I regret working with TEKSystems, and they have literally cost me THOUSANDS of dollars and ruined my holidays.  Stay FAR FAR FAR away from TEKSystems in Omaha NE.They sign you up and make sure your in the program all is great for about the first month and a half. Then they tell you you can't apply for other jobs ant they will not let you forget that, Then they spring on you that your contract is no longer gonna go how long they said it was going to g, which means no job until they find you something else so your basically stuck with then once you sign onEverything i learned came easy with how helpful everyone was and how well everyone worked as a team to get everything done on time. We helped move along the company for the cut-over and go-live projects to allow them to use the new software and scan guns. With that we stuck around to help train employees how to use the scan guns and troubleshoot mistakes and wrong actions.I have been doing contract work (on and off) for TEKsystems about 3+ years.  Their staff is always very helpful and address my needs when it comes to work.  They take care of their employees and make sure that the job they place you in is a good fit.  I really enjoy working with them and their eagerness to help.I have worked for Teksystems under the Pensacola, FL office and my experience was good. But the Teksystems in the New Orleans office is horrible lol. I dnt know where they get their recruiters or account manager from buy they are so not qualified. They do not do their homework but expect you to do yours, completely unorganized. If Teksystems is a ""Tech"" company, they should know IT terminology and not some notes from a website. I wouldn't work for Teksystems of New Orleans, I'll try another office.To be successful, you have to commit at LEAST 10 hours or more to your job. You can leave ""early"" at 5:00-5:30, but will have a lot of judgement from other people in the office. If you consistently, leave at that time your integrity to the company will be questioned. The company culture is amazing and so much fun, but if you don't want to live at work I don't recommend it.As with all staffing agencies the primary function is to find qualified, and reliable help for a client. Sometimes this takes all focus off of the worker and makes them feel like a number rather than a person. TEKsystems has been able to balance the relationship beautifully. Caring not only for the client but the people they send to those clients.Working with company has been a great experience compared to other staffing companies.  The recruiters stay in constant contact with you and ask questions about your current assignment.I enjoyed going to work everyday. This company is a recruitment company that strives to help the client as well as the employee. A typical day was to meet with my client and go over the goals for the day/week. the hardest part was working with the city people. The best was working with our contractors.My day consist of imaging laptops and desktop internal configurations desktop support tier 3 machine builds. I have a proven track record of meeting deadlines and service level objectives and have good judgment and to whom to escalate problems to various levels of the IT chain of command. I also have a proven track record deploying Window 7 as the lead tech and as a Deployment tech working with the project team and business unit contacts to confirm specific list of applications for each user to be migrated in a business group unit/group.TEKsystems has two primary business lines - (1) IT Staffing, and (2) Consulting Services.I was part of the latter, called TEKsystems Global Services.  During the selling and delivering of consultant services, we worked closely with the staffing side to acquire additional roles needed to fulfill the engagement.  The two organizations work virtually seamlessly together and make a great pairing.TEKsystems is a great place for your career - beginning, middle and end!Working for TEK means getting paid to be a contractor. If you are a contractor, you are treated as a replaceable cog in a machine and afforded that level of respect, especially if you work for state government via TEK. This is a good company to work for in terms of salary, but don't plan to stay in this role.TEKsystems is an excellent place to work. They provide high level training and maintain an excellent company culture. This promote from within company offers opportunity to expand your career at a faster rate than most Fortune 500's. I truly enjoy the people I work with!Working at TEKSystems has been an experience. Personally I haven't found pleasure because of the type of work I am performing on top of the fact the work life balance is non existent. The people you work with are great but there is always someone people are willing to help more than others which is essential to being successful.this is the tech industry production is essential. Environment changes from fast paced to slow, you must be flexible.When environment slows down more experienced co-workers are willing to share their   knowledge with less experienced workers.TEKsystems is a nice place to work.  Like any other company it has its positives and negatives.  I enjoy the work environment, the work life balance in my current role and the people I work with.learned many useful tips, and taught some.hardest part of the job was knowing that you had no benefits or raises available. Enjoyed working with most of my co-workers, always willing to help each other.This is a great entry level position to get experience in the IT field, however with no PTO and no paid holidays, it makes it tough to stay with it for more than a year. It helps get the experience for your resume to acquire a more steady career in the near future.","1,001 to 5,000",San-Francisco,Martinez,CA,2016-11-30T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/6dd46047-9de6-4ebd-99c5-0a757bbe42af?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

I created and led multiple customer satisfaction improvement projects as well. While Electronic Arts is relatively new it the customer support industry, the lack of room for advancement was a hinderance.Really just not very good.  No room to move up and poor choices on the part of management.  Really more of a glorified babysitter.While I knew I couldn't work there for much longer than the summer because I am a full time student at LSU, it was a great experience working with colleagues to work hard and figure out the bugs in the builds. I learned how to manage my time, where to look for bugs, how to use TestRail and JIRA, tracking in X-Code, and communicating with my team and the developers.Provides good work/life balance. Competitive salary and benefits. Provides employees with multiple concierge services on campus.Great community outreach programs.The app is 4.5 stars in both the iOS App Store and the Google Play Game Store and proves that my coworkers are an amazingly talented group of people who are dedicated, passionate, and good at what they do.EA offers a very flexable work schedule. the work environment is very fun and very diverse. They are also a very laid back company to work for. i love EABig company with so much potential that is realized through large, well organized teams committed to making the best games they can.Prominent franchises are given time to develop with the backing of intelligence that explains where the industry is going.Working for Electronic Arts opened my eyes to the gaming community and I was able to talk to fellow players and help them with their jobs. Getting excited for up coming games and enjoying the atmosphere and fellow employees and team. With training that was provided helped me get my foot in the door, well done!The company moves very fast so you need to be okay with change and lot's of different ;challenges.  The people are amazing to work with and talented. Always fun but intense at the same time.  It's truly a relationship focused company.  I would recommend to anyone looking for a fun challenging environment to work in.Very enjoyable and productive day to day job envirroment, management is very people oriented co workers are very nice as well, they support your PMO deliveries.Not only do they create entertainment for millions of people, they took care of the people who help create games for those millions of people.This is not a job where you go in and play video games all day.  that is not your job!  Your job is to do things over and over again trying different things to try and make the game do something unexpected. If its to cause a crash, a soft lock, or a graphical glitch.Background designs were done daily. Loved the pace and challenge of the production and the people were great.I thought this was an amazing experience. I was given all the props of a great employee and really enjoyed it. Most people love it so this is not uncommon.Definitely a place for computer savvy, or technologically inclined workers. Gamers are treated with great respect and constantly motivated and rewarded.Learned about porting Unity to the unreleased 3DS. Worked on the huge Sims 3 franchise. Unfortunately the studio lost it's way and had to lay off almost the entire company.What once was a fun workplace with advancement opportunities has changed over the years to a rather stale office with little advancement opportunity. Management changes regularly and will often totally reverse old policies without notice. You're paid at a flat rate with no raises no matter how many contracts you return for.I highly enjoyed working for Walgreens. Only issue i had at the job was a bit strict of a manager. Other that than it was great. Only reason i left was for a job that paid more.It is a very nice place to work if you enjoy gaming and gamers. The atmosphere is very inviting. The area is very nice.Typically, I was in-game testing and reporting bugs with the software. Before new policies, I was the one who took notes for the Artworks department's sync meetings and disclosed them to the entire team (immediate area and partners in Canada included) via email. What I loved most was that I felt like I belonged there, like people valued the work I did and effort I gave.It was super cool to work here. You had set, paid, time to play video games. $.25 vending machines. Free games and merch all the time. Generally fun!One of my first jobs out of high school.  Had lots of friends that worked here.  Fun place to work but very high call volume and impatient customers, but I was always able to make them smile & laugh by the end of the call.",,San-Francisco,Redwood City,CA,2016-10-30T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/17ebdb37-e1c8-4a7d-acb1-18a19c87b43c?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=27,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

New applications are added all the time an I learn an implement them into my work. I am my own manager so that's great!! other contractors I deal with are mostly pleasant and easy to collaborate with. There are no real hard parts to what I do an I enjoy the people I meet the most.Advertise my html homepages, this can be on the fourms, on other sites, and in person, once I have a task then I ask for advance money, and give them a questionnaire to fill which allows me to build their own homepage or even a special product. I also develop clothes, accessories, etc, which are all wearable on the IMVU chat client, I have to make sure it is cheap for all users, and create something unique that everyone likes.WOuld come into work, make myself some breakfast (bagels, cereal, fruit, oatmeal, donuts…act) go to my desk get to work and had a snack then work some more, then caters lunch , then work some. The people there are wonderful, very helpful and nice. Management is always there for you when needed. Everyone helps each other, no ""I"" in team!A typical day would be helping in the Staff created Help rooms as well as the Welcome rooms.  The help room is a place members can go with client issues, billing, harrassment, hacked accounts or help center issues.  It is our job to direct, explain and guide them through the different process or to escalate issues that need staff's attention.  I learned to be exceptional patience, teamwork and how to research solutions.  Staff are extremely helpful and great mentors.  The other forum Moderators are helpful and wok well as a team.  The hardest part would be the members who only come to cause trouble for the other member and the Moderators.  I have always loved helping people and in this position I am able to do so.  It is also a great creative outlet for me and I feel a huge sense of accomplishment when a project is completed.Very laid back environment with a ping pong table, great snacks and not to mention paid for lunches. Fridays are the best, we get pizza! Love all the people I work for , they are all very nice and are always willing to lend a helping hand.The work culture is great at IMVU, and there is always a lot to learn.A typical day consisted of having daily stand up meetings, developing new features, and pushing code out multiple times a day.You can make money or play, It is up to you if you want to take the time to learn how to become a creator and spend the time making things. Imvu is a home business, a great place to learn how to create graphics, it has homepage and 3D models. :)Imvu is not good, you can often get easily banned, what they called disabled, many have complained of being on there some years, having spent thousands of dollars and suddenly one day they can not access their account.Another worrying thing is the amount of accounts that get hacked, so a lot of them claim on the forums. If you complain to much you get banned and later disabled.Finally you have no realy safety on there, so despite the minimum age being of 13, anyone young can get access to the site. There is often naked graphic p-o-r-n images too, which makes it very unsettling given the fact there are young teens on the site. IMVU removes the naked images of men, but often avoids and leaves those of the women, for whatever reason, who knows.If I had to rate the site over all, give it 1 out of 10, better ringing them for someone decent to answer you, but then having said that, just given the run around as you are told to take out a ticket on the site, thus one can wait days or weeks, if they respond to you at all.As for the offers to get credits, most are a con, surveys all about getting your details off you, to bug you constantly, a serious privacy risk, especially for kids, which it appeals a lot to. And not only that, when you gone through them, often then say sorry at this time not qualified etc. We then have those free things one downloads, and these are often full of spyware or virus.For a company making so called millions of dollars now, to not be accountable to even paying customers is truly shocking to say the least.",,San-Francisco,Redwood City,CA,2016-10-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/d448c476-a201-4166-83e3-6046ed1b7f90?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=31,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

209,210.0,Senior Scientist: CAR T Cell Biology & Engineering,Pfizer Inc.,4.2,1900.0,"A typical day at work - checkin with your team on any issues affecting the working environment for the scientist and set priorities to get the facility back up to standards.What I learned - I learned to be a leader on a few projects and take on some responsibility on improving energy efficiencies. My co-workers were great, we had a softball league that we participated in.The hardest part of the job was when the company had to reduce staffing.After I graduated form the Pharmacy School, I work for Pfizer as a medical rep., as the policy in Saudi Arabia mandated to have healthcare background. The workplace, the system is exceptional and you well interact with the finest workforce in the industry among the companies. The firm policy is strict, either internally or at the market, the resources you have to achieve your goal are the best among other companies. However, the advangates come with a price, as the market leading position of Pfizer in the market required an exceptional performance in utilizing the resources provided to maintain the leader position, in which it will too tough at the begging, but it will be easier and funnier when you acquire the experience.Great benefits, great coworkers, and emphasis that all contribute to ""helping to made medicines""  which will in turn make a positive impact in the world. Emphasis on a ""healthy Pfizer"" - free flu shots for colleagues,  fitness center on site.There is plenty of room to grow within the company, if you are related to someone who works there. Nepotism is a problem at the Pearl River site and upward mobility is difficult with unqualified managers and employees. Discrimination exists in certain groups, as pregnancies seem to be a hassle for some team leaders. It is a shame because there really is potential here at Pfizer.I love working with Pfizer Company.  The benefits are great and the pay is wonderful.  The people are full of love and dedication.  I really enjoy being apart of such a wonderful family. I learned how to communicate properly and the importance of staying focused to get the job done right the first time.  Management is always there to help and motivate every individual.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the education and training, you can always move up.  As far as the job being hard, anything worth having is worth working hard for.Do to the take over,  the company had to downsize. Unfortunately my department was among to downsizing. I was hoping to spend many more years with this company.I was in charge of up to 40 mechanics a day and supervised demand and preventive maintenance. My group was tight an fun to work with but there were too many people we had to report to and we were very micromanaged at every turn. I lost all trust in management after the termination of my superior.I learned quickly to ""go with the flow"" which i had a hard time doing.Our schedule was ridiculous and they didn't care about family time.great co workers to work with management knows how to handel there workersbenifits are great great location to work at great pay rate.learned a lot working for pfizerManage and Prioritize all administrative tasks including scheduling meetings, conference calls, web-ex and video conferences, arranging international and domestic travel, obtain visas and passports as needed,  Responsible for generating reports from Business Warehouse in Citrix system.Coordinator for the E-room for both regions. Share Point Coordinator for Process & Information Management in Global Logistics Supply Network.Working with other admins learning different software and developing yourself for promotions. Filling in for other admins when necessary. Meeting last minutes deadlines to complete assigned tasks.Flexible working hours. Meeting people from different cultures learning their values.I love working here, keeping busy, but being a contractor for 2 years I do not see the job going anywhere. Everything that I do here is what I went to school for, and enjoy it.The culture changed after several over reaching acquisitions and the sales force was bloated in the mid 2000s. Several products in the pipeline never made it to the market. For the first time, in 2007, Pfizer had a lay off of sales personal that has conmtinued to this day.I am currently employed at Pfizer, I would rather not write a review. The compensation package is adequate. The work/ balance is below average due to mandatory overtime.I enjoyed working for Pfizer.  The compensation package was amazing.  I enjoyed working in the field and spending time with my family.  Unfortunately, my time there was too short.  In 2009 my territory was dissolved. Looking to get back in the industry!Worked there 28 years as my brother worked there 42 years, management was great and there were always compensation for your work and just being part of the ""Pfizer Family"" Really can not say enough...except GREAT!A mature company in the healthcare industry. My experience with Pfizer has been very positive.  Great benefits and internal support system.  Treats employees with respect.Workplace culture is great and you will be kept busy. It is a fun environment, but the work can be pretty demanding. Continue to learn and expand skills on your own time because you'll mainly focus on a couple of skills. The work is rewarding at the end of the day, but it is very easy to get lost in the trenches of the daily grind.I enjoyed this position for numerous reasons. I was able to design, develop and deploy an in-house patient registry enrollment program for heart valve patients per the requirements of the Safe Medical Device Act of 1990. I successfully educated 100,000+ patients/physician worldwide regarding product lines, medical, legal and regulatory issues. I was also given the opportunity to locate 896 patients at 14 institutions (U.S., Canadian, and European Hospitals), develop protocols, study requirements, case report forms, budgets, contacts and feasibility process for a IDE follow-up program complying with FDA directives. I enjoyed working with all of my co-workers which included the engineering and legal staff. Even though our projects were very stressful and challenging, we always found time to enjoy our jobs and each other's company.Nice place to work. No work was ever too physically demanding and I worked with a lot of experienced and helpful individuals. I learned a lot about production while I worked here and would recommend it to just about anyway. The hardest thing about the job was just learning to get into a rhythm of checking everything  on the machine to make sure everything was running ok. I did enjoy everybody I worked with though.Work all shifts. Leaned a lot about pharmaceuticals. I enjoyed work with Management and my Co-workers. A typical day at work consisted of: First have a meeting to inform on how processes are going (problems with equipment and status of process).  Second I would see previous operator too insure where process was.Easy work for the pay you receive. Great benefits with 401K and Vacation package. Highly recommend working for the company.The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to do a product to safe  people lives. The hardest part of my work was when the company closed.","10,000+",San-Francisco,South San Francisco,CA,2016-12-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/5cc51c43-ecad-4597-8389-fa028c3df633?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The best place I have ever worked.Only there a year and was being trained as a manager.  Tough training but prepared you for position.  Good company culture.  Enjoyed the people I worked with as well as management.Enjoyed working for this company. They treated their worker fairly and with respected. They made employees feel needed,I loved going to work.  I had the same manager for over 11 years which seems to be unheard of in the industry.  I learned the value of respect - ""catching people doing something right"" - which was one of my manager's sayings.  I also learned when participating in a workshop with co-workers always give the positive feedback then ""what you may which to try next time"" and then end on a positive note.The hardest part about the job was when someone in an office was dismissive before they knew my expertise or even me as a person.The most enjoyable part of the job was the people and knowing when I was helping and was a real resource for their caregiver.Great benefits.  Very generous pay and benefits.  Learned a lot of MS Office products there.  Family feel to the company at times.I worked 8 hours and walked to plant to plant. I learned many task as troubleshooting. There were a very nice organization and good relation with the head-plant. The more hardest were use the safety uniform. The most enjoyable part it was the relation with the others employees.Merck has three major sites in Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.   Boston site is the smallest of the three sites.Productive fan place to work and culturally diverse. Coworkers are helpful and cooperative. When it comes to team projects or cross-functional team projects, members seem to have open minds for different kinds of views and to resolve issues. Team members work hard to meet deadlines.Good company-I was there for a long time.  Many opportunities to grow and develop. I was promoted often. last job in oncology.Fun place to work and always a challenge. Good work culture and good co-workers. Good management. Always improving on production methods, Grate recognition program.Very competitive energetic environment to provide products to HCP's  in very important therapeutic catagories. Co workers most always have the highest level of integrity and passion.An excellent work experience and an excellent Company. In all aspect they offer: training, incentives, excellent products, etc. Unfortunately the Company Plan in which I work will be closing in December and I have to move.This is a wonderful place to work. They have a great work/life balance program and they even offer a shuttle program for a low cost to individuals to ensure they have transportation to and from work.Safe place to work, nice co-worker and a great place to make friends. Don't know about benefits because I was a temporary employee.Merck has great history, surround talent people, advanced techniques, excellent research environment, good benefit; I pretty much enjoy working at Merck.A typical day would be to check all pending correspondence that required follow-up and perform those tasks, move on to new work as needed and keep an eye on needed changes.I have learned the importance of understanding different communication styles.I take full responsibility and bring issues to closure either through my own skills or tapping into more experienced management.My co-workers have always bee over a wide range of diversity.The hardest part of any job is identifying priorities and watch for shifting priorities to address them in a timely manner.I love interaction with people and tending to their needs.Durham VBF, could use more restructuring. Need managers that have experience and people skills. The culture needs to be restructured also. Work-life balance in nonexistent. Pay is not all that good.Very good company. typical day includes making the production of vaccines and cleaning aseptic clean rooms. also dealing with paper work and log books.This company has great benefit packages and good work/life balance and all of the advantages a workplace can have.

The culture is incredible and although competitive, everyone collaborates to provide the best possible service. Everything is for the clients and First Republic truly takes fantastic care of their clients.Great opportunities to make a lot, great compensation.

I hit a home run with FRB landing my dream job.  Wonderful job in the Office of General Counsel.  Wonderful co-workers.  Wonderful culture.  Wonderful work/life balance. Awesome FRB employee referral program.If you need a good-paying job and don't mind sitting at a desk all day, this job is just fine. The company, however, asks for stressful scheduling and undervalues most employees.First Republic isn't a bank. Its more like a company that treats you like family. You are not a account number, but a face. Impressively, the banker know not only you, but you family, your dog, and your hobbies.Amazing company ethics, and such a great café. The food was awesome and an amazing price! Management of my particular team didn't really hold people accountable for the job they were doing. Many things flew by the manager. I would definitely  recommend this as a place to get a great start for your career.A typical day at work was preparing lunch for the customers. I learned how to make different foods many ways. The co-workers was very helpful and friendly.Management under pays and expects excellent work from each individual. Broken Promises and bad work life balance. They hire contract workers to do all the work with little pay and tell you they will hire you on as permanent but never get to it. They have a hiring freeze every other month which causes implications with employment. Too much work and not enough help.Lot of opportunities to learn and grow.Management is not easily accessible.More work pressure.Amazing colleagues.Great work culture and Good work life balance.First Republic banks keeps up with newer technologies.Awesome subsidized food cafeteria.Fun work environment with supportive managers.

Good management team; listen to your suggestions to make work more efficient.Super fun place to work with.  Everyone always do 110% to achieve whatever is best for the clients which retain high  customer satisfaction.I worked for FRB 6 + years. Terrible management, It is quite disappointing. I love the culture and customer service FRB is carrying however I will never work for them anymore!They have a great executive management team, the office environment was very high end.Be yourself. Have a conservation with the interviewer and a questions and answers meeting.i love my job duties but overwhelmed with emails and other duties. one person can't finish all the work. I can never get out the building on time. No social life with co workers.Employees were friendly, environment was not pushy, while working here I got the chance to be one of the first to work on their new in-house customer data system called FlightPathWorking at FRB is like being a bird in a golden cage.Great place to work if you want to stay at one location and do the same day after day and not move up.I learned a tremendous amount about trust accounts and actively managed accounts.  This position allowed me to analyze investments from many different angles.A great place to work.  The company does a great job of blending culture and work.

Aggressive Consulting Recruitment Co.Couldn't handle visa paper work for STEM OPT and made me loose my job and ruin my whole career.One of the reasons given was they don't want USCIS to come and check on them, but didn't give a proper explanation and just said that they won't sign the papers at all (All the other recruiting companies have signed the papers of their respective employees).Even after knowing that the whole situation was time sensitive, they didn't bother doing anything on time and after talking to lawyers about the things that they need to fill in the form, they ended up giving back a blank form, which they expected to submit it to USCIS.I have worked in this company for more then 2 Years .. it was a awesome place to work, the management is really very supportive . the work culture is very  good.*  Posting Lockboxes on a Daily Basic ;*  Posting Payments on Accounts and reviewing for errors and overpayment on a daily basic.I am not sure when job hunting became a telemarketing type thing but that is what this company does. They called me 10 times a day and sent me emails constantly for positions. 1st off, I do not work for someone I cannot understand. I also do not work for a company outside the US but uses a NJ phone number. That SCREAMS problems to me. I told them to take me off their list for over a year and they kept calling. I finally got nasty with them and told them I would report them to the gov't. They stated, and I quote, ""You put your phone number out on Monster so we can call all we want. If you do not want us to call, then do not put your phone number out on job sites. We are in India, you cannot do anything about it."" Talk about angry! I went off on her and explained if I got one more call or email from their unprofessional and nasty company I would hire an attorney and make sure I went after them for everything I could, as well as send information to the gov't to research them for terrorist activity since they felt they were above the law of other countries. So far, I have not received another call or email but it has only been a month. Even telling them I had a job did not stop they from calling by the way. I complained to Monster and Careerbuilder about this company and took my information off their website. Horrible in America you can be treated this way and can't trust to find a job on websites that state they are professional. Lesson learned.this is nothing but a body shop for Indians, They do not live up to their contracts.  Must be a cultural thing.  Sued the client and got paid right away .  Caveat Emptor!This temporary agency is actually located in India. They have a New Jersey phone number, but you are transferred to people in India. I went for 4 weeks without getting paid. It took the human resource department through my site, St. Joseph Hospital, to get me in touch with someone in the U.S. to get my pay.That being said, I got to work for St. Joseph for the first time. It was such an incredible journey. I loved the work load, the people, and the patients.The lady from Human Resources helped me get my permanent position in the float pool. It was the best experience!I enjoyed working for New york Life. The management was always clear and concise. I enjoyed the steady workflow as well. The work environment was not hostile.  each dept worked as a Team to get their job objectives completed .US Tech is the most worst company to work for. From the very start of my contract I had nothing but difficulty with US tech solutions. They are very unorganized and lack basic communication skills with their employees. You have to track them down to talk with them and they make you feel like you need to do there work for them. I would never recommend them to any oneWorked at another site for employment.My contact person was great.","1,001 to 5,000",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-10-20T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/cafab1dc-ee8c-4658-897e-b29cd2b1ccd2?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
225,226.0,"Scientist I, QA/QC",Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc,3.7,1000.0,"The co-workers are interactive and ready to give an helping hand where need be. The managers are understanding and very much considerate and accommodates each an every team member. They also allow us to have flexible schedule as they don't micro manage the team. The hardest part of the job is being is when you find a mean customer.This is straight up the worst place I ever worked. Managers would insult employees right in front of other people which made for a very uncomfortable environment to work in daily. There is small select group of people and if you are not in that group they do not care about you and you will not be there long. I got text messages at home while I was trying to sleep to let me know what time to come in on a daily basis because there is no organization. Got hurt pretty bad because of faulty equipment and dangerous workplace and they refused to give me x-rays and sent me back with an injury and threatened to let me go if I didn't go back. All in all just a terrible place to work, only thing good was money.Life is dynamic and fast-paced here. One day you are laser-focused on routine technical issues with a small customer and the next you are presenting to healthcare C-Suite around initiatives that will move them forward clinically and financially. The only constant is that we aim to help make the world healthier, cleaner, and safer for our customers. The support from co-workers is tremendous and the opportunity to use your existing skills while learning new ones is great.This was my 1st time working in a warehouse the experience was great! I worked the 2nd shift I would start my day by filing it would be a slow pace when I start then I would go to the floor and greet my coworker that worked on the line. I work well with others so I did have any issues with working with them. The hardest part was making was remembering Hazard Mats UN numbers but I made sure everything was correct for all Carries.The  culture of Thermo Fisher differs from department to department, so this only pertains to the department I worked within. My department hires people early in their careers and doesn't do much for them other than give them a job. The job provides extremely little training from inexperienced workers, is run by tone deaf management who literally avoid eye contact with people working below them, and demands intense physical commitment (working 10 hour shifts on your feet moving nearly constantly) while offering very little in return. Coworkers can often be great, however, and can help you through the job if you choose to work there.The silo approach between groups and divisions impedes Thermo Fisher's ability to be successful in the long run. The HR function that drives salary, promotions is relatively ineffective.  It is a nice place to work in that people and culture is positive but there is no sense of urgency or accountability.  They don't get things done - there is no corporate strategy on where the company is headed.It is a toxic culture at this place, the work environment is extremely poor, it is a good place to stay away from. They will treat you nice when you start then after a while they will change for no reason, they will start to watch you, not trust you, try to embarrass you or blame you for things you  did not even do. It is a shame that they do this.1  days at work are hectic and stressful2 i have learned a lot about the screen printing industry 3 management has changed in a negative way.4 for the most part co workers have been nice except for a few bad apples. 5 demands have increased and teamwork is diminishing 6 when things come together to give everyone a nice quarterly bonus.Working from home no office hours. my day at work was mainly checking and relying to daily emails, planning customer visits, working on sales plans, promoting the product. Management very dynamic changing constantly. too may layers of management. Met coworkers every quarter during sale meeting in Austin Texas, US hardest part...no immediate support being away of the country with 9 hours time deference. to many management changes, most enjoyable part was meeting with customers and promoting the productA typical day we have daily meetings. Management discuss the productivity of the company day before and what's needed to be done to complete for the day. Topics are discuss about the expectation of some individuals. Each co-worker is assigned to a duty for that day. Our job is enjoyable when others do their part but the hardest part of the job is lack of communication between management. Alot of times managers are nowhere to be found when something is wrong and much cant get done when that happens. Alot of responsibility on co-workers but that's counterproductive when they don't give alot of training to people.Work days can vary from 8-10 hr days and its only two shifts. I learned all of the basic job needs to fulfill the material handler 1 role. Management team doesn't have an understanding on warehouse needs and they are very experienced when it comes to warehouse work. They only care for themselves and don't at least try to take cares of the problems employees face each day. They tend to blame the employees for any kind of reason possible. They don't Acknowledge how hard you work and how the team works. Co-workers come from either a temp agency rarely hired on. Fun cool people easy to work with. The hardest part is dealing with management and trying to have them understand certain things. The most enjoyable is the amount of teamwork you do with your co-workers.In my time there I learned how little a corporation can care about its employees. There is very little chance of internal advancement, the pay is ok to start but the raises offered do not keep up with the cost of living increases. Other than that they have no issue shipping jobs oversees, treating their customers like cash cows and ignoring any kind of work life balance.The R&D culture at the Austin Thermo Fisher site is very inclusive. The employees are welcoming and collaborative, and frequent group meetings and presentations keep everyone's work in progress, by celebrating the successes and crowd-sourcing troubleshooting ideas when needed. This was my first industry position, and I have learned a great deal about business in my time at Thermo Fisher, and I think it has made me a much stronger scientist overall.A well run company that cares genuinely about its employees, who show consistent dedication to the success of corporate goals and each other.  It provides a supportive environment with sufficient resources (internal services such as market research) and tools to enable effective job growth and achievement.Calm, slow paced work environment, great supervisors and friendly work place. Due to Thermo Fisher Scientific being such a large company, I find that the top brass don't really care about their workers. They take way too long to hire temps on permanently and don't pay enough for the work we do. I don't necessarily like the way they do things here but the environment makes up for that a bit in the sense that it's very comfortable and everyone here is friendly.it a basic customer service operation where there is very little advancement opportunities as is dominated by individuals with the most years of service vs. knowledge and preparedness, even if you have higher qualifications the next best option in their network is the person who has the most yearsI have worked at this company for over 10 years. In that time I have seen management come and go. This round of current management is just deplorable. Treating employees like they are in a prison is the only description I can come up with.  It seems that this current batch of 'upper management' is obsessed with bending the company policy only when it benefits them. I would strongly urge folks to look elsewhere if they want to be happy with their job.A typical day involved conducting productions and reviewing results as well as logging data. I learned how safely and effectively work with hazardous chemicals. The management was fairly good. I enjoyed working with co-workers. I enjoyed the science and processes. The hardest part was the lack of competitive wages especially considering the hazards of the job.Documented success in leading various technical and non-technical team membersSkilled in influencing key stakeholders at all levels (peers, senior leaders, employees), demonstrated success in building and maintaining relationships, collaborating with others across business, function, and geographical boundariesA typical day at work begins with recording one's production goal for the day. After that, solutions that will be used throughout the day will need to be prepared. The assembling of chromatography columns will then begin, as well as the packing of them with specific types of resin. After the packing, the different methods of testing start. At the end of the testing, data is interpreted and analyzed.Great benefits, growing rapidly. Employee concerns addressed actively. Opportunity to make a difference. Actively embraces diversity in workplace.

230,231.0,Principal Scientist-Clinical Pharmacology,Amgen Inc,4.1,510.0,"Checked animals for health and welfare, study support.  Management was not always aware of issues.  Co-workers were great.  My commute was the most difficult part of my job.  The work was fun and rewarding.The culture at Amgen is very competitive, with favoritism shown to those who buddy up to management.  Individuals who do well in office politics are given more opportunity for advancement than those who master their jobs, particularly in the scientific roles.  Medical benefits are above average, as are savings plans for retirement.  Many layoffs have occurred over the last ten years, with staff being replaced by contractors.  Some benefits have declined in recent years, such as tuition reimbursement, which went from 100% to a flat $5K per year.  Child day care is available but is very expensive.  Cost-cutting since the 2008 economic crisis has negatively impacted the working environment and the company culture.Amgen worker productivity seems to be diminished, and its culture appears to be conditioned by constant large-scale initiatives driven top-down.  Teams' ability to execute is impacted by a culture of job-protectiveness, and even excellent and essential ideas are delayed for years waiting for various reorganizations.  In a nutshell, Amgen does not foster ideation, invention, creativity; further, the company seems to reward passive-aggressive behavior.Amgen's headquarters are isolated in Ventura County, CA, and while the benefits are great, I do not recommend relocating simply for Amgen.  It frequently pays relocation benefits to new hires, but moving here could geographically block enriching opportunities from coming to you.Loved being part of a science based company specializing in finding cures for grievous illnesses.  Great benefits and advancement potential.  Loved management and coworkers.Great CompanyExcellent Compensation BenefitsEnjoy the work cultureTeam Work AmbientManagement LearnLife BalanceAmgen was a good company to work for. Management overall was good but had issues removing poor management from the structures. Manufacturing seemed to be pushed beyond their limits. Good benefits and pay.Great products, great company. Teamwork environment and management try to be transparent to the sales reps.The most enjoyable part of my job is helping patients get access to the medication.The company looks nice to an outsider but management culture is very protective of an out of control quality system and does not invite new process improvement ideas!The work as a manufacturing associate is very stressful, even though   you learned a lot about automated and manual processes.You are asigned to a partner ( it can be a different one every day) everyday so you have to get to know each person working system and communication is very important. The most difficult part of this job is that you dont have and exact time to go to have lunch or to eat. Everyday  can be unpredictable. In my opinion the management has to work really hard on that and take the associates in consideration. I know that production is very important but workers health and consideration is too.Disappointing launch of Corlanor.  Fortunate enough to do well with the products however, the way leadership treated my counterparts who were not so fortunate with Corlanor after the messy launch is shameful.  Not a place I would encourage for the faint of heart.  Dog eat dog culture.  The launch of Repatha was even worse and they should have this specialty pharmacy game down to a science since they are not new to the biologics game.  Work life balance is non existent if you do not want to be on a list for not making your weekly numbers.  I am fortunate enough to have a great manager, however, nationally, my counterparts are miserable and get harassed every day regarding their numbers.  Our team is frightened of what will happen when our manager gets promoted and we get the tried and true Amgen manager that runs their teams on fear and intimidation.The people, work, and benefits are really great at Amgen. Unfortunately the job security if very low for this company. Also great opportunities to  travel.The day starts with heavy calendar, email and mailbox maintenance and cross functional interactions and wearing many hats throughout the day.  Learning management system allowednfor unlimited and frequent task and role educationnfor growth. Teamwork and cross functional interaction was a plus.I began at Amgen and loved it, however there have been huge cultural changes for the worse. Unrealistic timelines, ever increasing work with less staff and no job security.A competitive biotech company full of new challenges everyday. That provides you the tools to learn key principles of Lean Six Sigma. In a typical day you need to be ready for problem solving and process improvement ideas. Work environment is very competitive, compensation and benefits are very good.A typical day at work is to arrange appointments with oncologists and visit them for me to disseminate medical knowledge , clinical trials and new updates.I learned to be able to do segmentation , targeting and positioningI learned to be able to handle the physicians objectionsI learned to conduct medical presentations and time managementwe all work as a part of a team all my co-workers are co-operative and motivationalthe hardest part of the job is to actualy be able to set up an appointment with the oncology physician due to his tight schedule and responsibilitiesthe most enjoyable part is communicating with different people from nurses to pharmacy technicians , pharmacists, purchasers and physician in different hospital settingsGreat place to work with an excellent lean manufacturing culture.  The company values are embedded in all activities we do.Love my job and the peopleLearned different things, never boringCo-worker are helpfulGreat support from ManagementI was blessed to work at Amgen's Washington sites. The group of people there, not only in my group/department, but across all functions at the site were the best of the best.  Everyone was dedicated to the mission.  My immediate manager was truly someone unique and special to work for.  She absolutely made sure that her reports had a strong work/life balance (even if she didn't adhere to that for herself).  My immediate group of co-workers is what I loved the most and what I miss the most now that AWA has been closed down.Excellent place to workA lot of opportunities to learn about Nice co-workersExcellent management New people every day Opportunity to learn of different culturesAs an student you have the opportunity to be exposed as an regular employer to important projects.Loved the people that I worked with. I was able to learn and grow with the company. They offered a great tuition reimbursement plan for those that wanted to get an education.Great company to work for. Advancement opportunities were not easily available or proposed to eligible employees Management was not hands on with teams.

Local, national and international shipping.Excellent place to work. very supportive people and very good management group.employee benefits also very good. career growth also very good as always more opportunities to explore on different tasks.The only con is that you sit down the majority of time. It has a variety of positions to choose from so you will never get bored. The pay is more than enough and it has a flexible schedule.As a seller on eBay, I am my own boss. I set my own hours, sell whatever I want, and keep nearly all the profits from whatever I sell. With so many different people visiting the website, there's a market for virtually everything out there, including old collectibles and toys. It's a good way to make some extra money and offset the cost of any hobbies you might have. The only downside is the selling fees from both PayPal and eBay itself. They aren't too extreme, though they can be annoying, especially for smaller sales.I enjoyed by time at eBay because I had a great managers.  She had the ability to recognize strengths and weaknesses.  I liked that she held people accountable for producing a good product.I honestly don't understand this forced rating system. My opinion on eBay hasn't changed int he ten minutes since my last review of it. It's a great place to work and I regret having ot leave it.Enjoyed working there, many tasks to many to list but some are management, training, reporting, customer service, supervising a staff of 12 24/7 and being on callGreat work environment, Very flexible work schedule, you are making a difference by enabling connected commerce in all corners of the world. Fun place to work with many talented and friendly co-workers.Needs more organization and training more for representatives. There was a lot of hiring but not very many chairs open. A lot of under time was given and people were sent home A lot. It is a nice place to work if the promised hours were given.Great work environment, Team orientation and lots of team efforts. Great work culture to work for and a balance work and life style. Team motivation. Team FocusIf you want long hours you will find it here. Which can be a good and a bad thing. Yeah everyone needs the money but at the same time the astomspare of the whole place is kind of a downer so it just makes it a hard company to work for. They have very strict policys but they do offer alot of free lunches and a turkey at thanksgiving and ham at christmas. Every holiday they try and offer either a lunch and a gift or raffles.you can sell up to a certain amount of money. sell anything you want take good pictures and price it right and get money thru paypal or check. also good selling exposure as well as business interaction.After finding all items you must clean them, take photos, list them online, package, then ship. The hardest part of the job is finding the items for resale and the most enjoyable part of the job is offering products to people that may be hard to find or that they enjoy collecting.I love eBay! I have had much success and met wonderful people from eBay. I would rate overall a safe and fun site to work with.Telecommuting Infrastructure allowed for flexible workplace environments and schedules with excellent full-time training opportunities and benefits.Good work life balance, but some employees are in coast mode.Could be better opportunities for advancement, seems like they bring in a lot of senior leaders from outside rather than cultivating inside.Indeed's parsing software does not recognize the fact that I DID NOT WORK AT EBAY. This is on my resume as a task regarding independent contracts while freelancing.If you enjoy working in a standard call center then this is perfect for you. I did not like anything particular about the job. They were not organized when I worked there and they made the training a little stressful.Posted postings of CE items to be resold on Ebay. Took pictures and wrote descriptions about the product. The hardest part about this job was to find what to write about the product when you didn't have all the information when they give to the task to do.Full of life lots of people in and out. many interesting characters. Always extra work time available and constant feedback there for your growth in your profession.They take good care of there employees and everyone loves working here, they are plenty of opportunities to advance and they love to hire within","10,000+",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-12-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/0a645ecb-20a8-4c5d-b70f-b18e11baca5e?mescoid=1500122001001&jobPosition=31,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The people I work for and my colleagues are so much fun and I appreciate the opportunity to work with each one of them. I also love the Fiestas that Novartis through for Employees.Novartis is a very successful company which is mainly attributed to its emphasis on innovation, research and development, retaining top talent as well as focus on safety and quality. The company is extremely focused on delivering results and the place can be intense sometimes. However if one is comfortable under pressure and is geographically mobile, the opportunities for growth are ample.I had a large territory, so there was no work life balance.Had several good managers that were realists.  Understood the territory and would do what they could to help me succeed.Hardest part of the job was overnights.  Home for 2 weeks, on the road for 2 weeks each month.What made the job enjoyable were the success stories from the physicians that I called on when they would tell me that my drug changed somebody's life for the better.High Tech , too mulch overtime ,very little appreciation, Management constantly shiftimg, 12 supervisors in ten years ,half of them come in and try to make a name for themselves. High integrity , people constantly getting fired, great 41k.I enjoyed the variety in my job, it never got too boring. I learned so many things about manufacturing, packaging and labeling of over the counter pharmaceuticals. I liked working in the Pilot Laboratory with the miniature size equipment compared to the commercial size equipment used in the factory. I especially liked the scale-up process, that is where I learned the most about the robustness of the formula and the process used to manufacture gets challenged.I have worked at Novartis for ten years. Love the culture of work life balance. Generally, the co-workers are nice. However, very surfaced and hard to feel genuine natures. Management is the same. Very lenient and understanding to mistakes but will use it when necessary. Benefits and compensation are great. However, there is no room for advancement if you are in a support role. You have absolutely no support and in fact, I was told to leave the company and come back. Very difficult to move ahead or change positions.a good company, friendly work environment, career training opportunities. Decent benefits, work/life balance is OK.While the company has vast resources and a stellar on boarding, and training process, The Commercial side is riddled with process and micromanagement. There's no connection with the realities that the field faces.Good market level compensation. 4 major layoffs over past 6 years. no promotions. Lots of great people.At the end personal experience depends on manager and department. I was lucky one.great company. had a good career run with them. great training and salary plus compensation. worked there for 14+ years and progressed in my career. launched  several great drugs and had great sales success.Interesting work; excellent pay and benefits; diverse work; currently tight expense management; diverse suite of products; focused on being an employer of choiceNovartis is a good company to work for. I came from Alcon marketing and moving to finance there was a lot to learn as it is so different from marketing. But I appreciate the challenges.The struggle comes from so many changes within Novartis. You find something that works leave it alone for awhile. I believe employees become tired due to long hours and no work/life balance. Novartis purchased Alcon so there has been a lot of adjustments within the company to be made in the last few years. Overall Novartis and Alcon are great companies.I began with the company when it was Sandoz and would have given it 5 stars.  Novartis on the other hand, not so much.  The merger certainly took it toll.  I was wearing many different hats and the monetary compensation was not the same for ex-Sandoz employees.  Ciba employs were better compensated and there was resistance in bringing Sandoz employees  to the same level.  With that said, I loved the positions I held and my (Sandoz) co-workers were great. Overall it was a great learning experience for me.  I'm sure situations must be different at this time.  I would probably work there again should the opportunity arise.•	Establish, maintain and develop strong relationships with customers and key decision makers within the practices;•	Implement current marketing strategies and initiatives;•	Manage the territory's assigned operating budget; ensuring timely expense management;•	Ensure all pricing and contracts are in-line and executed pursuant to company policy and procedures;•	Maintain accurate customer profiles and provide new customer data/sales data into company database; and•	Seamlessly communicate with the corporate sales team and account managers.Some groups have good bosses who would put efforts to help you grow your career, some keep you blinded so you won't know much and keep working for the boss cluelessly and not learn anything so you will not out grow him/her. All depends on the personality of your boss.Novartis is a pay for performance company. I have excelled in that work ethic and salesmanship. Novartis is also very team oriented.  With that in mind I have had great experiences with other professional sales reps. We all had our eyes on the prize to get the job done...right.  The hardest part of the job has been the new call number orientation. Goals have been set very high and almost impossible to attain, I have been making sales goals and ranking in the upper 10% of reps.  The most enjoyable part of the jobs has been getting to know my customers and the passion they have to help their patients. My Novartis colleagues have been wonderful through my career with Novartis. We all care about doing the right thing...everyday.Many changes with moving to a BPO offshoring delivery for Fianance Procurement and HR.  Much transition but company trying to keep opportunities available and work life rewardingNorvartis NBS has provided the opportunity to learn about HR Related services and systems.The most enjoyable part of the job is the trainings and job support offered, from Yammer to new program and team meetings/trainings.Great Work Life Balance. Telecommuting and flexible work hours a huge plus. Open Space work environment a plus.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxThe company offers a lot of great opportunities through varied roles for people at all levels of attained education. The company culture is based on a great foundation of ideals. The cafeteria has an amazing selection, with new daily specialties.The company offered great benefits and competitive compensation. Employees were very well taken care of. The overall atmosphere was pleasant and supportive. While encouraging learning and career development, the LAS group, which I worked for, prized efficiency and productivity above all. The upper management admittedly stifled employee aspiration within the group when positions had opened despite claims of opportunity. I enjoyed working alongside my colleagues and supervisors.

251,252.0,Principal Research Scientist,Accenture Inc,4.0,7200.0,"I have spent 10 and 1/2 years with Accenture and they have given me many SAP Basis skills that I did not possess when I joined them.  They are a hands on company and employ only the most qualified people.  They value work/life balance and live up to that promise.  I always worked for managers that I enjoyed working for and respected which made me only want to do a better job for them. A typical day at work could vary from day to day as I learned quickly that some tasks take priority over others and at a very quick pace. I enjoyed all of my co-workers and worked well with them as a team.  Hardest part of the job was leaving after such a long time.Day-to-day project experience varies with your delivery lead.  Senior leaders try to create an engaging, nurturing culture, but that often comes secondary to delivery leads' efforts to over-deliver.Enjoyed working with the firm. They maintain a certain work environment which caters to the needs of their employees in an appropriate manor.If the management of project is ethical then one can find opportunities for growth. If not, then it can give one a challenging experience. Pay scale is decent.When you work at Accenture, you are moving very quickly but you are also exposed to so many new opportunities. If you like a big company and have an entrepreneurial spirit, you'll really enjoy it.My review of Accenture was that in my dept we were extremely understaffed which in turn cause A LOT of frustration and stress in the environment. In my time being there management was changed 3 times which cautioned a red flag in my mind. The management staff was very rude and non helpful. I even reported them to HR upon my departure due to the fact of the unfairness and treatment I would constantly receive at my time there on several different occasions.A typical work day is would be managing a Scrum team of 7 members. Attending daily standup meetings, grooming sessions, and Review & Retrospective meetings for 2 projects. The team is very productive and work as a well oiled machine. We have a nearshore team and they work with us during our timezone which makes them professional. The most enjoyable part of the job is that there is a lot of team work involved and we knock the requirements off the park during every sprint.I enjoy working for Accenture however it is a world wide company which makes it very difficult to get a quick answer from your supervisor when they work in a completely different state.I have worked at Accenture for 4 yrs and have had a great range of roles which have definitely help improve my over all skills but the salary and bonus are not good.In general, Accenture is a great company to work for.  They offer good benefits, decent compensation and have a strong company culture.  The people that work for Accenture are highly motivated and work well in team environments.  I never have felt threatened that someone was trying to take my job or through me under the bus.At first, the company would look rather really harmless, and full of fun. But when you get into a project, that's when the nightmare starts. You have to work longer hours even when it's not really necessary; and sometimes even work on Saturdays and Sundays just because the manager told you so. One time after a long day at work, I was still only parking my car in my garage (I haven't even turned the engine off yet) when my mobile phone rang and it was my manager calling me asking me to come to work EARLY the following day! at 2AM in the morning! Another gripe I had was even when the workplace is supposed to be full of software developers, for some reason, it's was always so noisy. You have to struggle focusing on your tasks. And since it's a very competitive company, you'll be lucky to find people to help you in case you get stuck in something - especially if it needs their specialty. People are so insecure with their positions that they often see you as a threat when you ask them for help.My time being here has been pretty good for the most part. It's a great company to work for. Great place to grow within the company.Good health and dental. Flexible with vacation time in my experience. Trouble growing in some career alignments, understand where you are in the company and how the group is prioritized.provided opportunity to create and seize business opportunities in formulation and preparation of proposals and ideas for new service offerings. Forged and leveraged positive relationships with key client executives, drove value by maximizing benefits / value for clients and Accenture, and coordinated and directed complex work efforts by planning and coordinating work ensuring achievement of multiple commitments and quality expectations. Restructured work in response to changing client needs, define and / or reinforce standard methods and processes delivering high quality services, as well as, balancing relationship among budget, staffing mix, and project milestones including work-plans and schedules.Excellent People, Environment challenges you to be your best.  Many different opportunities to grow your career.  Many roles require travel Monday through Thursday.Accenture is all about the bottom line.With Accenture there are no such thing as work life balance. The Company is mainly focus on it is bottom line.Only downside I experienced is when you change roles and the next role is clearly more difficult, a promotion and a pay raise should accompany as well.  This did not happen.Working in Accenture I started to understand about to work in a different level of business, was a gret job. I worked with people of many countries, different languages.Working on latest in technology. Great place to develop network, learn and progress if you are interested in consulting. Very open work culture in terms of moving to different areas if needed.Its very good work environment. Work Life Balance and Compensatio, Benefits are very good. Co- workers are really helpfull. And leadership is very friendly. Training are very good.Regular busy day, meetings , team management. I have learnt lots of testing management activities from my day 1. Hardest part of my Job was the project where i worked as test manager where I was responsible for all the testing activities of the project. Interacting with the new people while working with different clients.","10,000+",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-10-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/19869c3e-4b23-4e1a-b6f3-a3a2e196bf62?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
252,253.0,Survey Researcher,UCSF,4.2,75.0,"Good research resource and environment for health science. But research facilities are not organized and centered. It seems that excellent research product come from individual scientist capability and fund.Typical day at work depends from the lab you are in. Learned a lot of life experience, got clear with research in California in general. Management, again, depends from the lab. Hardest part of the job is to publish, again depends from your PI plans. Enjoyable part must be free scheduling of your day.Great place to work if you are looking to gain some professional experience.Management needs to improve considerably in the areas of communication, education, and use of new technologies.Independent yet collaborative workplace; great work-life balance; great benefits; Learned various skills and enhanced my abilities through challenging and exciting day to day duties.UCSF has the best benefits in Northern California, Union, and job security. However the management is most often poor, although organized, and no job advancement unless you are in good with the right people- the who you know type of deal.This job was written poorly and was determined to be too much for one person especially considering the title and compensation.I got a good training in UCSF. Thereare lots of seminar from academy and inudctry, give well-known scientific environment . Also, it's a good place to balance work and life.Excellent team work and opportunities for career advancement.  Fiscal year end has been the busiest time of the year but we managed to closed the accounts in a timely manner.I came from Europe to do my postdoc at UCSF. I found it challenging but very interesting at the same time. People, generally, are very open minded. However, as a high profile institution, expectations are high. Throughout my time at UCSF I had great pleasure to work here and to meet people with highest professional skills.I made also good friends and established a connection to other people around the world.UCSF is a great environment to learn and start out a career. Jobs are entry-level however room to grow and expand is almost non-existence if you are not part of the medical team.working with providers regarding note compliance. completing missing information regarding providers notes for billing/trending reports/must meet lag daysNice place to work. Management very inefficient.I was very good at customer service and had a lot of wonderful remarks from patrons to the hospital.I administered the Capital Asset Inventory for the company. I enjoyed working with all the department Asset Custodians. I enjoyed being in full command of the Equipment Audit function. There was nothing difficult about this job as my qualifications perfectly match the accoing maturity required to handle all accounting hurdles.UCSF is a great company to work for. They have all sorts of jobs and employ a ton of people from all backgrounds and cultures.Arrive before Chief, print out all Branch staff daily calendars, schedule meetings and conference rooms, review and/or revise documents for approval, enter status of all documents into database, help Chief stay on track, prioritize meeting requests, coordinate assignments with Division, Director's, and State Secretary's staff, advise Programs clerical support on preparation of certain items, contact IT when needed, assist Branch staff with desktop issues if possible, prepare Purchase Requisitions for supplies and equipment when necessary, process invoices, rotate supplies and inventory, compile next day or weekly meeting agendas and/or presentations. While working in California Department of Public Health (CDPH) I learned the importance getting monies and information out to the public in a timely manner. I worked with a great team of dedicated public servants who were all passionate about their duties to aid society.The hardest part was when budget cuts would come and the Chief would work 24/7 trying to prevent cutting benefits to our staff and the public. The most enjoyable moments were when the Branch Chief would somehow make it all come together and we would meet our assigned objectives from higher ups.A great experienced to be able to handle and managed the grants in our department with different faculty members and researchers.Supportive and fun staff who enjoy team building and working together to offer solutions and assistance. Management is supportive and provides expert guidance.I loved my time at UCSF and am hoping to get another job with them. Working in a learning center with some of the most talented people I have ever met is wonderful.My day at work was always busy.I increased my medical knowledge and skills.Management the first 10 years was perfect, the communication was open and appreciated.  My last few years with UCSF I experienced managers that did not leave their office,had a shut door policy and did not want input or opinions. Decisions were made and not communicated. I hope they work this out and know we all work better together as a team.My typical day at work consists of reviewing open tickets, following up with customers and scheduling my day to utilize my time to provide maximum efficiency in resolving tickets. Through my time at ITFS, I have obtained a vast amount of experience and knowledge in the field of Information technology (these details can be discussed in person). Management has changed 3 times during my employment which made it difficult to excel in my position, but did not affect my ability to perform. The hardest part of the job is coming across issues that require extensive amounts of time and effort to resolve as oppose to known issues that can be fixed on the spot. The ""most"" enjoyable part of the job for me was the opportunity to meet so many  people.Throughout my career, I have met over 3,000 people and have made so many friends.UCSF is really a nice place to work as a postdoc, benefits are good, and scientific collaborations are awesome here.UCSF truly operates in its core values of pride, respect, integrity, diversity and excellence.

It's health benefits can be better and it has a pretty bad career advancement but the team environment is great. The environment is relaxed and very friendly. Many team building activities. Work load can be tough at times and very easy other times. The hours can be pretty flexibleI liked working here close to home and new faces to meet great workplace and good hours good people to meet very safe place to workIt was nice to be able to play with the kids, build relationships and take care of the families as they each checked into our department.Fantastic family-like work culture. Plenty of work available for optimizing processes and developing pilot processes. Great at teaching Co-ops new laboratory techniques and how to use analytical software and laboratory equipment.I made a very good living working for this company, but 7 day straight rotating shifts catch up to you.  They have a very strict A & T policy and no sick days (you must be hospital ill or take the points.)  Every man for himself.very helpful people who want you too succeed in the industry. positive company. products are great and are able to compete with others in industry.The least supportive environment. Everyone looks out for themselves, no teamwork. A lot of arrogance and negativity.  Management is self serving. Arrogant technical fellows with mental issues constantly berate co-workers and do not get reprimanded.  They manipulate and take work away, then complain when you don't meet your 70% billable goal. A lot of hot air with these technical geniuses that needs to get deflated.  I left a stable job to work here, biggest mistake of my life as this place is a major disappointment. They lost their magic. Bosses only care about making themselves look good.Learning Sharpoint and Sap **** Awesome Job! Perfect Manager Perfect Office. New Equipment and Old Building. Two Cafs.

They care about people, not gust the bottom line. The employees are top notch if you had a question, they could answer itGreat exposure to engineering instruments. However during the Co-Op I was basically a glorified secretary. Tons of paper pushing and virtually no freedom of engineering practices.My experience entailed following operating procedures, troubleshooting, operating a DCS, locking out, tagging equipment, making, filling, and packaging of chemicals, load and unloading trailers, use of forklift/work saver. I also have an excellent safety record. I have attended and also ran safety meetings.DuPont has been a great company to work for, as it relates to pay, total compensation, and working within a challenging career field. I feel their management team is out of touch with what the crew needs and wants, and there is an impression that the plant is divided between the haves (front office personnel) and the have-nots (operations and maintenance personnel).Worked with a scrum master who treated the scrum team poorly...often cussing at and harassing team members, especially those who were leaders. The scrum team repeatedly talked to management about the scrum master's behavior for well over a year. The scrum master was never removed from her position--and she was a contractor. Only after several team members left (the body count was at least 7), she was assigned to another team. Now she's been hired as a full-time IT manager. One of Pioneer's core values is to treat people with respect. I never noticed that core value being executed the entire time I worked there.Company profile and standards are changing and down sizing is a critical factor among senior management. Direction of company is not assured. Chemical, and agriculture products is the only life line of the company.Enjoy working there a lot. I've learned a lot of the job field. Very friendly people. Everyone at work is willing to help you learn and become the best you can beRunning warehouses for on of the largest trucking companies in America on 2 dedicated accounts that kept me vrr busy with lots of overtime was a pleasure. I hate JB Hunt lost the accounts.My role includes the processing of customer orders, internal stock transfers, and review availability of materials for both.  I am constantly communicating with, supply chain management, external customers, internal customers, and sales management regarding their needs and out ability to fulfill their expectations. I also review processes against continuous improvement goals and account manager expectations.Decent pay, but must be willing to work 12hr rotating shift and 2 weekends a month. As far as the work goes, it can be boring. No challenge.the atmosphere there was friendly and the operators worked very hard each day. I learned to drive for the first time, about tools, different types of pumps, distillation columns, valves, heat exchangers and piping parts. The hardest part of the job was leaving.

259,260.0,GIS Analyst On-Call Bay Area,ICF International,3.4,237.0,"training provided was exceptional, some management very knowledgeable, environment clean and organized, some company morale, pay should increase for the jobReading other reviews of this company indicate to me that it depends on what part of the country you work in as to whether it's a good place to work. In Martinsville, VA it was a rotten place to work. Management treated employees with very little respect, there were few advancement opportunities, and pay raises depended on who you knew and not what you knew. (it took me 4 1/2 years to get a pay raise of $1.00).You had to constantly be worried about being fired for insignificant reasons. It was a stressful place to work.There was a different set of rules and regulations for the Martinsville call center compared to the rest of the company. We got no holiday pay and only 1.54 hours of PTO time per month. Your schedule could be changed without notification or concern for how it might affect you. The work enviroment was decidedly hostile. Leaving this company was the best thing that could have happened to me.I worked full time hours for several months and was never offered full time benefits such as health insurance. There is a huge lack of communication between management and employees. I witnessed managers and supervisors disrespect and talk down to their employees and nothing was done about it.The worst place to work for. They do not value there employees at all. The pay is horrible. The do not offer pay raises but give you new titles and expect for you to be content and do it for the low pay. The supervisors are horrible!! There was only one decent sup in there. They don't know what they are doing. When you ask questions they make stuff up and when you show them they are wrong they still expect you to listen and do what they say. They contradict there selves a lot. Very hostile work environment. No benefits of perks of working with them. They constantly put you down. You can be an excellent performer and they will look you in your face and say. Now you need to perform higher. They recently had / training classes of 12 ppl and out of those two training classes there is probably 4 ppl still employed. I've never worked in a office were everyone hates the job and the managers. They don't allow u to speak to fellow colleagues. If they see you are getting close they separate you. You are not allowed to talk. I honestly could keep going on but I would be here for days.ICF is an industry leader in consulting. ICF provides excellent employee benefits and exciting job opportunities. With offices all over the world, ICF positions itself to be a global leader in consulting.Have you seen Office Space? It's kind of like that. You better get your billable hours in, but not too many to the same charge code, or you'll be hearing from someone... During the 2013 Government Shutdown, they made their employees use vacation and unpaid leave if they couldn't find work (which was most of us). Pretty much sums it up. Basically, all they care about is how billable you are, so there's absolutely zero office culture (until happy hour when people would bond over how awful it was), and their year-end raises were laughable. DO NOT WORK HERE if you can help it.-Provide good training-Nice Supervisors-Nice work environment-Work  load balance is good-Not enough salary -You can ask for work from home after you complete one year at ICF        but you cannot ask for Monday and Friday-No more opportunities to move aheadI spent 15 years at ICF in total. I left and came back...and left again.  If you are willing to work hard, you produce great results, and you're willing to take some chances, you can go far here. I and many, many people I worked with, built careers here with a lot of advancement over time. I could name 20 people who started out near the bottom and worked their way up to VP. ICF is known for having really smart people, so there is stiff competition to get choice assignments and stand out in the crowd. Salary increases are not always large, but if you stay the course and continue to deliver, you'll get promoted and the money will eventually follow. Plus, there are several focus areas and a ton of projects, so if you don't ask permission too much and just take on as much as you can handle, you can learn a whole lot about your favorite subject and management in general.1. Great coworkers2. Demanding schedule3. Managers need to be sensitive to employee needs4. Lack of guidance5. Poor communication from managersGreat place to work with good culture, smart people, strong passion. They also allow me to work from home. Unfortunately, they are too business-oriented and do not adequately support their staff with good benefits and salary increases.Senior management attention and leadership is outstanding.  Great benefits, co-workers, working environment.  Terrific opportunities to work on variety of projects and locations.Working in the accounting department of ICF has been insanely awful. Management seemingly has no idea what they want and care very little for employees under Director level. They continue to lie and let employees go saying that they need to downsize for financial reasons and yet will create new Director positions shortly afterwards. There is no advancement at all. They would rather hire outside the company than promote the people within. Raises are horrible. Fear and intimidation are used to ""encourage"" employees to do their jobs and more by my current manager. Despite eight people leaving because of her, they continue to keep a no nothing manager on board who has no government contracting experience who has managed to overwhelm and anger everyone she encounters.Very low annual pay increases (on average 1.5%). Autonomous work culture. Only great situation if you are at Principal or VP level...everyone else do not get pay raises.This is by far the worst job I have ever had. Training is very poor and when they put you on the phone they change their mind about what you can and can't say every 10 minutes. There is absolutely no consistency and management refuses to help you. One manager spends her time taking personal calls while the other one guesses at the answers. None of the phone numbers they provide as resources work and they are always asking you to do more with no additional benefits. There are no other job titles which means no where to move up . Supervisors refuse to take escalated calls and gossip about employees to other employees. They can't even provide a clear answer about included benefits due to being over budget,most likely from the ridiculous turn over rate. No training class makes it more than a few days,and new class is taught weekly and each time only 2 out of 12 makes it for more than a week. Worst of all management stifles your personality, They claim it's too ""flamboyant"". They don't want you to know your fellow coworkers but expect you to tell them all of your business. You can't even use your cell phone in the break room. They make up reasons to fire people and never provide a legitimate reason. They even broke contract with the temp company that recruited for them without letting them know.Their goal for employees : have no personality and take as many calls as possible without offering real assistance to customers.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!Working for this company one may feel like they are not part of the machine that keeps this company going. The culture within the company is ""do as you're told and do not go against the grain."" Entering work on a daily basis becomes a chore - basically coming to work to earn a paycheck and nothing more. Upper management consist of people who previously served in the military together and their attitude is to say ""yes"" to the site manager no matter what. Even though there is constant descension from the management team the workers on the floor make things better. There is no growth opportunity beyond team lead and unfortunately the pay has been cut drastically for any person the management team selects. If you are not a person to go with the flow and give a constant yes your time will be limited.I began my career at ICF 5 years ago and was an employee referral.  The company has grown by about 1500 employees since I began and has still maintained a strong culture.  I was hired as a senior individual contributor and have been promoted several times in the last 5 years.My review is the same as my previous review of the company. Management staff is very non-supportive of lower level employees. There is no room for advancement unless close with upper management (based on friendships).Established a new satellite office requiring the creation of many new relationships and having to determine what was supported by main office and what needed to be created for the new location. The expectation is you work to get your job done and this may require 60-80 hours or it may require 40. Your success is based on your role, the tasks at hand, and you ability to delegate and or manage the assigned tasks. ICF is forward thinking and involved in many of societies ""Hot Topics"" across government and social responsibility.Consistent, easy work for decent pay. Definitely keep to yourself and work hard and you could be promoted once ample time has passed.A typical day at work involved a good mix of project work and proposal development. I learned a great deal about consulting, project management, and the proposal process.Co-workers were great.Hardest part of the job was working remotely.Most enjoyable part of the job was traveling and working at a work site.ICF International provided an environment that promoted both professional and personal growth. Through ICF's mentor program, I was able to learn skills outside of my scope of work. This program was a major component in developing skills that resulted in promotions and pay increases.",,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-09-19T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/dafdb819-1fb5-45d9-a8a1-2c17a1a77f7b?mescoid=1500140001001&jobPosition=25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Worked with hotel staff and transportation companies to arranged and organized the meeting. Worked with other H&A employees on this project to confirm flight and car rental for the people who needed it. The hardest part of the job was they just did not have enough work to keep me busy for the full 30 hours a week I needed.

262,263.0,Research Statistician,Roche,4.2,657.0,"My role in this job ranged from documentations expert to data manager to bio-statistician. Entering with a background in applied physics, I had a diverse and strong skill set, and this job required me to preform at all levels nearly all the time, whether I was networking with colleagues overseas to develop a testing procedure that would yield strong statistical power or to give an open presentation on our team's progress and statistical results. As my contract approached its end, my time was spent on data management and documentation.The company provided ample support and cross-department assistance. The atmosphere was largely amicable and the employees were incredibly friendly, which alleviated the stress that came with the workload. I was given the space and guidance to learn R, quickly becoming our office's expert, and developed statistical analysis modalities for verification protocols. I learned quality control procedures and how to produce adequate scientific publication for FDA submission. Learning is my favorite part of any job, and my role at Roche allowed me to absorb the knowledge and experience I need to become a stronger industry scientist.Our company was approaching launch when I joined, so my employment was restricted to a contractor position which did not grant vacation nor holidays. This was an issue for me, having missed out on holidays for the previous 6 years (4 during undergrad, 2 grad school), impacted by the high-intensity requirements of the job as we approached 510K/CE-marking submissions. These are the only qualms I had.If you don't agree with anything, make sure to keep it to yourself.  You'll by walked out the door so quickly that it'll make your head spin.

It's an international company with lots of growth opportunities internationally and locally.The work/life balance and benefits are far superior to other employers in the area.  The overall attitude of all leadership is to be learn from you as they teach you and prep you for the next stage in your career.  The most difficult part of working for an employer like Roche is having corporate headquarters in another country.  It can tend to cause some angst in getting through red tape and the fact that things are ran differently in Switzerland vs the US.  In short, a great place to land and settle in for the long haul.The direct reports control your outcome of your performance. The cafeteria is decent and the place is full of people who have worked more than 10 years. It is very difficult to win with the constant harassment by your reports and constantly going to HR to create havoc for the Manager.Roche is full of intelligent people who are always striving to better themselves, their company, and their products. I worked as an intern in the Technical Transfer Team and could not have been happier with my experience. I was encouraged to learn as much as I could during my time their and everyone I met was enthusiastic and helpful.Stable organization with great benefits and compensation. Generous profit sharing with full time employees. Plenty of activities and causes to join through the organization.Good. Nice working environment. Good working culture and good balance of work and personal life. Would recommend working at a great company. Great benefits as well.This was a great company to work for.  Management helped to foster a learning environment where anyone willing could grow.Roche is a great place to work. They have a clear direction as to where they are going and want to be. They are very supportive of your career goals whether with the company or not.Every time I got to work everybody would greet you with a smile. My co-workers were friendly, my supervisor was friendly and my work space was the best.Typical day at work consisted of me locating the shortages/overages of premium payments sent in from bail bonds agents who are writing under Roche by comparing our sales report to theirs, and notifying them of such differences. Also creating state needed documents specific to each state the bail bond agent resides in so they are able to legally start writing bail bonds. I wouldn't recommend working here, as teamwork is not a top priority at Roche Surety. Every man for themselves is basically the atmosphere I have come to learn over the past year. I learned how to better organize myself through all the chaos. The hardest part of the job was communication amongst co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job is the one friendship I developed with someone who has been with the company for about 10 years. At a moments notice, you can be let go without any notice of the termination or a legitimate reason as to why.I was really happy to work for this company, by mornings we started at 7 hrs and continue working until 12 hrs, that was the lunch time for my type of contract person, then 1 hour lunch and back to work from 13 to 16:30 hrs. but Friday, job on Friday end at 13:30 hrs.My co workers were very respectful of our privacy but anyways there were group activities after work.The hard part of the job is that I didn't have a permanent contract with the company, for the annual Christmas party I was not invited, and some other important meetings I was not required.The facilities were awesome, and the working life enjoyable.I mostly engaged as an overnight machine operator with the company. I inspected deficiencies in the glucose measuring strips that they manufacture, produce, and distribute. After that, I graduated to being a machine operator. I was trained to troubleshoot machine stoppages, errors in the coating process, and the quality creation of a well inspected and manufactured product.At roche, my coworkers had positive attitudes. The job kept me busy, but it was not physically strenuous at all. I really enjoyed my time there because although the work is not the most exciting thing, I know I am making something that someone out there truly needs, which brings me joy.There are very few cons about my job at Roche. One of these is that in the management, there is much unfair favoritism. Another thing about management is that they walk around and observe the employees almost constantly, which made me a bit uncomfortable. Over all, though, I loved working at Roche!PROS - Work/life balance. Plenty of events that encouraged camaraderie. Family like environment. Very regulated organization that leads to great professional development.CONS - Contract based for more than 50% of their manpower. No benefits if under temporary contract.Great company to work for. Love what the company does. Am glad to be part of a company that is innovative and truly cares for it's employees. Would recommend this company to anyone.I enjoyed everything about working for Roche. The company is well organized and diverse. It had a very positive impact on my life.Consulting:•	Assisted consultants in giving suggestions about the design of the clinical trials and providing R and STATA code.•	Employed multiple imputation method to solve the missing values associated with clinical data.Data Analysis:•	    Project #1: The first clinical trial research was jointly conducted by Johns Hopkins Hospital and University of Chicago to discover the relationship between the levels of depression of patients and 14 other demographic variables.•	    Project #2:  The second clinical trial research was to investigate whether patients who lose smelling function having higher odds of being delirium in clinics.Currently i am working in Roche Pak Ltd as Senior Service Engineer.I am gaining knowledge day by day and my professional skills are also enhanced as time goes, i am very much satisfied with my professional growth. The only thing which bothers me is the work/life balance. That is not balanced and i couldn't give proper time to my family.The co-workers are what makes this company very unique. They are positive, welcoming and always willing to lend a hand when asked. The company allows growth professionally and management is supportive if communicated. The company has great health benefits and safety is a high priority. The work/life balance is hard to maintain.","10,000+",San-Francisco,South San Francisco,CA,2016-08-22T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/fd67eeeb-e1c4-4a04-9717-46a826f5f912?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=28,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I proposed and implemented many changes with the goal of providing the best care possible to the infants in the NICU and their parents. I proposed written care plans that were to be manintained and updated as an ongoing process for the babies and their parents so that other nurses who came in could refer to the care plan and know the central problems and processes being done for the infant and parents. I proposed primary care nursing for the infants, so taht one nurse could be in charge of their care and get to know the parents, establising a bond and trust with the mothers ad fathers. I proposed a more humane treatment plan for babies dying in the unit that included the grieving parents' needs. I proposed a committee to provide a forum for nurses and doctors to collaborate on patients' care and meeting parent's needs. I worked on the Policy and Procedure Committee writing new policies for nurses to follow. I was in charge of 10-12 nurses, managing the NICU at night, when fewer doctors were available. I was also in charge during the day, managing a busy NICU. I went on transports, bringing new babies to our unit from outlying hospitals. I learned how to manage difficult prople during the most difficult times in their lives. I helped mothers and fathers be parents in a inhospitable environment. I thoroughly enjoyed my work, especially as a primary care nurse, working with mothers everyday, helping to care for sick term and preterm infants. The biggest challenge for me was making sure the babies and their families were  more... treated humanely and that all nurses recognized and respected their right to be there and their need for each other during their hospitalization. I was inspired by my own experience as a working mother with four sons and a husband at home. Balancing all this was difficult but rewarding and gratifying. I learned much that could be applied to life, to running a business, especially to customer service and satisfaction.  lessTypical day was recruiting study participants and coordinating research studys. I have learned the importance of continuing to deliver high quality customer care.My co-workers work as a team.Answer phones and operate a switchboard.Route calls to specific people.Answer inquiries about company.Greet visitors warmly and make sure they are comfortable.Call persons waiting for visitor and book them a room to meet in.Schedule meetings and conference rooms.Make coffee and set out food.Ensure reception area is tidy.Coordinate mail flow in and out of office.Coordinate office activities.Handle phone calls from people calling in sick.Gather personal and insurance information.Hand out employee applications.Arrange appointments.Cash out people when necessary.Validate parking tickets.Give visitors badges and direct them to where they can sign in.Issue parking passes.Send email and faxes.Collect and distribute parcels and other mail.Perform basic bookkeeping, filing, and clerical duties.Prepare travel vouchers.Take and relay messages.Update appointment calendars.Schedule follow-up appointments.Is a good good place to work. benefits little expensive at this company , is always under a new management. that's all.nothing else to say for now.I did word processing with a 24 hour turn around of medical reports.  I worked in the Pediatric Pulmonary and Cystic Fibrosis Center for 4 years as a full time employee.  I answered the phones, did all the filing, handled the mail and set up emergency hospitalizations at the end of the day at California Pacific Medical Center.I love working here. I love the People, I ve learned so much from working here.  The co-workers have been very helpful in making my work experience very pleasent.At the time, there was much to work out at CPMC. I'm sure by now much has been changed and improved. At the time, everything was poorly managed but I hear it is better now.My workplace is a wonderful place to work at, with competitive and skilled nurses and doctors.  The ability to participate in healthcare policy and executive management gives employees ownership and stewardship.Busy work schedule...had to work all shifts....no time to learn...emergency department was always packed with peopleI enjoyed my job at CPMC  tremendously . it paved my way to stay in oncology nursing . The staff and support was fabulous they were a 23 bed  medical surgical oncology unit.I joy servicing the public. And making a difference  in the work environment, I find it rewarding and challenging  with the help of team work.Worked for 27 years at CPMC in outpatient surgery. Very fast paced challenging environment. The outpatient surgery center has had a census from 25 to 55 pts per day. I found working with surgical patients in this environment to be extremely rewarding. I developed many skills that facilitated smooth patient admission and recovery.I love working for this company as I always feel supported by management and other staff. Everyone there is super friendly and very educated in a supportive and fun loving way. Patients that come in feeling ill leave with a great sense of hope.Management Pits department against department and employee against employee.  Middle management is disposable.  The hardest part of the job is not becoming part of the culture of this facility.  The job of upper management is to keep their jobs.I worked with this company for years and I enjoyed working with them. I was sadden to have left the company and hope to find a new position with them again. Great people and great overall environment.Worked per diem.  Staff is highly professional and maintain strict standards.  The working environment is clearly a culture of safety.A typical day as a Discharge Specialist at California Pacific Medical Center would consist of many responsibilities.  The day would start by going to interdisciplinary rounds to discuss which patients would be discharging for the day.  I would work with nurse case managers, social workers, and doctors to identify any needs or barriers for discharge.  It was very much a team approach to work toward a common goal.Most enjoyable part was Clinical Research and working with patients.",,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-06-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/379ef2c6-1e12-45dd-8db4-6968606e8e04?mescoid=1900257001001&jobPosition=9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

327,328.0,Biologist (Computational/Bioinformatics),Department Of Agriculture,4.2,577.0,"I never worked for the Department of AG.  I dont know why this agency popped up.  there is not review to say.    blah blah blah  nothing to say.  Never worked at this agency.Through UGA I was able to intern at the USDA. I was not paid a salary but was given class credit as compensation. A typical day involved arriving to the lab on time with a plan for that day's procedures. The first half of the internship involved learning basic lab techniques and following protocols. The second half of the internship involved troubleshooting in order to create my own lab protocol for future interns to follow. I mostly spent my time learning from the head lab technician, but would occasionally work with the head of research if he was available. The best part about the job was learning new things related to biology and being able to think through my errors in an environment suited for student advancement.You assist landowners and farmers on a daily basis to receive government subsidies. Work with genuine people all around. Not just within the office but the producers themselves.The USDA FOREST SERVICE is a wonderful agency to begin a career. The agency allows applicants to gain valuable work experience as a students, veterans, limited term employee, contactor, etc. The agency has several positions for those who have a love of the outdoors and want to protect those assets. The agency has clear directives, goals, and set measurable standards for all staff. Like most federal agencies, the USDA Forest Service rewards their employees who furthers their education and seek additional training.Department  of agriculture is a government  agency in the Philippines. The agency is a very good place work with because of the good management and the professionalism and respect the employees have.Positive Work Environment, Goals of agency align with personal goals, Management is knowledgeable, Work is fulfilling, Schedule allows for work/life balanceGreat place to work and provide great customer service to clients. I work day for me started around 6 am in the morning. I would be the first to arrive so I was the tam member that came in and st the pace for the rest of the staff for the day. I learned how the government works and what it take to please your supervisors as well as the community. Management  was more hands off, which I loved as long as you knew your expectations and performed. Co-workers, some worked just as hard as you, some did not. Some were long term, and some were not, with that approach. The hardest part was management having a difficult time making sure everything was communicated effectively and everyone on the same page. The happiest part of the job, was knowing that you save someone from losing their home are their hard earned possessions or property.The Temple office is a great place to work.  The people are friendly and the work environment is good also.  I have learned a lot from them and they seem to be very helpful.Fast paced. Garnered teamwork skills that were fundamental for career development. Growth potential. Various training opportunity's. Great place to network, and reliable management to learn from.USDA has a fantastic mission and tools to help Rural America. The policies and leadership are so political that the wrong people and projects are receiving assistance. Employees are not encouraged to think outside the box by management and each office is very local and very clicky.Monday thru Friday jobI learned a lot about personnelworking independently I enjoy about the job nice co workers and also like working as a teamPhones, emails, scheduling, detail sheets, Travel Arrangements, vouchers.  Assisting field employees and supervisors with questions and problems.  Working with other departments to resolve issues.The incumbent possesses knowledge of the principles, practices, concepts and theories of law (Federal and State), regulations, and policies as they relate to the servicing and liquidation of guaranteed loans. The incumbent uses this knowledge and skill to apply techniques to obtain and evaluate a borrower's ability (or lack thereof) to reinstate a delinquent loan and to conclude whether a borrower has the potential to repay the loan.Management could get too micro manage and only care for production instead of being people oriented. Customer service is not their priority but making their numbers. Coworkers are hard worker but afraid of management and losing their job. The most enjoyable part of the job is that we could make a difference in people's lives, and that is satisfaction enough.I job shadowed a lab technician. There was not much I could learn about benefits or other employees. The work environment was more constricted to a specific area.I work in an agency that helps farmers improve their land.  We have a very diverse group of employees.My job is to maintain files and assist the various groups with the administrative duties, answer phones, put postage on our system and to ship the UPS packages each day.  Each day is a varied set of duties...just depends on the day and what is going on in the office.  I enjoy learning new processes and trying new projects.  I have learned to be very flexible!While performing the duties as a Consumer Safety Inspector I was responsible for product and it's wholesomeness. It was to be unadulterated and free of contamination.I learned that inspite of what the company or plant wanted it was my job to make sure the American Consumer was served and not the plant.My co workers were good people and mindful of the importance of the work they did.The hardest part of the job? Getting beyond the tediousness of the job. I enjoyed serving the public above all else.Everyday was very productive we had to multitask and think on our feet every minute while on the job. I loved fighting the fires that was the most enjoyable part because you do something that is selfless in a sense that you love to do. I learned alot from everything to how sharpen blades on a lawn mower, to operating a Fire truck that was the size of a semi and building firelines to contain a fire with a bulldozer with a plow on the end hitched to it.This was my first position I held with the US Government.  It was a great place to begin my federal career.  After a few years of being there, I transferred to another position within the Dept. of Agriculture that was closer to home.Working for USDA is great.  They provide excellent work schedule options to accommodate you.   Good co-workers and good support from upper management.I loved working for the USDA they try to work with you in every way possible and provide you with what you need to get your job done efficiently. Their Management is well staffed and experienced so they are very knowledgeable and dependent. The hardest part was waiting for lunch!","5,001 to 10,000",San-Francisco,Albany,CA,2016-12-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/a446c662-755d-496d-b6ce-f5b5d61b84c7?mescoid=1900245001001&jobPosition=23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Working there I got so much in return because I learnt a huge deal and understand the work life better. The teammates are always helping and are always ready to explain you things when you don't understand something. At times it would get stressful, however I believe that it is the stress level and the difficulty of the job that keeps us going and striving for excellence, by making it an adventure to work for the company. All the teams always help each other out, inter-teams and intra-teams, when in confusion and there is always discussions going on within the team which is makes it a better place to work for.Great place to get the exposure on the cutting edge technologies, flexible, caring and friendly working environment.",,San-Francisco,San Mateo,CA,2016-07-25T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/a80f7f03-f9e5-4205-8a00-2b5c22fbdf40?mescoid=1500140001001&jobPosition=33,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

I loved having multiple breaks in such a nice environment. This job just requires a great personality and the ability to listen.Outside in Florida is always a great environment. The management style is hands on and the crew really knew what they where doing. I learned all that I now know from them.A typical day at work involved a good mix of project work and proposal development. I learned a great deal about consulting, project management, and the proposal process.Co-workers were great.Hardest part of the job was working remotely.Most enjoyable part of the job was traveling and working at a work site.Atmosphere at ICF was fun and family oriented. I enjoyed the morning meetings every morning. Employees were able to use the gym for a monthly fee. Metro acessible.I enjoyed working with a team in which each member knew their purpose. People were generally helpful when I asked questions that pertained to my role and theirs.This is a great company to work for.  They have a great history and they take care of their employees.  They have a great track record as a reputable contractor in the DMV.The best ran company I've ever worked for and I will privileged to work there full time the moment a position arises.  I currently am a permanent on-call temp worker.Established a new satellite office requiring the creation of many new relationships and having to determine what was supported by main office and what needed to be created for the new location. The expectation is you work to get your job done and this may require 60-80 hours or it may require 40. Your success is based on your role, the tasks at hand, and you ability to delegate and or manage the assigned tasks. ICF is forward thinking and involved in many of societies ""Hot Topics"" across government and social responsibility.-Provide good training-Nice Supervisors-Nice work environment-Work  load balance is good-Not enough salary -You can ask for work from home after you complete one year at ICF        but you cannot ask for Monday and Friday-No more opportunities to move aheadICF was a great place to work. The staff is very friendly. The always had events for the office to participate in. They fed us a lot and parking was always there. They provide a shuttle to and from the metro as well.I worked full time hours for several months and was never offered full time benefits such as health insurance. There is a huge lack of communication between management and employees. I witnessed managers and supervisors disrespect and talk down to their employees and nothing was done about it.ICF is an industry leader in consulting. ICF provides excellent employee benefits and exciting job opportunities. With offices all over the world, ICF positions itself to be a global leader in consulting.Great clients to work for.  However not potential career growth.  Would have like to have taken on more advance skills / duties while employed with the companyWorking for this company one may feel like they are not part of the machine that keeps this company going. The culture within the company is ""do as you're told and do not go against the grain."" Entering work on a daily basis becomes a chore - basically coming to work to earn a paycheck and nothing more. Upper management consist of people who previously served in the military together and their attitude is to say ""yes"" to the site manager no matter what. Even though there is constant descension from the management team the workers on the floor make things better. There is no growth opportunity beyond team lead and unfortunately the pay has been cut drastically for any person the management team selects. If you are not a person to go with the flow and give a constant yes your time will be limited.My review is the same as my previous review of the company. Management staff is very non-supportive of lower level employees. There is no room for advancement unless close with upper management (based on friendships).Consistent, easy work for decent pay. Definitely keep to yourself and work hard and you could be promoted once ample time has passed.In the beginning of my career with ICF I thought it was a wonderful company, there is a a lot of room for advancement and learning of new systems and projects. I have learned so much working for ICF international.Awesome workplace. Great working. Company culture is good and people are flexible. Lot of work and good no. of hiring. Telecommuting is also there as an option.Not a bad job just got laid off and never wanted to go back due to all the shenanigans the work put me through. It wasn't all that bad but personally I don't like working in the heat due to how easily I over heat. I'm not seeking to go back there but its a good company1. Great coworkers2. Demanding schedule3. Managers need to be sensitive to employee needs4. Lack of guidance5.

Allowed me to utilize an environmental education role that I previously had no experience in. And gave me many independent projects and management roles.only worked two weeks, hard work, driving time. it sucks to only work two weeks at temp job. was looking for full-time job with benefitsReally great place to work in and a great work environment. There is a lot of work to do, everyday is different challenge. The way the department is managed is perfect.Providing technical support for the special agents and maintainingthe DEA radio system. Learned a lot about law enforcement.Management was ok.  Co workers were the best. Hardest part of the job were long hours. Most enjoyable part was a successful criminalcase.The best part of this job is being a National Park Service Ranger. Everyone who comes in says ""you're so lucky to have this job!!"" To do it well it means working hard, spending a lot of hours of preparing programs and sometimes, waiting for hours on a ridgeline for wildlife that decide to go somewhere else on a whim. The vast majority of the jobs the the NPS are seasonal, summer type jobs, so that's one reason you'll see a lot of retirees as Park Rangers. When you only have work for 6 months a year, you need a 2nd source of income. There are generally very few people out in the parks who don't really want to be there, so the working environment is great.To look for NPS jobs, you have to find them on USAJobs, the Government's official website. Search where you want to work and be sure to tailor your USAJobs resume specifically to the opening you are applying for.best job I have ever had though it was unfortunately a seasonal position. The company itself had great job security for full time workers as well as noteworthy benefits. The job itself was hard work but very fulfilling.on certain days I would go in and do maintenance at the main office fixing things like electrical problems, Repairing buildings, Installing siding on buildings, Installing Instillation under buildings, and on days im not at office I would go out to camp grounds and keep up with the camp grounds and fix and repair things such as fixing broken door handles, Installing water pumps, Installing solar panels, Installing hot water heatersMy direct manager was wonderful. She tried everything she could to get me on permanent, was like pulling teeth in the State Office, not because of work performance but because I had no military status. I held very good positions because of manager but was not paid for those positions. The experience was well worth it. I learned about project analysis and project management. Took courses held through the Federal Government for Federal Appropriations Law and Project Management. Assisted in multi-million dollars budgeting and database management in financing. If I could only rate Karla Norris...she was an exceptional manager. Because I worked for the federal government most of us were not native to the area..different walks of life, great working with people from all over the united states.Excitimg career choice nevera dull moment. Damgerous but rewarding. Tons of opportunities for growth.   Senior officers are nice and very open with help and leading new officersIt was an amazing experience to associate with wildland firefighters (an incredible group of people).  In coordinating training within the State of Utah, working with State and Federal organizations, I learned a lot and learned to work with an appreciate a 'work culture' previously unknown to me.The system includes 413 areas covering more than 84 million acres in every state, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. These areas include national parks, monuments, battlefields, military parks, historical parks, historic sites, lake shores, seashores, recreation areas, scenic rivers and trails, and the White House.I thoroughly enjoyed working for DOI. The work was challenging at times, but always enjoyable. My coworkers and management were so easy to get along with that it made my job much more enjoyable.The best people I have ever worked with and would like to stay but I must work on 100 ton vessel to advance my license. I have worked there for two years and have enough time to upgrade to 1600 Mate. Would like to get more time on 100 ton vessel to upgrade to 500 ton Master.good job just needs better job security. however work is starting to heat up so overall a great place to work. a typical day would be getting to job setting up equipment and taking care of business.I only worked with the NPS for a summer. The entire summer was full of fun and learning experiences. They had a lot of things for us to do on the weekends when we weren't working such as traveling to different parks, learning about the NPS, going to DC, among other exciting experiences. I would love to work for them again.Management is aweful.  They only care about themselves and getting promoted.  Management doesn't care about the actual workers.Learned how to get things done in a GOV environment. It is different than Commercial workflow. I also gained the experience of a Nation wide collaboration of combined systems and people.Although my work in the federal service has been incredibly rewarding and my career has continuously progressed, my passion lies in community engagement and meeting the needs of the people within my community. My ability to lead is the richest when I am focused on leading a team that is focused on building a better future for youth, families and the surrounding communities.The DOI is one of many Government agencies that represent the worst that the Federal Government has to offer. The have taken full time positions and re defined them as term positions or seasonal positions. Advancement is impossible unless you are on the ""in"" with the agency. Nepotism is rampant and pay is low.I really enjoyed saving people lives and property. It gave me a sense of happiness and joy knowing that I help someone who need it my help. I enjoy traveling seeing nice forest and other towns that I never seen before. Enjoy seeing animals in the wild.Great place of business. Room for growth and learning. Great opportunities. Great atmosphere. I loved this place.

Solution from depro plate is then transferred to the each individual tube on the rack it's assigned to, dried down again on what we call our IVAPS, capped after their dry and then shipped off to the customer who ordered the oligos. The night crew I work with are overall enjoyable to be around and work alongside. I learned a lot about DNA synthesize, oligos peaks, and so on.My time as an intern helped me see how much the employees enjoyed their jobs. They were always willing to help educate us on new policies and procedures.

369,370.0,Speech Analytics Engineer,SRI International,3.8,57.0,"Great work flexibility, low pressure environment. Management tends to work in a vacuum and does not promote team environment. Culture is very unique overallI worked for SRI International for 9 years, they never ceased to amaze me with what they were working on. SRI always is out looking for new and better ways to satisfy the customer.SRI Harrisonburg is a beautiful site, good facility. Right now it suffers from not having its own HR department, and decisions are made by HQ. Half the labs are empty, waiting to be filled.It was one of my first jobs in the field outside of school and definitely a learning/growing experience.  I have many fond memories of this place.SRI International is a good non-profit company, but it has undergone some significant changes in senior management in recent years. I am not really sure about the direction of the company any more, but the people there are top notch.SRI International is so multi-faceted, opinions in the suggested areas are bound to vary from person to person.  For instance, people working in support roles have a pretty set schedule, as with most jobs, while engineers and research personnel often have a more flexible schedule.Most of what I learned would fall under the heading ""Intangibles"", other than properly filling out documentation for the project I worked with, according to the client's guidance.Management seems to be hesitant in holding people as accountable as their peers would like, but that is a reality of any Project-type environment:  the majority of team members primarily work for someone else, and can always opt to leave.The hardest part of my job was working at such a distance that timely responses were not always possible from the corporate end.  I was in a decided minority compared to the majority of the work situations.The most enjoyable was the confidence my supervisors had in my abilities, and their consistent and constant support, as well as the timely mentorship.My supervisor did not train me very well with the everyday assignments that was given to me daily.  My co-workers did not want to cover for me at the front desk for breaks and lunch breaks.  My eleven months with this company was not very good.Working with scientist and engineers is my favorite. We had government contracts, and so it was tedious at times.  The people were superb.  Special project on new lines of business, computer systems modernization, and spin offs kept us busy. Stable and rewarding environment.   No stock options!Day to day busy with one duty or another. You always have someone to give you good advice. Its up to you to come prepare to do what is needed to be done.SRI is on the cutting edge in many areas of research,   the culture inspires individuals to do their best and is open to many areas of  interest.   The people are great to work for and there is a culture of working together to enjoy work and comradery among the employees.Decent work place with friendly supportive management. This site is relative new but the productivity is going up and all the numbers are ok.A good company with a diverse employee base, as well as high-level technology.Lots to keep up with, if you're ""up to the task"".Employees receive training in many different areas of specialty, so this company is a great first job for people.The management can overlook the forest for the trees and very rarely sees the big picture. Inconsistent criteria for advancement. Compensation is low for the amount of work required (overtime will be scheduled to the point where one's work/life balance will be disrupted).As a four year veteran who is just now taking his own advice - do the work, get your training, excel at it, but don't stay here too long.Confusing management system.  The workforce is growing very old and they are having a hard time attracting younger people.I believe that any typical day at any job is the same all around. There are times when you could be busy all day, that you don't even realize where the time has gone. And then there are the days when  work is slow that you have to go around asking for work, just trying to look busy. Management was real kick back, but firm when need be. But very open minded people. Not hard to get along with at all. I would have to say that the hardest part about the job was having to pick up after the technicians and maintain the medical supplies in the warehouse. And the most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things and meeting people with many different personalities and characters.A typical day of work for a Corporate Security Professional is never the same. I learned that most of the time people are not recognized for their hard work, but instead humiliated for any type of mistake made.A reputable institution and for someone without an PhD, it's a good start. It's very old school so there's very little room to move up without a PhD. I've worked in labs where education was second to skill base, although at SRI I found it difficult to be taken seriously unless you have a PhD.SRI Culture is described as a ""Google"" like campus with senior professors, professionals that create and innovate. Diverse market source for R&D.I've been with Sarnoff and SRI International for the past 16 years.It is a great place to work. I am intrigued with world changing  technology. It changes at a days notice.No two days are ever the same.Great management and colleagues with awesome personalities.Hardest part is the deadline, everything has a deadline. But we tend to work well under pressure.Most enjoyable would be the day to day. I truly enjoy my job and the people I work for  and with.SRI International is an innovative company that is very creative and has many hard working folks who put a lot of time and effort in assisting the Military in their mission.  The XCTC program and FlexTrain Home Station programs are very good tools that were created to meet the digital training requirements for National Guard Bureau and have accomplished this many times over.Multi-tasking with various clients for engineering research proposal development.",,San-Francisco,Menlo Park,CA,2016-10-17T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/cb23bbf0-d581-49b5-867f-f22b68df8bfb?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=30,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Work Life balance is any oxymoron, a normal work week is 60+ hours.  Perhaps i have rose colored glasses thinking it will be any different with another manufacturer, but BD is taking advantage of too many good people and breaking them is disheartening.    It is unfortunate BD has changed so quickly, it was once a great place to work, it has the feel of a small private company with employee satisfaction at the forefront. Unfortunately the acquisition of debt has the company scrambling to pay back quickly no matter the cost or associate turnover.    My advice to management is to pay more attention to the associates and the company cash generation, the manufacturing plant.  Yes BD, you are a manufacturing company!It's not relevant to write a review on a company you may have worked for over ten years ago, things change, people change and management changes, please delete.Great Culture and people. Communication was not as great. Was there as a contractor and it seemed that the employees were really happy with BDTypical workday is very routine. Co-workers are great and the most enjoyable part of my job would be seeing the products we make benefit others health.Eight hour work days go smooth with balanced work load, and efficient leadership. Co-workers are helpful and professional. There is no hard part of the day.The Company having long history of commitment to the highest standard of excellence and high quality and integrity in everything that is provided to improve healthy lives.   Best place to work.  Higher  standard of employee benefits.Team leads and managers do not take ownership of anything in Global Support. There is no guidance to help someone through the BD culture. No training was provided, no clear direction to expectations, and no acceptance of any failures. When help was sought, leads always deflected to others in departments that were not part of global support. Leads were quick to throw others under the bus and got extremely upset if anyone complained.Great company to work for However, they rather hire contracted workers. The permanent  employees are extremely spoiled. you work from the time you walk in the door to the time you leave. Very fast paced company.Great place to work where employees are well respected and encouraged to help improve patients' lives. Strong social investing position. Good team work.One of the best and highest paying jobs I've ever had. I love that I don't have a manager breathing down my neck all day ""micromanaging"" me. However, many have been affected by recent lay-offs since BD acquired CareFusion...I am one of them!!!Friendly co workers. Free coffee. Very cold. Good Pay. Lots of traffic. Laid back environment. Not too strict. Meetings are plenty.The harder you work the more likely someone will take credit or set you up. It's those people who get promoted. External hires for all promotable positions instead of internal candidates is the way they like it. Unskilled external folks who need to be trained by tenured employees who are organizationally under them.Great place to work. A lot of opportunities within this organization here in the U.S or abroad. Fantastic culture that gives you a great work life balance for you and your family.very rewarding Job, as it focuses on people and building relationship.typically, I connect with a variety of people specific with the  healthcare professional, key professionals in charge to decide about improving healthcare practices. Our company is more on clinical solutions versus being a vendor alone.I Manufactured surgical drapes and post surgical opthalmic lens covers. Qaulity was very important here all products were made in accordance to very specific procedures. The management team was very good here and I was sorry to lose the job when they relocated to another state.Fun Place,worked as Sap BW,BO consultant and enjoyed the work with coworkers and learned other technologies and enjoyed to work here.explore more in this cmpany.This is a wonderful company. Great people to work with.Changing the world for better. BD helps people live healthy lives.Beautiful campus.Very good culture.Growing to fast thru acquisitions... Good benefits and PTO .Good Incentives for future planning.Sad they had to close facility and consolidate in San Jose.Management is fair and level headed. Lots of opportunity for advancement. Full time employees have excellent benefits, 99% of co-workers seem happy and easy going; they are very easy to work with. I am eager to get hired full time and spend my last ten years of employment (or more) here before I retire.Management at BD usually has someone in mind before they post a job.  Management is very closed minded.  BD's doesn't promote from within much.

433,434.0,Scientist II,Bristol Myers Squibb,4.2,533.0,"Great compensation and benefits; many terrific employeesOne of the reasons that I loved my job with BMS is that you did not always have the typical hum drum work day. There were times when something would happen that required all hands on deck. It was awesome to work in an environment that was truly Team inspired. Also it was an employee driven atmosphere. Our managers made sure that you were exposed to any and everything that would promote you to the next level!!!!Great company and staff. It taught me how to handle customers needs with special needs. I truly had a very strong connection with the managers and supervisors... I truly loved the company.I highly recommend this company to anyone lucky enough to work there. The management is very strong. I have learned a tremendous amount in this company. It does a very large amount of things right.The company is continuously evolving. I enjoy my job but feel as though my department may be losing head count and do not feel as secure as I have for the past 10 years.Excellent company culture and fostering of professional development.  Very pleased with the friendly, collegiate work environment.Follow SOP's, personnel at all level was well trained. Great, professional atmosphere. Job activities were well coordinated between the supervisor and the operators.I have enjoyed working at BMS, I find that the teamwork and collaboration is great.  We are all part of a team and help each other.  People don't hesitate to lend a hand when asked or to share their experience.  Overall it's been a great experience; it's just that professional development can be lacking.  In my current department, it is hard to find a way to grow and develop.BMS is a company with long-standing reputation on knowledge of brand science.  Excellent training department.  Pipeline is well diversify and has the team on place to have effective product launches.Long work days due to territory size.Great management team; encouraged to think outside the boxGreat counterparts on my team.Limited product lifeThe department tried to make all persons mix together and become friends because we work in the same area, but I think is much more better not to impose the mandatory friendship.In a typical day we should start at 8, work with the CRFs and so until 13 hrs going all together to have lunch and then back to work again from 14 to 17 hrs.I learnt to use online fax and to do community work.For me it's hard to say, I had the misfortune that on my days there some of the management were out of duty for pregnancy and working abroad, so I don't have an accurate view of the general management of the department.Most of my coworkers were nice hard working persons, but besides the work we didn't share common interests. That was the hardest part of the job to be friend with person I barely knew and with no common interests. The most enjoyable part of the job were the teleconferences, it was amazing working with persons all around the world trying to make the job done in time and with quality.Great place to work. Good work ethic, personal development, opportunity to learn and grow. Very good work life balance. Industry Comparable benefits.Making a difference in the lives of people Why must I provide additional information that is none of your business.  These mandatory field requirements are ridiculousA lot to learn, limited but precise guidance, continuous performance, great co-workers, team spirit, awesome inter location communication setup, easy communication with global teams, flexible schedule.As a Territory Business Manager at BMS, each employee is responsible for managing a territory and individually creating and strengthening customer relationships. Each day, the TBM devises a schedule to achieve maximum growth for the territory. The job encompasses cold calls, planned calls, and occasionally, dinner-time appointments. Although the job is generally solitary, communication with fellow colleagues is encouraged and necessary for success in this job. BMS encourages employees to be heavily engaged in their success, but also supportive of a positive work-life balance.At BMS, I learn the root cause analysis of the non conformance events and handling CAPAS. I expose to new technologies, aseptic filling using isolator technologies.i did not want to give review but indeed is forcing to do so , , i have no reason why would indeed do that , to conclude it is good place to work , atBMS is a great company to work for.  Excellent people and team environment.  I would highly recommend anyone to work here.BMS offers a great work/life balance by allowing flexibility to work from home.  Sometimes the hours can be long but the work is rewarding in itself by allowing patients to live long healthy lives.  I was working on contract so was not eligible to receive benefits.  Management is knowledgeable on the subject matter but could sometimes have better communication skills.  Job Culture is excellent at promoting diverse skilled workforce through equal opportunity employment.Science is great, company politics not so much. Good if you are in the ""favored"" group, if not, good luck getting promoted or even getting the hired help you were promised. New people who just joined allowed to hire over people who have been here for years. I stay here because I love the science, that's about it.I have worked here for over 10 years. In that time I have had many opportunities to learn new skills and have been promoted 4 times.  I enjoy the people I work with as we all share a vision of compassionate animal care while still completing important animal research.","10,000+",San-Francisco,Redwood City,CA,2016-10-16T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/81c7b3f5-f70b-458a-b65c-de8f574bd378?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

My only complain/concern about Ascend is that the don't appreciate their on-call/per diem employees more than they should since they are the ones finishing the work during busy week. It was very disappointing when they announced via email that the they would be giving out bonuses during the Holidays only to discover that we (on-calls/per diem) were not included. It seems like every time they have an employee appreciation, we (the on-calls/per diem) are forgotten. We work just as hard if not harder than the regular employees. Hopefully it changes.I learned a lot and I enjoyed working in there.Nice people to work withExcellent teamwork Offers chemistry, hematology, microbiology and immunology analysis for dialysis patient demographic.I work for Ascend Clinical formerly known as Satellite Laboratories Services for almost 7 years. A typical day at work was to check all the emails to find out what what going on for the day. I learned a numerous amount about laboratory testing, and dialysis.I had great managers who were also great at at helping me advance in my career. We were a strong department and all the co-workers work together to get the priorities completed. The hardest part of my job is when we received over 800 tubes during busy week, and the labels were not labeled corrected.The most enjoyable part of the job was when we has Dialysis Week once a year. It was very festive, when had games, won many prizes, such as ipod's, computers, dishwhere, dvd, luggage.

465,466.0,Senior Biostatistician (Oncology) - Novella Clinical,Quintiles Inc.,3.9,491.0,"Great people, management is not always aware of how processes, transition, and the clinical model and career pathway workKeeping up with tested slides and properly storing them. Organizing and keeping up with lab equipment was very important as well as carrying many medical files and placing them in alphabetical order. Great environment to work in, hardest part was carefully placing the slides in their storage area having to be extremely careful. Easiest job I would say keeping up with the records and maintaining the lab equipment and assisting others.A typical work day was pretty med range as far as stress levels go and the work loads are not to bad. You go in, wait for a delivery truck to drop off your work load and then you began your work which takes about 2 1/2 - 4 hours and you are on your feet the whole time.I learned better time management and to speak up if I had an ideal that may better the business. Nothing good to say about the Management team so I won't speak on it. Co-workers are like family. The hardest part of the job was trying to remember all of the protocols to are continently being changed every few weeks. Second half of the work day which was light and some of the positive people I worked with was the most enjoyable part of the job.The job I was hired for didn't have long to really take off.  After a few weeks, my boss learned that his new boss was transferring the project we were working on, over seas and the whole team would need to look elsewhere for a position - either within Quintiles or outside of Quintiles.A company with lots of opportunity to do different work projects, however it does not afford those opportunities to those lacking experience in specific jobs, therefore not a great place for growth.Develop recruitment strategies and an enrollment plan with the investigator and site staff to meet recruitment goals in coordination with the Global Monitoring Plan project recruitment plan and conducts evaluation, initiation, routine monitoring and close out visits at each assigned study site, as outlined in the Global Monitoring Plan.Decent pay scale, benes, and bonus opportunity in management.  The lab business unit has always been chaotic without enough applied vision.  Clients generally allowed to dictate timelines.  A lot of good people on staff, but burnout is a significant problem.  The merger with Quest Clinical Labs brings potential for significant change, but uncertainty ahead, especially for redundant resource bases.Quintiles is a great place to work.Competitive wages.Competitive insurance.Many opportunities for upward mobility.Quintiles provides a stable environment within an evolving and changing market.Quintiles is a great company to work for ten years. Excellentsalary with benefits including gas card, car allowance as thejob requires travelling to physician offices in Greater Philadelphia.Team spirit and positive environment. Leadership encouraged.Job security is a plus if you make it to permanent employee, but temps are hired and fired with reckless abandon. Very little mobility in the company that isn't predetermined. Management is toxic and underhanded, with almost no transparency and a lot of ""because I said so"" reasoning that has no place in the work environment.If one makes permanent employee, be prepared to have drastically increased responsibilities over time with little to no increase in pay as a result. Low starting pay, and doesn't even increase to stay competitive with inflation.Strong background in project management, technical training, and support. Ability to balance complexity and partner with all levels within a multi-national environment. Analytical, articulate, and diligent.Management treated employees with respect and listened to ideas from the field.  They truly cared about the individual as well as the companies bottom line.Its like home, like a family you never want to leave.  I am only a temporary associate who works on the Medicaid team.  I am stationed at my own desk, with very little micro managing. Self starter and goal oriented, to get the job done.technology. work flexible.(telecommute). Client visits. Vendor services.Great name in information industry, new tools and products.largest vendor industry.Very good company to work for. The employees work very well together in getting the projects done on time with a very hard working teaming atmosphere.Good company to work for. There are several opportunities to learn and grow. The staff is very knowledgeable and willing to help. There are many opportunities for your hard work to be recognized.I loved working with Quintiles. A very diverse place to work with good benefits. Salary was good, and the employee gym.  Everyone was excited to work for this companyWorking at Quintiles was a great experience.  They take care of their employees and help them further their careers by offering opportunities to grow and advancement.They are slow to promote but very understanding with life events and giving a good balance of work to family life. Depending on your role you work at your own pace to produce results.Pros: Work/life balance, benefits, vacation, and compensation. Cons: High turn over rate within engineering department.  Uncertainty with senior level management.I was working on Special Projects that would bring a new product to the marketplace based on the results.  1000 people were involved in this study.","10,000+",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/0b624c58-0c87-4b47-9ff6-44b7f9545033?mescoid=1500153001001&jobPosition=21,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

467,468.0,Statistician Assistant,UCSF Medical Center,4.3,179.0,"Nurses are overworked. Needs updating. Hospital seems to be lacking funds to update facilities.Good place to work and obtain experience in specialties/fields.Great benefits, union benefits. Con no encouragement/chance for educational advancementFast paced, extremely busy work environment.  Great co-workers and friendly staff.  Great benefits package.  UCSF encourages growth and provides additional training when identified.As the second largest employer in the City, UCSF is made up of a diverse group of people. Many of my colleagues were a joy to work with, despite the fact that there was an almost unanimous feeling of being over-worked. The organization seems unnecessarily top heavy, with many layers of management, and I rarely felt supported by my superiors, either when I needed direction or when I felt overburdened by the number and variety of job requests.As a teaching institution, it is interesting to see many new developments implemented at the facility each day which keeps the employees on their toes with enhancing their knowledge. The management practices servant leadership, however, is often unsuccessful with carrying out such measures due to union contracts.  Co workers are great with collaboration of ideas and patient care techniques during difficult assignments.  The hardest part of the job is portraying efficiency at bedside while juggling a heavy assignment during short staffing.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that one gets to gain valuable knowledge every day via new patient care interventions and research conducted and published by the facility.This is a great place to work if you are looking for stability or have a family.  It is not a great place to work if you are needing to be challenge or need to be stimulated beyond your daily duties.  Opportunity for growth is very hard, you really have to go outside of your department in order to grow.I worked hard at my job for many years, Advancing at a great pace. We had a unique work environment, and we all got along quite well.i learned a bit of mainframe computing, I learned billing, collecting, NIH money and private funds processing.  I even negotiated some accounts with vendors. I learned even more medical terminology than I ever thought possible,The hardest part of the job was political, and why I left to go to graduate school. The head of our lab retired, and the management was never the same.I loved working at UC. It is a great place to work if you find your niche.UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland provides exceptional primary and sub-specialty care as well as access to cutting edge clinical research to a diverse patient population.There is great flexibility and buy-in from the clinical staff to conduct innovative clinical trials here due in large part to the fact that CHO is at heart a small hospital. The downside is that the bureaucracy is not  designed to support the research effort so roadblocks to hiring and financial management are frustrating.Working at the UCSF Campus was an amazing experience. It is a research hospital and they offer millions or opportunities to learn new skills and growth opportunities. San Francisco is a very diverse city and working at UCSF you are given the opportunity to learn about other cultures and their life practices. Management was well organized and informative. The hardest part of the job was being on-hand and witnessing Code Blue patients and their families.The  most enjoyable part of the job was learning and experiencing implementation of new methods, medications, and practices.The money is consistent, the people work hard at this outfit. The managers that I have worked for are really good, and they are very knowledgeable about procedures at hospital protocols* An overall great medical center to work for* Employees are great but not alwayscompensated for their effort* A great retirment plan* Has a lot of classes on line or in personEveryone in the departments extended their knowledge, thorough in the details of all assignments, very busy departments, heavy data entry, specimen cataloging, and filing.Overall, a great environment to spend 8hrs of your day.  Also, you got to have a strong stomach...you are surrounded by ""specimens""...sliced brains and other body parts.  Some of the research you do involves very graphic pictures of medical condition, it can be shocker.Excellent teaching hospital with a homey atmosphere for the children. Every employee takes pride in working at CHO, and professionals working together to take care of these special patients. Friendly co-workers make this teamwork gratifying. Very low turnover rate of employees, which tells you what a good place this is to work. Excellent benefits. The physical plant is old and there is a shortage of space, though work has begun on building a new hospital.There is no such thing as a typical day; every patient is different. Healthy mix of outpatients and inpatients. I have learned to improve my skills courtesy of my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the pediatric patients; it is fun seeing children all day, and fulfilling to help them through what can be a difficult experience. The hardest part of the job is dealing with moribund patients and witnessing the pain of patient's parents.just your typical work food place, serving, preparing, cleaning your station when sold out or done for the day, handling customers orders and modified orders. very fast pace during peak hours,  but management picks on you if you are young. other employees give you a hard time for the same reason.U.C.S.F. Pediatrics Benioff Hospital was the most enjoyable and rewarding place I have ever worked.  Very busy environment but organized with happy co workers/employees.  Everyone, from different professions, work together.  I was a happy employee because of the benefits, compensation, and the appreciation shown by management.Everyone I encountered was kind and loved their work. Staff are all supportive of each other and myself. The work was good and rewarding, and I enjoyed my time there. I learned many skills from juggling multiple projects at once, to valuable life skills, and many office skills that I hope to be able to utilize in a future job.UCSF gave me and opportunity to learn and grown within my family as well as within the world.I was given a chance to lean with ucsf and was able to take life by the bootstraps, I absolutely loved my time with ucsf, I would love to stay but san Francisco and the high rents are more of the issue.Working here is great, however, management needs to learn how to treat their employees better. The job is not easy, but it is rewarding. I enjoy helping patients.UCSF Medical Center is an exceptional place to work with good benefits. I work with Executives and Management that are very supportive and make work enjoyable.typical day is very simple.learned how to clean baby bed and clean pumps.management is very kind hearted.enjoyable part of the job is seeing the babies.This was a contract position to train staff in the use of new software.  Since it was in IT, the pay was extremely good, although as a contract employee, you aren't eligible for benefits.  My co-workers were probably 1/2 and 1/2 regarding a sense of professionalism and giving the best and most accurate information possible in the most professional manner possible.  There were both contract people on the project and UCSF employees.  The hardest thing was probably dealing with last minute changes and expectation that we weren't just flexible, but could indeed make the impossible happen.",,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-11-17T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/825d4e2a-b9ff-4ac3-a8ed-33c464d2fe79?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

This was frustrating. I learned how to wash dishes. hardest part was doing that all day.A typical day at Andiamo includes setting up section or bar (depending on position that day). Servers work on all opening duties such as: butters, waters, parmesan, salad dressing, snacks(during shows) and polishing their sections. Bartenders opening duties are making sure you have all the glassware you'll need, stocking your bar with beer, wine, and any liquor you may need and cutting fruit.I've learned a lot during my time at Andiamo, I've learned how to talk to people, bus trays, food services, even food preparation. Management is a little scattered sometimes, but overall they're a good team. My coworkers all stick together, like a family, and always have each others backs when we need it but like all families once in a while there is a bit of drama. The hardest part about the job is going long hours without a break or any chance of eating. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the coworkers and when working weddings making that event the best day of those peoples lives with no issues.great busy all day every day little time to spend with family re did work almost every day due to customers not making up there minds one client all the time no expansion in the companyIts a great place to work minus the benefits. You end time is questionable. The management is great and easy to get along with as long as you do your job.Its fun co workers are fun and cool to work with, very little managing going on.Super cool fine dining and theater.

535,536.0,Research Scientist - Machine Intelligence,Siemens,4.1,4200.0,"at siemens the training is great the employees are friendly and there is no limit to how much you can make in terms of uncapped commissionsThe job and responsibilities were changing from hard copy to electronic.  This was challenging and gave me a pride of satisfaction after learning the tasks.  Enjoyed being a team player and working with management.  The most challenging part was the constant changing of the software and testing until the application worked correctly.  The most enjoyable part of my joy was the contact with the employees that I had to interact with in my job.Company went through many C-level management changes in the 6 years I was there.  It eventually resulted in the loss of the biggest federal contract the division had- Siemens has a wide range of products.- Siemens invests a lot of billions to develop the employees.- The team is helpful and hard workers.- The internal competition is very st rong.I was an intern at the company during a summer. Overall it was a great experience, the staff was friendly, the pay and international benefits were great.Siemens is a great company with great vision. They are career oriented and certainly are forward looking. They take a great deal of pride in producing products that improve the world.Great company to work for had safety lunches every week we were safe cared for there employees and treated me good vary professional people and companyLearned a lot quickly.  There was a mix of contractors and employees and everyone got alone.   Siemens acquired Acuson and things started to change.it was a great company to work for I learned a lot from this company and it was good pay and also good people to be around would like to work for the company long term. they teach you everything you need to knowits very nice to work in this company it has a very nice management and they pay good and it has a very good benefits.they also giving a seminar for some employees every year.This was a stable work environment. This why I work there I work there for 26 years. My only for leaving is that my retire came too early. This was challenging work it involved installing intricate medical machines in Hospitals around the world.I benefited greatly during my time at Siemens. I learn a lot about my trade and how to manage it. They also gave me the opportunity to start a management career.Held positions of responsibility ranging from Manufacturing, Procurement, Planning, and Logistics for rapidly growing company specializing in the Oil, Gas, and Mining related industryThe job is fine, the work is fine, for the most part, the people are fine (if you can tolerate the nepotism) but dealing with the local management is the bad.Responsible for all customer owned product that is sent to the repair facility.Manages tool room for production to receive all direct material to facilitate repairs. Manages 40 million dollars of direct material14 direct reportsSiemens is a great company and rewards accomplishment and proactively supports employee development. Encourages and celebrates individual success and shared goals.I went to Siemens as a contractor and was offered the chance to work full time for them. It was the best decision I made. The pay was awesome! The benefits were great! Especially wonderful were summer hours and telecommuting. Couldn't ask for anything better. Negatives - I had a new boss every year. Reviews were harder and harder every year with near impossible goals.I thoroughly enjoyed working at Siemens, however there are too many chiefs and not enough indians. No one was ever on the same page and there was always confusion.Here at Siemens I have many roles. They give their employees the chance to advance which is great. Compensation and benefits are amazing. My co workers make my job easier.I worked up ther for a month in the electrical division syarcuse ny office. Im a field service gen/engine tech. Was promised a vehicle  with gas card before I started. That never happened. I was doing service work from my own vehicle. I also could have hired a secretary  on my behalf. Way to much paper work. 12 Pages of paper work for a pm. Crazy. There system is awfull. Benifits are good but u paying for.  Money was not worth the hassle.  Great supiv. Loved him was not his fault. Also to much back stabbing going on. I quit and moved on.  Think about going to work in the generation division for this company.  Thank you.An excellent workplace where I have been educated further in my Equipment Finance and portfolio management career. Once a division with an increasing portfolio willing to bid and finance various types of industries and transactions, SFS is shortening its vision of what to finance, limiting it more to Siemens related products and industries.","10,000+",San-Francisco,Berkeley,CA,2016-11-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/1d4b8dfc-62fd-4970-b171-9b7760ce519c?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=21,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

578,579.0,"Medical Science Liaison, Facial Aesthetics- Northern California","Allergan, Inc.",3.8,469.0,"The people here are wonderful to work with. I wish the company was a little less old fashioned and would allow telecommuting.Allergan is the result of mergers and acquisitions and as such comes changes and job uncertainty. As with all changes come some good management and some arrogant management, with the latter a reason for good people not to stay. When you hear the peers of the bad manager even criticizes them it make you wonder why they are kept on in the first place.Allergan is a strong company that has always had a great culture.  The work/life balance is good.  The benefits and good, but have been slipping over the last few years.  Following the merger with Actavis, the company has been overly focused on mergers and acquisitions and less concerned about research and growing existing product lines.As far as warehouses are concerned, this was a laid back place to work but we also took our jobs very seriously. Management was great and co-workers worked hard.I worked there for over 5 years before the location shut down due to lack of work, combined with other reasons. I really did enjoy the responsibility that the job required.selling devices, aesthetics and pharmaceuticals for a top notch fortune 500 leader. innovative and growth pharma on the frontier.  Selling to physicians, hospitals and group purchasing organizations and having the ability to negotiate contracts is a must.  you need to be driven and a leader. Management qualitiesAllergan is an awesome company to work for. You get surprise rewards and days off. Our Sr. Site Director has an open door policy. She listens and is really great. The company is understanding to life events and changes. We have a Monday thru Friday schedule only and get all respected holidays off with pay. You couldn't ask for more than that.Allergan is a forward thinking company that considers its employees as an asset to its success. Great management teams and benefits. A global technology leader and is on the cutting edge of science and technology. They have great benefits and a strong team environment.Great teamwork environment. manageable travel requirements. Supervisors encourage autonomy.Excellent training for me as a new position in the role of MSL in a new division.Excellent small immediate team with great extensions.Hardest part of the job was back to back conferences is multiple cities.Best part of the job fostered independence with weekly conferences with supervisor.I was given opportunities to learn different trades. I worked with different people. I enjoyed getting to know about different departments. My supervisor was always there if I had any questions and gave positive feedback and constructive criticism.After the Actavis merger and Allergan purchase, there was a rapid change in management  ( three managers in three years) that created a very challenging and strange work enviroment.Allergan is a nice company to work for that offers many opportunities with great benefits.  The Orange County campus has amazing talent. Work hours are flexible for most positions.Good place to work. Positive and friendly atmosphere. Can play basketball at lunch or go to the company cafeteria. Free gym for Allergan employees and secure parking with several ports for electric cars.Good culture with good leadership. Work life balance is not as good. Hard working people with a good compensation package. The opportunity for advancement is good since there are many divisions.I am grateful for the years at KMGL for teaching me how to be a hungry salesperson working for 100% commission.  My co-workers were fantastic and helped me to further grow in sales.  However, it is difficult to endorse a company that gives so little support and compensation to their sales staff.A tyical day at work begins with assessment of what previous shift had done and what is priority at the moment according to management business interest for the day.Team work are highly examplify in the way the process is arranged. No one person can run the process from start to finish. You need one or two people to verify part of the work you have done.The hardest part of the job is that some of the equipment in use is highly complex.Whenever target is met brings moment of celebration. This is my joyous moment.The people I work with throughout the US and even globally have been a real pleasure.  People are responsive and it's been a real team effort that's really hard to find these days.My only complaint is that the company is changing rapidly and there's really not a feeling of stability.  The buying and selling of assets is constant and at the highest level everyone else is just a number.  Once you get down to the director level and below it's the greatest of experiences, but the CEO only has corporate interests in mind.You can be relocated and happy you survived the most recent merger and then let go six months later in the next deal of a lifetime.Allergan is a terrific company with regards to the neuroscience division.  Botox is a tremendous product for their therapeutic indications, more specifically Chronic Migraine.  The direction of the company has become much more focused over the last 15 years.  Allergan is a wonderful company to work for, where I have developed great relations with many individuals.  Calling on key injectors in multiple cities.  The expectations from Allergan management is 6.5 call per day, which I exceeded.I learned how to evaluate situations which included; Sales data, understanding the color profiles of each office to effectively communicate with specific offices/individuals and forecasting sales results.My co-workers have been wonderful.  I have developed many lasting relationships with many individuals.The most difficult part of the job is at times, excessive administrative work with a short turnaround.  I enjoy selling Botox because of the benefits to patients, and listening to patients who rave about life changing results based on their therapyThe work is very easy an 3rd grader can do it, but the work environment and management is extremely poor. One the worst company's I have ever worked for. If one manager doesn't likes you the rest doesn't either, you never get off at shift end time. The worker's most of them are lazy and they don't do anything about it. They just had two lay offs and the last year and a half if you have standards do not apply for this company. The hiring manager feed you a bunch of lies to make you think it's a great company to only be hired and find out it was all lies!  Only great thing this company has to offer is health insurance.It's awful to see and hear from others how poor or non existent the culture is at this place.  Management (including Jr/Sr/Executive) is so poor due to the fact the CO only wants to save a buck by putting inexperienced and bewildered people in place just to follow orders like clowns and repeat their superiors like parrots.  It's a good place to stay away from!Great working environment.  Really good people who act very professional.  The only problem is that most of the jobs available are only contigient so the only benefits are what you get from the temp agency.Good leadership and co workers, also great benefits and time off. Also, great job to help start a career in pharmaceuticals.","10,000+",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-10-12T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/3cbc14aa-1c45-4d85-9e33-28ab671b09e4?mescoid=1900254001001&jobPosition=29,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

608,609.0,Geologist II,AECOM Technology,3.7,1900.0,"Work with analyzing data, writing reports, developing monitoring plans, and managing technicians in the field. Co-workers are all very friendly.My day consisted of various laboratory tasks as assigned to include work with an AA machine, wastewater BODs, and oil and grease assessment of samples. I was also tasked with maintaining inventory and ordering supplies as needed.Good company and people,nice atmosphere, flexible on start and end times. There are many online training platforms, just need more practical application and direction for the long term. Benefits are decent, just raised rates.I worked for AECOM twice. When they found out they were losing the contract they force the people who had insurance to take their insurance and it was high. The second time they came in with their gonna make things better bull and they allowed the wrong things to still happen.Regular work day was great, learned how to navigate oracle system, managers easy to work with. nothing hard to learn at AECOM, just coming to work was the enjoyable part and talking to co-workers.Fantastic atmosphere with friendly,professional, and safe teammates. Typical work day is an eight hour day with expected PM procedures, and few trouble calls. Great opportunity for advancement within the company as long the individual is willing to relocate. Training is always available.Tried to do the best I could with little training. Management was puppet to the host company and would throw us under the bus to make themselves look better.Ive been with the company for eight years and overall they are a great company but there is no advancement within the company. Management needs to improve.its good pay but the workload is crazy. They don't show employees no appreciation for the work we do. The benefits are good. Its really no room for growth.Employee morale at a all time low. No advancement or stability. Play favorites with employees. Does not acknowledge loyalty.Projects were varied; travel opportunity was excellent. Supervisors were fair and provided training when necessary. I enjoyed the experience.AECOM has some amazingly passionate employees that I felt honored to call my coworkers. Talent in abundance, humble and true professionals. The teams really go above and beyond with their dedication.Friendly atmosphere and good team experience. Good work culture and enjoyed working with management and friendly co-workers. Enjoyed extra-curricular events and celebrations.Outstanding opportunities with AECOM. a globally recognized corporation with LOTS of opportunities for personal and professional growthAll the folks who run the maintenance desk are the same people who ran it in the Navy. So, in most cases, you've got the same types of problems.The company offer a variety of benefits and paid above average compensation.  The costs were average in the industry.  There is constant change coming from Corporate leadership which resulted in a stressful work environment.  No work/life balance due to long hours.A very large company and as such, don't get the feel that the company really cares about you as an individual. I spent over 2+ years at a job site before I actually met an AECOM Chief or overall discipline manager or higher.I began my career here and all the people have been friendly and I have learned and grown a lot in my career and as a person.  I have enjoyed my time with AECOM but feel I am wanting to grow more and they do not have the position I am looking for and I have a lot of motivation and drive and I am stuck now in my career.Worked with the legacy company Washington group and URS.  Once aecom took over the feel of a big company set in.  Soon it was evident all the company cared about is their bottom line.  Absolutely no thought given about their employees unless it somehow benefits the company.Benefits are a thing of the past for this company. Health insurance benefits are doubling in price and the coverage is going down. Look to spend 20-30% of your salary for health coverage. In 2017 you will be penalized for having a working spouse on your insurance plan.typical day went by kind of fast due to busy work and trying to not be fired. come in, get situated, grab tools and go out to the flight line. launch jet, recover jet, inspect jet.",201 to 500,San-Francisco,Oakland,CA,2016-09-14T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/0b1bce2a-d2c9-4820-aeca-5c576c272b85?mescoid=1900265001001&jobPosition=24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

610,611.0,Scientist 1,Arcadis,3.6,101.0,"I love the people I work with. Aggressive billable hours goals can be tough to get used to if you haven't worked as a consultant before.Was an acquired firm but was a great place to work! Great people and culture with room for advancement. Wished the company was able to maintain the workforce.Strong global company with the desire to do great things. First part of the climb was, to pay off all senior staff to leave the company and hire Collage students. Effects, the company lost clients and senior knowledge. Next up was to hold back and stop yearly merit increases... when moral was already low from previous actions, it just dipped lower. Each deparment has their own personnel challenges. No company is going to give their money away, but this one will try to give up as little as possible on it's staff, even if you do more than expected (above and bound).Flexible work schedule, Great people, but stability and advancement opportunities are poor. For similar role with a competitor, the salary is low as well.Ok, very large company with many offices and international locations. Felt too large and impersonal. Okay place to start careerPoor company to work with.  I was with the firm for many, many years and it has gone down hill since the merger with Malcolm Pirnie.  The merger was poorly managed, the leadership team let the smaller purchased company come in and change how a well managed company was run and it FAILED.  Morale in most offices is very bad, there is no loyalty, management talks of a ""transformation plan"" that has falsified KPI's.  Bonuses have gone down, down, down every year since the merger with Malcolm Pirnie.  The hires they make into leadership and business development roles are very poorly vetted, business revenue is not improving year after year.  I think this company needs to start from scratch and get back to basics and should start by getting rid of all of the Malcolm Pirnie employees still left in the firm.The pay and benefits have been great, but the hours are terrible.  I have no time for life outside of work.  Management seems to want to help you succeed, and will pay for any continued educationAfter 23 years of my service, Arcadis fired me while I was out on disability recovering from my liver transplant. They then started to force out any senior members who had 20+ years of experience. This was a cost saving measure to purge all the high end salaries. Many of the furloughed employees were from the original G & M firm who helped Arcadis grow from 10,000 to over 55,000 people. We in the Southeast provided most of the revenues to finance their expansion. We were rewarded with pink slips. My advice is to join the company for experience and leave for a better job as soon as you can. Loyalty is not a word in the Arcadis vocabulary.My overall experience has been good. I like what I do, and where I do it, I love the fact that I serve a purpose to the American public. Management has been very helpful in helping to adjust to the different areas and scope of work. The hardest part about this job is the travel. I loved it at first. Now I just need to be at home more with my family. My co-workers have all on the most part been one of the best parts to my job. Most of them are in the same boat as I. This make relationships easy to relate to.great opportunity to learn and for professional development,  My co-workers are team spirited and work well together.The position was not advertised as the actual position required. My expertise was in Project Accounting, not Governmental Contract Accounting.Huge turnover. Management is horrible with money, so they are constantly looking for younger people who will do the same work for a fraction of a good wage. Laid off after thirty years of loyalty and hard work because their poor work can't maintain clients. It used to be a good company but they fired all of the people who made the company work. Good luck in this shrinking industry.(This is my experience from someone who has had multiple years of field work with ARCADIS)Typical engineering company. Nothing very special about the way it treats its employees. Promotes a culture of self promotion and not actual hard work to move up the chain. Good way to start a career but I would not recommend staying with this company once you have experience. Some people get lucky and find a nice niche but they can get eliminated after a few years depending on how bad the company is doing.Horrible communication between office staff and field staff. Never got to a job site where the ARCADIS office staff came up with an efficient and common sense plan. There is no emphasis on field-office staff communication. Probably would save millions of dollars for ARCADIS-US if they did. That is no exaggeration I personally have seen hundreds of thousands of dollars of waste because of this lack of communication. The communication problem is also exacerbated by the current policy of ARCADIS to hire the youngest and cheapest  employees to do the field work.There is some positives though. Can work with some experienced people that have stayed with the company and actually learn a few things. Currently ARCADIS is on a rampage to get rid of experienced people though. There is no guarantee of having a job from year to year and it will try and use you for every dollar that it gives you. I would view ARCADIS as a good place to get training and that's it.Like I said earlier get experience and then get out.- Work for this company for 8 yrs since I was 19.- Company is willing to teach and groom new trainees- Friendly co-workers- Not doing redundant work every week- Hardest part about the job was learning new, tedious, and critical work that needed to be completed as soon as possible. - The most enjoyable part about the job was learning new and intense work on a daily basis.Communication is very poor. As a new employee the burden is shifted to me to figure out what projects I'm on or I am notified less than a day before that I'm on a job. We're supposed to have project meetings which I'm never involved in, but am expected to know what was discussed. Finally, the way expense reporting and billable hours work is horrible. Lets just say that if I work over 40 hours, but 8 of those hours were to overhead and not a project well I just wont get paid for those 8 hours. At least they are flexible with career paths and letting you decide what type of work you'd like to learn.Good breadth of projects. The company has a global perspective. Lot of opportunity for collaboration on firm wide level. Focused on few sectors.Where to begin? From the beginning a lot of promises were said but never followed up on. Me and fellow colleagues helped build up a new process for a project we were collaborating on globally and were literally used and abused. Once the project was completed management dropped our hours from 50% for example and expect people to stay busy of be threatened with layoff. A lot of blackmailing goes on if you are not of the big boys club or one of their favorites. A lot of favoritism occurs and management likes to speak to people like dirt. Also they expect you to work 10 hours without an outside social life. They also treat women like its 1950. If you are married and have children they make you feel guilty about having to leave work after 8 hours. It is like working on a slave ship for very low pay, I would avoid this company by all means.A typical work day is continually putting out fires.  I rarely knew in the morning what I would be working on in the afternoon, but I always knew I would be busy.Ever since the company became publicly traded on the stock market job security and morale plummeted.I didn't get the chance to work at Arcadis long, but I enjoyed the time  I did spend there! Great management and staff! This is a company that really cares about their employees.I enjoyed working with the Project Managers from all over the US and Canada as well as Brazil, Chile, & Peru.  I enjoyed the challenges of the larger projects.I learned the practices and procedures of accountingYou'll feel like a little fish in a big boy club world. Employees work extra hard, just to obtain a 1.5-2.5% raise..........","5,001 to 10,000",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-08-26T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/56c758b0-f678-46d3-8e68-61fbecf9d37d?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=26,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

686,687.0,Senior Analytics Development Engineer,Teradata,3.9,82.0,"I am new to this company for 1 week, too early to judge this company.  Will let you know few months later.The Teradata company is a very mature company.A job that provides opportunity to learn, progress and contribute to the organization.A teamwork-oriented environment in a company that empowers employees to create and take initiatives.A job that my skills are utilized to the maximum and allows me to grow within the organization.I interned in Teradata during this summer and I felt very happy when I worked there because I got many nice colleagues and my manager and mentor are really nice.Teradata pays well and allows growth for their employees however Teradata is a company that has been around a long time and is not adapting well to change.Very fast pace company. generous with vacation days. Learned how to managed stress and to prioritize workload.  Good opportunities for advancement within the company.  Some departments need to some management to take management class to learn how to manage people.Worked on a newer cloud product and Management has zero vision.  Avoid if you want to save your sanity.  They have no visibility into cloud vs on-premise and are still, completely reliant on large physical hardware.Good job as a big data consultant. Work with other companies as clients and perform data analytics and data science. Work with teams of other data scientistsGood oprotunities to work in different industries with international teams. The best of breed product, the best technology, and so onThe company is good if you are okay to take challenges.Management Good.Co Workers GoodTypical Day at work - GoodGood Good Good Good Good Good GoodMy co-workers were always extremely competent and knowledge.  Teradata always encourages the consultants to maintain their skillsets and encourages great performance.Horrible company.  Ran like the old NCR company.  In real financial trouble.  Find work elsewhere.  Management is out of touch with the changes in the industry.  Very old school company.Teradata is a good company to work for. With the pre-sale announcement that they were going to sell off their marketing applications divisions, many sales motions came to a halt. Hopefully, the new owners will take the old Aprimo products in a good direction.There was a nice laid back IT officevibe. If you did your work well and showed up to work on time, there was a decent amount of flexibility. The company recently has experienced a reduction in force with lots of uncertainty ahead. Top level execs have received multimillion dollar bonuses/pay outs meanwhile throngs of low level employees even with years of service will receive paltry in comparison severance packages. I wouldn't recommend pursuing a position here during this transitionary time.Need upward mobility for senior security architects.  Co-workers are close knit team willing to share experience and problem solving.Teradata is wonderful place to work with appropriate Job Work and life balance.overall job culture is best in industryI had a great experience working over there and people over there are very friendly and polite,the working atmosphere was awesomeGreat work life balance; Managers are very accommodating. need more diversity. The most enjoyable part is travelling to different states of the country.Engaging work with lots of opportunities to learn new skills. Employees are friendly and easy to work with. Enjoyable atmosphere.I was lucky.  At the right place at the right time.  My experience at Teradata was nothing shot of a great American story.  My experience demonstrates what can happen when a company looks at an individuals skills from a personal prespective and evaluates what that person could accomplish when given the proper opportunites.Enjoyed the people I worked for and with.  Typical business with good and not so good situations you deal with over 25 years.Most of the employees at Teradata did not have the appropriate computer educations to be working for this company.  It seemed as if they hired MBAs and tried to turn them into Technical Consultants or Watchdogs;  Upper management seemed OK, middle management was unprofessional to say the least and in my opinion a great reason for the downfall of this company.  There was ZERO logical reason for this downfall other than recruiting people with appropriate educational backgrounds and getting rid of DEAD WOOD long ago.It was an honor to work for this company.  Unfortunately, the place is ridden with unqualified employees who know nothing about computers and do not have any genuine interest in Teradatas products.  Managers were more like just money/recruiter people.","5,001 to 10,000",San-Francisco,San Carlos,CA,2016-09-16T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/37989609-3096-4c83-a678-d8ec8854eb29?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=33,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
