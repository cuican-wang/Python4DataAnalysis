192,193.0,Data Scientist,Electronic Arts,3.9,257.0,"During my time at Electronic Arts I implemented multiple training programs and agent assistance training. I created and led multiple customer satisfaction improvement projects as well. While Electronic Arts is relatively new it the customer support industry, the lack of room for advancement was a hinderance.Really just not very good.  No room to move up and poor choices on the part of management.  Really more of a glorified babysitter.While I knew I couldn't work there for much longer than the summer because I am a full time student at LSU, it was a great experience working with colleagues to work hard and figure out the bugs in the builds. I learned how to manage my time, where to look for bugs, how to use TestRail and JIRA, tracking in X-Code, and communicating with my team and the developers.Provides good work/life balance. Competitive salary and benefits. Provides employees with multiple concierge services on campus.Great community outreach programs.The app is 4.5 stars in both the iOS App Store and the Google Play Game Store and proves that my coworkers are an amazingly talented group of people who are dedicated, passionate, and good at what they do.EA offers a very flexable work schedule. the work environment is very fun and very diverse. They are also a very laid back company to work for. i love EABig company with so much potential that is realized through large, well organized teams committed to making the best games they can.Prominent franchises are given time to develop with the backing of intelligence that explains where the industry is going.Working for Electronic Arts opened my eyes to the gaming community and I was able to talk to fellow players and help them with their jobs. Getting excited for up coming games and enjoying the atmosphere and fellow employees and team. With training that was provided helped me get my foot in the door, well done!The company moves very fast so you need to be okay with change and lot's of different ;challenges.  The people are amazing to work with and talented. Always fun but intense at the same time.  It's truly a relationship focused company.  I would recommend to anyone looking for a fun challenging environment to work in.Very enjoyable and productive day to day job envirroment, management is very people oriented co workers are very nice as well, they support your PMO deliveries.Not only do they create entertainment for millions of people, they took care of the people who help create games for those millions of people.This is not a job where you go in and play video games all day.  that is not your job!  Your job is to do things over and over again trying different things to try and make the game do something unexpected. If its to cause a crash, a soft lock, or a graphical glitch.Background designs were done daily. Loved the pace and challenge of the production and the people were great.I thought this was an amazing experience. I was given all the props of a great employee and really enjoyed it. Most people love it so this is not uncommon.Definitely a place for computer savvy, or technologically inclined workers. Gamers are treated with great respect and constantly motivated and rewarded.Learned about porting Unity to the unreleased 3DS. Worked on the huge Sims 3 franchise. Unfortunately the studio lost it's way and had to lay off almost the entire company.What once was a fun workplace with advancement opportunities has changed over the years to a rather stale office with little advancement opportunity. Management changes regularly and will often totally reverse old policies without notice. You're paid at a flat rate with no raises no matter how many contracts you return for.I highly enjoyed working for Walgreens. Only issue i had at the job was a bit strict of a manager. Other that than it was great. Only reason i left was for a job that paid more.It is a very nice place to work if you enjoy gaming and gamers. The atmosphere is very inviting. The area is very nice.Typically, I was in-game testing and reporting bugs with the software. Before new policies, I was the one who took notes for the Artworks department's sync meetings and disclosed them to the entire team (immediate area and partners in Canada included) via email. What I loved most was that I felt like I belonged there, like people valued the work I did and effort I gave.It was super cool to work here. You had set, paid, time to play video games. $.25 vending machines. Free games and merch all the time. Generally fun!One of my first jobs out of high school.  Had lots of friends that worked here.  Fun place to work but very high call volume and impatient customers, but I was always able to make them smile & laugh by the end of the call.",,San-Francisco,Redwood City,CA,2016-10-30T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/17ebdb37-e1c8-4a7d-acb1-18a19c87b43c?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=27,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
