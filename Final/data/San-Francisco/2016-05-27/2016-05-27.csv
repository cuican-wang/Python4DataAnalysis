149,150.0,Data Scientist,Luxe,4.0,7.0,"Great people to work with and I love to drive cars. Overall I had a very pleasant work experience. However, it is not a stable enough job, and room for growth.Great Company Overall. I loved working here and I hope others would to. I worked here for about two years it was the longest job i have had. Its a great first time job.I write this review as working for them as a ""contractor"" but we were treated like employee for the most part. We were able to choose our shifts in blocks such as 9-12 ect. However the Blocks were really inconvenient for all employees, and no wiggle room to fix your scheduled. You really do feel free to do what ever you like, but that might change after the W2 conversion. I have been with the company since they moved to Seattle and my need and openings were meaningless the them when they converted, so now I need to find something better. I will miss the ability to shop and play games while you what for work however.All around great place to work. The CEO is awesome and very understanding. I was able to meet lots of people and learn a lot during my time at Luxe.From meeting corporate brands, influencers, and Celebrities. I have been able create ambiances/events that will allow my brand to grow.loves my job here, i sucked at the being but picked up fast would still be there if not for my health problem of being out in the son for so many hours.full time or part time. was driver valet parking and I stopped by ley off. my company is good.",51 to 200,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-05-27T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/1dcce0c2-1558-465b-887e-9935b2556e9f?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
