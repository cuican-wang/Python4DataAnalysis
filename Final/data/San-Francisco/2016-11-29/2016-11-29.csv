76,77.0,Senior Data Scientist,Verizon,4.0,11400.0,"Constant tracking of percent to goals to ensure you hit your quotas. Fluctuating targets and metrics skew commission month to month. Fantastic benefits.Everyday at Verizon the job is a puzzle to figure out how best to serve the customer. Employees who are wholly committed to customer service in every aspect of their work life will persevere and do well. Verizon expects employees to be knowledgeable of and work towards marketing all of its products, all of the time. Sales are a huge part of the Verizon effort and all employees are expected to participate.I was so happy and pleased to work for such a prominent company as Verizon Wireless. The staff and co-workers were the best people I had ever met. I didn't mind going to work everyday because we had a pleasant, cohesive work environment. Everyone helped one another, which is the way it should be anyway. Their benefits were so right on time for employees-health benefits, tuition and promotions just to name a few good attributes. You just couldn't ask for a better work place.Verizon business in Highlands Ranch Colorado is not a fun place to work.  like going to work in a prison, the management all had delusions of granduer and were not very helpful.  They don't tell you this but, this segment used to be the Failed company MCI, your sitting around all day on the phone trying to sell IT.  The job would not be bad but management only cares for themselves and had inner circles that they would funnel leads to, their old colleagues from other firms.  It was actually comical how they acted and the culture was very low class and NOT conducive to career development and growthA typical day at work is fast paced , I've learned patience , and how to better people skills. My co workers  are awesome , and we work as a team and help each other  out . Not all management were always on the same page and it became some what unorganized at times . The hardest part was learning how to deal with escalated  customers . The most enjoyable art  were the people here and  incentives  to show appreciation for the employees.While working at Verizon, I used and learned multiple different sales techniques and each day was different. It was a very challenging work environment, due to the wide range of customer and accounts that I touched each day. As a solutions specialist, I was to analyze each account for possible savings and up-sells. Verizon prides themselves on customer satisfaction and we were to make each customer feel comfortable and valued, while making sure to meet all their needs. I enjoyed helping customers and pushing myself to meet the monthly requirements.To be plain and to the point . The turnover rate at this location is extremely Hugh. 1st clue- when you're outfought in for a panel interview , you are interviewed by the director of this call center. , 2nd clue Warch the facial clues and expression of the people that work on the call center floor. ( Morale is awful) The Director is smug and insulting (deliberate ). Especially when you have more call center experience then he. Not worth the money offered.Hourly and commission. Great benefits. Hours are your typical retail hours. Very numbers driven. Your managers make or break your job experience. Sales reps have too many responsibilities. You are also tech troubleshooting, customer service, we even have to handle inventory now. It can be very overwhelming and quota can be difficult to achieve with more unrelated responsibilities are stacking on.I answered customer calls regarding billing& account information, as well as cell plans and cell phone offerings.I learned Verizons' proprietary computer program, and also how to deal respectfully with customers.My co-workers were always willing to lend a hand or make suggestions about how the call could have gone better.The hardest part of my job was explaining why some customers cell reception was poor in mountainous areas.The best part of the job was talking to people from all over the states.Basically I talk to people all day about technology. As with any retail job you see all walks of life, some more difficult than others and some have no idea how to work their phone at all. Coworkers are great and fun to talk to between customers, management is very lax as long as sales goals are being hit. Pay is great for retail and it's allowed me to better my financial situation immensely.Challenging workplace with a steep learning curve, but a very exhilarating job.  Management was outstanding and co-workers on my team were second to none- with highest integrity.  Hardest part of the job was leaving it at work and the most enjoyable part of the job was enjoying my co-workers and my customers.  The relationships built with the customers over the years and helping them was the thrill I looked forward to each year.My current position is being moved to another location but the option to transfer is there with 10K in compensation to make the transition. You won't find compensation like this available at any other call center position. Job security is great and the management will work with you. unlike other call center jobs their centers are not revolving doors.This company treated us very well, including generous compensation and amazing benefits.  This is a company where the ""open-door"" policy is actually carried out and almost any person you meet is actually going to live out the company's credo.  Every supervisor/manager I ever talked to listen to me, treated me with respect and dignity, and was truly invested in my success and happiness as a person.  I am only leaving because my center is closing, but even with that they have given us 5 month notice, help with our resumes, job placement programs, and a guaranteed job with the company if we are willing to locate and a generous severance package.Lots of training and ongoing help through supervisor meetings, sales incentives, bonuses, opportunities for advancement. Very professional and supportive environment. Very clean. I enjoyed being able to help customers through professional and courteous interaction and listening skills. My work at Verizon was very enjoyable. Fun meetings. Great team to work with. Great benefits and cell phone discounts for employees.Typical day at work was taking calls most of the day. I learned that it can be very stressful in a call center. I also learned how to talk to people and react to certain situations. Learned deescalation techniques. Management wanted you to be successful. Co-workers were interesting to say the least. The hardest part of the job was dealing with intolerant customers with no common sense and making them happy. The most enjoyable part was the pay checks.I really enjoy it this particular company unfortunately at the time I have been there over a year and was still a contract worker and needed stability as an individual and that's the only reason why I chose to leave that company to be hired in as a full employee elsewhere.I remained neutral with all the constant daily changes and the nit picking from upper management. At first things would really get to me and I would take everything literally and personally and then I just became numb to it all.  Reported to work like a robot, did my job as best I could, Collected a paycheck at the end of the pay period, paid bills and the cycle repeated for a year.I really enjoyed the concept of this job, taking phone calls and having conversations with people to resolve their issues but they place their entire value of their employees on randomly generated surveys that for some reason seem to favor the few bad calls you'll get per day. Once you get a few negative surveys and your approval rating drops below 90% the management expects you to recover quickly or you may as well have a countdown on your head till terminationWhile working at Verizon Wireless, I was continually impressed with the continual training and options for career growth. I had no problem moving in whichever direction I wanted my career to go, especially due to the willingness of managers to assist and guide. It was also easy to work for an industry leading company in the wireless telecommunications field as the products and services are best in class.The actual job was very interesting and I was able to learn a lot from by experience.  My supervisor was very encouraged with my professionalism and ability to grasp the techniques needed to perform my job well.Great paying job if you work hard. The environment was very unprofessional and you had to rely on your own resources to be good at your job. management wasn't always there for you, they would encourage manipulation as a means to sale.","10,000+",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-11-29T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/0b973024-240f-48c6-8b57-cecc11cf06c4?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
