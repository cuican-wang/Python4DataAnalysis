433,434.0,Scientist II,Bristol Myers Squibb,4.2,533.0,"Great compensation and benefits; many terrific employeesOne of the reasons that I loved my job with BMS is that you did not always have the typical hum drum work day. There were times when something would happen that required all hands on deck. It was awesome to work in an environment that was truly Team inspired. Also it was an employee driven atmosphere. Our managers made sure that you were exposed to any and everything that would promote you to the next level!!!!Great company and staff. It taught me how to handle customers needs with special needs. I truly had a very strong connection with the managers and supervisors... I truly loved the company.I highly recommend this company to anyone lucky enough to work there. The management is very strong. I have learned a tremendous amount in this company. It does a very large amount of things right.The company is continuously evolving. I enjoy my job but feel as though my department may be losing head count and do not feel as secure as I have for the past 10 years.Excellent company culture and fostering of professional development.  Very pleased with the friendly, collegiate work environment.Follow SOP's, personnel at all level was well trained. Great, professional atmosphere. Job activities were well coordinated between the supervisor and the operators.I have enjoyed working at BMS, I find that the teamwork and collaboration is great.  We are all part of a team and help each other.  People don't hesitate to lend a hand when asked or to share their experience.  Overall it's been a great experience; it's just that professional development can be lacking.  In my current department, it is hard to find a way to grow and develop.BMS is a company with long-standing reputation on knowledge of brand science.  Excellent training department.  Pipeline is well diversify and has the team on place to have effective product launches.Long work days due to territory size.Great management team; encouraged to think outside the boxGreat counterparts on my team.Limited product lifeThe department tried to make all persons mix together and become friends because we work in the same area, but I think is much more better not to impose the mandatory friendship.In a typical day we should start at 8, work with the CRFs and so until 13 hrs going all together to have lunch and then back to work again from 14 to 17 hrs.I learnt to use online fax and to do community work.For me it's hard to say, I had the misfortune that on my days there some of the management were out of duty for pregnancy and working abroad, so I don't have an accurate view of the general management of the department.Most of my coworkers were nice hard working persons, but besides the work we didn't share common interests. That was the hardest part of the job to be friend with person I barely knew and with no common interests. The most enjoyable part of the job were the teleconferences, it was amazing working with persons all around the world trying to make the job done in time and with quality.Great place to work. Good work ethic, personal development, opportunity to learn and grow. Very good work life balance. Industry Comparable benefits.Making a difference in the lives of people Why must I provide additional information that is none of your business.  These mandatory field requirements are ridiculousA lot to learn, limited but precise guidance, continuous performance, great co-workers, team spirit, awesome inter location communication setup, easy communication with global teams, flexible schedule.As a Territory Business Manager at BMS, each employee is responsible for managing a territory and individually creating and strengthening customer relationships. Each day, the TBM devises a schedule to achieve maximum growth for the territory. The job encompasses cold calls, planned calls, and occasionally, dinner-time appointments. Although the job is generally solitary, communication with fellow colleagues is encouraged and necessary for success in this job. BMS encourages employees to be heavily engaged in their success, but also supportive of a positive work-life balance.At BMS, I learn the root cause analysis of the non conformance events and handling CAPAS. I expose to new technologies, aseptic filling using isolator technologies.i did not want to give review but indeed is forcing to do so , , i have no reason why would indeed do that , to conclude it is good place to work , atBMS is a great company to work for.  Excellent people and team environment.  I would highly recommend anyone to work here.BMS offers a great work/life balance by allowing flexibility to work from home.  Sometimes the hours can be long but the work is rewarding in itself by allowing patients to live long healthy lives.  I was working on contract so was not eligible to receive benefits.  Management is knowledgeable on the subject matter but could sometimes have better communication skills.  Job Culture is excellent at promoting diverse skilled workforce through equal opportunity employment.Science is great, company politics not so much. Good if you are in the ""favored"" group, if not, good luck getting promoted or even getting the hired help you were promised. New people who just joined allowed to hire over people who have been here for years. I stay here because I love the science, that's about it.I have worked here for over 10 years. In that time I have had many opportunities to learn new skills and have been promoted 4 times.  I enjoy the people I work with as we all share a vision of compassionate animal care while still completing important animal research.","10,000+",San-Francisco,Redwood City,CA,2016-10-16T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/81c7b3f5-f70b-458a-b65c-de8f574bd378?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
