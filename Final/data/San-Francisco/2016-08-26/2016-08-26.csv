610,611.0,Scientist 1,Arcadis,3.6,101.0,"I love the people I work with. Aggressive billable hours goals can be tough to get used to if you haven't worked as a consultant before.Was an acquired firm but was a great place to work! Great people and culture with room for advancement. Wished the company was able to maintain the workforce.Strong global company with the desire to do great things. First part of the climb was, to pay off all senior staff to leave the company and hire Collage students. Effects, the company lost clients and senior knowledge. Next up was to hold back and stop yearly merit increases... when moral was already low from previous actions, it just dipped lower. Each deparment has their own personnel challenges. No company is going to give their money away, but this one will try to give up as little as possible on it's staff, even if you do more than expected (above and bound).Flexible work schedule, Great people, but stability and advancement opportunities are poor. For similar role with a competitor, the salary is low as well.Ok, very large company with many offices and international locations. Felt too large and impersonal. Okay place to start careerPoor company to work with.  I was with the firm for many, many years and it has gone down hill since the merger with Malcolm Pirnie.  The merger was poorly managed, the leadership team let the smaller purchased company come in and change how a well managed company was run and it FAILED.  Morale in most offices is very bad, there is no loyalty, management talks of a ""transformation plan"" that has falsified KPI's.  Bonuses have gone down, down, down every year since the merger with Malcolm Pirnie.  The hires they make into leadership and business development roles are very poorly vetted, business revenue is not improving year after year.  I think this company needs to start from scratch and get back to basics and should start by getting rid of all of the Malcolm Pirnie employees still left in the firm.The pay and benefits have been great, but the hours are terrible.  I have no time for life outside of work.  Management seems to want to help you succeed, and will pay for any continued educationAfter 23 years of my service, Arcadis fired me while I was out on disability recovering from my liver transplant. They then started to force out any senior members who had 20+ years of experience. This was a cost saving measure to purge all the high end salaries. Many of the furloughed employees were from the original G & M firm who helped Arcadis grow from 10,000 to over 55,000 people. We in the Southeast provided most of the revenues to finance their expansion. We were rewarded with pink slips. My advice is to join the company for experience and leave for a better job as soon as you can. Loyalty is not a word in the Arcadis vocabulary.My overall experience has been good. I like what I do, and where I do it, I love the fact that I serve a purpose to the American public. Management has been very helpful in helping to adjust to the different areas and scope of work. The hardest part about this job is the travel. I loved it at first. Now I just need to be at home more with my family. My co-workers have all on the most part been one of the best parts to my job. Most of them are in the same boat as I. This make relationships easy to relate to.great opportunity to learn and for professional development,  My co-workers are team spirited and work well together.The position was not advertised as the actual position required. My expertise was in Project Accounting, not Governmental Contract Accounting.Huge turnover. Management is horrible with money, so they are constantly looking for younger people who will do the same work for a fraction of a good wage. Laid off after thirty years of loyalty and hard work because their poor work can't maintain clients. It used to be a good company but they fired all of the people who made the company work. Good luck in this shrinking industry.(This is my experience from someone who has had multiple years of field work with ARCADIS)Typical engineering company. Nothing very special about the way it treats its employees. Promotes a culture of self promotion and not actual hard work to move up the chain. Good way to start a career but I would not recommend staying with this company once you have experience. Some people get lucky and find a nice niche but they can get eliminated after a few years depending on how bad the company is doing.Horrible communication between office staff and field staff. Never got to a job site where the ARCADIS office staff came up with an efficient and common sense plan. There is no emphasis on field-office staff communication. Probably would save millions of dollars for ARCADIS-US if they did. That is no exaggeration I personally have seen hundreds of thousands of dollars of waste because of this lack of communication. The communication problem is also exacerbated by the current policy of ARCADIS to hire the youngest and cheapest  employees to do the field work.There is some positives though. Can work with some experienced people that have stayed with the company and actually learn a few things. Currently ARCADIS is on a rampage to get rid of experienced people though. There is no guarantee of having a job from year to year and it will try and use you for every dollar that it gives you. I would view ARCADIS as a good place to get training and that's it.Like I said earlier get experience and then get out.- Work for this company for 8 yrs since I was 19.- Company is willing to teach and groom new trainees- Friendly co-workers- Not doing redundant work every week- Hardest part about the job was learning new, tedious, and critical work that needed to be completed as soon as possible. - The most enjoyable part about the job was learning new and intense work on a daily basis.Communication is very poor. As a new employee the burden is shifted to me to figure out what projects I'm on or I am notified less than a day before that I'm on a job. We're supposed to have project meetings which I'm never involved in, but am expected to know what was discussed. Finally, the way expense reporting and billable hours work is horrible. Lets just say that if I work over 40 hours, but 8 of those hours were to overhead and not a project well I just wont get paid for those 8 hours. At least they are flexible with career paths and letting you decide what type of work you'd like to learn.Good breadth of projects. The company has a global perspective. Lot of opportunity for collaboration on firm wide level. Focused on few sectors.Where to begin? From the beginning a lot of promises were said but never followed up on. Me and fellow colleagues helped build up a new process for a project we were collaborating on globally and were literally used and abused. Once the project was completed management dropped our hours from 50% for example and expect people to stay busy of be threatened with layoff. A lot of blackmailing goes on if you are not of the big boys club or one of their favorites. A lot of favoritism occurs and management likes to speak to people like dirt. Also they expect you to work 10 hours without an outside social life. They also treat women like its 1950. If you are married and have children they make you feel guilty about having to leave work after 8 hours. It is like working on a slave ship for very low pay, I would avoid this company by all means.A typical work day is continually putting out fires.  I rarely knew in the morning what I would be working on in the afternoon, but I always knew I would be busy.Ever since the company became publicly traded on the stock market job security and morale plummeted.I didn't get the chance to work at Arcadis long, but I enjoyed the time  I did spend there! Great management and staff! This is a company that really cares about their employees.I enjoyed working with the Project Managers from all over the US and Canada as well as Brazil, Chile, & Peru.  I enjoyed the challenges of the larger projects.I learned the practices and procedures of accountingYou'll feel like a little fish in a big boy club world. Employees work extra hard, just to obtain a 1.5-2.5% raise..........","5,001 to 10,000",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-08-26T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/56c758b0-f678-46d3-8e68-61fbecf9d37d?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=26,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
