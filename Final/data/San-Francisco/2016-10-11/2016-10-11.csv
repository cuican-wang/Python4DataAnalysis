117,118.0,"Data Scientist, Market Strategy and Analytics","Williams-Sonoma, Inc.",3.8,801.0,"Day to day there is a lot to do and not enough time to do it. Most stores are short staffed because we have high expectations of who we want to hire. This job has taught me a lot and I know have a much better business acumen and a better understanding of the business overall. Management can be great some days and really tough the next. Criticism is not always constructive. My coworkers are actually quite great, we are a tight-knit group of friends at this point. Hardest part about my job is the hours worked. Most enjoyable part about my job is making a store beautiful and succeeding through my people.The training portion on this job was adequate at best.  The job itself is pretty easy, until it is not.  Meaning, as long as the customers questions are something  you know.... things are good.  However, the minute you need any assistance from a team lead, supervisor, etc...  things go downhill pretty quickly.  As you can imagine, when working at home, when you do need assistance it is pretty important.  I would be very hesitant in recommending any of my friends to apply for a job with Williams-Sonoma.  The employees, including team leads and supervisors, are all very nice.  There's just a lack of support when it is truly needed.During my typical workday, I am responsible to go through emails to make sure there are any updates on system issues the night before, credits cards not being able to process, orders not being filled because of a glitch in the system. Also any emails pertaining to any website issues. After the emails I begin to take calls from the associate and answer any questions they may have for the customer. I will also take calls from the associate if the customer has escalated.  Later in the afternoon I will go through the my emails answer any question the customer has sent me and and check my voicemail and do call backs.Williams Sonoma in Memphis/Olive Branch is a very difficult company to work for.  They are in the middle of changing upper management and the new regime is very young and inexperienced.  They are leading by threats and intimidation and always seeking to blame someone lower on any issues.  The moral is very low.  Williams Sonoma volume is 20% - 30% down in 2016, which will likely create more negativity in the coming year.A typical day at work is opening the building for the employees and ensuring that all systems are properly working for a productive day at work.  I have learned to resolve customer and employee concerns.  In management, I have learned all aspects of managing supervisors and associates.  There is nothing hard about the job when you give 110% of effort in completing all tasks and willing to learn other duties.  I truly enjoy working with the people while establishing a trustworthy relationship as this enhances their willingness to perform at a high level.Very high-stress job.  Emails come in non-stop - expect 200+ emails per day.  Very poor processes from top to bottom. Employees are not empowered at all - approvals are needed for nearly everything and if you don't have the proper approvals the process stops - even if it is an emergency.  Co-workers are great but executives either have no idea of how bad things are or don't care. Terrible corporate culture that produces high anxiety, resulting in very high turnover. The best part of the job was my co-workers.A typical at work, we load the delivery truck on Monday morning and we leave the same day to start making deliveries to customers and to the stores.I learned to resolve issues with customers, organize the available time to make all the deliveries on time, and assemble all types of home furniture.The hardest part of the job is to leave home all week and only spend the weekends with my family.I enjoy working under minimal supervision.Cheap labor don't be fooled!!!!! They advertise for management position but when you go in for the interview it's minimum wage and they offer seasonal because they want you to prove yourself! And probably lay you off after Christmas I can't believe they pay so little! I also went to pottery barn then realized this is owned by William Sonoma so I ran fast lolTraining is a month long, They don't teach you anything in that course except how to use the system. The trainer is very sarcastic and rude. The customers that call are rude and always upset about little things. I was a work from home agent and could never get in touch with management or a lead when I needed one for help. The pay is great for a Work from home agent, but you put up with a lot of Stuff so it is deserved. No insurance.I love working for them, they are good for seasonal positions , and the hours are excellent hours. Also they have great employee discounts, and depending on which store you work in your bound to meet famous people.Every morning if your early before your shift starts, you can enjoy your time in the break room, Clock in and turn on your assigned computer, and read email and depending the email you receive from preparing an order or put away orders that has been processed/   What i learn is that i learn to email back to sender and reply back properly and answer phone calls, and put away items to there designated location, The management is well organize and my co workers are exciting,fun, tons of energy, well mannered polite, respectful understanding,   The hardest is none and I enjoy the most is that twice a year theirs an event that the company challenges other company's for good cost and also the company has this outlet that the company sells item for  very low price.I would take call for customers wanting to place an order, or need help with and existing order. I learned so much at William-Sonoma on how to work two systems at a time. My co-workers were very nice everyone ones was there to help each other. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.If you like to take complaints then by all means work at Williams-Sonoma.  You will work from home and take very few orders but lots and lots of complaints.  The management is very hard to reach if you have a problem and I found simply calling another work at home agent the best solution for any problem.  Asking for days off is like requesting a pot of gold be delivered to your door.  It was a very bad experience and I am glad I do not work for them anymore.  Their computer is also antiquated and hard to work.Theirs a daily routine everyday. Very friendly environment .  people care about their job and very easy training. It is very useful. Everyone is willing to help to get the job done. Working there you will be happy to attend work everyday.Great place to work a lot of responsibility and fun while doing so .the furniture is very well made so you expect the delivery to be the same . Just not that much down time at home w friends and familytypical day consisted of impossible goals to reach,, unbearable work conditions, and mismanagement. co workers were typically ok, but mainly a younger class of employees. Hardest part was attempting to follow the directives of more than one person, and the extreme heat.I really enjoyed my time with this company. They really put quality products and customer service first. I had the opportunity work part as a manager in college which served as great experience later on.Overall - enjoyable place to work.Unrealistic expectations for floor set - expected to be completed during business hours.Upper management just cut a lot of store management jobs due to poor business performance.A typical day at work is smooth sailing, fun and  productive. Coworkers are very down to earth and everyday you learn something new from one of the managers. The hardest part of the job is being able to have thorough knowledge of all merchandise and services. Most enjoyable part of the job is gaining experience and learning about things and having access to a lot of people with great knowledge.I came in as a Full Service Associate, (C.S.R.) and in just 2 short months I was at the Command Center. Williams-Sonoma gave me the opportunity to learn new skills that include:-Troubleshooting our Work-From-Home Associates with their computer issues.-Reading 'Real Time' call volume.-Updating Associates schedules-Approving and Declining time off or overtime.-Sending hourly reports to Management.All these skills I did not have before I was hired at Williams-Sonoma.Experience at the store level is entirely based on the GM.  District Managers change to much to actually be able to accomplish anything.  People First atmosphere is not reflected in store level pay.",,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-10-11T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/93319ae8-c9ad-4650-86be-42ee7033a1b1?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

My co-workers were great, we had a softball league that we participated in.The hardest part of the job was when the company had to reduce staffing.Great benefits, great coworkers, and emphasis that all contribute to ""helping to made medicines""  which will in turn make a positive impact in the world. Emphasis on a ""healthy Pfizer"" - free flu shots for colleagues,  fitness center on site.Nice place to work. No work was ever too physically demanding and I worked with a lot of experienced and helpful individuals. I learned a lot about production while I worked here and would recommend it to just about anyway. The hardest thing about the job was just learning to get into a rhythm of checking everything  on the machine to make sure everything was running ok. I did enjoy everybody I worked with though.As a Life Science Lab Instrument Technician, the most rewarding accomplishment I did for Pfizer on a day-to-day basis was delivery my services to so many wonderful scientists when their equipment went down in the middle of an experiment. I would stop my world and come to their aid and restore the operation of their equipment right away. This, in turn, allowed them to deliver their work to their team. As always, they would thank me, being relieved from this dilemma with relief on their faces. My customers would send emails to my managers, thanking me for my support to their studies.Pfizer is a nice company to work for. I work with very nice people. We had some wonderful time together.

I learned how to read and write up the PID Board. The management and co-workers were okay they followed the rules and went by the guidelines. The hardest part of the job was Inspecting the products because the particulate can be very small. The most enjoyable part of the job was making unlimited overtime.Sometime we had easy days and other days were not so easy. I've learned to just be patient and just do the job as it is presented. Management was somewhat far. The co-workers was fun to work with at times. The hardest part about the job was when something happened you had to know what to do, but as time went by all the things that happened was second nature.
