114,115.0,Associate Data Scientist,EventBrite,3.3,3.0,"It's a reat place to work forhave great work life balanceFood and snaks are all good.nice and smart coworkers..........................Eventbrite was an admired brand in '08-'10 full of Stanford grads but many have since moved on and replaced by folks from dying brands like eBay and Twitter. Ticketing/e-commerce is now commoditized SAAS and the company's ""strategic"" projects has failed to deliver any differentiation. Both Product and Strategy teams have abandoned the marketplace mission as they struggle to make Eventbrite a destination page for event discovery. Instead the team executes multi-year efforts on refreshing the look and feel of the website to occupy time and without substantial metrics impact. The Engineering team moves at glacial speeds and mostly comes from other events-oriented SAAS companies (read: never worked at pedigree like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, etc). This breads an engineering culture that lacks real processes or documentation. The ""bench strength"" has never worked on large-scale services at aforementioned firms and thus many of its services/experiences have broken under larger loads. This lack of know-how also creates a fear of touching legacy code, building hack upon hack. Recent acquisitions have built off-shore engineering centers making it even harder to develop. With compensation well below market rate and and unknown equity value, more subpar talent is recruited.I loved my time at Eventbrite, I would love to go back to work there.  They have a contract with my staffing agency not to hire temps directly from themIt is a fab office with a focus on the individual, definitely not cubicle land.","501 to 1,000",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-10-13T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/cfd85f51-4e9d-4725-a5f6-c1395803d15e?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=18,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
115,116.0,"Senior Data Scientist, Search and Local",Zillow,3.9,29.0,"Zillow is a great place to call home. I worked for two years for this company as they kept buying the companies I was working for.Great culture and would encourage anyone to apply.Benefits are amazing, but there is not a lot of room to grow. Management does not try and help your personal growth and development.A Non-Sales Viewpoint:ZIllow has a great culture and is full of amazing and intelligent people.  If you want to work in a tech job with great work/life balance, amazing  benefits, while surrounded by smart people, you should work at Zillow.Hardest Part:  The technical challenges.  I think this should be the hardest part, because you aren't learning anything otherwise.Most Enjoyable:  Free lunches, co-workers, solving challenging problems.ps- The CEO is awesome, everyone loves him!!If you like competitive enviornments, sell or be fired, this company is for you. Jump in, and be ready for a cut-throat, dog eat dog world. The CEO is awesome!Amazing company to work for. Great hours with a fantastic work/ life balance. The people are amazing, everyone is friendly and actually happy to be at work.Trulia/Zillow was an amazing startup, with a great culture at first.As Zillow bought it and changed the dynamic, the culture started to resemble a corporate entity more.Many employees unhappy and made for a non positive atmosphere.  The benefits were by far the best of any company I have worked for.The job exposes you to a great company and bright co-workers and management. I do feel it is a bit of a treadmill type job. It's an open floor environment with heavy sales pressure. Its long days.It teaches and requires strong work ethic and thick skin.Job does have a high turn over and Zillow is OK with that because they are looking for the top 10% in sales. Any day could be your last. No big sense of job security.However, I do like the cheering and support from co-workers and the ability to learn from talented co-workers.This a perfect job for out of college but not necessarily a good long term job in inside sales. Burnout without a year.Pushes you to your daily limit. It's telemarketing and a stepping stone for something better.This is not the place for negative nellys or worry warts! If you are proned to doubt and fear, SALES in general is not a good fit.So There are some annoyingly competitive and negative ppl that work or have worked at zillow but they never last.The high turn over is due to the fact that at zillow you are given a lot of free and fun stuff but alot of work is required of you. If you have bad energy and hate to work hard this is not the job for you. The cream of the crop reps and management are awesome. Genuinely good ppl. Benefits are the best I have ever had and I have had GREAT benefits before. Also I love the entreprenuerial atmosphere and how you get paid large commission checks and bonuses for helping Agents make lots of money. I love getting calls from clients who follow protocol and cash big checks from zillow.Looking for a good career? Love Sales? Zillow is the a great option.Zillow is a great environment and company to work for. The CEO is always involved making it more personable and excited to work.Excellent work environment & culture.  Benefits are amazing with a fantastic management staff.  Your income is based on your abilities to operate your own business.Zillow is a company with an amazing culture that really knows how to reward and create incentive for its employees. Management is very good at what they do and help push you to new limits. The nature of inside sales however is very tough to say the least and incredibly challenging every day.If this is absolutely your last option take it.  Terrible managment, training and culture.  You'll see plenty of cool aid drinkers who review Zillow but frankly don't know any better. Do yourself a favor and keep looking.Move fast, make a lot of calls, culture is good, talented managment team,No strategic planningNo directionNo collaborationDiscouraged from seeking guidancesalary average, nice office, fun people.show me how many character is enough for me to be able to hit continue button. is this enough???great company but management and Hr are lack some professionilism. 80-100 cold calls dailyniche product, your only selling to real estate agents great trainingparty atmosphere, loudA typical day consists of at least 200 minutes of talk time and/or at least 200 dials to prospective Real Estate agents. Employees are encouraged to work 10-12 hours a day and stay until they either hit talk time or book deals to get to their quota. The training program is really full of information about real estate, salesforce, the Zillow Way, Realtors, etc. It is quite intense. The management is very performance focused, but (some) do what they can to help the employees succeed. The hardest part of the job is keeping high energy and a focused/good attitude dial after dial, especially when (and this is most often the case) the previous realtor just hung up on you. The best part of the job is seeing your agents have great success with the program.Zillow is a place where you are surrounded by intelligent motivated people and a great environment to come to work every day.  Zillow does not just pay lip service to the importance of culture and the management is continually looking for better ways to serve it's employees.  The best part of coming to work every day was knowing that I was selling something that would make a difference in the business of my customers and Zillow allowed me to run my business within the business.-Made a significant amount of calls to obtain new business-Over worked/ Under-paid-Management was not helpful in key situationsThe interview process with this company is really suspect in my opinion.  I come from a serious Real Estate Advertising background,  and this is what Zillow claims to do as a business,  but did not get a serious look.  Actually could have delivered large accounts to them with my expertise,  but just had the general human resources interview (which was the only good part about this company) and then a stock ""people more qualified"" rejection notice.  I do not know anyone more qualified then me for the sales position.  Stay away from this place.","1,001 to 5,000",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-10-13T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/4222f667-90c8-4a4e-ac3d-c073e7e18250?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=19,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I loved having multiple breaks in such a nice environment. This job just requires a great personality and the ability to listen.Outside in Florida is always a great environment. The management style is hands on and the crew really knew what they where doing. I learned all that I now know from them.A typical day at work involved a good mix of project work and proposal development. I learned a great deal about consulting, project management, and the proposal process.Co-workers were great.Hardest part of the job was working remotely.Most enjoyable part of the job was traveling and working at a work site.Atmosphere at ICF was fun and family oriented. I enjoyed the morning meetings every morning. Employees were able to use the gym for a monthly fee. Metro acessible.I enjoyed working with a team in which each member knew their purpose. People were generally helpful when I asked questions that pertained to my role and theirs.This is a great company to work for.  They have a great history and they take care of their employees.  They have a great track record as a reputable contractor in the DMV.The best ran company I've ever worked for and I will privileged to work there full time the moment a position arises.  I currently am a permanent on-call temp worker.Established a new satellite office requiring the creation of many new relationships and having to determine what was supported by main office and what needed to be created for the new location. The expectation is you work to get your job done and this may require 60-80 hours or it may require 40. Your success is based on your role, the tasks at hand, and you ability to delegate and or manage the assigned tasks. ICF is forward thinking and involved in many of societies ""Hot Topics"" across government and social responsibility.-Provide good training-Nice Supervisors-Nice work environment-Work  load balance is good-Not enough salary -You can ask for work from home after you complete one year at ICF        but you cannot ask for Monday and Friday-No more opportunities to move aheadICF was a great place to work. The staff is very friendly. The always had events for the office to participate in. They fed us a lot and parking was always there. They provide a shuttle to and from the metro as well.I worked full time hours for several months and was never offered full time benefits such as health insurance. There is a huge lack of communication between management and employees. I witnessed managers and supervisors disrespect and talk down to their employees and nothing was done about it.ICF is an industry leader in consulting. ICF provides excellent employee benefits and exciting job opportunities. With offices all over the world, ICF positions itself to be a global leader in consulting.Great clients to work for.  However not potential career growth.  Would have like to have taken on more advance skills / duties while employed with the companyWorking for this company one may feel like they are not part of the machine that keeps this company going. The culture within the company is ""do as you're told and do not go against the grain."" Entering work on a daily basis becomes a chore - basically coming to work to earn a paycheck and nothing more. Upper management consist of people who previously served in the military together and their attitude is to say ""yes"" to the site manager no matter what. Even though there is constant descension from the management team the workers on the floor make things better. There is no growth opportunity beyond team lead and unfortunately the pay has been cut drastically for any person the management team selects. If you are not a person to go with the flow and give a constant yes your time will be limited.My review is the same as my previous review of the company. Management staff is very non-supportive of lower level employees. There is no room for advancement unless close with upper management (based on friendships).Consistent, easy work for decent pay. Definitely keep to yourself and work hard and you could be promoted once ample time has passed.In the beginning of my career with ICF I thought it was a wonderful company, there is a a lot of room for advancement and learning of new systems and projects. I have learned so much working for ICF international.Awesome workplace. Great working. Company culture is good and people are flexible. Lot of work and good no. of hiring. Telecommuting is also there as an option.Not a bad job just got laid off and never wanted to go back due to all the shenanigans the work put me through. It wasn't all that bad but personally I don't like working in the heat due to how easily I over heat. I'm not seeking to go back there but its a good company1. Great coworkers2. Demanding schedule3. Managers need to be sensitive to employee needs4. Lack of guidance5.
