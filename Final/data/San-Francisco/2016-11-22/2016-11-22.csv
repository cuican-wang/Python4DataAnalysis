9,10.0,Associate Scientist III,Experis,3.8,301.0,"Good experience.  Professional and helpful.  Submitting time sheet is easy.  They have employee appreciation days.  They work well with you when you need time off.so many clients and productive work. Management is reachable and good to work with them.Average Compensation with Poor Benefits.No relocation allowances and no paid leaves.I have enjoyed working as a Financial Consultant for Experis.  I am their employee, and have all the benefits of a full time position, and can be choosy about the positions that I accept.I transferred to Experis to be able to get back to doing technical recruiting and have been able to do so. However, the staffing firm culture where recruiters are competing against each other even though they work for the same company and where there is little to no work/life balance has left me with an overall negative impression of the company and the staffing firm industry as a whole. This company clearly values quantity over quality which is not a fit for me.If you are not concerned with work/life balance and have no recruiting experience they will hire you instantly. However if you are a Senior Recruiter like me and value quality over quantity than this may not be the place for you.High stress with metrics and lots of changes. Pay cuts and layoffs and taking away of benefits really has left me angry and overall I'd give them a 3 or 4 star.This company is amazing. Excellent benefits, excellent recruitment. Worked with the Office 365 Ambassador Team and learned more than I could have imagined.Worked with many good people, unfortunately it was just a year long contract, and changes in the contract position made it no longer worth the compensation level.  I would recommend anyone seeking contract work to try them.I have learned the way that many Engineers work and how short term it is with their projects.  If you work smart and hard, you will earn the compensation you want and deserve.Leadership could be better, but generally colleagues and managers try employees well.  Decent work/life balance.  Great training program for new recruiters and leadership mostly tries to set people up for success. Benefits are great and base salary is awesome for no experience in the field.  Flexible work from home and lots of vacation.Flexible working hoursFlexible scheduling environmentGood salarydesirable work loadThis experience stretched me in the realm of customer service and supportSince Experis IT is a vendor for Microsoft Studios games division, there are many down times at the company which means important people are let go from their position with no other reason than, 'Your project is coming to a close and we don't have anywhere to move you.' This is understandable to get rid of the excess work force that had ramped up during project heavy times, but they get rid of cornerstones of the company on a regular basis. The direct management of the game testing company is pretty solid - they are approachable, helpful, and always open to feeback - be it good or bad. Experis management, outside of our facility, does not understand the gaming industry and bases peoples performance on their bug output, without taking anything else into consideration.The atmosphere at Experis is a very fun and laid back atmosphere. The people that tend to work there, though some of them are quite young, are almost always a joy to be around. Coworkers are what make this place into a fun environment (that and the testing of video games). The people that you directly work with and relationships that can form because of that are most enjoyable parts of the job.One of the hardest parts of the job is that we are almost never given any sort of design/requirements documentation. We must files issues and reverse engineer documentation based on the bug resolutions (Fixed, Won't Fix, By Design, External).Another tough part of the job is that the developers almost never hit their milestone acceptance dates which creates backed up work in a Waterfall environment. Constant  more... risk and mitigation planning is what gets us through the times when delivery dates are not met.A typical day at work for a QA Engineer contains but is not limited to:Running bug triage to appropriately prioritize bug fixesEngineering tasksMentoring testersWriting test specs and test cases for deliverablesReporting to partners for transparent coverage detailsExecution of tasks createdRisk assessmentClarifying or expounding on results of testingRegression testing  lessThe company is absolutely terrible. They will say that the position is ""temp to hire"" but it ends up not being that way. They will let people go for performance but honestly that is not the case. If the company you are contracted to gives a raise for some reason they will immediately start analyzing everything you do to look for a reason to get rid of you. They will give you no notice of when your contract will end, they will extend it without asking you, and they are very rude. They treat you like a number not like an employee. DO NOT go to work for Experis. They are absolutely terrible.Overall they got me into a great opportunity and the rest was up to me.  Got me an interview right away a job shortly after.  Even considered going back for better pay long term and new opportunities.I have worked with a lot of agencies and by far Experis is one of the best.  My recruiter checks in with me on a regular basis and addresses any problems or concerns I may have in an efficient manner.  I would recommend Experis to anyone looking to fill temporary roles.Great place to work.  Very professional and the benefits are good for a contractor/consultant position. I would recommend Experis to individuals that are looking for a consulting role.I was contacted twice by a recruiter between May and September of 2015, and accepted a position as an Office 365 concierge ambassador on a contract for 18 months. In December we were called to a meeting and told that there were a low volume of phone calls and everyone had to accept a reduction in our weekly hours, from 40 hours per week to 27.5 hours per week.  Then towards the middle of the month we started noticing people going ""status unknown"" in Skype for business, which we use to communicate. From working with a previous company, ""status unknown"" usually means a person is no longer working with the company. It was confirmed that the company was hiring a large number of new employees while firing older, higher paying technicians. The one and only reason given for termination was and continue to be, performance. Performance based on surveys from sometimes angry clients who are more upset with Microsoft than with the service providers, these surveys are based on a five star rating,  one to three are bottom boxes, four stars are also bottom boxes, I was told by a not so friendly manager,  and five stars are top boxes. If an agent gets a bottom box and the client writes a letter of appreciation to management, it doesn't matter because, ""Strive for the top box guys, that's what keep management happy""Technicians who have been working with Office 365 when it was called BPOS have been fired for not being able to provide the proper support, that's just wrong. Another company did the same thing with many of the same people, get certified people to secure a Microsoft contract,  more... then fire those people and hire less qualified techs to do the work for significantly less. I started in October, and in February I was called by two managers and told that my numbers are down and improving but not fast enough, in the weeks leading up to this, I requested two days off to make funeral arrangements for a relative, my manager told me I can only take one day off, and explained that ""You are not the only agent who has had a relative die.""Manpower/Experis,  no matter how big or small, everyone gets what they deserve, eventually.  lessEvery Monday I would receive a list of new hires from JPMorgan Chase (nationwide; about 100 users per week) and would organize them into an Excel spreadsheet. I would then order software and applications required to perform their job. I learned great data analysis skills as well as organizational skills and time management. My co-workers were always very positive and motivational.Experis Finance has provided a rich variety of work experiences for a consultant in finance and accounting, as well as internal audit. It is a fairly flat organization. They are not at the cutting edge of technology, in that it has to be well-established before adoption for their consultants. Local management is very competent in leading their practice.When I first began working at Experis, my office lost three of its most senior business development managers and its IT director at the same time. They had all left the company after gas prices plummeted and there was a great deal of pressure for production from neglected accounts. Then, the managing director left the company, and there was no leadership whatsoever. A team member who was not at all prepared was pushed into an IT director role without the title or compensation, a new managing director was brought in, and gas prices continued to fall. For a year now, the office has been in a ""transitional stage,"" and without any change in direction or clear and effective leadership, there is an intense pressure to produce at an exceedingly high rate. This company has great vision and all the necessary potential to succeed and grow, but this particular office is lead with the most policy and least principle of any office in which I've had the misfortune of working.I would say its a decent company to start your career or during early phase of your career.This firm has a decent clientele and one can get some diverse experience.I was always treated with great respect and given every opportunity to express any personal issues with a placement and helped professionally by building my skills to advance in my professional career.","10,000+",San-Francisco,Redwood City,CA,2016-11-22T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/associate-scientist-iii-job-redwood-city-ca-us-176536917.aspx?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=6,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
