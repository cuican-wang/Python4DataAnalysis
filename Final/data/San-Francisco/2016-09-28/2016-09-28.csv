258,259.0,"Research Scientist, Molecular Biology (PhD)",DuPont,4.0,607.0,"Overall Dupont is an OK company to work for. It's health benefits can be better and it has a pretty bad career advancement but the team environment is great. The environment is relaxed and very friendly. Many team building activities. Work load can be tough at times and very easy other times. The hours can be pretty flexibleI liked working here close to home and new faces to meet great workplace and good hours good people to meet very safe place to workIt was nice to be able to play with the kids, build relationships and take care of the families as they each checked into our department.Fantastic family-like work culture. Plenty of work available for optimizing processes and developing pilot processes. Great at teaching Co-ops new laboratory techniques and how to use analytical software and laboratory equipment.I made a very good living working for this company, but 7 day straight rotating shifts catch up to you.  They have a very strict A & T policy and no sick days (you must be hospital ill or take the points.)  Every man for himself.very helpful people who want you too succeed in the industry. positive company. products are great and are able to compete with others in industry.The least supportive environment. Everyone looks out for themselves, no teamwork. A lot of arrogance and negativity.  Management is self serving. Arrogant technical fellows with mental issues constantly berate co-workers and do not get reprimanded.  They manipulate and take work away, then complain when you don't meet your 70% billable goal. A lot of hot air with these technical geniuses that needs to get deflated.  I left a stable job to work here, biggest mistake of my life as this place is a major disappointment. They lost their magic. Bosses only care about making themselves look good.Learning Sharpoint and Sap **** Awesome Job! Perfect Manager Perfect Office. New Equipment and Old Building. Two Cafs. Lots of Coffee and Knowledge. AN AManagement was organized. We were always busy. The co-workers I enjoyed, we were truly a strong team. I learned all the DuPont computers programs and forms that needed to be processes for a successful outcome.I worked for DuPont for 26 years until the Nylon business was  sold to Koch Ind. in 2004. I worked in the laboratory organization as a shift lab tech. lab Inst. tech,  lab training coordinator, lab procedure writerSafety is they're number 1 priority. They care about people, not gust the bottom line. The employees are top notch if you had a question, they could answer itGreat exposure to engineering instruments. However during the Co-Op I was basically a glorified secretary. Tons of paper pushing and virtually no freedom of engineering practices.My experience entailed following operating procedures, troubleshooting, operating a DCS, locking out, tagging equipment, making, filling, and packaging of chemicals, load and unloading trailers, use of forklift/work saver. I also have an excellent safety record. I have attended and also ran safety meetings.DuPont has been a great company to work for, as it relates to pay, total compensation, and working within a challenging career field. I feel their management team is out of touch with what the crew needs and wants, and there is an impression that the plant is divided between the haves (front office personnel) and the have-nots (operations and maintenance personnel).Worked with a scrum master who treated the scrum team poorly...often cussing at and harassing team members, especially those who were leaders. The scrum team repeatedly talked to management about the scrum master's behavior for well over a year. The scrum master was never removed from her position--and she was a contractor. Only after several team members left (the body count was at least 7), she was assigned to another team. Now she's been hired as a full-time IT manager. One of Pioneer's core values is to treat people with respect. I never noticed that core value being executed the entire time I worked there.Company profile and standards are changing and down sizing is a critical factor among senior management. Direction of company is not assured. Chemical, and agriculture products is the only life line of the company.Enjoy working there a lot. I've learned a lot of the job field. Very friendly people. Everyone at work is willing to help you learn and become the best you can beRunning warehouses for on of the largest trucking companies in America on 2 dedicated accounts that kept me vrr busy with lots of overtime was a pleasure. I hate JB Hunt lost the accounts.My role includes the processing of customer orders, internal stock transfers, and review availability of materials for both.  I am constantly communicating with, supply chain management, external customers, internal customers, and sales management regarding their needs and out ability to fulfill their expectations. I also review processes against continuous improvement goals and account manager expectations.Decent pay, but must be willing to work 12hr rotating shift and 2 weekends a month. As far as the work goes, it can be boring. No challenge.the atmosphere there was friendly and the operators worked very hard each day. I learned to drive for the first time, about tools, different types of pumps, distillation columns, valves, heat exchangers and piping parts. The hardest part of the job was leaving. I liked working and getting to know the managers as well as my co-workers","10,000+",San-Francisco,Tiburon,CA,2016-09-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/7c9fca25-44b2-44ac-88af-91cf80fdb7b4?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
