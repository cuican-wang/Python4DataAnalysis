39,40.0,Senior Associate Scientist Immuno Assay,"Amgen, Inc",4.1,510.0,"Checked animals for health and welfare, study support.  Management was not always aware of issues.  Co-workers were great.  My commute was the most difficult part of my job.  The work was fun and rewarding.The work as a manufacturing associate is very stressful, even though   you learned a lot about automated and manual processes.You are asigned to a partner ( it can be a different one every day) everyday so you have to get to know each person working system and communication is very important. The most difficult part of this job is that you dont have and exact time to go to have lunch or to eat. Everyday  can be unpredictable. In my opinion the management has to work really hard on that and take the associates in consideration. I know that production is very important but workers health and consideration is too.Loved the people that I worked with. I was able to learn and grow with the company. They offered a great tuition reimbursement plan for those that wanted to get an education.The culture at Amgen is very competitive, with favoritism shown to those who buddy up to management.  Individuals who do well in office politics are given more opportunity for advancement than those who master their jobs, particularly in the scientific roles.  Medical benefits are above average, as are savings plans for retirement.  Many layoffs have occurred over the last ten years, with staff being replaced by contractors.  Some benefits have declined in recent years, such as tuition reimbursement, which went from 100% to a flat $5K per year.  Child day care is available but is very expensive.  Cost-cutting since the 2008 economic crisis has negatively impacted the working environment and the company culture.Amgen was a good company to work for. Management overall was good but had issues removing poor management from the structures. Manufacturing seemed to be pushed beyond their limits. Good benefits and pay.My job experience at Amgen was very important of my life, because I adquired professional knowledge. A tipical day at work was very hard. In Amgen I work as co-worker, this job was my first official science job and my first experience at the pharmaceutical industry. I learned everything of the manufacturing area.Amgen is a great working environment with many different bussines units ranging from Oncology to CV drugs. If you are relocatable the options are great for upward mobility and your goals can be met if you clearly identify your direction.The company looks nice to an outsider but management culture is very protective of an out of control quality system and does not invite new process improvement ideas!I had the opportunity to lead several Supplier Quality initiatives.  Management and co-workers were solid, though there were many late nights preparing for and executing successful regulatory inspections.Great training programs for those that want to excel in the company. Management is always there and ready to assist. CO-workers are very helpful and happy. Office management is providing assistance to higher level staffgreat pay   working  conditions are  Terrible  very high stress environment and very long hours but met some great co workers.emphasis on doing anything to get ahead even if it means damaging a coworkers reputation.Amgen worker productivity seems to be diminished, and its culture appears to be conditioned by constant large-scale initiatives driven top-down.  Teams' ability to execute is impacted by a culture of job-protectiveness, and even excellent and essential ideas are delayed for years waiting for various reorganizations.  In a nutshell, Amgen does not foster ideation, invention, creativity; further, the company seems to reward passive-aggressive behavior.Amgen's headquarters are isolated in Ventura County, CA, and while the benefits are great, I do not recommend relocating simply for Amgen.  It frequently pays relocation benefits to new hires, but moving here could geographically block enriching opportunities from coming to you.Contracted in the Woburn, MA facility for two nightmarish months. I was told they had an open ear and welcome new ideas. Not even close. The safety dbag watched over everything you did just to tell you to do it different. Hardcore FDA regulated. Employees are told to fill out reports and ""dime-drop"" on others if they see you do something wrong. You'll be better off joining the army. It's run just like that. Big turnover and a lot of firings. Stay far away from this asylum.Excellent co-workers and team work environment.  Every day is a new challenge to manage the time to succeed and meet workload as well as giving support to other areas.  Excellent place to learn and grow as a professional.Good job, unfortunately just a temporary assignment, wish it was permanent.  Even though it was a bit of a drive there from my residence, I would have been more than glad to be a permanent employee of Amgen.Its the place where challenge own capacities since day one. The team member are in constante search of improvement. As it is each task, responsibility importan as it is the site facilities.Great products, great company. Teamwork environment and management try to be transparent to the sales reps.The most enjoyable part of my job is helping patients get access to the medication.The day starts with heavy calendar, email and mailbox maintenance and cross functional interactions and wearing many hats throughout the day.  Learning management system allowednfor unlimited and frequent task and role educationnfor growth. Teamwork and cross functional interaction was a plus.Enjoyed working here.  The project teams were awesome and everyone worked very hard.  The group included FTE's and Contractors and everyone worked as a team delivering results that was appreciated and recognized.Great place to work with an excellent lean manufacturing culture.  The company values are embedded in all activities we do.When I was a contracted employee Amgen was great. After I was hired it was totally different than what I was presented. Everyone there is depressed and complaining. Lack of communication between management and employees.","10,000+",San-Francisco,South San Francisco,CA,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/a622dbdf-e880-4fe5-a21c-b5f377cdf4b3?mescoid=1900254001001&jobPosition=7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

66,67.0,Data Scientist,Enterprise Solution inc,4.0,70.0,"Good place to work. Excellent work culture. Great value of work.Excellent management. Always ready to help out. provide guidance to gain your goal. Good ways to communicate with other employees.This was a high call volume call center for collecting medical record for several different companies, the objective was to schedule at least three on site reviews which was the hard part because some doctors office didn't like to have technicians come in so it was a very competitive job and you had to be assertive and persuasive in order to get that done. Sometime we would have races to see who get the most onsite reviews scheduled within a time frame. I enjoyed it i was always able to get five or more and that was the fun part.Work life balance is good. Good testing tools-Quality Center, Jira QTP, and In-house tools. Good testing methodology.The people at ECS was not professional at all. No one on the office side was helpful. I would go to a job site retrieve all the information that I was required to retrieve, upload the information, and think that I would be going forward to the next job. However; I would have to return to a site because they do not work together in the corporate office. It was a high turnover rate for the Field Tech Coordinators, in the 11.5 months that I worked there, I had 6+ Coordinators. The most enjoyable part of working for ECS was going to various job sites and working with different people every day.Working as your own supervisor was wonderful! It put great responsibility on me, but also taught me a lot. With this kind of job you need organization. The only downfall was there was not always work available. So when the cases slowed, so did the heavy paycheck that you relied on.A typical day at work is driving to site location all over New Jersey for chart retrieval. I learned how to maneuver Electronic Medical Record programs that I am using to retrieve charts. Management has been very good to me. They work with me with scheduling for issues that arise that causes me to miss work or change work times. I do not have contact with other co-workers because I work alone. Hardest part of the job is dealing with rude workers at some site locations. Most enjoyable part is working alone and only checking in through job website and applications.Upper management was very poor, Middle management made up for that, in how they interacted and treated employees. The company took pride in their adherence in HIPPA and continuously updated employees and quizzed them on information. Based in a call center environment, as a field tech coordinator, you are provided with a team made up of 10-20 individuals that were from the same general area in the United States. It was my responsibility to account for these team members to show up to their pre-scheduled job site and provide tier one technical support with our software that was sent out to them, where they scanned the pre-chosen medical records from the office they were assigned to. The company lost a few major contract and were forced to lay off 3/4 of the employed staff,Focus on client satisfaction with excellent service; enable the efficient knowledge transfer from the consultants to the client user so that the client end users can expedite the implementation and mastery of the system.Encourage the client users to take ownership of the implementation with advisory support and solution architecture.Travel  to site, transpose patient's medical record charts to electronic medical records (EMR). Send data to corporate office to transfer to EMR. Follow Medicare and Medicaid regulations.Great place to work, Contracts vary so each job will be different, Management is very supportive and the environment is a just do it type of place.Enjoyed work place and gained the skills  by dealing with complex business scenarios. Found lot of opportunities in working with various technologies and gained skills in short time.At ECS the work was really great and the doctors and staff were easy to get along with. My co-workers were very great friendly people and at times very helpful. The hardest part of the job is when you have to keep calling the doctors and there staff to let them know that they have past due medical records that need to be sent out. They start feeling harassed and pressured. Your job is to keep as calm as possible ans explain to them that you can allow them to have an extension. The goal is to keep them happy all the while make sure you get your job accomplished. The management was difficult. Due to them not acknowledging their employees. They don't speak to you nor do they even look at you. All in all i loved my job and wished that my assignment never ended there.A Typical work day varied; because it typically was often a different location. The exciting part of the job would be changes in the job locations. The most enjoyable part of the job was working independently. However;  management, whenever needed was awesome, they were just a phone call away. The hardest part of the job might be no full-time employment available. The position is just a temporary position; which is made clear before the position is offered. A GREAT COMPANY TO WORK WITH!It was incredibly easy working for this company. I worked off a schedule that was flexible to my needs. I drove to different cities and recovered medical charts from private practice physicians for Medicare insurance audits. I had the opportunity to learn medical procedure terminology and a feel for what a medical organization can expect with insurance audits. I learned how to carefully process sensitive information. Unfortunately I didn’t have the pleasure of getting to know any given person regularly due to me working at different sites daily, however it was nice to meet new people.This position enabled me to work with many different sales teams and see many different management styles. Providing true value to the field organization with strategy, fostering collaborative thinking and a consulatative sales approach incorporating all buiness lines. Leading presentatations for end user customers for roadmap planning.  Planning and development for new products to be launched globally. The most challenging aspect of this job was covering such a large territory so throughly. Most enjoyable was the company, people and level of expertise and size of projects delt with.The compensation was very fair and working from home allowed for autonomy.You will be working independently. I learned some valuable things about HIM and EMR. My experience with ECS landed my current job, which I love, for me. Overall a great experience, but not a lot of security. Great work if you are looking for a position in the HIM field.I enjoyed going to different clinics and seeing new people, management was good. I liked that you were almost your own boss didn't have people looking over your shoulder, there was a lot of trust.Consulting at Enterprise  Business Solutions gives good exposure to end clients. Get to work and gain valuable experience at end clients in different industries.Travel to scheduled Medical sites and retrieve specific requested documents for requested dates of service by either paper scan, print to scan or EMR flashdrive.I learned how to navigate through several different EMR systems.Management is friendly and easy to get along with.Hardest part of the job is traveling to unknown offices and working by yourself.most enjoyable part was meeting different people and seeing different Medical offices.Great opportunity if you enjoy working independently and mostly figuring things out on your own. If you are even semi tech savvy, it's super easy. I have worked nearly full time all summer and have exceeded the 12 week commitment required. This has been great, in that it is a part time job, thus you I have earned a lot of overtime pay. If you follow the guidelines/expectations, call in to your Coordinator as required, do daily reporting online, you will be be offered work. (If it is available in your area; it is all project based and you are informed of that upon hire.) There can be issues with communication, but this is the case with any company, and at least it is all via telephone/not in your face. The job is not permanent, no benefits, and some wear/tear on your vehicle, all of which you are informed of during the interview process. However, it beats drawing unemployment, and affords one the opportunity to network in different offices daily.I enjoy working with Enterprise Consulting Solutions.  If I need any extra training they tell me where to find it.  If I need help with uploading charts they have tech support to help with that.  Overall, this is a great company to work for.","1,001 to 5,000",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/f6a4bdfa-0960-4cac-86cc-f899be705150?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Autodesk have managed to raise the lowly engineer to the level of Geek Superhero - in fact, they were just named one of the Universum Top 100 Ideal Employers for engineering students.In the right role, one can change the future. Autodesk is a powerful enabler in many spaces, and smart, young people can truly excel in this company.Autodesk transformed drafting and design back in the 1980's, and they continue to lead the world in engineering technology, design, visualization and future techologies (e.g., additive manufacturing, green buildings and engineering simulation). Great benefits and above-scale pay. Super corporate stewardship for many sustainable efforts - Autodesk gives back to the world.In the right team, you'll have fun while changing the world. The average Autodesker is more than just smart - he or she is probably a fun-loving prankster / comedian, too. Seriously, the work atmosphere is intense but when this they take a break from their task lists, the majority of functional teams have a great time together. This alone can make work at Autodesk very, very worthwhile.Dirty politics played by bad management because they don't have the skills to do the job.Regular layoffs for people who don't cater to managment.Steady outsourcing increase so no job security.Upper management burning reserves buying incompetent companies.Autodesk is recently expanding into the world of manufacturing. They have little experience with direct customer support which is making the next few years questionable from the standpoint of stability.I really enjoy my time working at Autodesk the environment is very open and the people to work with are very nice.My major complaint is it is very difficult to apply anywhere else internally. If you are working through a contract you could be let go at any moments notice without any notification ahead of time.Management teams are excellent.Co-workers work very hard.Company culture is focused on results.There is a lot of overtime available which is excellent for those with a strong work ethic. Overall, the company culture is evolving to build a better work life balance For those who are dedicated, there are a lot of opportunities for advancement.Great organization.Management very flexible,accessible, and well informed about the work that needs to be done, and overall willing to give you the support the you need. Supervisors are not always looking over your shoulder and you are given space to implement new ideas about the processes.I was given the opportunity to use my knowledge and skills and also to learn from my co-workers. I got a lot of support from everyone around me with not hesitation or reserve.  Great working environment. Benefits are good and good work/job balance.Company held and promote workers-social gathering within the facilities or outside the facilities. The facilities are great (very clean and modern. Co-workers are always willing to help no matter in what part of the country (USA) or over-sea they are located.Some positions have the option to work from home or at the office.  This is a very technological oriented organization.It was a great place to work not much else to say. Everyone worked together and everyone's ideas were put to use. I traveled about 50% of my time with the company. The travel was almost always 5 days at a time and almost never 2 weeks in a row.Autodesk is a progressive software company with excellent benefits and compensation.  It's a great place to work for someone who wants constant change.While the leadership of the support group seem to care, they in fact are more concerned with their spread sheets, than their employees and customers.Everyone is very good to you and work space is very good. All the Co-workers are very friendly. Management is also very good to you. There is not much work stress here.It was a great place to develop skill and to have an opportunity to grow. Also the job allowed me to get a great I deal on how to satisfy the customer.Great people, great benefits and great products. The technology is cutting edge and you have opportunity to work with every type company manageable.Sync up statusDaily stand upWork on the tasks allocatedFriendly and supportive team matesImplementing APIsAWS SQSAgile methodologiesAutodesk has a great product and employees can be proud to work for a company with such a good reputation.  The people are terrific and the space in SF is pretty awesome.  However, management is very uneven and not everyone is on the same page.  There are a lot of mixed messages.  Beware of younger managers and those who have been with the company less than 2 years. They are eager, ambitious, and have little-to-no training on how to manage people.  Loyalty and tenure are not valued at Autodesk, and the company does a major reduction in force about every 3-4 years, focusing on releasing employees who have been with the company more than 10 years.I can't say enough good about Autodesk.  I loved my time there.  They treat there employees so well.  I was rookie of the year my first year in sales and was the only one of my team that was over quota.  Love Autodesk.Worked there for several years.  Back in the mid-1980's there were some fun, fun times.... but with the increase in need for more corporate structure, those days are sadly a memory... though fond memories :)American multinational software corporation that makes software for the architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, media, and entertainment industries.Autodesk provides really cool technology to a variety of interesting industries.  A person beginning their career could really learn a lot here.  But executive management is erratic, with no centralized product management or strategy.  Too many products, some of which overlap each other.  Lots of territorial conflicts due to lack of leadership.After 18 years, it is sad to be part of the 10% reduction in force at Autodesk.  It has been the most challenging, exciting, and rewarding place I have ever worked.  The corporate culture is good, and the people are fantastic.  It's an innovative company with lots of creativity.  I've learned so much and I am ready to take my experience and knowledge to another great company.Pros: Benefits, Salary, Location, Facilities, Resources, decent/fairly interesting products, free lunch 2 days per week, work from home on Friday.Cons: New employees will struggle to be effective at times due to the large amount of ""backstory"" knowledge resident in the heads of existing employees. This is a very political place, Management is ineffective at driving initiatives to success. The company appears to be struggling with reconciling its culture from when it was smaller with the changes required to be efficient as a larger company. Its not uncommon to have conference calls at night during the week to collaborate with other ADSK offices in other timezones.Great company, solid business model, but has too many changes with management & uncertainty in the upcoming times.Big potential if you survive through the changes.","5,001 to 10,000",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/b52b96f1-0a08-4006-834f-3f54d804f9ca?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

It is such a fast moving environment, if you aren't quick on your feet, you can be left behind.Facebook is a great place to work.  The culture of innovation provides opportunities that many companies cannot.  This is especially true for security professionals.  The only downside is the lack of career path development for security professionals in this organization.Facebook kind of embodies the American Dream.

However, this company has one of the worse issues people have to deal and work with because the leads are not encouraging others for more morale, but instead insuinating their management to doing nothing or doing nothing about talk going on in the inside its very poor in that way. Furthermore, the company's assets going green is a great idea, but the best face the experience that Tesla just might not be a growing company, but a mistake.

Transportation by Bus , it is great. It makes job very easy. sometimes I continue my work by VPN connection  in the bus on way home and at Home.I do not have anything negative to say about working for Facebook. The people truly cared, they gave me the tools I needed to suceed and there was not a glass ceiling for growth.Working at Facebook was an amazing experience. The culture there was great. The benefits were top tier as well. They fed us three meals a day. Supplied employees with their own personal computers for work.Love the culture, awesome coworkers and great opportunities to grow and learn and expand your career. I had a wonderful experience and made such great connections and friendships.Facebook onsite with PROUnlimited was an excellent opportunity into viewing corporate work life.  It gave an inside view of how larger companies work together to create a product that is end-user driven.  The culture is also top notch as they push to have users experience and attempt new ideas.  They certainly strive to set the bar higher for new entrants and individuals seeking a challenging work place.Don't want to go into too much detail about what happens at one of these offices, but to put it in a nutshell, words almost can't describe how much I appreciate the opportunity to work with this company. It is definitely an experience that I will never forget.The opportunity to network within the company is amazing! They provided me with a monthly amount of advertising money to promote my business for free!This is place is exactly what you would expect from an established Silicon Valley company. The people are smart and helpful, the management is flat, and the atmosphere is amazing.Weird horrible management and no room for growth. Great job to do while figuring out your career! Flexible enough and easy workloadFacebook was a great place to work, I was very disappointed when my contract ended.  The Co-Workers and Managers were awesome, everyone got a long and everyone wanted what is best for the customers.  Helping customers place ads with Facebook was a true learning experience.Do not like working for cognizant, they do not care about employees at all. Management is horrible, they are rude and do not respect employees.It was a great place to work because of the culture. The work becomes routine, and they don't promote much from within. It still tries to function like a startup instead of the tech juggernaut that it is.Was able to learn from a wide array of Chefs from different backgrounds and expand upon my culinary career in a large institutional kitchen setting.   Opportunities to create eight item menus based upon a theme or region and execute your personal menu for a large group of patrons.  It also forced you to be quick on your feet and adapt to changing environment.  For example, if you had a popular dish and it was running low, you had to be prepared to come up with a substitute dish on the fly.  Also very informative to learn how large scale kitchen production works.Great to work for a great company. Hard but you succeed. Great opportunity for growth within the company. Top experience of my life.Facebook is a great place to work. Great people, great perks and lots of fun. You are never bored and actually like coming to work.","5,001 to 10,000",San-Francisco,Menlo Park,CA,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/a1506e62-f656-471d-80f7-4bbbf8844fca?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
