278,279.0,Chief Medical Physicist-Radiation Oncology,California Pacific Medical Center,4.3,88.0,"It was great working with other health care professionals and learning how to work in a team setting but also independently.Busy and productive, very organized organisation.  I love the population we serve and am proud to give quality care.There is room to grow in the organization.California Pacific Medical Center is a great place to work at. The manager was really nice and professional. This was my first job as a HIM clerk and it gave a lot of experience.I grew up being and RN in the Newborn Intensive Care Unit. I proposed and implemented many changes with the goal of providing the best care possible to the infants in the NICU and their parents. I proposed written care plans that were to be manintained and updated as an ongoing process for the babies and their parents so that other nurses who came in could refer to the care plan and know the central problems and processes being done for the infant and parents. I proposed primary care nursing for the infants, so taht one nurse could be in charge of their care and get to know the parents, establising a bond and trust with the mothers ad fathers. I proposed a more humane treatment plan for babies dying in the unit that included the grieving parents' needs. I proposed a committee to provide a forum for nurses and doctors to collaborate on patients' care and meeting parent's needs. I worked on the Policy and Procedure Committee writing new policies for nurses to follow. I was in charge of 10-12 nurses, managing the NICU at night, when fewer doctors were available. I was also in charge during the day, managing a busy NICU. I went on transports, bringing new babies to our unit from outlying hospitals. I learned how to manage difficult prople during the most difficult times in their lives. I helped mothers and fathers be parents in a inhospitable environment. I thoroughly enjoyed my work, especially as a primary care nurse, working with mothers everyday, helping to care for sick term and preterm infants. The biggest challenge for me was making sure the babies and their families were  more... treated humanely and that all nurses recognized and respected their right to be there and their need for each other during their hospitalization. I was inspired by my own experience as a working mother with four sons and a husband at home. Balancing all this was difficult but rewarding and gratifying. I learned much that could be applied to life, to running a business, especially to customer service and satisfaction.  lessTypical day was recruiting study participants and coordinating research studys. I have learned the importance of continuing to deliver high quality customer care.My co-workers work as a team.Answer phones and operate a switchboard.Route calls to specific people.Answer inquiries about company.Greet visitors warmly and make sure they are comfortable.Call persons waiting for visitor and book them a room to meet in.Schedule meetings and conference rooms.Make coffee and set out food.Ensure reception area is tidy.Coordinate mail flow in and out of office.Coordinate office activities.Handle phone calls from people calling in sick.Gather personal and insurance information.Hand out employee applications.Arrange appointments.Cash out people when necessary.Validate parking tickets.Give visitors badges and direct them to where they can sign in.Issue parking passes.Send email and faxes.Collect and distribute parcels and other mail.Perform basic bookkeeping, filing, and clerical duties.Prepare travel vouchers.Take and relay messages.Update appointment calendars.Schedule follow-up appointments.Is a good good place to work. benefits little expensive at this company , is always under a new management. that's all.nothing else to say for now.I did word processing with a 24 hour turn around of medical reports.  I worked in the Pediatric Pulmonary and Cystic Fibrosis Center for 4 years as a full time employee.  I answered the phones, did all the filing, handled the mail and set up emergency hospitalizations at the end of the day at California Pacific Medical Center.I love working here. I love the People, I ve learned so much from working here.  The co-workers have been very helpful in making my work experience very pleasent.At the time, there was much to work out at CPMC. I'm sure by now much has been changed and improved. At the time, everything was poorly managed but I hear it is better now.My workplace is a wonderful place to work at, with competitive and skilled nurses and doctors.  The ability to participate in healthcare policy and executive management gives employees ownership and stewardship.Busy work schedule...had to work all shifts....no time to learn...emergency department was always packed with peopleI enjoyed my job at CPMC  tremendously . it paved my way to stay in oncology nursing . The staff and support was fabulous they were a 23 bed  medical surgical oncology unit.I joy servicing the public. And making a difference  in the work environment, I find it rewarding and challenging  with the help of team work.Worked for 27 years at CPMC in outpatient surgery. Very fast paced challenging environment. The outpatient surgery center has had a census from 25 to 55 pts per day. I found working with surgical patients in this environment to be extremely rewarding. I developed many skills that facilitated smooth patient admission and recovery.I love working for this company as I always feel supported by management and other staff. Everyone there is super friendly and very educated in a supportive and fun loving way. Patients that come in feeling ill leave with a great sense of hope.Management Pits department against department and employee against employee.  Middle management is disposable.  The hardest part of the job is not becoming part of the culture of this facility.  The job of upper management is to keep their jobs.I worked with this company for years and I enjoyed working with them. I was sadden to have left the company and hope to find a new position with them again. Great people and great overall environment.Worked per diem.  Staff is highly professional and maintain strict standards.  The working environment is clearly a culture of safety.A typical day as a Discharge Specialist at California Pacific Medical Center would consist of many responsibilities.  The day would start by going to interdisciplinary rounds to discuss which patients would be discharging for the day.  I would work with nurse case managers, social workers, and doctors to identify any needs or barriers for discharge.  It was very much a team approach to work toward a common goal.Most enjoyable part was Clinical Research and working with patients.",,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-06-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/379ef2c6-1e12-45dd-8db4-6968606e8e04?mescoid=1900257001001&jobPosition=9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
