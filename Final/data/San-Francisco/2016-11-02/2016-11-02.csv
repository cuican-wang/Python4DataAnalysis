I like how it can relaxed one moment then in the next moment it can become competitive. The motivation from my managers to push myself and be aggressive, makes me want to do so much better.Great Company always listening and helping you and treat you with respect Confidently and proactively help resolve issues for customers and balance number of customers in a busy retail environment. Contribute to a constructive work environment by consistently treat all Gap Brans workers and shoppers with respectThe typical day at work, for my position, is fast paced. I learned how to think on my toes and to merchandise in unique ways to sell product to customers. The management team is diverse, with a specific work ethic that all follow. The hardest part of the job is to complete shipment on time. The most enjoyable part is having control of all inventory, knowing what's in and what's out for the store, and talking directly to management about all the exciting things that will happen for the company.I worked for this company at the height of its popularity and found it to be a great place to work.  I would definitely go back to work for them if I wanted to get into retail management again.It was very exciting and fun job. I learned a lot about the retail business and had the ability to apply those skills in my future jobs. Management was poor and there was a lack of communication, but your coworkers were your family and the atmosphere was usually positive.Management gives you the opportunity to grow and get involved in other areas that make up company. I've had the opportunity to do so and I have to say it pays off.good place to work great benefits, peak season are long and tiring with long days and multiple days worked without a day off. Would recommend for hourly employmentGap was a short seasonal job. I absolutely love the atmosphere because it is so lively, but the pay was very low and there was literally only 4 to 8 hour weeks.A typical day at work requires us to sell and know about the products we are selling.You have to learn about the items and know what is best for each customer. Management was organized and wanted to achieve goals as a team. Co worker, were all lovely, fun, energetic and goal oriented. The job was not that hard its just frustrating working on holidays.the people are great very fun for a first job very outgoing people, gets busy during holidays so expect to be always moving, loved where it was located because at lunch or after work you have the court yard or can go shopping in the outlet, and the discount you get is great.I love this place, I love the people. The job is so easy and fun and I enjoy working here. A typical day at work can vary from shipment to fitting room to cashier and its always different and fun. I love my coworkers most of them are very nice and fun to be around. The hardest part is dealing with messy costumers and being on my feet all day.Great place to work with the people that is around you as they help you develop skills. Be prepare to work hard and always greet the customers no matter.Gap is a great place to work. The employees are like a second family and it doesn't even feel like work. I would have stayed for a long time but I moved. Forever missing Gap.Great place to work! Love the company that I have returned to work there again.Everyone there is friendly, and the atmosphere is great. They are willing to work with me on my schedule.The location, I worked at specifically, had an amazing management team and sales associates were just as great. Fast-paced, especially during the holidays, but great environment to be in.Black Friday crazy as always, but things are always better when they are organized. Well staffed and everyone was nice and respectful, even when it got late.I worked at Gap for about a year. I gained a lot of experience in customer service and sales skills. Management was great and they worked with my high school schedule.Orderfilling is great easy and fun, fast pace good school hours for working and if you are going to school. Health insurance is great!Fast paced work for large corporation. If you like big box stores, give them a try. Hard to adjust to the crazy holiday hours.It is a stable work environment with many opportunities. A great first job for anyone new to the workforce. Lots of hours and room for internal advancement.","10,000+",San-Francisco,SAN FRANCISCO,CA,2016-11-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/9550d5b4-064d-46f5-b771-75ed3d6cc24e?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

165,166.0,Data Scientist,Philips,4.1,1200.0,"Lifeline was an exceptional work place. Very educational, professional and eye opening. Its an emotional experience.Great people help make a great company. The open work environment took some time to get used to but helped foster collaborative working. The ability to work from home when need-be was a positive.Contract engineer performing supplier quality work.  Helped Philips & their suppliers get through remediation period and successfully ramp up back to normal production.I worked at lifeline not only for my paycheck ,but the rewards of helping the subscribers . There arn't alot of people that handle calls when the sub presses that phb for depression ,lonliness,anxiety,suicidal,robberies and confusion and just to talk and the typical I've fallen and can't get up was frequent,to hear a friendly voice that they may recognize. My coworkers had compassion,kindness and were monitored on a frequent basis. We left our life behind to help people.Snow,rain,sleet we were there.Good atmosphere and cool place.Good job and good compensation and good benefits and good security and good advancement and good management and good job culture.Overall, the worst experience of my professional career.  The beaurocracy is beyond compare, with zero important decisions delegated beyond the second level CEO.  That's right, there are three CEOs reporting vertically into one another, and even the Vice Presidents don't own their P&L.   There's a complete mismatch between accountability and authority, annual performance goals aren't finalized until Q4 or after the year closes, and the subjective nature of the reviews allow politics and relationships to vastly overshadow any objective measurement of success.  All metrics are kept at a total division level, so free riders can rejoice with a good bonus while hard workers are exploited and asked to continue to do more for the team.a fantastic company but specific managers make it ""less than appealing"". I would  highly recommend you work there, but you need to be able to tolerate managers (some) who only care about their paychecks and not about you.A typical day at Philips consists of me reviewing Global Complaints and trying to manage the complaints I already have in TrackWise our Complaint Handling Database.Temp: Customer Service for 2 years (original assignment was 6-8 mths). Company had no intention of hiring as direct.  Job was outsourced to India. Co-workers were very nice, fun, and helpful. There was no hard part of the job, easiest I have ever done. Not enough challenges.  Too many managers, not always available when needed.It is fun working in the company. I have dealt with complex troubleshooting issues of LAN/WAN. The management is very co-operative and friendly. The co-workers help us to understand the concepts.a day at work is usually the same depending on what department I am working in stock room shipping or receiving. mainly stockroomfor now between me and 5 other workers we all have different responsibility. the hardest part is when I receiving orders at the last minute that has to be pulled from stock and transacted and deliveredto production area before the close of the day management is good especially if you have a problem very is to talk to. most enjoyable part of the job is employee discounts .what I learned fire safetyspill control, hazardous labels of material and how to store themWork from home and Travel as needed to customer sites. Occasional weekend work and late night work scheduled as needed.Philips is a great company to work for, as with any large corporations, moving up could be quite slow.  However, in exchange you get stability, solid benefits, a great work environment and the satisfaction that you are benefiting society through better healthcare.Work/Life balances, focus on employee satisfaction, decent pay and benefits.  Diverse background of employees.Hardest Part - Levels of managers and collaboration to get things changedEasiest Part - strong HR involvement in employee satisfaction and listening to employeesPhilips is a good company. The products are innovative and well received by the public. The compensation is fair, but there is no room to grow as an FSR.I found Philips a very difficult place to work.  I was new to the team and no training was provided.  I had to learn my job by trial and error.  When I went to management with questions, they had no answer.  Had to work on holidays.Great company to work for. Great benefits and compensation packages. Philips is a leader in the healthcare industry with a majority lead in the market share. Diverse product set with quality manufacturing, engineering and customer support.The work is easy just very fast pace. When I first started, everyone was very friendly. Once you learn how to do the job you will have no problems.a good place to work how to make exit signs management was good coworker communication  was good inventory time  was the hardest part most enjoyable when we came together as a family at holidays before the day we get offa great place to be innovative in your approach to ultrasound and sales. It is a place for your to share your ultrasound and physics expertise. there is a good compensation package.Excellent environment, management are excellent too, the facilities are reliable and good for all the duties, the people are very friendly and have a good attitude","10,000+",San-Francisco,Foster City,CA,2016-11-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/ea454b7f-9133-4f75-b326-c64bf9af3d03?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=35,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
