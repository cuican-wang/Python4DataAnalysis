124,125.0,Data Scientist - Housing Economist,"Airbnb, Inc.",4.2,53.0,"I host people for Airbnb. It is a lot of fun, and a good way to meet people very different from you. In general, the people who visit are quite nice to have around.I enjoyed the challenge of remodeling my property transforming it into and 11 guest stay. Also, meeting all sort of people from different parts of the world and learning from their distinct cultures.Being an AirBnb host has been really amazing meeting new people and listening to their adventures. It also allows me to have an open schedule so that I am not missing out on other things in life.Great Environment. There are thousands of ways to learn and innovate in this environment. Allows you to take charge and oversee the many operations of keeping an Airbnb property afloat.an amazing place to meet an abundance of people. we worked together to give off the best ambiance so the clients felt the vibes. after moving up in positions, i became a floater to help any and every station complete daily tasks.Is such a great experience working with Airbnb, I can have my own schedule, I don't need to be at my place all the time, and I can know people around the world at the same time I make some money.Awesome culture to work in. Super friendly, community is very active, always a different day when I arrive at the office. Free food, I truly get to taste the world everyday!As a host, I got the chance to meet people from all different backgrounds with different stories.Most of the guest were super polite, kindly and be aware of me.Amazing experience meeting, helping hosting guests from Europe, Asia, Australia and Centro America.Provided professional and friendly customer assistant  and keep maintenance and guests need as a top priority.An awesome way to meet new people and offer services at reasonable rates. The job was very easy and has limitless benefits. I loved it. If you love people and enjoy entertaining this is the job for you.I love Airbnb. They have provided a way for me to bring in extra income and do what I love most which is to make my home an oasis and to serve guests with a pleasurable experience while staying with me.-Limited to no growth potential-Strong lack of work/life balance-Highly inexperienced management-Lightning fast pace-Burnout environmentGreat second source of income. Lots of freedom to manage your own way. I will continue to rent my home as long as I can. Great idea and I hope it sticks around for years to come.Great company and provides great backup for hosts. Super flexible and they are always there to help a host.  Super fast on response.There are a plethora of people who don't do anything and still have a job. I made one mistake and written up for it and then fired, which wasn't even a rightful termination. Loved the agents and the environment but the clients between 24-7 InTouch and Airbnb have no understanding of valuing their employees.Great work team. Very supportive. Great perks in travel credit I highly recommend working here.They were very flexible and I was able to work from homeI have worked at Airbnb as a Customer experience specialist for about a year.Airbnb is a great company to work for, they have amazing offices and great perks: breakfast, lunch, snacks, health insurance, happy hours, travel coupons every quarters for employees, laptop provided, etc.They take good care of their employees and they have a great on-boarding training.For this position, we usually worked in shift either from Sunday to Thursday or from Tuesday to Saturday.The only drawback while I was there was a lack of consistency between managers across teams but the issue was identified so I am confident that it is being taken care of.Overall, I am very satisfied with the company and its culture and I would recommend working for them.A typical day at work is unpredictable, considering  each case is different. I've learned the victories and difficulties in working with travel/booking. My co-workers are awesome for the most part, I get along with everyone and do not mind helping when needed. The hardest and most enjoyable part of the job would be balancing the stress depending on the level of difficulty behind the case, and the most enjoyable part is saving the day!Hosting and interacting with guests is fun and rewarding.You make new friends, build new relationships, and help people transition from one move to another.The system is easy. Guests see our profile on site and reserve a time. We confirm the reservation and take care of each guest dedicated to achieve guest satisfaction. Management includes collection of deposits for keys and house keeping, house cleaning and maintenance, and showing and guiding guest through residence.The hardest part of the job is receiving a rude guest who is high maintenance and the best way to handle the guest is to be calm and collected. If problems arise, we try to come up with the best solution and best service for that guest. The most enjoyable part of the job is making new friends that have lasted long past their stay.I was my own boss, so I only hosted when I had the time. I learned to manage my time, deal with people from different backgrounds, and learn about different cultures. Cons are: minimum security and could be more than a full time job as I was on call 24/7.It was a interesting complex due to the legalization of Airbnb in NYC. We worked in a cool office space but everyone was assigned a territory.",,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-09-30T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/9369de21-13c5-47db-8c80-a17109750bf2?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=28,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
