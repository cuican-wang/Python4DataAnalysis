129,130.0,Senior Data Scientist,Ticketfly,3.7,3.0,"I would go in and prepare and ship out UPS. Then check the print que and print out anything incoming, then print a batch of tickets that consisted of one thousand orders. i learned to be a very good multi-taker, and working under very high stress conditions, thinking ahead. Trying to always keep the customer happy, as in special shipping requests. The management was a little hard to get used to but they tried to be very understanding. My co-workers were very friendly and helpful, they would go out of their way to hep. We were more like a family then co-workers. The hardest part of the job was making sure the customers were the most satisfied they could be while maintaining company policies. I would have to say the most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of knowing that i was doing my very best and making the customer happy and the comradery  of the other employees.Ticketfly is a music tech company that is reforming the concert going experience. They love live music and encourage all of their employees to attend as many shows as possible. The culture is music oriented, social and caters to everyone's talents. Since Ticketfly is still a start up company, things are constantly changing as management figures out the best ways to help clients achieve high ticket sales and provide great service to customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is being among the awesome people who work there. I respect all of my coworkers and don't mind going out of my way to help when I can.Had couple of excellent managers that guided me and empowered me to create successful teams, where my leadership and management skills got polished.They will grow and be more successful, my only recommendation will be management training for all their managers.",51 to 200,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-09-14T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/44886dcb-7865-44b6-8c9c-bfe6dd6f7272?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
176,177.0,Staff Scientist (Particle Data Group - Physics Division),Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,4.2,62.0,"The work at LBNL was very organized and well managed. The collaboration is one key point of my experience. The time schedule is flexible. Offices quite small.it's hard to have a developed career if you don't have a PhD at national lab. Stable but salary can't be high. You will have good health insurance and pension plan which is rare now.Good place to work.  Good benefits, and a great view.  Opportunities depend on the Division you work for.  Culture is improving daily.I moved to the Bay Area for a postdoc position at LBNL. I love working there and have good colleagues, but the culture of LBNL is different from most other national labs in that there isn't a well-defined track for advancement. You either get one of the rare staff scientist positions, or your out looking for jobs in 2-5 years. Overall, it was a positive experience, but I would have liked more stability.I worked on the Administration side of LBNL and unless you're a scientist, they don't really value you as an employee.  After being employed for a administrator position, I was relegated to a storeroom issued parts for 90% of my time.  My manager did a poor job of training me for the duties listed in the job description, pawning me off on other employees from time to time.  While this may sound normal, during the interview process I was told that I would be working closely with my supervisor, attending meetings and shadowing him to learn both his position and mine.Although there as a contract employee, this company is a great place to work. The company is diversified and everyone you work with is pleasant. Each of the persons in different departments supported HR and worked together as a team to ensure each Department at the lab were supported and each employee and student received the information needed to be a success.The Berkeley Lab is managed more like a university than other national laboratories, likely because of its proximity to UC Berkeley. This has some of the benefits of a university-like feel, but sometimes makes it difficult to execute large/ambitious projects that (a) require coordination between different departments/divisions, and (b) require some legwork before being able to publish results.If you're interested in building new capabilities instead of making slides about all that cool stuff you're going to do with your grant money, you might want to look elsewhere.I have been working with the scientists who work real hard to advance the current knowledge state of science to the next level. I am really inspired and motivated by seeing their motivation for the good cause of humanity. Typical job day includes a lot of computational work including scientific programming, simulation, data analysis, visualization, and above all sharing these information with the fellow scientists and colleagues. Also, there are a lots of enlightening seminars almost every day where we can learn the new knowledge of a research area. The work culture here is excellent and the people are very helpful and supportive. The most enjoyable part is how knowledgeable the people working here yet so humble. Hardest part is to keep publishing of cutting edge research papers which sometime takes years.Great place to learnGreat place to workGreat place to cryGreat place to laughGreat place to support leaders in scienceMulti cultural environment with top-notch research in various fields of science. Large opportunity to learn, collaborate and perform every step of the experimental process.love working as a Research Assistant at the Center for Research and Education on Aging Lab (CREA) in the Lawrence Berkeley NationalLaboratory division of Physical Biosciences. I'm part of a very interesting research were we are Investigating the causes and processes of aging through caloric restrictionwith the objective of improving and extending the human health span. Helped create an interactive map of the agingprocess based on thousands of published primary academic research.LBNL is a fantastic place to work. The people there are the most intelligent and creative in the scientific world. I am only an intern right now but it's obviously a great work environment.LBL is a fine place to work.  Pay scale is good.  The location and campus is nice.  LBL does a lot of important work that it is fun to be a part of.Tons of available resources, nice work environment and location. The work/life balance is pretty good. The research setting is very nice, and the environment I worked in is collaborative, and interactions are generally constructive.Excellent and productive research environment, dynamic and truly international atmosphere. It is a good place to do science with exceptional research facilities. LBNL is a world-class institution,  I would strongly recommend this place to anyone who like to carry out top notch science.Excellent research environment, dynamic and diverse international atmosphere.Berkley National Laboratory an excellent platform to develop fundamental scientific and engineering skills. Exciting projects at the forefront of new technologies.friendly environment, talented co-workers, good work-life balance, and a superb place to learn new things,beautiful and convenient office locationThe work environment is great. Lots of opportunities to collaborate with people from different backgrounds. I like the management. Everyone encourages out of the box ideas.The best part about working at LBNL is the beautiful location. The lab is located in the Berkeley hills surrounded by nature with a beautiful view of the San Francisco Bay. The most enjoyable part of the job was serving new employees, taking their  photos for their badges and interacting with them. The hardest  part of the job was dealing with bureaucracy. Overall working at the lab was enjoyable.It is a good place to do science. Sometimes can be very bucrocratic. As a postdoc you can't apply to have independent funding which makes the transition to staff quite harsh.  Very relaxed environment but the salary is to low for the area.A typical day at work for me was pushing paperwork. I worked in the proposals department where I had to obtain signatures of scientist and then submit the proposal for funding. I learned the structure of a proposal and how to submit it for funding for different projects. Management and co-workers were very helpful and always worked together. The hardest part of the job was making sure I paid attention to detail because if one thing was incomplete or wrong on the proposal you would have to start all over because the proposal would get rejected. The most enjoyable part of the job was when our proposal were granted.",,San-Francisco,Berkeley,CA,2016-09-14T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/597a69e1-05d4-4ff5-aeea-17d842095c2a?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

608,609.0,Geologist II,AECOM Technology,3.7,1900.0,"Work with analyzing data, writing reports, developing monitoring plans, and managing technicians in the field. Co-workers are all very friendly.My day consisted of various laboratory tasks as assigned to include work with an AA machine, wastewater BODs, and oil and grease assessment of samples. I was also tasked with maintaining inventory and ordering supplies as needed.Good company and people,nice atmosphere, flexible on start and end times. There are many online training platforms, just need more practical application and direction for the long term. Benefits are decent, just raised rates.I worked for AECOM twice. When they found out they were losing the contract they force the people who had insurance to take their insurance and it was high. The second time they came in with their gonna make things better bull and they allowed the wrong things to still happen.Regular work day was great, learned how to navigate oracle system, managers easy to work with. nothing hard to learn at AECOM, just coming to work was the enjoyable part and talking to co-workers.Fantastic atmosphere with friendly,professional, and safe teammates. Typical work day is an eight hour day with expected PM procedures, and few trouble calls. Great opportunity for advancement within the company as long the individual is willing to relocate. Training is always available.Tried to do the best I could with little training. Management was puppet to the host company and would throw us under the bus to make themselves look better.Ive been with the company for eight years and overall they are a great company but there is no advancement within the company. Management needs to improve.its good pay but the workload is crazy. They don't show employees no appreciation for the work we do. The benefits are good. Its really no room for growth.Employee morale at a all time low. No advancement or stability. Play favorites with employees. Does not acknowledge loyalty.Projects were varied; travel opportunity was excellent. Supervisors were fair and provided training when necessary. I enjoyed the experience.AECOM has some amazingly passionate employees that I felt honored to call my coworkers. Talent in abundance, humble and true professionals. The teams really go above and beyond with their dedication.Friendly atmosphere and good team experience. Good work culture and enjoyed working with management and friendly co-workers. Enjoyed extra-curricular events and celebrations.Outstanding opportunities with AECOM. a globally recognized corporation with LOTS of opportunities for personal and professional growthAll the folks who run the maintenance desk are the same people who ran it in the Navy. So, in most cases, you've got the same types of problems.The company offer a variety of benefits and paid above average compensation.  The costs were average in the industry.  There is constant change coming from Corporate leadership which resulted in a stressful work environment.  No work/life balance due to long hours.A very large company and as such, don't get the feel that the company really cares about you as an individual. I spent over 2+ years at a job site before I actually met an AECOM Chief or overall discipline manager or higher.I began my career here and all the people have been friendly and I have learned and grown a lot in my career and as a person.  I have enjoyed my time with AECOM but feel I am wanting to grow more and they do not have the position I am looking for and I have a lot of motivation and drive and I am stuck now in my career.Worked with the legacy company Washington group and URS.  Once aecom took over the feel of a big company set in.  Soon it was evident all the company cared about is their bottom line.  Absolutely no thought given about their employees unless it somehow benefits the company.Benefits are a thing of the past for this company. Health insurance benefits are doubling in price and the coverage is going down. Look to spend 20-30% of your salary for health coverage. In 2017 you will be penalized for having a working spouse on your insurance plan.typical day went by kind of fast due to busy work and trying to not be fired. come in, get situated, grab tools and go out to the flight line. launch jet, recover jet, inspect jet.",201 to 500,San-Francisco,Oakland,CA,2016-09-14T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/0b1bce2a-d2c9-4820-aeca-5c576c272b85?mescoid=1900265001001&jobPosition=24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
