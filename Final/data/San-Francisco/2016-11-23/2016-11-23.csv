Co-workers were for the most part a lot of fun and very bright.  Middle level managers many times were looking up instead of helping to push their employees along to further their careers.  But still a great place to work.Google is a great place to work, hard deadlines but manageable, overall very nice atmosphere. Great people to work with.It is an enjoyable work environment, mainly because of the employees. The day can become tedious but the good company makes time go by quickly. The field (main) operators are also attentive and understanding. As long as the workflow is running smoothly, they are open to suggestions and willing to solve any issues. The least favorite thing about the job are the weather conditions. Being that transport is a vital part of the operation, it is a constant battle with the forces of nature depending on the season.Although my internship is unpaid, I strongly support the mission of the program that I volunteer with on behalf of Google.knowledge high tech and community with co-workers. Google glass.for sample: when I Coat. I just use 2 my fingers in the font of Coating machine, and the machine automatic they Coat the OPTIC themsefl.Fun working environment for young people. Good benefits, compensation and company perks. Encourages creativity and team work although most of daily communication is via computers and chat.Gave opportunity to work with experienced team members, Learned many things from their expertise likehow to meet ETA on timehow to handle multiple projectshow to meet client requirementshow to work with Tools and services like SIS, SSAS, SSRSperformed anomaly and cluster detectionlearned how to find the hidden information from large data sets.A lot of very smart people, with great ideas and the drive to innovate and make an impact.Many top performers advance to manager but often don't have people skills, nor the vocation to manage people. This is a problem management should address.No clear, focused direction from management (on my specific project).  Revolving door of Technical Project Managers...5 TPMs in 12 months.  With such a large and very talented staff on hand, the analogy of the US Marines being lead by the Keystone Cops comes to mind.  In the defense of the TPMs -- there most definitely ARE some great ones -- unfortunately, they're so over-burdened and spread so thin that I can't imagine how they're able to keep much of anything focused and on-track.The job has many great perks and personal development opportunity. The challenge keeps me interested and I love all the people I work with.Great benefits, great place to explore ideas and work with some of the brightest and kind people on earth. Transfers encouraged which creates a lot of opportunities, etc.A regular day for me is mostly busy ... receiving putting accessories into camp and Guts tickets . I'm on my feet 80% of the day due to Inventory as well as prepping task tickets. Management is pretty good no one over your back to micro manage. I have a hard working team . We work together and get the job done. The hardest part of my day i would say would be receiving pallets and putting them into google camp at the same time..Google helps you find any and everything you need that you search up, I use it myself when im looking for books, music, games, jobs, clothes, shoes, electronics, and more.Enjoyable work space. People seems very nice. Good perks.They're take care of their people with respect. Facilities are amazing. It deserve its reputation as one of the best company you could work for.A company with great culture, ability to constantly learn and develop, and add value to the business. World class perks and benefits, and  top rated talent.I have worked there over  a year and the leadership, environment and atmosphere is open, fun, attentive and they treat their people with respect and admiration.Managers have full reign to steer you in one direction, then turn around and criticize you when they change course. Co-workers are competitive and cut throat and will also try to manipulate situations.  HR does not help you.  Managers are able to tell their employees to threaten their staff and HR and Senior managers do nothing. The company hires under work permits so they don't have to pay double tax. This means you're not entitled to unemployment and cobra health care.  Google is the new Microsoft and the technology is dead.Working here is link dream come true. I got many things to learn and the work environment is amazing. If offered a full time I would certainly join it againWish there was no 2 year contract,probably would still be working there. Always kept us busy and had time limits to get things done by the end of the day.Good culture, environment,people, innovation,. And so many things to learn with..Need to give more respect with TVC as same as FTEThe people i worked with were very friendly and informative, especially when i was first starting out. It's not a difficult job, it doesn't require much besides punctuality and care.","10,000+",San-Francisco,South San Francisco,CA,2016-11-23T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/88b9c110-71d2-42eb-b826-4c5dbd2a5cea?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
