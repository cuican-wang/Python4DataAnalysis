337,338.0,Sr. GIS Engineer,Blackberry Limited,4.5,4.0,"BlackBerry was a great place to work at its height. Many changes since new management team implemented Android focused hardware and BlackBerry software.I consider Blackberry Limited an excellent high tech company, with with opportunities for quick exposure, responsibility, and advancement, which have only increased since they started go worldwide, they are positioned to grow exponentially over the next several years. Most of the cultural elements that made Blackberry great are still defining of Strategy to focus on technology and consumer response to their new products.The company is happy with you as long as you do your job and give your best. It is very flexible when it comes to the working hours. BlackBerry has a lot of intelligent engineers who are very good mentors, they will help you out with anything and everything. Working there I got so much in return because I learnt a huge deal and understand the work life better. The teammates are always helping and are always ready to explain you things when you don't understand something. At times it would get stressful, however I believe that it is the stress level and the difficulty of the job that keeps us going and striving for excellence, by making it an adventure to work for the company. All the teams always help each other out, inter-teams and intra-teams, when in confusion and there is always discussions going on within the team which is makes it a better place to work for.Great place to get the exposure on the cutting edge technologies, flexible, caring and friendly working environment.",,San-Francisco,San Mateo,CA,2016-07-25T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/a80f7f03-f9e5-4205-8a00-2b5c22fbdf40?mescoid=1500140001001&jobPosition=33,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
