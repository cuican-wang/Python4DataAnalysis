169,170.0,Senior Data Scientist - Commercial Business,Auction.com,3.5,43.0,"The staff level employees are great and I met a lot of wonderful people during the time I worked there. Middle-management needs a lot of work. People tend to get promoted based on who they know or how long they've been there and not based on if they can handle the job. There is a big disconnect between staff level employees and upper management due to middle-management not reporting actual problems that are going on to cover themselves. There is a lot of favoritism and nepotism. Room for advancement is virtually impossible some departments do not let you leave to work in another department. I think executive level management really needs to sit down and talk to staff level employees to find out what is really going on because they would be shocked. During the time I was there I didn't encounter many people that were actually happy working there most people felt stuck and were very unhappyGreat culture overall. Casual. Fun. Collaborative. Open communication. Intelligent. Forward Thinking. Innovative. Pushing the limits of engineering the in the online housing marketDo not work this company.  They do not provide benefits, sick days, vacation even working  40 hours a week.  They reduce hours without pay benefits .  It is very politic and race cards.  Hopefully they hire new management team.  Not do what they say in their business.  Lot of customer complaints.a typical day is spent at your desk calling a min of  50 a day. it is very very repetitive. very redundant! the management is a bit unorganized. the bonus guidelines at not clear. the work environment is relaxed. and the people are great.good, strong company model. People I work with are great. I like going to work and knowing I am helping the public get a little bit of happiness.Large scale company and it all depends on what your looking for.  Great part time/flexible schedule for Auction manager, coordinator and concierge type roles.  Difficult to advance/move up if you want to take it further.  Most of the best full time jobs are in California, texas and new york.Nice place, constant work, great coworkers, company was sold and is no longer an option for employment. Typical day was typically busy, very few surprisesLove this, great experience, great people. I like being able to learn new things. each time is a new learning experience.There is something new always happening within the company in a good way. New clients, new system updates, new processes.Good salary. Work life balance is average. Overall the company is a good company to work for within the Real Estate community.Contract writing lots of phone calls Customer servicegreat working environmenteveryone is friendlyvery good support team great trainingroom for advancementAuction.com is a great place to work.  Management is changing for the better and we are definitely on a trajectory.  Non-performers are weeded out quickly and the culture is great.  A well established company with a start-up vibe, and many perks.  Perks include free lunch, game room, and many learning opportunities.I loved working for Auction.com.  They were great to their employees and provided a great work/life balance.Highly recommendBeing hired with Auction is a short term employment not long term.  Upper management did not care about their employees nor the long hours they stayed to complete the daily reports and work load.I love working with people and helping them. I got to speak with people from all over the world.What I learned is that it cost me nothing to me kind and pleasant to people. A lot of times our clients do not do their home work so to speak. Which meant al lot of questions I would have to go over with them. But the best feeling is when they understood and were happy I took time with them.This Company does a poor job at growing talent from within. Lacks motivation for employees to excel up in the OrganizationThere is no room for advancement within the company. You would have to kiss a lot of butt cheek to move up. Management is horrible, company is a joke, all the executive want more money in there pocket and treated the little guy as dirt.Not recommended for referral. No additional information can be provided. Located in Irvine, CA. Experience may vary by department. Company remains in transition since recent merger.Advancement is difficult at best. Almost never any openings. Bonuses are not based on your individual efforts for the most part. However, the atmosphere is great, co-workers always help one another. The work is always fast-paced, but almost never unbearable.Great Pay.Management is very poor. Company does not care for anyone. Hours very Flexible.I work as a Contract Writer at the monthly Auctions in Georgia. I've been with the company for about a year, but have only done a handful of auctions. The people are amazing, very friendly and helpful. Everyone really works as a team and carries their own weight! You also start to grow attached to the county that you work in because you begin to learn and become friendly with the people who attend the auctions (most of the properties are bought by companies that attend every month).The work is simple, but you do need to have an eye for detail. You are dealing with property transactions! Plenty of money that you will be handling. They hold training classes EVERY month the Saturday before the auction because it is crucial that no mistakes are made.They have started using an iPad app to do the contracts. While I love them when it works there are still quite a few things that can make using them a pain (if it goes to sleep in the middle of the contract it can delete all the info you've entered). As for the customers, like I said, they come every month. Some of them can be short with you and seem cold, but most of them are very friendly. I have a sneaking suspicion that some of them just come for social hour, lol! But they know what they are doing and don't play games about it, so make sure you listen well in training.However, as a bad note when I first started I did one auction. Then was placed on standby for almost 6 months. I guess they over-hired when I was hired, but then after people started leaving I was able to work more. Now I'm an essential part of my county's  more... team and doubt I will be placed on standby again. So be prepared for that possibility.Another bad note, when I started the pay was $25/hour. Then it was moved to $20/hour with no notice except when my paycheck felt lighter. Pretty unprofessional.  less","501 to 1,000",San-Francisco,Belmont,CA,2016-10-17T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/6911c89a-f39e-4c6c-a830-ea792a135aa2?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

369,370.0,Speech Analytics Engineer,SRI International,3.8,57.0,"Great work flexibility, low pressure environment. Management tends to work in a vacuum and does not promote team environment. Culture is very unique overallI worked for SRI International for 9 years, they never ceased to amaze me with what they were working on. SRI always is out looking for new and better ways to satisfy the customer.SRI Harrisonburg is a beautiful site, good facility. Right now it suffers from not having its own HR department, and decisions are made by HQ. Half the labs are empty, waiting to be filled.It was one of my first jobs in the field outside of school and definitely a learning/growing experience.  I have many fond memories of this place.SRI International is a good non-profit company, but it has undergone some significant changes in senior management in recent years. I am not really sure about the direction of the company any more, but the people there are top notch.SRI International is so multi-faceted, opinions in the suggested areas are bound to vary from person to person.  For instance, people working in support roles have a pretty set schedule, as with most jobs, while engineers and research personnel often have a more flexible schedule.Most of what I learned would fall under the heading ""Intangibles"", other than properly filling out documentation for the project I worked with, according to the client's guidance.Management seems to be hesitant in holding people as accountable as their peers would like, but that is a reality of any Project-type environment:  the majority of team members primarily work for someone else, and can always opt to leave.The hardest part of my job was working at such a distance that timely responses were not always possible from the corporate end.  I was in a decided minority compared to the majority of the work situations.The most enjoyable was the confidence my supervisors had in my abilities, and their consistent and constant support, as well as the timely mentorship.My supervisor did not train me very well with the everyday assignments that was given to me daily.  My co-workers did not want to cover for me at the front desk for breaks and lunch breaks.  My eleven months with this company was not very good.Working with scientist and engineers is my favorite. We had government contracts, and so it was tedious at times.  The people were superb.  Special project on new lines of business, computer systems modernization, and spin offs kept us busy. Stable and rewarding environment.   No stock options!Day to day busy with one duty or another. You always have someone to give you good advice. Its up to you to come prepare to do what is needed to be done.SRI is on the cutting edge in many areas of research,   the culture inspires individuals to do their best and is open to many areas of  interest.   The people are great to work for and there is a culture of working together to enjoy work and comradery among the employees.Decent work place with friendly supportive management. This site is relative new but the productivity is going up and all the numbers are ok.A good company with a diverse employee base, as well as high-level technology.Lots to keep up with, if you're ""up to the task"".Employees receive training in many different areas of specialty, so this company is a great first job for people.The management can overlook the forest for the trees and very rarely sees the big picture. Inconsistent criteria for advancement. Compensation is low for the amount of work required (overtime will be scheduled to the point where one's work/life balance will be disrupted).As a four year veteran who is just now taking his own advice - do the work, get your training, excel at it, but don't stay here too long.Confusing management system.  The workforce is growing very old and they are having a hard time attracting younger people.I believe that any typical day at any job is the same all around. There are times when you could be busy all day, that you don't even realize where the time has gone. And then there are the days when  work is slow that you have to go around asking for work, just trying to look busy. Management was real kick back, but firm when need be. But very open minded people. Not hard to get along with at all. I would have to say that the hardest part about the job was having to pick up after the technicians and maintain the medical supplies in the warehouse. And the most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things and meeting people with many different personalities and characters.A typical day of work for a Corporate Security Professional is never the same. I learned that most of the time people are not recognized for their hard work, but instead humiliated for any type of mistake made.A reputable institution and for someone without an PhD, it's a good start. It's very old school so there's very little room to move up without a PhD. I've worked in labs where education was second to skill base, although at SRI I found it difficult to be taken seriously unless you have a PhD.SRI Culture is described as a ""Google"" like campus with senior professors, professionals that create and innovate. Diverse market source for R&D.I've been with Sarnoff and SRI International for the past 16 years.It is a great place to work. I am intrigued with world changing  technology. It changes at a days notice.No two days are ever the same.Great management and colleagues with awesome personalities.Hardest part is the deadline, everything has a deadline. But we tend to work well under pressure.Most enjoyable would be the day to day. I truly enjoy my job and the people I work for  and with.SRI International is an innovative company that is very creative and has many hard working folks who put a lot of time and effort in assisting the Military in their mission.  The XCTC program and FlexTrain Home Station programs are very good tools that were created to meet the digital training requirements for National Guard Bureau and have accomplished this many times over.Multi-tasking with various clients for engineering research proposal development.",,San-Francisco,Menlo Park,CA,2016-10-17T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/cb23bbf0-d581-49b5-867f-f22b68df8bfb?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=30,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
