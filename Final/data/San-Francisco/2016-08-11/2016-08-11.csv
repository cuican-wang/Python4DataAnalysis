140,141.0,Principal Data Scientist (User Data),Thomson Reuters Corporation,4.0,1600.0,"Thomson Reuters provides very good work life balance. The co-workers are good and it is a fun place to be. The salary is not bad and you feel fulfilled because of it.Working here opens the doors to so many opportunities.  Their training for interns puts more emphasis on preparing you for the future you desire than a future with the company, and the VP of Customer Operations takes the time to learn everybody's names and get to know you pretty well.  Strong emphasis on work/life balance at this company.  They ask that you don't take your work home with you, and they are heavy on the coffee breaks.Overall great place to work!Tax and Accounting Department doesn't seem to be doing the things necessary to have long term employment for their sales personnel. Products are outdated and over priced, the way people sell them now devalues their prices in the first place, creating two seasons where you can sell products - q2, and q4. Pay was continually downgraded - they would up your base salary and completely soften your commissions. The third year of my employment I would have had to sell 150K more than I sold my second year to make the same amount of money. Pressure from management to make a certain number of dials a day, you're monitored, and if you don't hit your numbers - whether sales or dials you are on this ice. Out perform your team and go two hundred percent of quota? you're still there late at the end of the month, and management is extremely quick to forget your performance if you have a lackluster quarter due to their poor business strategy. The training here is top notch, and the managers are mostly good.Great products, good company, pretty tough when it comes to work life balance.  I have worked here for over 3 years and almost every week I work 70 hours or more.  It's very tough to take a vacation and succeed.  If you are single and/or don't have a life, it's great because you can make a lot of money.  If you have a family and you are dedicated to your family, it can be really rough.  The health care benefits are pretty expensive.It has been several years since I worked here. When I did work there, they had a very family oriented work place. My wife was going through some health issues and they were very understanding, sometimes going above and beyond what most people would do. At the time I worked there, before the implementation of obamacare, they had outstanding health, dental and vision insurance. I am not sure what it is now. I saw several people move up within the company which was a really nice change from some companies I have worked for.Good work-life balance; nice people. Good pay and benefits.  Nice and supportive culture. Management is supportive and company offers lots of opportunities for career and personal growthThe management in this organization is extremely supportive and provide you opportunities to grow and thrive in a competitive environment. This company will drive you to be self motivated and will allow you to be truly successful.Enjoyable place to work. Would like to see more stability and less change.  Micromanagement is everywhere and the next change is always just around the corner. It is hard to be effective in an environment where you are always looking over your shoulder.Good idea of work/life balance, but very understaffed, so, typically 40+ hours week with a lot of stress and pressure of deadlines. Low salary. Very nice team members. Flexible schedule with possibility of working from home. Good benefits.At times the hours could be long, and there were some layoffs, but if you put in some effort there were many opportunities to expand your skills and learn new things. Compensation could vary a lot, but the benefits package was really good.Great company to work for, good people.  The management was great to work for.  The company provides a good workplace environment.  They provide many learning opportunities as well.It has been a pleasure to work at Thomson Reuters. Benefits and pay are great. Management is outstanding. The company culture is one of a kind. I would recommend Thomson Reuters to anyone.We're a huge OLD company that was the result of 100s of acquisitions. Compared to Google, a Software Engineer wouldn't want to be here. It's not tailored for high caliber engineers who are highly paid and who's time is highly respected. Bureaucracy is all over the place. From HR, to project team level.My manager is a great person, that's the main reason I'm still here. Also, our benefits are top notch, not our perks though.The benefits are declining, the management i always changing and their is always uncertainty as to who will be in charge the next week and if you will have a job.people here is greatcompany culture is not focused on technologymanagement is reasonable, but salary is stagnantbenefit is very badIf you are looking for a company with great flexibility and work/life balance, Thomson Reuters is the place for you. Perfect place to have a fulfilling career, but also time to enjoy life.Thomson Reuters is a great company for individuals with families and children. They have great benefits with excellent personal time off /vacation time.Nice place to work at, with a great work/life balance and competitive compensation and benefits. The environment is nice with a perfect mix of old school professional and millennials.If you're into chaos and enjoy a fast-paced, frequently changing environment, then this is the place for you.There is certainly a ""Work hard, play hard"" ethic here.  Many people work a significant amount of hours, but are also compensated for their efforts in the form of recognition, bonuses, etc.Management has a clear vision and is constantly trying to tune the internal engine to perform as good as possible.Overall a good place to work.The one downside is the ""Mothership"" mentality of the folks in Eagan, MN.   Although the CEO resides in New York City, the largest percentage of employees are located in Eagan, MN.   The Eagan folks have an ""Eagan First"" mentality and staff at other locations are all expected to fall in-line with Eagan's way of doing business.Lots of cold calls. Micro-management. Emails at all times of the day. Never seen a company with so many emails from management. It seems they justify their positions through the number of emails they send out. Quotas are nearly the same in all territories whether you have Silicon Valley, Manhattan or rural Nebraska. Management views any negative feedback as complaining or whining, thus stifling objective and constructive feedback from field reps.Great company to work for as far as benefits! I truly enjoyed my time working in their tax and accounting department. They also offer a substantial amount of PTO","10,000+",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-08-11T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/d8dc75bb-0dc9-446f-a709-312a2d1ccedf?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=9,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
