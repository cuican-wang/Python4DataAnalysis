367,368.0,Bioinformatics Senior Staff Scientist,Integrated DNA Technologies,3.7,15.0,"This company give a great opportunity for getting into biochemistry type of jobs. Work environment is typically friendly. There are great benefits and vacation days.Didn't really interact with anyone outside the department I worked in, but overall people seemed nice.  It appeared at the time they were experiencing a high turnover...As with anything, change is inevitable. The core of the business is changing and so is the culture. The company has done great over the years and grown tremendously.A great place to work. They care about their employees and it is really starting to show. The direction that the company is heading is very exciting.I ship dna and pick orders. my co workers are easy to get along with. management could be better. there is no real hard part about this job.was great place to work-everyone helped everyone-had lunches at meeting every week.when a problem occurred management helped solve them.We column load 96 well synth plates, DNA/RNA synthesize, deprotect the oligos, place them in hot/cold bath for an extended amount of time, dry the plates down, resuspend them in water or hepes depending on if it's DNA/RNA, we test there optical density levels, and if everything passes it goes to the tube room where it each well in the depro plate receives its own tube and label. Solution from depro plate is then transferred to the each individual tube on the rack it's assigned to, dried down again on what we call our IVAPS, capped after their dry and then shipped off to the customer who ordered the oligos. The night crew I work with are overall enjoyable to be around and work alongside. I learned a lot about DNA synthesize, oligos peaks, and so on.My time as an intern helped me see how much the employees enjoyed their jobs. They were always willing to help educate us on new policies and procedures. Everyone was more than willing to be helpful and helped prove that they were trying their hardest ensure our food safety.I have worked at IDT for almost 3 years.  In my particular department there is no opportunity for advancement and the managerial style is bad.  The company overall is fine but there are issues between departments that could easily be dealt with by having better leadership structure.Pros: PTO, Good resume builder if need work history right out of collegeCons: Limited on advancement, quality feels like it is decreasing as the company is getting bigger, i have generally been lucky but raises can be 0%-6%This job was very repeatative but again my co-workers made it a fun work environment.Great place to work.  Very supportive, has great compensation and benefits.  Treats employees with much respect.I enjoyed my time at IDT but they just don't pay enough to stay competitive which is really a disappointment.This company geve me my start in HR and I loved that it was very employee focused.The company is an excellent place to start your career right out of college. You gain valuable skills and have an opportunity for advancement. The compensation is slightly lacking compared to companines with similar oppotunities. The benefits package is amazing.",,San-Francisco,Redwood City,CA,2016-10-21T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/cce92c6b-b9cd-4caa-bc01-356badfa139a?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=28,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
