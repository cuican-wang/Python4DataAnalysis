95,96.0,Data Scientist,W2O Group,3.5,4.0,"With a client-minded flexible schedule, you are largely free to do your own work and be responsible for your deliverables. A typical day for me is different because I work in IT. I get to see the troubles that people face each day and learn from each experience and that's a unique perspective that most people don't benefit from.The hardest part of the job has been an inability to align my department's goals with the company's goals because that information either isn't communicated or not communicated well enough.The most enjoyable part of my job is the flexibility to try new technologies and coerce people into beta testing for others in the company!I enjoy working at W2O for almost seven years now.  I have great account team and finance co-workers to work with.It has been an okay place to work. A lot of turn over, which is typical for a PR Firm.Private company so finance rules are a bit loose, which is sometimes hard to deal with.So many changes since I started.
