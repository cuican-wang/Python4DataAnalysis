8,9.0,"Staff Scientist, (Accelerator Directorate, Accelerator Diagnostics Department Head)",SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory,4.3,10.0,"SLAC is a wonderful place to work.  SLAC is a DOE laboratory operated by Stanford University, meaning employees get the perks of being Stanford staff and can also enjoy being part of the global accelerator community.  Employees generally stay around for many years, even decades, since they love the work, publishing papers, and attending international conferences.  Operating an accelerator 24-7 creates a job culture where people want to work long hours and often don't notice they're working late when they're working together to setup the beam for an experiment.However, affordable housing and childcare is difficult to find in the area, pushing more young families to commute long distances or move on to other laboratories.  The waiting lists for infant care often exceeds a year and long commutes put a substantial strain on the work-life balance.Used to be a great place to work and be immersed in pure science. The lab is compartmentalized into fiefdoms which are all different from each other. The best-funded division is LCLS and has a lot of potential.number of smart people to work with;  enjoy the work, but budget is unstable; origination changed frequently; in-consistent management;people are busy, don't have much time to chat.Great place to be exposed to desk work and business work. It is also a great place to get exposed to the financial part of a company.Great opportunity to work with a wide range of employees in developing new horizons in science provide profession growth and life balance.Stanford University is a beautiful place to work. Benefits are excellent. The company is very diverse and it was enjoyable working   with other people from around the globe.My typical day at work includes both office work ad experimental hands-ons. Learned a lot during my past four years here and enjoyed it! People are in general easy-going, proficient, and helpful here. The hardest part of my job is the flexible and sometimes unpredictable work hours.It is a good environment to come to work everyday. I've learned new things which the physicists had discovered during their experiences such as new atoms. My co-workers are very friendly. We have  gone out for lunch and talked about our social life. We have had a big gym in the lab. We can sign up for exercise classes or do on our own time during break, lunch, or after work. The hard part of the job is the funding from the government. If the DOE will not give us enough funding there will be some laid off. Over all, it is a nice place to work.It were many interesting projects. The team work was very fruitful, people were friendly and supportive.It was good time!I Enjoyed working there; people are nice and mostly cooperative. It has a decent benefits package. Commute to work is not difficult. For most of the positions, hours are flexible.",,San-Francisco,Menlo Park,CA,2016-11-09T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/staff-scientist-accelerator-directorate-accelerator-diagnostics-department-head-job-menlo-park-ca-us-175747345.aspx?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

93,94.0,Data Scientist - Marketing,McKinsey,4.3,173.0,"*Smart, hard-working people everywhere you look*Management invests in helping individuals develop professionally*Collaborative, supportive environment (if occasionally stressful)*Fantastic topics that matterFun environment where employees become a close knit community and become life long friends.  Employees are highly intelligent and have rock solid values.  The benefits are incredible, and work/life balance is a priority.  The only drawback is that there isn't any growth opportunity for the support staff.  As a non-hierarchical company, employees are all equal, so promotions do not exist.  Unfortunately, the job responsibilities never change, which can eventually create boredom in this position even though the position is very fast paced with a heavy workload.I have enjoyed working for this company and have gained a lot of experience in accounting, finance, HR, and office management. However, the opportunity to expand and grow in the finance field is rather limited and doesn't fully align with my ultimate career goals.Most management that work under Procurement- GPG- do not have experience in procurement. They are only there because they know someone higher up. It's a great company if you work on the consulting side and starting at the bottom will not get you there. They only hire consultants from top 10% in ivy league schools. If you work as an assistant in procurement, be careful who your managers are. Some will belittle you, yell at you in from of people over the most stupid thing and require you to take a test before being hired which doesn't apply to assistant work at all. Benefits are great if you are a full time employee and they won't let you take time off in the first year. Following year, approach with caution. This place is all about politics and favoritism. If you get on the wrong side of a manager, you won't get a promotion. They are experts are making you believe you will move up and when the time comes they will give you some excuse. They will try to give you the least amount of money and work you like a dog.Only good to put on resume because of the name.I need to put 150 characters here. It was a good experience and I learned a lot when working here. The culture and atmosphere simply fostered excellence.They really try to build you up and make you succeed in your time there, helping with advancement.They keep the kitchen fully stocked and have regular reviews to ensure the entire team understands where the projects stand and how to improve/lessons learned.Many e-mails.  Travel arrangements. Meeting scheduling.Learned to be extra pro-active.Management of support staff is fair.Great peers - always ready to help each other.Hardest part of job is constant change of schedules.Enjoyable part of job is figuring out complex travel arrangements and offering solutions.Exceptional workplace where you get to work with some really smart people. You get to do interesting work in a fast paced environment.  Limited advancement opportunities and professional development.McKinsey & Company is one of the top companies to work for but beware that this only applies if you have a career as a Consultant, Engagement manager, etc and working on the Client side.  However if you're working in Operations, Reconciliations, Card Service, Purchasing, Procurement... you won't have a life, you will be humiliated, yelled at and you will put in more than 50 hours a week. Yes you'll have great benefits and vacations but you'll work during your vacation or expect a call from your manager.  If you leave on vacation, you'll pay the price when you return.  It's a nightmare.  Some that have been there for several years, are use to this type of treatment and think this is normal. Leaving that place was the best thing I've done!!  The only positive thing was to have McKinsey in my resume which it landed me a great job with great people who actually treat me with respect. I want people to know so they won't go through the same nightmare I went through. If you land an interview, please ask the right questions, make sure this place is for you.  Ask the employees questions about their supervisor, manager, etc, ask them if there happy, ask about work & life balance. Think twice about it if you have a family and kids... because you won't be spending much time with them.Pros: fast learning curve; working with smart people; exposure to a variety of different topics/industries;good training programs and exit optionsCons: poor life balanceLarge variety of challenging clients & situations across the globe and incredible people to work with.  Plenty of opportunity and ability to forge your own path.A place where you can explore you area of interest. Good people. Daily you will learn new things . You can travel all around the Globe on various engagements.This company has many good qualities preferred skills and knowledge can be implemented in future job replacements to better advance your professional needs.Come in early and enter day in a very easy going environment. It was a lot of tedious work but it flew by and it was a great learning experienceSet up equipment for consultants. The processes of internal technology. Co-workers were self centered. Working around the strict budget placed on IT.People:-- Surrounded by some of the most talented, impact-driven people of any organization-- Contrary to most expectations, the people are interesting and interested, and much more interested in solving problems than career advancement or office politics.Lifestlye:-- Travel and hours can be challenging, but most of it is self-enforced. There is a tradeoff between location/lifestyle/sector for any project, and you can't always have all 3.Too many arrogant people... although others are very nice.Your life depends completely on your engagement manager. If you have a complete lunatic, your live will be terrible. Otherwise, you may be happy...Great place to work; very difficult business problems and high exposure to c-suite executivesOne of the best companies to start a career in but sustainable work life balance is difficult to achieve, especially as you take up senior rolesIncredible people, pay, training, benefits, and career opportunities during and post-.  Work/life balance has a lot of room for improvement.McKinsey provides excellent benefits and a bright, airy, warm work setting. Non-management salaries are minimal and advancement is extremely limited.","10,000+",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-11-09T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/a8b7f6a7-ae5e-431d-98f2-1f0977da8983?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=32,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

Allowed me to utilize an environmental education role that I previously had no experience in. And gave me many independent projects and management roles.only worked two weeks, hard work, driving time. it sucks to only work two weeks at temp job. was looking for full-time job with benefitsReally great place to work in and a great work environment. There is a lot of work to do, everyday is different challenge. The way the department is managed is perfect.Providing technical support for the special agents and maintainingthe DEA radio system. Learned a lot about law enforcement.Management was ok.  Co workers were the best. Hardest part of the job were long hours. Most enjoyable part was a successful criminalcase.The best part of this job is being a National Park Service Ranger. Everyone who comes in says ""you're so lucky to have this job!!"" To do it well it means working hard, spending a lot of hours of preparing programs and sometimes, waiting for hours on a ridgeline for wildlife that decide to go somewhere else on a whim. The vast majority of the jobs the the NPS are seasonal, summer type jobs, so that's one reason you'll see a lot of retirees as Park Rangers. When you only have work for 6 months a year, you need a 2nd source of income. There are generally very few people out in the parks who don't really want to be there, so the working environment is great.To look for NPS jobs, you have to find them on USAJobs, the Government's official website. Search where you want to work and be sure to tailor your USAJobs resume specifically to the opening you are applying for.best job I have ever had though it was unfortunately a seasonal position. The company itself had great job security for full time workers as well as noteworthy benefits. The job itself was hard work but very fulfilling.on certain days I would go in and do maintenance at the main office fixing things like electrical problems, Repairing buildings, Installing siding on buildings, Installing Instillation under buildings, and on days im not at office I would go out to camp grounds and keep up with the camp grounds and fix and repair things such as fixing broken door handles, Installing water pumps, Installing solar panels, Installing hot water heatersMy direct manager was wonderful. She tried everything she could to get me on permanent, was like pulling teeth in the State Office, not because of work performance but because I had no military status. I held very good positions because of manager but was not paid for those positions. The experience was well worth it. I learned about project analysis and project management. Took courses held through the Federal Government for Federal Appropriations Law and Project Management. Assisted in multi-million dollars budgeting and database management in financing. If I could only rate Karla Norris...she was an exceptional manager. Because I worked for the federal government most of us were not native to the area..different walks of life, great working with people from all over the united states.Excitimg career choice nevera dull moment. Damgerous but rewarding. Tons of opportunities for growth.   Senior officers are nice and very open with help and leading new officersIt was an amazing experience to associate with wildland firefighters (an incredible group of people).  In coordinating training within the State of Utah, working with State and Federal organizations, I learned a lot and learned to work with an appreciate a 'work culture' previously unknown to me.The system includes 413 areas covering more than 84 million acres in every state, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. These areas include national parks, monuments, battlefields, military parks, historical parks, historic sites, lake shores, seashores, recreation areas, scenic rivers and trails, and the White House.I thoroughly enjoyed working for DOI. The work was challenging at times, but always enjoyable. My coworkers and management were so easy to get along with that it made my job much more enjoyable.The best people I have ever worked with and would like to stay but I must work on 100 ton vessel to advance my license. I have worked there for two years and have enough time to upgrade to 1600 Mate. Would like to get more time on 100 ton vessel to upgrade to 500 ton Master.good job just needs better job security. however work is starting to heat up so overall a great place to work. a typical day would be getting to job setting up equipment and taking care of business.I only worked with the NPS for a summer. The entire summer was full of fun and learning experiences. They had a lot of things for us to do on the weekends when we weren't working such as traveling to different parks, learning about the NPS, going to DC, among other exciting experiences. I would love to work for them again.Management is aweful.  They only care about themselves and getting promoted.  Management doesn't care about the actual workers.Learned how to get things done in a GOV environment. It is different than Commercial workflow. I also gained the experience of a Nation wide collaboration of combined systems and people.Although my work in the federal service has been incredibly rewarding and my career has continuously progressed, my passion lies in community engagement and meeting the needs of the people within my community. My ability to lead is the richest when I am focused on leading a team that is focused on building a better future for youth, families and the surrounding communities.The DOI is one of many Government agencies that represent the worst that the Federal Government has to offer. The have taken full time positions and re defined them as term positions or seasonal positions. Advancement is impossible unless you are on the ""in"" with the agency. Nepotism is rampant and pay is low.I really enjoyed saving people lives and property. It gave me a sense of happiness and joy knowing that I help someone who need it my help. I enjoy traveling seeing nice forest and other towns that I never seen before. Enjoy seeing animals in the wild.Great place of business. Room for growth and learning. Great opportunities. Great atmosphere. I loved this place.

This was frustrating. I learned how to wash dishes. hardest part was doing that all day.A typical day at Andiamo includes setting up section or bar (depending on position that day). Servers work on all opening duties such as: butters, waters, parmesan, salad dressing, snacks(during shows) and polishing their sections. Bartenders opening duties are making sure you have all the glassware you'll need, stocking your bar with beer, wine, and any liquor you may need and cutting fruit.I've learned a lot during my time at Andiamo, I've learned how to talk to people, bus trays, food services, even food preparation. Management is a little scattered sometimes, but overall they're a good team. My coworkers all stick together, like a family, and always have each others backs when we need it but like all families once in a while there is a bit of drama.
