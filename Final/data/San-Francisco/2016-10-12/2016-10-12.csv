578,579.0,"Medical Science Liaison, Facial Aesthetics- Northern California","Allergan, Inc.",3.8,469.0,"The people here are wonderful to work with. I wish the company was a little less old fashioned and would allow telecommuting.Allergan is the result of mergers and acquisitions and as such comes changes and job uncertainty. As with all changes come some good management and some arrogant management, with the latter a reason for good people not to stay. When you hear the peers of the bad manager even criticizes them it make you wonder why they are kept on in the first place.Allergan is a strong company that has always had a great culture.  The work/life balance is good.  The benefits and good, but have been slipping over the last few years.  Following the merger with Actavis, the company has been overly focused on mergers and acquisitions and less concerned about research and growing existing product lines.As far as warehouses are concerned, this was a laid back place to work but we also took our jobs very seriously. Management was great and co-workers worked hard.I worked there for over 5 years before the location shut down due to lack of work, combined with other reasons. I really did enjoy the responsibility that the job required.selling devices, aesthetics and pharmaceuticals for a top notch fortune 500 leader. innovative and growth pharma on the frontier.  Selling to physicians, hospitals and group purchasing organizations and having the ability to negotiate contracts is a must.  you need to be driven and a leader. Management qualitiesAllergan is an awesome company to work for. You get surprise rewards and days off. Our Sr. Site Director has an open door policy. She listens and is really great. The company is understanding to life events and changes. We have a Monday thru Friday schedule only and get all respected holidays off with pay. You couldn't ask for more than that.Allergan is a forward thinking company that considers its employees as an asset to its success. Great management teams and benefits. A global technology leader and is on the cutting edge of science and technology. They have great benefits and a strong team environment.Great teamwork environment. manageable travel requirements. Supervisors encourage autonomy.Excellent training for me as a new position in the role of MSL in a new division.Excellent small immediate team with great extensions.Hardest part of the job was back to back conferences is multiple cities.Best part of the job fostered independence with weekly conferences with supervisor.I was given opportunities to learn different trades. I worked with different people. I enjoyed getting to know about different departments. My supervisor was always there if I had any questions and gave positive feedback and constructive criticism.After the Actavis merger and Allergan purchase, there was a rapid change in management  ( three managers in three years) that created a very challenging and strange work enviroment.Allergan is a nice company to work for that offers many opportunities with great benefits.  The Orange County campus has amazing talent. Work hours are flexible for most positions.Good place to work. Positive and friendly atmosphere. Can play basketball at lunch or go to the company cafeteria. Free gym for Allergan employees and secure parking with several ports for electric cars.Good culture with good leadership. Work life balance is not as good. Hard working people with a good compensation package. The opportunity for advancement is good since there are many divisions.I am grateful for the years at KMGL for teaching me how to be a hungry salesperson working for 100% commission.  My co-workers were fantastic and helped me to further grow in sales.  However, it is difficult to endorse a company that gives so little support and compensation to their sales staff.A tyical day at work begins with assessment of what previous shift had done and what is priority at the moment according to management business interest for the day.Team work are highly examplify in the way the process is arranged. No one person can run the process from start to finish. You need one or two people to verify part of the work you have done.The hardest part of the job is that some of the equipment in use is highly complex.Whenever target is met brings moment of celebration. This is my joyous moment.The people I work with throughout the US and even globally have been a real pleasure.  People are responsive and it's been a real team effort that's really hard to find these days.My only complaint is that the company is changing rapidly and there's really not a feeling of stability.  The buying and selling of assets is constant and at the highest level everyone else is just a number.  Once you get down to the director level and below it's the greatest of experiences, but the CEO only has corporate interests in mind.You can be relocated and happy you survived the most recent merger and then let go six months later in the next deal of a lifetime.Allergan is a terrific company with regards to the neuroscience division.  Botox is a tremendous product for their therapeutic indications, more specifically Chronic Migraine.  The direction of the company has become much more focused over the last 15 years.  Allergan is a wonderful company to work for, where I have developed great relations with many individuals.  Calling on key injectors in multiple cities.  The expectations from Allergan management is 6.5 call per day, which I exceeded.I learned how to evaluate situations which included; Sales data, understanding the color profiles of each office to effectively communicate with specific offices/individuals and forecasting sales results.My co-workers have been wonderful.  I have developed many lasting relationships with many individuals.The most difficult part of the job is at times, excessive administrative work with a short turnaround.  I enjoy selling Botox because of the benefits to patients, and listening to patients who rave about life changing results based on their therapyThe work is very easy an 3rd grader can do it, but the work environment and management is extremely poor. One the worst company's I have ever worked for. If one manager doesn't likes you the rest doesn't either, you never get off at shift end time. The worker's most of them are lazy and they don't do anything about it. They just had two lay offs and the last year and a half if you have standards do not apply for this company. The hiring manager feed you a bunch of lies to make you think it's a great company to only be hired and find out it was all lies!  Only great thing this company has to offer is health insurance.It's awful to see and hear from others how poor or non existent the culture is at this place.  Management (including Jr/Sr/Executive) is so poor due to the fact the CO only wants to save a buck by putting inexperienced and bewildered people in place just to follow orders like clowns and repeat their superiors like parrots.  It's a good place to stay away from!Great working environment.  Really good people who act very professional.  The only problem is that most of the jobs available are only contigient so the only benefits are what you get from the temp agency.Good leadership and co workers, also great benefits and time off. Also, great job to help start a career in pharmaceuticals.","10,000+",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-10-12T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/3cbc14aa-1c45-4d85-9e33-28ab671b09e4?mescoid=1900254001001&jobPosition=29,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
