467,468.0,Statistician Assistant,UCSF Medical Center,4.3,179.0,"Nurses are overworked. Needs updating. Hospital seems to be lacking funds to update facilities.Good place to work and obtain experience in specialties/fields.Great benefits, union benefits. Con no encouragement/chance for educational advancementFast paced, extremely busy work environment.  Great co-workers and friendly staff.  Great benefits package.  UCSF encourages growth and provides additional training when identified.As the second largest employer in the City, UCSF is made up of a diverse group of people. Many of my colleagues were a joy to work with, despite the fact that there was an almost unanimous feeling of being over-worked. The organization seems unnecessarily top heavy, with many layers of management, and I rarely felt supported by my superiors, either when I needed direction or when I felt overburdened by the number and variety of job requests.As a teaching institution, it is interesting to see many new developments implemented at the facility each day which keeps the employees on their toes with enhancing their knowledge. The management practices servant leadership, however, is often unsuccessful with carrying out such measures due to union contracts.  Co workers are great with collaboration of ideas and patient care techniques during difficult assignments.  The hardest part of the job is portraying efficiency at bedside while juggling a heavy assignment during short staffing.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that one gets to gain valuable knowledge every day via new patient care interventions and research conducted and published by the facility.This is a great place to work if you are looking for stability or have a family.  It is not a great place to work if you are needing to be challenge or need to be stimulated beyond your daily duties.  Opportunity for growth is very hard, you really have to go outside of your department in order to grow.I worked hard at my job for many years, Advancing at a great pace. We had a unique work environment, and we all got along quite well.i learned a bit of mainframe computing, I learned billing, collecting, NIH money and private funds processing.  I even negotiated some accounts with vendors. I learned even more medical terminology than I ever thought possible,The hardest part of the job was political, and why I left to go to graduate school. The head of our lab retired, and the management was never the same.I loved working at UC. It is a great place to work if you find your niche.UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland provides exceptional primary and sub-specialty care as well as access to cutting edge clinical research to a diverse patient population.There is great flexibility and buy-in from the clinical staff to conduct innovative clinical trials here due in large part to the fact that CHO is at heart a small hospital. The downside is that the bureaucracy is not  designed to support the research effort so roadblocks to hiring and financial management are frustrating.Working at the UCSF Campus was an amazing experience. It is a research hospital and they offer millions or opportunities to learn new skills and growth opportunities. San Francisco is a very diverse city and working at UCSF you are given the opportunity to learn about other cultures and their life practices. Management was well organized and informative. The hardest part of the job was being on-hand and witnessing Code Blue patients and their families.The  most enjoyable part of the job was learning and experiencing implementation of new methods, medications, and practices.The money is consistent, the people work hard at this outfit. The managers that I have worked for are really good, and they are very knowledgeable about procedures at hospital protocols* An overall great medical center to work for* Employees are great but not alwayscompensated for their effort* A great retirment plan* Has a lot of classes on line or in personEveryone in the departments extended their knowledge, thorough in the details of all assignments, very busy departments, heavy data entry, specimen cataloging, and filing.Overall, a great environment to spend 8hrs of your day.  Also, you got to have a strong stomach...you are surrounded by ""specimens""...sliced brains and other body parts.  Some of the research you do involves very graphic pictures of medical condition, it can be shocker.Excellent teaching hospital with a homey atmosphere for the children. Every employee takes pride in working at CHO, and professionals working together to take care of these special patients. Friendly co-workers make this teamwork gratifying. Very low turnover rate of employees, which tells you what a good place this is to work. Excellent benefits. The physical plant is old and there is a shortage of space, though work has begun on building a new hospital.There is no such thing as a typical day; every patient is different. Healthy mix of outpatients and inpatients. I have learned to improve my skills courtesy of my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the pediatric patients; it is fun seeing children all day, and fulfilling to help them through what can be a difficult experience. The hardest part of the job is dealing with moribund patients and witnessing the pain of patient's parents.just your typical work food place, serving, preparing, cleaning your station when sold out or done for the day, handling customers orders and modified orders. very fast pace during peak hours,  but management picks on you if you are young. other employees give you a hard time for the same reason.U.C.S.F. Pediatrics Benioff Hospital was the most enjoyable and rewarding place I have ever worked.  Very busy environment but organized with happy co workers/employees.  Everyone, from different professions, work together.  I was a happy employee because of the benefits, compensation, and the appreciation shown by management.Everyone I encountered was kind and loved their work. Staff are all supportive of each other and myself. The work was good and rewarding, and I enjoyed my time there. I learned many skills from juggling multiple projects at once, to valuable life skills, and many office skills that I hope to be able to utilize in a future job.UCSF gave me and opportunity to learn and grown within my family as well as within the world.I was given a chance to lean with ucsf and was able to take life by the bootstraps, I absolutely loved my time with ucsf, I would love to stay but san Francisco and the high rents are more of the issue.Working here is great, however, management needs to learn how to treat their employees better. The job is not easy, but it is rewarding. I enjoy helping patients.UCSF Medical Center is an exceptional place to work with good benefits. I work with Executives and Management that are very supportive and make work enjoyable.typical day is very simple.learned how to clean baby bed and clean pumps.management is very kind hearted.enjoyable part of the job is seeing the babies.This was a contract position to train staff in the use of new software.  Since it was in IT, the pay was extremely good, although as a contract employee, you aren't eligible for benefits.  My co-workers were probably 1/2 and 1/2 regarding a sense of professionalism and giving the best and most accurate information possible in the most professional manner possible.  There were both contract people on the project and UCSF employees.  The hardest thing was probably dealing with last minute changes and expectation that we weren't just flexible, but could indeed make the impossible happen.",,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-11-17T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/825d4e2a-b9ff-4ac3-a8ed-33c464d2fe79?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
