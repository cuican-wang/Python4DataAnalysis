They are on the forefront of addressing some of the most debilitating and devastating diseases.  Their culture is phenomenal and their benefits are great.I had a great time working at AbbVie. For an intern right out of high school I had a lot of freedom which was nice. Could have used a few more structured projects but it was good.Had an amazing experience working with the company, the employees and everyone at the company were very friendly. Very easy going workplace, everyone was available to help.AbbVie values its employees. Provides opportunities to grow and connect.Managements try their best to listen to employees and provide solutions. Projects goals that are inspiring and motivating.I had a great summer interning and combining my science skills with the business behind a pharma company. I had time to work on my own projects, conduct informational interviews, visit/tour different company sites, attend lectures, and network.Excellent company. Computer Operator Skills. Diversified employees and co-workers worked together on various projects. Meetings and luncheons given monthly.The project I was on was short term and didn't give me enough time to get a sense of the culture.  The people I met and worked with were kind and hard working.AbbVie Pharmaceuticals is simply a wonderful place to work. I was a  Change Management Consultant for the Purchasing Dept. I worked under wonderful people and was paid well. Can't say enough good things.Good company but limited growth potential. Not  as innovated as other organizations.Using older sales techniques to sell product.Good marketing department.Promotions are limited if you are in field sales.Still have low numbers of diversity in management positions.The company is great, the work is fun and there is a lot to learn so it is challenging in a good way. Benefits are awesome. But I have a lack of immediate Management.Not interested in providing a review of AbbVie. I have worked here for 3 years as a consultant but do not have enough exposure to the company to offer a thorough review.Many career opportunities. Theres something for everyone. Well managed and great benefits.

I enjoyed developing  new technical skills.Manufacturing organization that requires the best of any candidate that seeks employment.The work at times requires a seven day work week, this can be a benefit to some and not to others, depending on your life style.Lessons learned  while working here is the importance of product accountability, cGMP, FIFO, JIT and good record keeping.The product IPSWITCH  gives users the ability to share files within the company  and outside the company firewalls usually for 3rd party vendors to update and retrieve documents in a secure area. No limit on file sizes - disk space was always a concern.  A typical day at work would be setting up new users and creating the environment for each dept needs and use. The hardest part of the job was managing resources without clear and defined roles of who would be responsible for outcome deliverables. The most enjoyable part of the job was providing satisfaction and quick turn around time to Customers and as an alternative to the standard MQ messaging environment which was both costly and cumbersome for small business units within the organization.prepare a calls planings with pre-call analissis , looking for opportunities ,call pharmacies , learn more about health care products cover , learn more about physician situation , hard part is complete the 8 calls days , I like this jobs","10,000+",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-12-03T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/2efb8086-516f-4c21-b640-83bd99aae015?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Work Life balance is any oxymoron, a normal work week is 60+ hours.  Perhaps i have rose colored glasses thinking it will be any different with another manufacturer, but BD is taking advantage of too many good people and breaking them is disheartening.    It is unfortunate BD has changed so quickly, it was once a great place to work, it has the feel of a small private company with employee satisfaction at the forefront. Unfortunately the acquisition of debt has the company scrambling to pay back quickly no matter the cost or associate turnover.    My advice to management is to pay more attention to the associates and the company cash generation, the manufacturing plant.  Yes BD, you are a manufacturing company!It's not relevant to write a review on a company you may have worked for over ten years ago, things change, people change and management changes, please delete.Great Culture and people. Communication was not as great. Was there as a contractor and it seemed that the employees were really happy with BDTypical workday is very routine. Co-workers are great and the most enjoyable part of my job would be seeing the products we make benefit others health.Eight hour work days go smooth with balanced work load, and efficient leadership. Co-workers are helpful and professional. There is no hard part of the day.The Company having long history of commitment to the highest standard of excellence and high quality and integrity in everything that is provided to improve healthy lives.   Best place to work.  Higher  standard of employee benefits.Team leads and managers do not take ownership of anything in Global Support. There is no guidance to help someone through the BD culture. No training was provided, no clear direction to expectations, and no acceptance of any failures. When help was sought, leads always deflected to others in departments that were not part of global support. Leads were quick to throw others under the bus and got extremely upset if anyone complained.Great company to work for However, they rather hire contracted workers. The permanent  employees are extremely spoiled. you work from the time you walk in the door to the time you leave. Very fast paced company.Great place to work where employees are well respected and encouraged to help improve patients' lives. Strong social investing position. Good team work.One of the best and highest paying jobs I've ever had. I love that I don't have a manager breathing down my neck all day ""micromanaging"" me. However, many have been affected by recent lay-offs since BD acquired CareFusion...I am one of them!!!Friendly co workers. Free coffee. Very cold. Good Pay. Lots of traffic. Laid back environment. Not too strict. Meetings are plenty.The harder you work the more likely someone will take credit or set you up. It's those people who get promoted. External hires for all promotable positions instead of internal candidates is the way they like it. Unskilled external folks who need to be trained by tenured employees who are organizationally under them.Great place to work. A lot of opportunities within this organization here in the U.S or abroad. Fantastic culture that gives you a great work life balance for you and your family.very rewarding Job, as it focuses on people and building relationship.typically, I connect with a variety of people specific with the  healthcare professional, key professionals in charge to decide about improving healthcare practices. Our company is more on clinical solutions versus being a vendor alone.I Manufactured surgical drapes and post surgical opthalmic lens covers. Qaulity was very important here all products were made in accordance to very specific procedures. The management team was very good here and I was sorry to lose the job when they relocated to another state.Fun Place,worked as Sap BW,BO consultant and enjoyed the work with coworkers and learned other technologies and enjoyed to work here.explore more in this cmpany.This is a wonderful company. Great people to work with.Changing the world for better. BD helps people live healthy lives.Beautiful campus.Very good culture.Growing to fast thru acquisitions... Good benefits and PTO .Good Incentives for future planning.Sad they had to close facility and consolidate in San Jose.Management is fair and level headed. Lots of opportunity for advancement. Full time employees have excellent benefits, 99% of co-workers seem happy and easy going; they are very easy to work with. I am eager to get hired full time and spend my last ten years of employment (or more) here before I retire.Management at BD usually has someone in mind before they post a job.  Management is very closed minded.  BD's doesn't promote from within much.
