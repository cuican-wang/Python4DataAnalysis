224,225.0,Research Scientist,Us tech Solutions,3.0,18.0,"Great Staff. Enjoyable workplace. Aggressive Consulting Recruitment Co.Couldn't handle visa paper work for STEM OPT and made me loose my job and ruin my whole career.One of the reasons given was they don't want USCIS to come and check on them, but didn't give a proper explanation and just said that they won't sign the papers at all (All the other recruiting companies have signed the papers of their respective employees).Even after knowing that the whole situation was time sensitive, they didn't bother doing anything on time and after talking to lawyers about the things that they need to fill in the form, they ended up giving back a blank form, which they expected to submit it to USCIS.I have worked in this company for more then 2 Years .. it was a awesome place to work, the management is really very supportive . the work culture is very  good.*  Posting Lockboxes on a Daily Basic ;*  Posting Payments on Accounts and reviewing for errors and overpayment on a daily basic.I am not sure when job hunting became a telemarketing type thing but that is what this company does. They called me 10 times a day and sent me emails constantly for positions. 1st off, I do not work for someone I cannot understand. I also do not work for a company outside the US but uses a NJ phone number. That SCREAMS problems to me. I told them to take me off their list for over a year and they kept calling. I finally got nasty with them and told them I would report them to the gov't. They stated, and I quote, ""You put your phone number out on Monster so we can call all we want. If you do not want us to call, then do not put your phone number out on job sites. We are in India, you cannot do anything about it."" Talk about angry! I went off on her and explained if I got one more call or email from their unprofessional and nasty company I would hire an attorney and make sure I went after them for everything I could, as well as send information to the gov't to research them for terrorist activity since they felt they were above the law of other countries. So far, I have not received another call or email but it has only been a month. Even telling them I had a job did not stop they from calling by the way. I complained to Monster and Careerbuilder about this company and took my information off their website. Horrible in America you can be treated this way and can't trust to find a job on websites that state they are professional. Lesson learned.this is nothing but a body shop for Indians, They do not live up to their contracts.  Must be a cultural thing.  Sued the client and got paid right away .  Caveat Emptor!This temporary agency is actually located in India. They have a New Jersey phone number, but you are transferred to people in India. I went for 4 weeks without getting paid. It took the human resource department through my site, St. Joseph Hospital, to get me in touch with someone in the U.S. to get my pay.That being said, I got to work for St. Joseph for the first time. It was such an incredible journey. I loved the work load, the people, and the patients.The lady from Human Resources helped me get my permanent position in the float pool. It was the best experience!I enjoyed working for New york Life. The management was always clear and concise. I enjoyed the steady workflow as well. The work environment was not hostile.  each dept worked as a Team to get their job objectives completed .US Tech is the most worst company to work for. From the very start of my contract I had nothing but difficulty with US tech solutions. They are very unorganized and lack basic communication skills with their employees. You have to track them down to talk with them and they make you feel like you need to do there work for them. I would never recommend them to any oneWorked at another site for employment.My contact person was great.","1,001 to 5,000",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-10-20T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/cafab1dc-ee8c-4658-897e-b29cd2b1ccd2?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
