135,136.0,"Manager, Data Scientist - Consumer Marketing Analytics",Kaiser Permanente,4.2,3900.0,"Nice job culture with the kaiser team. The team is very small and they are very helpful. Nice team co-ordination. Management always give good support to the developer, which helped every developerI worked for Kaiser for many years. From college through my early professional career. A lot of politics among administrators at times but they treated me well. Kaiser compensation was far below what other hospitals in the community were paying back when I worked for them.  Eventually what  prompted me to leave. Not sure how they compare now. Very manageable workday. Teamwork among co workers. Hardest part of my job was the egos of certain physicians. Enjoyable part of my job was working with my co workers.We were and still are like family.After working at Kaiser for 10 years, I saw two different types of leadership. The initial CEO had a heart for the nurses, and Kaiser did very well in patient satisfaction surveys as well as staff satisfaction surveys. The current CEO has less interest in the staff from what I could see, the nurses' weren't being listened to. I was saddened to see this happen, the work culture felt much more tense.KP is a great place to extend your career. Employees are friendly, professional and willing to help. The culture promoted is one of togetherness with the patients first. There are some snags in management, primarily in Georgia. A typical day of greeting and serving some of the best people in the world and helping to make their health the best it can be. Overall I would recommend it as a stepping stone for the medical field. The providers are overall a great group, eager to listen and respond to their patients and internal employees. The hardest part of the job would be going home at the end of the day with so many people to help.My typical work day start at 6 and end at 2:30. I've learned how to process claims and to problem solve.  Also I've learned how to work with outside vendors in recouping overpayments on claims.  Our management team is very knowledgeable and willing to go beyond to help you achieve your goals.  The hardest part of the job is that what I do as a Claims Recovery Specialist is it's always busy, but I like the challenge of my job, it keeps you on your toes at all time, because day and day out you must know how to mulit-task and problem solve.  My job is a problem solving job.  The best part I enjoy is that I never get bored and there is a challenge everyday and you can come to work 5 days a week and not do the same job duty everyday.  We were many hats as a Claims Recovery Specialist.I enjoyed my internship experience at Kaiser Hospital because I was able to network with several Kaiser employees, and learned more in-depth about the culture of Kaiser.  In addition, I attained more knowledge and experience in Microsoft Excel and data entry.  It was truly an enjoyable experience and I look forward to any potential job openings/availabilities in the Kaiser Permanente Network.Excellent organization with excellent emphasis on preventive care. Great opportunity for improvement in career growthInvolve in staff development to ensure partnership and provide safety  and affordable care for patient To be able to work in partnership in a union environmentGreat coworkers who works coperatively with each other to ensure succesHardest part of the job is long hours to ensure efficiency and maintain the organization statusMost enjoyable to note the great and continued succes of the organizationThis Review is Solely on The EVS Department-The Pay is Good But It's Like a Secret Society.  Communication us HORRIBLE Between Management and Staffing. Alot of Favoritism Occurs, Unfortunately. Extremely Gossipy Co Workers. Get In, Do Your Work and Go Home.  Not Sure Why EVS Department Lacks So Much Comradery and Organization.  Plenty of O.T. if Wanted.  Benefits Good After 90 Days. Areas are Extremely  Large to Finish in an 8 Hour Shift. In Proper Training. I Would Rather Have The Work Culture Be Much More Professional and Unified in Another Department. Not Enough Pay for the Stress. Manager and Both Supervisors Left/ Quit/Transferred/ Got Terminated All Within Months of One Another.I worked for this company for over 10 years in the Sacramento Call Center. When I got sick I was let go. The work culture in the Call Center was abysmal and the management was unsympathetic to life needs. I started there to ""get my foot in the door"" and found that it was impossible to transfer out of the call center once I was there. There was no room for advancement. The job is highly stressful and the management made that stress worse. I loved being a Kaiser Employee but would never work in the call center again. I would love a chance to work in a different department however because the benefits and pay were excellentKaiser was a great company to work for if all i cared about was salary and benefits. I learned many things in my place of employment and grew a lot as a nurse. I learned to supervise different modules in our department as well as work with different specialties within pediatrics. However management was not kind to their employees at all and were only ever worried about numbers and not patients well being. My co-workers were overall kind and I got along with them well. The hardest party of my job was being able to talk to or communicate with management about any issues there were within work. The overall best part of my job was working with kids and being to help others in their time of need. Not only the patient was grateful at the end of the visit but the family members as well which was very rewarding.Kaiser is a great place for a steady career. Being a big company there are many reorganizations, especially in the IT space. The workforce is a talented pool of people who enjoy their work. The concern appears when new executives are hired which can has the potential to change the work/life balance.Most jobs were 4 10 hour days, which worked great for me.  My direct manager was in general very fair and knowledgeable.  I did feel like some of the upper level management made decisions that directly affected us without really understanding the consequences.  I felt valued and appreciated as an employee.  They do an outstanding job of communicating pertinent information such as policies, job expectations, and work systems to employees.  The care given to patients is in general very high quality, evidence-based, comprehensive care.  The dentists I worked with were humble, down-to-earth, and happy to work with staff as a team.  They seemed to check their egos at the door.There is not enough money in the world to get me to work here ever again. The work culture is lazy, people work here only for the money which is top pay because the place is horrible to work for. Top people leave, or are counting their days until retirement.Kaiser Permanente set the standard for providing top notch healthcare benefits to their employees.  As such, they expect and believe in each employee showing empathy while providing great customer care to all Kaiser customers; whether it's a vendor or patient.  Kaiser stays busy.  We consistently provide care to patients.  We work hard on a daily basis to make sure each & every patient is treated with respect, dignity and great customer care.  When working at Kaiser you run across employees who have been there 30 yrs or more.  So it goes without saying, Kaiser is great place to work!  Yes, it's not peaches and cream everyday but overall, you'll feel good about the care provided to patients here.A typical day at work is consumed by coordination of employees, providers, and patients, to provide a seamless experience. The hardest part of the job is maintaining a positive team spirit, and providing the best care for our patients. I find this challenging and enjoyable.This is the healthcare company you work for if you want to sell your nursing soul to the devil. Management beds the various Unions there & vice versa. Do not believe the union hype. The concepts of respect & trust are non-existent, and both administration, nursing leadership, and union leadership are tainted from the top down. Don't expect much from the physicians either. In my 20 years of nursing work experience, I would go so far as to say that the employment environment at Kaiser Fresno is the most hostile, uncultured and unrefined of its kind in the healthcare industry. Quality and safe patient care take a backseat to the ""great pay and benefits,"" and these are the only reasons why nurses stay. If you value your integrity, morals &  principles, and are willing to make a little less money to preserve them, take your priceless experience and skills elsewhere.Program executives are committed to Kaiser Permanente's mission to serve the community.  The three departments that I have worked in, and the dozens more whom I have collaborated with, are talented and interested in thinking about the impact of their work.KP is a great company to work for. The culture is one focused on patient care and over community  care. I would recommend Kaiser to potential employees. The benefits and work life balance are a plus.I can not say enough about the great place to work like KP. The employees are great and very friendly. Days are what you make them. Most co-workers are hard working and like their jobs.If you are non-union, you are treated like a third class citizen.  You work harder, pay more for insurance and prescriptions.  Receive lower wages, no salary increases, and held to a higher standard, due to KP ""honoring"" union contracts.  Union workers receive automatic non-merit raises annually and have a ""not my job"" attitude, which non-union EE must pick up the workload.  Middle management who run large departments with big union environments are corrupt. They will bend laws and contract to pacify Union and Upper Management.  Not all Kaisers are like this - but Roseville, CA is extremely offensive.Kaiser is a really good employer in that they want to see their employees succeed in Career and Home Life.  They do work tirelessly at ensuring that you are happy in your workplace and feel you have a positive work/life balance.","10,000+",San-Francisco,Oakland,CA,2016-08-31T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/10ff50c0-c572-42b2-a271-e02c13443055?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=4,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
