143,144.0,Data Scientist,Advantis Global,3.0,2.0,"- Management is great - enjoy working with my direct manager who provided constant support and guidance. - In technical recruiting you have 20% control of what goes on so it is not a stable work environment by any means. In this job you definitely have to be resilient and thick-skinned. - A lot of the expectations set for recruiters and account managers are unrealistic and in order to hit those goals you have to stay late (working unpaid overtime). - The Apple Account Manager is by far the meanest person I have ever worked with. Belittles recruiters and even management on a day-to-day basis. In the time I was with the company many recruiters quit solely because of her treatment and the hostility she brings to the office.I sourced and recruited highly skilled IT professionals into various technical positions, conducted 250+ calls, 75+ leads, and 10+ in-person interviews with candidates on a weekly basis, built rapport with both candidates and clients to ensure the best fit in a team, managed full cycle recruitment and fulfillment processes, and generated leads and cold called for new business development.I learned time management and consistency; time is money. Management was very easy communicate with and provided great tools to success; however, they did play favorites when it came to who was making the most money. My co-workers were great for the most part; however, because it is such a young environment, people tended to form cliques and judge alot. The hardest part of the job was to be consistent--there are good weeks and bad weeks. The most enjoyable part was the culture and motivation.",,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-07-09T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/c033ece9-9ce7-4da7-944e-09600ef14e1e?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
