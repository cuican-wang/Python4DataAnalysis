78,79.0,"Data Scientist, Growth Marketing",Postmates,3.6,114.0,"I turn on the app and start getting request to pick up food from restaruants. Then I deliver the food to the person at their home or office. I usually hang out near the colleges where many students and professional request deliveries.I like to work in clean and organized places. I work in a simple and efficient way, I fulfill all the demands that.   Postmates in transforming the way local goods move around a city by enabling anyone to get any product delivered in under one hour .it wasn't and isn't your typical job.you work when you want, which as awesome. but traveling around the city burns a whole in your pocket. every delivery was a challenge.  racing miles through the city to bring a customer there favorite food. metrocard fares ate through most of my profits so i had to let it go.I like how it's flexible and i can do this as a second job but can't find a phone number to call and talk to a live person. Does anyone know of a phone number ?  I'd like to do this but I have many questions unanswered.ðŸ˜ž.I work for Postmates when when I need some pocket change. When you're ready to work you just go online on the app. Its pretty easy. The man that manages it here on the west coast is laid back and he's pretty good at communicating with us to let us know when he's not going to be in town. You don't see your coworkers because everyone works independently. Hardest part of the job is making lots of money.Postmates is an awesome App platform to work with I only have positive things to say about Postmates, San Francisco, it gave me a     sense of personal accomplishment it was just very rewarding end to end.Postmates is ok, if you want a no hassle side job then postmates would work for you. If you are trying to take care of a household then you probably won't do well with postmates. The main issue I hated was to get jobs you had to drive around town, jobs are dispatched to the closest postmate. So there can be a lot of wasted gas and time. Also, they would often send me miles away to get food from certain restaurants and no matter what I did it wouldn't be warm upon arrival. Which means no tip for me and an unhappy customer. Customer service is a joke too. Once as a customer my order was wrong and all the company offered was a discount on delivery for my next order. So I was left with no immediate resolution, incorrect food and a company who didn't care. All in all, I left for a better courier company that not only paid much better but treated its drivers and customers like they matter.After two weeks and 104 deliveries, there is no pay, the dashboard show the earnings, but no transfer to my bank account, and the customer service is only through  email that  they never answered.A good extra income job. Good because you work whenever you want by simply turning on the app. It worked great for me because I'm on a motorcycle in Los Angeles traffic. If your in a car probably not so good. I wish I got compensated for my quickness and I also wish deliveries were sometimes closer together when dispatched. Overall good if your a college student who rides motorcycles looking for extra cash.You can create your own schedule and are never required to work . The only downfall is not having health benefits. Other than that, the fact that you are your own boss is amazing! As long as you get those two -three jobs an hour your hourly intake is awesome!Steady Eddie definition. someone who will not hit it and quit it - he'll be there for you whenever you need to get the big o. This job was always there for me when I needed that extra cash.  Convenient for everyone involved.  Decent company.  Decent pay.Easy and fast way to ear money. usually pretty busy throughout the day! company works well in helping you out when needed.Being a food deliverer for postmates was straight forward. You create your own schedule and are able to go online whenever you wanted to. Everything needed was on the app. However, when an issue came up with the order, Postmates customer service was non existent. There's no number to call when an order was difficult or not going through. If the issue was not for an active order, a request has to be emailed to Postmates, but they would never reply. Even to this day, I never received any responses for my many requests.The reaponsibilities are high. i make my own time, my own schedule, and I am my own boss. I like the fact that customer service is still involved. I am a people person , so seeing the satisfaction in a customers face makes me happy.Working for Postmates has been a fun, enlightening and flexible experience. There is a lot of support within the company from colleagues but sometimes management can be slow to make decisions. Overall it's a great company to work for that offers phenomenal benefits, as well as flexible work/life balance.Fun, laid back, and driven individuals. It is a typical start-up company environment. The people are nice, and you can expect the kitchen to be stocked.My experience, while working for Postmates, has been great. This company provides opportunities for it's employees to make money and explore the city of Chicago. I use the time I spend at work as exercise; it's a release.Got lured in because of the start up culture and all payed insurance. But everyone here gets treated like a number and there is zero job security. I got hired on as a quality analyst and within six months my role was outsourced to the same phillipines representatives I would analyze. There was no notice of the business decision and barely a compensation for the unexpected lay off. Don't work with them. You'll end up looking for a new job very soon.Working as a Courier was an ok job. This job requires you to be dedicated to the job in order to make a great outcome money wise. You also had to keep your customer rating up above 4.5 stars.This was the WORSE place I ever worked for.They treat their employees like numbers, not like human At All!! Anyone who is  thinking about working for Postmates, don't!  I rather drive for Uber than work for this uncaring and ignorant company.They have no culture. Their pay is very pitiful.fleet support isn't good, but if you find a way that works for you it can be beneficial for you.. depends city to city what payment you will receive",,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/da81b43a-83a1-4e5d-b2e9-d0e1b1e995d3?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

From day one, everything was hands on. Each sales rep would do all of their own lead generation, outbound sales calls, sales closing, and account management. The work environment was fun and energetic, an open floor with immediate access to management. Everyone was collaborative and encouraging, I could not have asked for a better work environment to learn sales.I manage Platform team and Partner Integration teams. My daily task includes the following1. Provide technical direction to teams2. Triage issues3. Work with Product team on the next generation products4. Work with Jira on the product backlog5. 1:1 with team members and peers6. Work with Business teams to understand the pain points and growth in business7. Participate in customer calls.8. Mentorship and coaching team membersPro: For the most part Tapjoy is comprised of some fantastic and smart people. Honestly, this is likely the only reason why many are still working here. There is also some ridiculous work-life balance here.Con: The smart and fantastic people are shoved into the corner, while the incompetent lead. Terrible organizational communication. Product vision is borderline terrible. Frankly, if it weren't for my peers this place would probably rank as one of the worst places to work.I learned a great deal watching this small startup flourish from under 100 employees to close to 300 employees.",,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/d6479dca-2a9e-46b0-81e5-43d490125521?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Being  a manager I would coordinate projects subcontractors and the public to assure all safety procedures were in place prior to material installation. The hardest part of my job was trying to coordinate heavy equipment in public spaces. I also was in charge of  all the glass needs in each terminal at SFO.Respond to crisis. coordinate and schedule meetings with service providers, mental health professionals, attorneys, relatives, parents, and client (minor). make decisions to remove minor to and from placement. Consult with team to make a decision for the best interest of the minor. minor(s) may have mental health that can be a complicated factor in inquiring a higher level placement. Minor's psychotropic medication(s) and medical have to be up to date.Minor may also have an IEP.I really enjoy working for the city and county of san FranciscoI work with a great group of people I love working near home.working in a mental health clinic could be hectic, very busy; learned how to deal with difficult customers/clients; management are very nice, professional and lay-back type of people; coworkers are great, fun to work with; hardest part of the job is when a client is experiencing bad episode but the most enjoyable part of the job is when we are able to help clients live normal livesFantastic experience. A very hardworking team that believe in knowledge sharing. Typical days starts checking our emails and ticketing system. I learned how the entire IT network works in different locations of government. Management were a complete delight considering they hold all to a high level of accountability. Co workers have turned into life long friends, the hardest part of the job is learning quick and adapting to different set ups in the network. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing how appreciated you felt from management after a hard day of work,Loved it! Did that job twice, and would do it again, met great people, my supervisor was a great guy! I worked with the best crew I could have been with both times. Once October 2002 to April 2003 and again October 2013 to April 2013. Got one year experience there. Also did gardening at City College Of San Francisco in the Horticulture Department while I attended school, students job and Volunteer Gardening at Laguna Honda Hospital & Rehab. Center. At College June 2009 to December 2011, and Laguna Honda May 2009 to February 2012. I moved to the East Bay & had no way to commute to the City every day.If you would not mind working 60+ hours a week, with constant hand off trials and knowing other people are getting promoted because they donated money to the DA's campaign or have other ""connections""... Then this is the place for you.Majority of the hard working DA's ended up leaving to go to other DA's offices.  A handful of good ones remain.   Unfortunately there is no real training in the office, and commonly lateral DA's would have to correct and teach their superiors the law.  SFPD is not considered an entity that you work with, given all the poliical head butting.  Unlike other counties where cops are more than willing to help and do their job, SFPD puts in the bare minimal due their long and challenging history with the DA's office.Money is great!I used to train users in Office 2000, via class set up or individually one one one for over 12 years. I was the top technician to complete work orders (user requests) on desktop (PC and laptop), remote and server issues including printers & telephone systems for over 15 years. this government agency was 10 years behind in technology when I left in 2011. the most gratifying part of my job for over 15years was to be able to teach the drivers and users that had never used a PC to be able to help them learn and relief their fear from using a computer or a laptop. And to also walk them thru an application problem either on the phone or in person, this city department has over 50 sites with users on computers.When I was employed with the city & county of San Francisco I worked for a redevelopment company called Urban Strategies. It was an experience I will never forget. Everyone was so caring and it was like one big family. Helping others get on the right track and is always a great way to spend the day.The location was difficult to handle since it was in the heart of San Francisco's Tenderloin district..... It was a learning experience since their average clientele was not average. I learned a lot from the community and the people that worked there..From the start of you day there is a extreme amount of positive energy. The sense of teamwork is great and everyone is eager to succeed and get the job done.Working on san francisco busy bus route in the southeast sector of the city provding safety and directions for passengers of all agesA good place to retire from. The work pace is slow and the technology is behind. Ask a lot of questions during the interview because the job descriptions are misleading.Working here you must be a jack of all trades and a master of least a few.Like working with people and meeting people, with 2010 CensusFun place to work for with great benefits, good managers and a lot to learn.

I have learned so much and it has really helped me to grow personally and professionally in ways that wouldn't have been possible anywhere else. There is a lot of hard work and tough problems, but working here has given the the confidence to plow through what looks impossible, and take my cues from other people that I respect and admire.  The most enjoyable part is the high quality of people; the education, experiences and skills.The company has phenomenal culture, cares for employees overall  and an outstanding benefits as long as you have a good manager, sometimes, you might get a bad one, but those are very few.A typical at day work supporting the manufacturing floor and providing support to upper management. Coworkerâ€™s very friendly and hard working. Most of the management team was friendly and easy to work with. The hardest part of my job was supporting two manufacturing buildings.  The enjoyable part of my job was traveling with some of my colleagues.Genentech is an example of effective entrepreneurial initiative to create a wonderful company.  The pipeline is ample within the oncology marketplace, but limited on other therapeutic categories.Genentech has a rich culture that inspires workers to achieve their career goals and give back to the community.There is great support to grow your career and receive feedback for positive growth.Everyday is a new learning challenge.  No day is alike.  I've learned to utilize applications and systems and also becoming for technical.The employees are amazing.  Everyone is willing to assist in any way.  The resources provided are very helpful and they thrive for career growth.make rounds with partner to other buildings to check levels of supplies and glassware as well as labware.  bring soiled labware and glassware back to our lab to clean/ sterilize and bake before delivering it back out.> Roche/Genentech is a heavy data driven culture.> Focus on results through collaboration (team heavy).  > Management focus on not just the results by how we achieve them (process definition).I worked for GNE for a total of 3 years as a Case Manager and later as a Foundation Specialist. I worked in the Access Solutions department doing reimbursment services as a case manager. This  consisited of relaying insurance benefits to patients and doctor's offices and referring patient's organizations that can provide co-pay assistance for particular specialty medications. As a foundation specialist, I provided free medication for those who met our criteria. Management there are very flexible and do not micro manage. These roles are very team oreinted, everyone I worked with were very friendly.I love working in genentech however the lack of growing or room for growth I shall say isn't as easy. It is very competitive and within some departments there are favoritism. Once one is a contractor its hard to get out of the contractor poll. The company does this because they would like to save as far as FTE count.Acumed has some really skilled machinist and they make some of the best orthopedic implant parts I have ever seen. The machinery is great and the operations are nice.Genentech is a great place to work! There are always opportunities to move up or move on within the company. They do a great job of training up their employees and giving them all the information necessary to do the job.A great place to work and offers a wide variety to opportunities for full time employees. Since Genentech is a brand name of Roche Inc, there a frequent need for domestic and international travel.High level of work load with short deadlines, with that being said , it is difficult to get a hold of people. Typical day is on the run from start to finish. People are nice and work is interesting, but workload is over whelming.Great place to work at. Benefits are great. Management needs work. They offer many incentives. You will move up fast in the company as long as you know the right people.This is a fun environment. We are all team players. I have learned many programs. It is great job security. The hardest part of my job is billing and having so many days to complete it.Genentech is a GMP environment so it is very important that while at work we do everything correctly and to standards, it is also important because we make medicine for extremely important patients.  The company also takes care of its employees they believe in a work life balance and make sure we have fun when we can while at work as well as have team building events, family is also very important.  Managers help out in any way possible and will also sit down and have lunch with you, they treat you as equals.  Everyone I work with are encouraging and helpful.  The benefits are amazing and the scheudle is also a great schedule.With this job, you need to be really flexible.  The work hours are in shifts.  You rotate with your Co-Teachers.  At times, you may need to switch shifts with another Co-Teacher.  This is something that everyone should be aware of when they apply for a job here.An excellent work life balance culture. The compensation and benefits are great. Genentech takes care of its own and as a company, strives to put out the best in putting patients first.Great place to work.  Work life balance is felt.   It feels good knowing what you do makes a difference.  I think the company puts it's people first and this is a good feeling as well.","10,000+",San-Francisco,South San Francisco,CA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/c0860624-4500-42cd-8fa8-4d675d1bd48d?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=19,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Here are some additional things to note: -We have an ability to work on projects that have a global impact from anywhere in the company which makes for interesting and challenging work and you learn a lot in a short amount of time.-People are not only the best at what they do, but they're also super humble and down to earth (i.e don't be intimated by all the ivy league linkedin profiles, they're also really cool, genuine people and you don't need to come from an ivy league school to work here contrary to what others say).-Prior to joining, I thought the team was much larger and much further along than it is and as a result there's a lot left to do as we scale and grow. You get the luxury of an already well known brand but the infrastructure of a small to mid-size company with a lot of things to still tackle!-They do a really good job of empowering/involving offices outside of HQ so we get to be a part of the strategy conversation vs. just implementation/execution-On the sales side you get to be the first and only ones calling into large Enterprise accounts, you don't have to worry about competing internally or dealing with a bunch of red tape internally to sellDropbox is a decade old ""startup"" that has yet to make a clear profit.  Benefits and pay are competitive for SF.  Workloads are high as many people leaders are not competent at managing others.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with smart people.  The hardest part of the job is taking some executives seriously that have no business managing other people.  The HBO series ""Silicon Valley"" should do a future season based on this company.The perks of the job are way better than the job itself. Being security there can be boring if you're not the favorite of the supervisor. Work loads are Not evenly distributed. There's no room for advancement and no guarantees to anything promised. But the Benefits are awesome and its definitely worth it not having to buy or bring lunch everyday.Dropbox was behind on invoice processing so brought in 3 temps to catch up, using NetSuite software. They also use their own software for email management; and also Zendesk for task management. That was new to me, so was a good learning experience.They have a very young group at Dropbox, so wasn't as professional as I'm used to. My manager was very supportive and always available for any questions or suggestions on process improvements.Fun place to work. Great management, great bonuses, overall great place to workAt Dropbox, there are a lot of really smart people tackling interesting problems.The compensation is great, the food is better than a majority of restaurants, and management trusts you to figure out how to get your work done.","1,001 to 5,000",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/abbd788b-727c-4575-931b-6c507639776b?mescoid=1300087001001&jobPosition=20,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
83,84.0,Senior Data Scientist - On Demand Tutor Product Team,Chegg,3.4,27.0,"It's easy going, you choose when to take tutoring opportunities and only log on when you want to. There are no hour requirements.Your typical warehouse job, very bland work. They do feed you, but some times they expect more work than is physically possible.I learned more about how to work with and teach people who may be having difficulties with certain subject matter. This job has really helped me to hone my problem solving and interpersonal skills.The system requires students to post a question on the board, and the first tutor to respond earns the chance to answer his question.There was four application processes as a temporary position which was interesting. Working in telecommunications for the first time was an eye opening experience. I was able to get promoted to chat and do instant messaging full time with a small pay increase. An early set schedule as well which was beneficial financially.Great CultureGood Work life balanceSupporting ManagersFree FoodAverage Technical work, depend upon the teamOverall it's good company to work For.Didnt really care for the environment. First day was ok, but after a while of silence and no one talking, it became really bad.- Typical work day: load/unload deliveries, sort, pick/pack- Management/Co-workers: enjoyable place to work with fun environment, management was always there to help employees- Hardest part of the job: Getting into a routine, but once routine was figured out, everything was good.- Most enjoyable part of the job: Working in a fun environmentI was a team leader here a chegg, very good place to work. Only thing bad was when schools wasn't in session the work would slow down extremely a lot. After all it were a good place to work peaceful and quiet.walk up to 10 miles a shift restock books and pull orders work long hours walking for the 10-12 hour shift was no order no managementThe job was not hard, but more boring. I was not mentally challenged. I did not have a bad experience, but knowing that it was only a temporary position I felt a lack of motivation. I would have also preferred a cooler climate.CHEGG is a nice place to work, friendly, but hardly anyone gets hired permanently. They said it was because it is seasonal and they only needed a few full time people because during off season, there are only the leaders and two or three supervisors. they didn't get 40 hrs. a week then, not enough work.receiving books and inspecting themlearned how to use different machineshardest part: standing on your feet for long shiftsenjoyable: payrateGreat place to work, enjoyed, balanced and flexible, enjoyed working hereGreat place to work. Fun friendly work environment the biggest problem is you come in as a temp and you may or may not get hired after you work 1,000 hours in a calendar year.GREAT PAY!! Very busy and can be a very fast paste environment. typical day of work for me was to pick books, stage them, then ship them back. Employee's are great with making team members well rounded by training them in every aspect of the warehouse.Everyday is a learning experience.  Especially in the field of Human resources.  There are a wide range of full time and temporary employee issues that all need to be handled in a unique way.  This job had afforded me the opportunity to learn and grow within my field.I'd go in and one day i could be picking books, the next i could be shipping books, and the next or same i could be shelving or relocating books.My day would start off projecting how many orders will have to be shipped out and how much product is coming in.  Once that is decided, then I would need to place employees accordingly to where I would need them to meet the deadlines of the shipments.  My co-workers were great, they knew what had to be done and always knew they had to do whatever it took to get the job done.  The biggest thing I have learned while working at Chegg is that ""never ask anyone to do anything that you aren't willing to do yourself"".  I enjoyed going to work everyday, it was an atmosphere where everyone was happy to be there.This place was such a mess. Millions of books misplaced. No one seems to care about the organization.Not wanting to be there.I have not learned anything at Chegg. I walked in on my first day and knew how to do most of the jobs do to previous warehouse work.Unprofessional and favoritism. Leads, Supervisors, and management will talk down to you and, get a attitude with you.My co-workers are the only perks to the job.Hardest part of the is the stress of the job and upper positions.","501 to 1,000",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/aa3b711b-af9c-49d2-bd23-6f0290fefbc3?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=21,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I like how it can relaxed one moment then in the next moment it can become competitive. The motivation from my managers to push myself and be aggressive, makes me want to do so much better.Great Company always listening and helping you and treat you with respect Confidently and proactively help resolve issues for customers and balance number of customers in a busy retail environment. Contribute to a constructive work environment by consistently treat all Gap Brans workers and shoppers with respectThe typical day at work, for my position, is fast paced. I learned how to think on my toes and to merchandise in unique ways to sell product to customers. The management team is diverse, with a specific work ethic that all follow. The hardest part of the job is to complete shipment on time. The most enjoyable part is having control of all inventory, knowing what's in and what's out for the store, and talking directly to management about all the exciting things that will happen for the company.I worked for this company at the height of its popularity and found it to be a great place to work.  I would definitely go back to work for them if I wanted to get into retail management again.It was very exciting and fun job. I learned a lot about the retail business and had the ability to apply those skills in my future jobs. Management was poor and there was a lack of communication, but your coworkers were your family and the atmosphere was usually positive.Management gives you the opportunity to grow and get involved in other areas that make up company. I've had the opportunity to do so and I have to say it pays off.good place to work great benefits, peak season are long and tiring with long days and multiple days worked without a day off. Would recommend for hourly employmentGap was a short seasonal job. I absolutely love the atmosphere because it is so lively, but the pay was very low and there was literally only 4 to 8 hour weeks.A typical day at work requires us to sell and know about the products we are selling.You have to learn about the items and know what is best for each customer. Management was organized and wanted to achieve goals as a team. Co worker, were all lovely, fun, energetic and goal oriented. The job was not that hard its just frustrating working on holidays.the people are great very fun for a first job very outgoing people, gets busy during holidays so expect to be always moving, loved where it was located because at lunch or after work you have the court yard or can go shopping in the outlet, and the discount you get is great.I love this place, I love the people. The job is so easy and fun and I enjoy working here. A typical day at work can vary from shipment to fitting room to cashier and its always different and fun. I love my coworkers most of them are very nice and fun to be around. The hardest part is dealing with messy costumers and being on my feet all day.Great place to work with the people that is around you as they help you develop skills. Be prepare to work hard and always greet the customers no matter.Gap is a great place to work. The employees are like a second family and it doesn't even feel like work. I would have stayed for a long time but I moved. Forever missing Gap.Great place to work! Love the company that I have returned to work there again.Everyone there is friendly, and the atmosphere is great. They are willing to work with me on my schedule.The location, I worked at specifically, had an amazing management team and sales associates were just as great. Fast-paced, especially during the holidays, but great environment to be in.Black Friday crazy as always, but things are always better when they are organized. Well staffed and everyone was nice and respectful, even when it got late.I worked at Gap for about a year. I gained a lot of experience in customer service and sales skills. Management was great and they worked with my high school schedule.Orderfilling is great easy and fun, fast pace good school hours for working and if you are going to school. Health insurance is great!Fast paced work for large corporation. If you like big box stores, give them a try. Hard to adjust to the crazy holiday hours.It is a stable work environment with many opportunities. A great first job for anyone new to the workforce.

I had the same manager for over 11 years which seems to be unheard of in the industry.

The people I work for and my colleagues are so much fun and I appreciate the opportunity to work with each one of them. I also love the Fiestas that Novartis through for Employees.Novartis is a very successful company which is mainly attributed to its emphasis on innovation, research and development, retaining top talent as well as focus on safety and quality. The company is extremely focused on delivering results and the place can be intense sometimes. However if one is comfortable under pressure and is geographically mobile, the opportunities for growth are ample.I had a large territory, so there was no work life balance.Had several good managers that were realists.  Understood the territory and would do what they could to help me succeed.Hardest part of the job was overnights.  Home for 2 weeks, on the road for 2 weeks each month.What made the job enjoyable were the success stories from the physicians that I called on when they would tell me that my drug changed somebody's life for the better.High Tech , too mulch overtime ,very little appreciation, Management constantly shiftimg, 12 supervisors in ten years ,half of them come in and try to make a name for themselves. High integrity , people constantly getting fired, great 41k.I enjoyed the variety in my job, it never got too boring. I learned so many things about manufacturing, packaging and labeling of over the counter pharmaceuticals. I liked working in the Pilot Laboratory with the miniature size equipment compared to the commercial size equipment used in the factory. I especially liked the scale-up process, that is where I learned the most about the robustness of the formula and the process used to manufacture gets challenged.I have worked at Novartis for ten years. Love the culture of work life balance. Generally, the co-workers are nice. However, very surfaced and hard to feel genuine natures. Management is the same. Very lenient and understanding to mistakes but will use it when necessary. Benefits and compensation are great. However, there is no room for advancement if you are in a support role. You have absolutely no support and in fact, I was told to leave the company and come back. Very difficult to move ahead or change positions.a good company, friendly work environment, career training opportunities. Decent benefits, work/life balance is OK.While the company has vast resources and a stellar on boarding, and training process, The Commercial side is riddled with process and micromanagement. There's no connection with the realities that the field faces.Good market level compensation. 4 major layoffs over past 6 years. no promotions. Lots of great people.At the end personal experience depends on manager and department. I was lucky one.great company. had a good career run with them. great training and salary plus compensation. worked there for 14+ years and progressed in my career. launched  several great drugs and had great sales success.Interesting work; excellent pay and benefits; diverse work; currently tight expense management; diverse suite of products; focused on being an employer of choiceNovartis is a good company to work for. I came from Alcon marketing and moving to finance there was a lot to learn as it is so different from marketing. But I appreciate the challenges.The struggle comes from so many changes within Novartis. You find something that works leave it alone for awhile. I believe employees become tired due to long hours and no work/life balance. Novartis purchased Alcon so there has been a lot of adjustments within the company to be made in the last few years. Overall Novartis and Alcon are great companies.I began with the company when it was Sandoz and would have given it 5 stars.  Novartis on the other hand, not so much.  The merger certainly took it toll.  I was wearing many different hats and the monetary compensation was not the same for ex-Sandoz employees.  Ciba employs were better compensated and there was resistance in bringing Sandoz employees  to the same level.  With that said, I loved the positions I held and my (Sandoz) co-workers were great. Overall it was a great learning experience for me.  I'm sure situations must be different at this time.  I would probably work there again should the opportunity arise.â€¢	Establish, maintain and develop strong relationships with customers and key decision makers within the practices;â€¢	Implement current marketing strategies and initiatives;â€¢	Manage the territory's assigned operating budget; ensuring timely expense management;â€¢	Ensure all pricing and contracts are in-line and executed pursuant to company policy and procedures;â€¢	Maintain accurate customer profiles and provide new customer data/sales data into company database; andâ€¢	Seamlessly communicate with the corporate sales team and account managers.Some groups have good bosses who would put efforts to help you grow your career, some keep you blinded so you won't know much and keep working for the boss cluelessly and not learn anything so you will not out grow him/her. All depends on the personality of your boss.Novartis is a pay for performance company. I have excelled in that work ethic and salesmanship. Novartis is also very team oriented.  With that in mind I have had great experiences with other professional sales reps. We all had our eyes on the prize to get the job done...right.  The hardest part of the job has been the new call number orientation. Goals have been set very high and almost impossible to attain, I have been making sales goals and ranking in the upper 10% of reps.  The most enjoyable part of the jobs has been getting to know my customers and the passion they have to help their patients. My Novartis colleagues have been wonderful through my career with Novartis. We all care about doing the right thing...everyday.Many changes with moving to a BPO offshoring delivery for Fianance Procurement and HR.  Much transition but company trying to keep opportunities available and work life rewardingNorvartis NBS has provided the opportunity to learn about HR Related services and systems.The most enjoyable part of the job is the trainings and job support offered, from Yammer to new program and team meetings/trainings.Great Work Life Balance. Telecommuting and flexible work hours a huge plus. Open Space work environment a plus.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxThe company offers a lot of great opportunities through varied roles for people at all levels of attained education. The company culture is based on a great foundation of ideals. The cafeteria has an amazing selection, with new daily specialties.The company offered great benefits and competitive compensation. Employees were very well taken care of. The overall atmosphere was pleasant and supportive. While encouraging learning and career development, the LAS group, which I worked for, prized efficiency and productivity above all. The upper management admittedly stifled employee aspiration within the group when positions had opened despite claims of opportunity. I enjoyed working alongside my colleagues and supervisors. Some of the skills I acquired are time management and analysis and response to adverse situations.","10,000+",San-Francisco,Emeryville,CA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/9bbd99b9-1962-468a-8fe2-3dc1afa3d748?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=35,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

465,466.0,Senior Biostatistician (Oncology) - Novella Clinical,Quintiles Inc.,3.9,491.0,"Great people, management is not always aware of how processes, transition, and the clinical model and career pathway workKeeping up with tested slides and properly storing them. Organizing and keeping up with lab equipment was very important as well as carrying many medical files and placing them in alphabetical order. Great environment to work in, hardest part was carefully placing the slides in their storage area having to be extremely careful. Easiest job I would say keeping up with the records and maintaining the lab equipment and assisting others.A typical work day was pretty med range as far as stress levels go and the work loads are not to bad. You go in, wait for a delivery truck to drop off your work load and then you began your work which takes about 2 1/2 - 4 hours and you are on your feet the whole time.I learned better time management and to speak up if I had an ideal that may better the business. Nothing good to say about the Management team so I won't speak on it. Co-workers are like family. The hardest part of the job was trying to remember all of the protocols to are continently being changed every few weeks. Second half of the work day which was light and some of the positive people I worked with was the most enjoyable part of the job.The job I was hired for didn't have long to really take off.  After a few weeks, my boss learned that his new boss was transferring the project we were working on, over seas and the whole team would need to look elsewhere for a position - either within Quintiles or outside of Quintiles.A company with lots of opportunity to do different work projects, however it does not afford those opportunities to those lacking experience in specific jobs, therefore not a great place for growth.Develop recruitment strategies and an enrollment plan with the investigator and site staff to meet recruitment goals in coordination with the Global Monitoring Plan project recruitment plan and conducts evaluation, initiation, routine monitoring and close out visits at each assigned study site, as outlined in the Global Monitoring Plan.Decent pay scale, benes, and bonus opportunity in management.  The lab business unit has always been chaotic without enough applied vision.  Clients generally allowed to dictate timelines.  A lot of good people on staff, but burnout is a significant problem.  The merger with Quest Clinical Labs brings potential for significant change, but uncertainty ahead, especially for redundant resource bases.Quintiles is a great place to work.Competitive wages.Competitive insurance.Many opportunities for upward mobility.Quintiles provides a stable environment within an evolving and changing market.Quintiles is a great company to work for ten years. Excellentsalary with benefits including gas card, car allowance as thejob requires travelling to physician offices in Greater Philadelphia.Team spirit and positive environment. Leadership encouraged.Job security is a plus if you make it to permanent employee, but temps are hired and fired with reckless abandon. Very little mobility in the company that isn't predetermined. Management is toxic and underhanded, with almost no transparency and a lot of ""because I said so"" reasoning that has no place in the work environment.If one makes permanent employee, be prepared to have drastically increased responsibilities over time with little to no increase in pay as a result. Low starting pay, and doesn't even increase to stay competitive with inflation.Strong background in project management, technical training, and support. Ability to balance complexity and partner with all levels within a multi-national environment. Analytical, articulate, and diligent.Management treated employees with respect and listened to ideas from the field.  They truly cared about the individual as well as the companies bottom line.Its like home, like a family you never want to leave.  I am only a temporary associate who works on the Medicaid team.  I am stationed at my own desk, with very little micro managing. Self starter and goal oriented, to get the job done.technology. work flexible.(telecommute). Client visits. Vendor services.Great name in information industry, new tools and products.largest vendor industry.Very good company to work for. The employees work very well together in getting the projects done on time with a very hard working teaming atmosphere.Good company to work for. There are several opportunities to learn and grow. The staff is very knowledgeable and willing to help. There are many opportunities for your hard work to be recognized.I loved working with Quintiles. A very diverse place to work with good benefits. Salary was good, and the employee gym.  Everyone was excited to work for this companyWorking at Quintiles was a great experience.  They take care of their employees and help them further their careers by offering opportunities to grow and advancement.They are slow to promote but very understanding with life events and giving a good balance of work to family life. Depending on your role you work at your own pace to produce results.Pros: Work/life balance, benefits, vacation, and compensation. Cons: High turn over rate within engineering department.
