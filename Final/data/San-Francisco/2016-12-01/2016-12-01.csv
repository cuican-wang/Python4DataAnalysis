You buckle down putting in 10-12 hour days, yet it will pay off in the event that you keep at it. Try not to enter this occupation supposing you can bear to be lethargic else you WILL fizzle. Great commission setup is fine for a few people however unquestionably not everybody. Youthful air and positive vibes all around.Fun culture and work environmentGreat money opportunityGreat growth opportunityUnlimited SnacksAbility to work remoteGreat company partiesCyberCoders is a solid culture company. The people and most management are very strong and are willing to assist in any way possible. It is not a 9 to 5 so you definitely need to be ready to work long hours to be successful.Sink or Swim.  Management is very hands off, even if you do well you can get swept in layoffs.  Company is not going in the right direction and their approach is very bullish.  Plenty of potential clients/candidates would not work with me due to the ""stigma"" of working with Cybercoders.  It is truly a double edged sword.allstate is a fortune 100 company that is a great experience to gain professionalism and experience. Really fun coworkersAs a recruiter you learn to build your business from scratch. You work hard putting in 10-12 hour days, but it will pay off if you keep at it. Do not enter this job thinking you can afford to be lazy else you WILL fail. 100% commission setup is fine for some people but definitely not everyone. Young atmosphere and positive vibes all around.I managed a database of clients and candidates. I did all my own business development by cold calls, emails, linkedin inmails and referrals. I sourced for candidates and matched them with my client staffing needs. Negotiated pay and bill rates and coordinated interviews and placementsCyberCoders is becoming a giant staffing firm the industry - and rightfully so! They are surrounded with so much talent from everyone in the organization.Great place to work at! Company culture is great. Love the people and atmosphere.Like the saying goes""work hard play harder""!!CyberCoders is very unprofessional.Money hoardersthey will call you all the time just to make the quotaA good supportive company and they provide pay reflective of the level of experience of the candidate.I worked for Cybercoders for about 4-months. I had heard many good things about them over the years so I was excited to be offered a position to join the team. Unfortunately, from the day I started I saw a lot of red flags that reminded me a lot of another large, international recruiting firm (RHI) where I previously worked. CC has a churn and burn environment and they micromanage you - pulling up reports throughout the day on your activity. They have a TON of meetings - team meetings, company wide meetings, individual meetings - EVERY WEEK! Over the 4 months I was there people quit or were being fired practically every week. The 3 new people on my team that started the same day as I did, were gone within 4 months. Yes, they did have cool quarterly sales party's at an ocean front resort in Orange County. And a summer party that was a blast! But aside from that, the work environment was tedious. You had to achieve a certain # of ""CA's"" per week (Cyber Actions) that you earn by securing a new job order from a client, submitting candidates for open jobs and scheduling in-person interviews between your candidate and client. If you don't meet the required number of CA's, you must attend what I referred to as a ""dunce or disciplinary"" training session for each week you missed the mark...driving 1.5 to 2 hours from their Playa Vista location to Irvine for a 45 minute meeting. Basically, taking up your entire day of productivity when the reason you're having to attend this meeting in the first place is because of what they deem your lack of productivity. Unfortunately,  more... if you have several job orders open with different clients for the same type of position, the candidates you submit only counts for 1 CA, even if you submit the same candidate to 5 different clients. So you're constantly scrambling to meet your CA numbers. A lot of people found ways to trick the system into thinking they earned CA's in order to avoid disciplinary action. WE ARE THERE TO WORK, not to surf the net or mess around so treating us like children is unnecessary.I placed four full time placements within the first 4 months I was there at a profit of almost $100k for the company, but when I called in sick one day when I was supposed to attend one of these disciplinary meetings in Irvine, I was called that very morning and told ""this isn't working out"". Yes, I was fired. I was shocked and surprised. I reminded my manager that we had just met a few days prior and he said I was doing well and making good progress. I could tell he was annoyed I had called in sick rather than drive to Irvine. He just repeated himself ""this isn't working out"". I do not recommend Cybercoders to fellow recruiters. It's a cut throat, micromanaging, churn and burn environment. Plus, you're on a draw, so you may as well just work as an independent recruiter rather than share your profits with the company because you're responsible for 100% of your own salary anyway.  lessOver the years I've seen many many jobs from Cybercoders for which I felt I was well qualified, but have never landed so much as a phone screen when applying through them.Cybercoders reason for being is to insert themselves between you and any prospective employers and extort money from those who might find you a promising candidate. Your interest or potential suitability for a job makes no difference to them, your resume won't leave their computers unless they think they can get a commission out of it. It takes more legwork, but try to filter out Cybercoder ads, target job searches to only return actual employer generated positions and send them your resume directly. You won't get every job you apply for, but at least you don't have to meet some anonymous recruiter's commission checklist before employers see your resume.One word Resume Farmers! Read many reviews were people were contacted by their 'recruiters"", recommended the candidate apply for the job via their link and never to be heard from again.Excellent recruiting environment.  Collaborative, excellent management with top-notch tools.CyberCoders is the leader in full-time technology staffing nationwide for a reason.   You are working with real people working with some of the worlds best companies providing life changing opportunities that help thousands of people grow their careers and income every year.  I read one review that said we were a Spammer and owned by Experian?  Not true.  We are not owned by Experian and your personal information isn't shared with any agency.  Our job requires many phone calls and many emails to insure we reach our targeted audience, but we are no more a spammer than Groupon or Travelzoo when you ask to receive exciting updates that match your specific interests. If you have applied for jobs and are not getting a response, there is no interview request.  You could still be a very good candidate, so followup with us and we'll do our best to make a match.  Hiring managers are very busy and find it hard to reply to every resume, so some go without a response unfortunately.  Internally, all employees of CyberCoders are treated very well with generous compensation packages as well as many in house treats and fun catered events.  The culture is fun and casual, providing recruiters with unmatched marketing and software tools to reach thousands of new passive talent everyday.Nothing feels better than helping someone find a new position and helping a trusted client fill an important need all at the same time.  Ultimately, recruiters are your friends and can help you.  Try us!After swearing myself of not returning to the staffing agency world, CyberCoders came along and completely changed my mind. Their approach and constant dedication on investment to staying ahead of the curve with regards to their technology and how they approach the best way to service both their clients and candidates has given me a place that I'm very happy to say I work for.There is plenty of opportunity for growth and the organization is not flat at all. The company as a whole is on a pretty exciting growth path as well.",,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-12-01T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/data-scientist-growth-marketing-research-san-fran!-job-san-francisco-ca-us-176931443.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
13,14.0,Data Scientist,"The Judge Group, Inc.",3.4,82.0,"The recruiter always called me back whenever i had any questions during the time of the contractTypical day at work was very much unsatisfying.I learned that you can't trust this organization at all.Management treats you like a dog!Co workers are back stabbers.Hardest part of the job was never being thanked for all the hard work you do.Can't say I enjoyed working for this company at all!!!Great company, great people to work with. There is a ton of opportunity to earn a good living if you work hard and dedicate yourself. There is a great work life balance and a work hard play hard culture. Very good opportunity for people who want to learn how to be a recruiter and do it well. Very strong support system and grade A training program. This company will provide you with all the tools to be successful.no work life balance and compensation is low for the amount of stress and hours you have to put in. Every day you have to come in and work on the same jobs over and over. Recently, they decided to stop using LinkedIn and Indeed as well, making recruiters lives harder.a lot of turn around not too much job security, hardest part of the job is to build your client data base. management lacked a bitOnsite management needs improvement, high turnover in leadership resulting in job security for potential growth with job siteI only worked for Judge briefly. I started in the month of January and by resigned by May. I quickly realized how much I despised this place. By February I began looking for a new job. The office I worked in was very tiny (the size of a small closet). I worked with 3 other people in this closet. The girls I worked with were very mean and extremely rude. They would talk about you the second you walked out of a room and would stop the moment you returned. They were fake nice when you would try to talk to them. I never in my life felt so alone and excluded. I made every attempt to get along with them but they simply wouldn’t have it. I was often pulled into HR to discuss my work attire. There was a strict dress code there but only for certain people. I was in trouble for wearing black suede boots and a military style jacket yet my coworker was permitted to wear a denim jacket and cowboy boots. A lot of the women there would also wear micro miniskirts where I could see more than I wanted to yet my dresses were too short according to HR cause they didn’t cover my knees. The place was very “clicky”. It was like being back in High School. You were either a popular kid or a nerd. I tried to fit in but was pushed out every time I tried. It was very hurtful. I couldn’t get out of there fast enough! And if you like to have time off from work, forget about it! This company does not allow anyone to take unpaid time off and the accrual rate of time off is a joke. Your 1st year you get 3 days! Also, the benefits are probably some of the worst I have ever seen. For a large company,  more... they have horrible health benefits. You will literally be working there for just benefits but never get to use them because the deductibles are so high.  lessLoved the position I was in and really enjoyed working with the group of people I was with.  I learned quite a bit regarding Healthcare that I hope to use in the future.  I was very disappointed when I was told that the company I was working with did not want to keep me on past my 6 month contract date after I was pretty much convinced that I would be kept on through the next contract with the same company.Most of the branches are pretty ok at judge, but working for healthcare in the corporate office (conshy) is extremely stressful.  In the past year alone they have gone through two internal recruiters which you would think is a bad sign since now the managers themselves are doing the internal recruiting.  Some account managers are very high strung, and those who run the office treat the recruiters like a number.  Most recruiters have to bend/break the rules to meet quotas mainly out of fear for being yelled at.  These recruiters work extremely hard, and at least 45 hours a week not including all the work from home to keep up with the cycle.They say the pay scale is competitive, however it is pretty basic compared to other firms, honestly 32,000 (about 13 bucks an hour...) after you get your bachelors is really low.  I feel like they are taking advantage of students coming right out of college. The commission plan is ok but its very rare to make anything noticeable in commission until after six months. The promotions they run are fairly difficult to hit, one recruiter out of thirty might get a small gift for hitting a quota. As recruiters we've been yelled at, and cursed at for things that we cannot control such as a candidate taking another job, not showing for their interview despite telling us they would, etc.  Again kicking you while you are down.  Since they try to motivate by fear, most people are too scared of losing their job to report anything.  If you are recently graduated and have few other options, then get some experience there and get out.  Hardest  more... part of the job - hitting the quota.Most enjoyable part - the recruiters and recruiting managers are nice people, but they are being taken advantage of.  The Judge family and executives seem like genuine people, though you dont hear much from them.  lessgood first job out of college. not a lot of room for growth though. hours are long but you can make money at this job if you work hard. its a lot of luck so you need to be resilient.I would definitely recommend this company for the college graduate or anyone who is in the market of looking for a job. They look to fit you with the best job to fit your experience.Your day starts out with a conference call first thing in the morning to go over most recent job openings.  During the call, recruiters are assigned to work each of those positions.  Once jobs are assigned, the day is spent posting jobs on the company website, sending email blasts and looking through the job boards for qualified candidates.  There is another conference call in the afternoon to check on the status of job openings from the morning as well as assign new ones that have come out since.  Keys to success are time management and excellent organizational skills.  Definitely a highly competitive environment.Good company to work for.  I like the fact that they pay weekly.  The beginning pay process I think may need some attention, and the fact that you have to track time in the assigned company's system, and also in Judge's system is a bit cumbersome and always involves coordination, etc.This office has a great work environment! Everyone is wonderful and the director is the best. It is best to be confident in what you say and be prepared to make a lot of phone calls. You must definitely enjoy talking to people to succeed here!Love this company, the only problem is the Medical benefits, other than that it's awesome! This is a family oriented Company.I enjoyed working as a private contractor. My assignment was in clinical suppoort, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I have learned a great deal about health maintenance, gap remediation and medication uses and indications as well as diagnostic testing indications. I was disappointed that I was not brought on permanently to the position I was at. I was promised a position, but the organization suffered massive budget cuts.Good communication, responsive to employee inquiries, fair pay. Managers respond to inquiries concerning, job assignments, hours of work and pay issuesNot a bad job but stressful environment due to productivity standards. Hours are long and there is a lot of micromanagement. Reports come out daily with a list of phone call totals for each person, submittals, interviews and last placement.The company is focused on metrics more than anything, and if you aren't hitting your numbers consistently then you're hearing about it.  There are a lot of jobs to be worked on, but the environment sometimes isn't very fun.  There is a lot of turnover and it doesn't show much stability.  Seems like the only successful people are those who have been there for 5+ years, junior recruiters have a hard time growing.Worked from home on Insurance company's national project.  LOVED being a telenurse.The Judge Group was wonderful to work with -  Very Responsive, Well Compensated.  Would DEFINITELY work for them again!I enjoy my current position at Judge Healthcare. Lots of opportunity here to grow.I really enjoy the people and it is def a work hard play hard type environment",201 to 500,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-12-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/e5e51478-3fcc-4962-86ac-b9734b829c5f?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

69,70.0,Data Scientist,DNV GL,3.9,54.0,"A nice company that's going through a lot of changes.  Unfortunately, the European mentality (which can be great) is this company's biggest problem.Working for DNV GL was an experience of a lifetime. The work/life balance was absolutely amazing. And the opportunities provided by the company were amazing. There was a lot of room for growth. The company encouraged all of their employees towards individual growth. The management treated you like an adult, with minimal interference, while maintaining a supportive role in everyday activities.Recently after merger, things changed otherwise good place to work.New CEO is promising and expecting to bring commercial culture and get rid of old way of doing the business.The department was highly disorganized, employees over worked, demanding overtime, management problems.  Too many projects and not enough people to do the work.DNV GL comprises of the technical experts in the Energy Efficiency field and the culture has an open and collaborative environment. The company allows you to grow that is congruent to your work results. The employees are dedicated and solution oriented.Worked in the renewables independent engineering group, exciting work, however the company planned a merger very poorly and suffered with a poor accounting system, and horribly understaffed and burned everyone out.  Would have been nice if management could have executed their vision much better.Very friendly, hard working but fair company to work for. Nice offices in Singapore. Very international workforce, supportive management.DNV GL has high standards that are values based. Great opportunities for those interested in doing their best and exploring the world.Love environment and disciplines in company. Process oriented , and very driven environment. Management is ideal for work conditions .I love that I am being paid to do something that I am so passionate about. There is nothing I love more than being able to connect business owners with incentive dollars from the utility that they can use to reinvest in their own business.The effect of two mergers coupled with poor mid-level management practices are having a marked effect on the company's professionalism. In particular, their energy-efficiency evaluations have seen too many examples of unprofessional practices, as noted by customers and utilities. Business development is in decline, resulting in a sharp decline in moral.great place to work, and travel a lot, but difficult to be closer with the family. Nice benefits and friendly with the coworkers.Good place to work and just like all companies, there are some challenges.  They have a heart and want to do the right thing but at times are constrained by having to make a business decisions that go against the employees.  Overall, I recommend DNV GL.-Large company benefits with a small company atmosphere-Flex time-friendly group of people to work with- Great location in Dublin for lunch- over 300 offices world wide - multicultural work enviromentgood place to work, flexible, salary is not high, but it is fair enough. People are friendly to each other. The location is close to home.I work 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM and I've learned numerous skills.  I've had the opportunity to work on global projects and interfacing with upper management.Nice place to work with good benefit. Treating the employees well and professional. Learning new thing from colleagues through project work.I have enjoyed my time with the DNV GL family. This company is very fast paced, co-workers are very close. The company sincerely cares about you and your family with flexibility towards it when needed to be there for your family. This company is great to start off as a first place to work in the corporate world.Working as an intern for DNV GL involved a wide range of technical problem solving. There was a good balance of individual and team-based work. I gained a relevant understanding in corrosion science and enjoyed being able to directly apply my several years of engineering training for a useful purpose.The company's take is you learn 80% of what you need to know on the job, 10% thru training materials, and 10% thru mentoring.My most enjoyable part of my job is to make sure all customers are taking care on a daily basis.  If the customer is happy, I am happy.",,San-Francisco,Oakland,CA,2016-12-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/f12f5ad8-8179-4993-baa6-44b023f5c6e7?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

My commute was the most difficult part of my job.  The work was fun and rewarding.The culture at Amgen is very competitive, with favoritism shown to those who buddy up to management.  Individuals who do well in office politics are given more opportunity for advancement than those who master their jobs, particularly in the scientific roles.  Medical benefits are above average, as are savings plans for retirement.  Many layoffs have occurred over the last ten years, with staff being replaced by contractors.  Some benefits have declined in recent years, such as tuition reimbursement, which went from 100% to a flat $5K per year.  Child day care is available but is very expensive.  Cost-cutting since the 2008 economic crisis has negatively impacted the working environment and the company culture.Amgen worker productivity seems to be diminished, and its culture appears to be conditioned by constant large-scale initiatives driven top-down.  Teams' ability to execute is impacted by a culture of job-protectiveness, and even excellent and essential ideas are delayed for years waiting for various reorganizations.  In a nutshell, Amgen does not foster ideation, invention, creativity; further, the company seems to reward passive-aggressive behavior.Amgen's headquarters are isolated in Ventura County, CA, and while the benefits are great, I do not recommend relocating simply for Amgen.  It frequently pays relocation benefits to new hires, but moving here could geographically block enriching opportunities from coming to you.Loved being part of a science based company specializing in finding cures for grievous illnesses.  Great benefits and advancement potential.  Loved management and coworkers.Great CompanyExcellent Compensation BenefitsEnjoy the work cultureTeam Work AmbientManagement LearnLife BalanceAmgen was a good company to work for. Management overall was good but had issues removing poor management from the structures. Manufacturing seemed to be pushed beyond their limits. Good benefits and pay.Great products, great company. Teamwork environment and management try to be transparent to the sales reps.The most enjoyable part of my job is helping patients get access to the medication.The company looks nice to an outsider but management culture is very protective of an out of control quality system and does not invite new process improvement ideas!The work as a manufacturing associate is very stressful, even though   you learned a lot about automated and manual processes.You are asigned to a partner ( it can be a different one every day) everyday so you have to get to know each person working system and communication is very important. The most difficult part of this job is that you dont have and exact time to go to have lunch or to eat. Everyday  can be unpredictable. In my opinion the management has to work really hard on that and take the associates in consideration. I know that production is very important but workers health and consideration is too.Disappointing launch of Corlanor.  Fortunate enough to do well with the products however, the way leadership treated my counterparts who were not so fortunate with Corlanor after the messy launch is shameful.  Not a place I would encourage for the faint of heart.  Dog eat dog culture.  The launch of Repatha was even worse and they should have this specialty pharmacy game down to a science since they are not new to the biologics game.  Work life balance is non existent if you do not want to be on a list for not making your weekly numbers.  I am fortunate enough to have a great manager, however, nationally, my counterparts are miserable and get harassed every day regarding their numbers.  Our team is frightened of what will happen when our manager gets promoted and we get the tried and true Amgen manager that runs their teams on fear and intimidation.The people, work, and benefits are really great at Amgen. Unfortunately the job security if very low for this company. Also great opportunities to  travel.The day starts with heavy calendar, email and mailbox maintenance and cross functional interactions and wearing many hats throughout the day.  Learning management system allowednfor unlimited and frequent task and role educationnfor growth. Teamwork and cross functional interaction was a plus.I began at Amgen and loved it, however there have been huge cultural changes for the worse. Unrealistic timelines, ever increasing work with less staff and no job security.A competitive biotech company full of new challenges everyday. That provides you the tools to learn key principles of Lean Six Sigma. In a typical day you need to be ready for problem solving and process improvement ideas. Work environment is very competitive, compensation and benefits are very good.A typical day at work is to arrange appointments with oncologists and visit them for me to disseminate medical knowledge , clinical trials and new updates.I learned to be able to do segmentation , targeting and positioningI learned to be able to handle the physicians objectionsI learned to conduct medical presentations and time managementwe all work as a part of a team all my co-workers are co-operative and motivationalthe hardest part of the job is to actualy be able to set up an appointment with the oncology physician due to his tight schedule and responsibilitiesthe most enjoyable part is communicating with different people from nurses to pharmacy technicians , pharmacists, purchasers and physician in different hospital settingsGreat place to work with an excellent lean manufacturing culture.  The company values are embedded in all activities we do.Love my job and the peopleLearned different things, never boringCo-worker are helpfulGreat support from ManagementI was blessed to work at Amgen's Washington sites. The group of people there, not only in my group/department, but across all functions at the site were the best of the best.  Everyone was dedicated to the mission.  My immediate manager was truly someone unique and special to work for.  She absolutely made sure that her reports had a strong work/life balance (even if she didn't adhere to that for herself).  My immediate group of co-workers is what I loved the most and what I miss the most now that AWA has been closed down.Excellent place to workA lot of opportunities to learn about Nice co-workersExcellent management New people every day Opportunity to learn of different culturesAs an student you have the opportunity to be exposed as an regular employer to important projects.Loved the people that I worked with. I was able to learn and grow with the company. They offered a great tuition reimbursement plan for those that wanted to get an education.Great company to work for. Advancement opportunities were not easily available or proposed to eligible employees Management was not hands on with teams.

231,232.0,Research Scientist Computer Vision,eBay Inc,4.1,763.0,"Put inventory into bin location, kept inventory, took pictures and published merchandise. Handled shipping and customer service. Local, national and international shipping.Excellent place to work. very supportive people and very good management group.employee benefits also very good. career growth also very good as always more opportunities to explore on different tasks.The only con is that you sit down the majority of time. It has a variety of positions to choose from so you will never get bored. The pay is more than enough and it has a flexible schedule.As a seller on eBay, I am my own boss. I set my own hours, sell whatever I want, and keep nearly all the profits from whatever I sell. With so many different people visiting the website, there's a market for virtually everything out there, including old collectibles and toys. It's a good way to make some extra money and offset the cost of any hobbies you might have. The only downside is the selling fees from both PayPal and eBay itself. They aren't too extreme, though they can be annoying, especially for smaller sales.I enjoyed by time at eBay because I had a great managers.  She had the ability to recognize strengths and weaknesses.  I liked that she held people accountable for producing a good product.I honestly don't understand this forced rating system. My opinion on eBay hasn't changed int he ten minutes since my last review of it. It's a great place to work and I regret having ot leave it.Enjoyed working there, many tasks to many to list but some are management, training, reporting, customer service, supervising a staff of 12 24/7 and being on callGreat work environment, Very flexible work schedule, you are making a difference by enabling connected commerce in all corners of the world. Fun place to work with many talented and friendly co-workers.Needs more organization and training more for representatives. There was a lot of hiring but not very many chairs open. A lot of under time was given and people were sent home A lot. It is a nice place to work if the promised hours were given.Great work environment, Team orientation and lots of team efforts. Great work culture to work for and a balance work and life style. Team motivation. Team FocusIf you want long hours you will find it here. Which can be a good and a bad thing. Yeah everyone needs the money but at the same time the astomspare of the whole place is kind of a downer so it just makes it a hard company to work for. They have very strict policys but they do offer alot of free lunches and a turkey at thanksgiving and ham at christmas. Every holiday they try and offer either a lunch and a gift or raffles.you can sell up to a certain amount of money. sell anything you want take good pictures and price it right and get money thru paypal or check. also good selling exposure as well as business interaction.After finding all items you must clean them, take photos, list them online, package, then ship. The hardest part of the job is finding the items for resale and the most enjoyable part of the job is offering products to people that may be hard to find or that they enjoy collecting.I love eBay! I have had much success and met wonderful people from eBay. I would rate overall a safe and fun site to work with.Telecommuting Infrastructure allowed for flexible workplace environments and schedules with excellent full-time training opportunities and benefits.Good work life balance, but some employees are in coast mode.Could be better opportunities for advancement, seems like they bring in a lot of senior leaders from outside rather than cultivating inside.Indeed's parsing software does not recognize the fact that I DID NOT WORK AT EBAY. This is on my resume as a task regarding independent contracts while freelancing.If you enjoy working in a standard call center then this is perfect for you. I did not like anything particular about the job. They were not organized when I worked there and they made the training a little stressful.Posted postings of CE items to be resold on Ebay. Took pictures and wrote descriptions about the product. The hardest part about this job was to find what to write about the product when you didn't have all the information when they give to the task to do.Full of life lots of people in and out. many interesting characters.

327,328.0,Biologist (Computational/Bioinformatics),Department Of Agriculture,4.2,577.0,"I never worked for the Department of AG.  I dont know why this agency popped up.  there is not review to say.    blah blah blah  nothing to say.  Never worked at this agency.Through UGA I was able to intern at the USDA. I was not paid a salary but was given class credit as compensation. A typical day involved arriving to the lab on time with a plan for that day's procedures. The first half of the internship involved learning basic lab techniques and following protocols. The second half of the internship involved troubleshooting in order to create my own lab protocol for future interns to follow. I mostly spent my time learning from the head lab technician, but would occasionally work with the head of research if he was available. The best part about the job was learning new things related to biology and being able to think through my errors in an environment suited for student advancement.You assist landowners and farmers on a daily basis to receive government subsidies. Work with genuine people all around. Not just within the office but the producers themselves.The USDA FOREST SERVICE is a wonderful agency to begin a career. The agency allows applicants to gain valuable work experience as a students, veterans, limited term employee, contactor, etc. The agency has several positions for those who have a love of the outdoors and want to protect those assets. The agency has clear directives, goals, and set measurable standards for all staff. Like most federal agencies, the USDA Forest Service rewards their employees who furthers their education and seek additional training.Department  of agriculture is a government  agency in the Philippines. The agency is a very good place work with because of the good management and the professionalism and respect the employees have.Positive Work Environment, Goals of agency align with personal goals, Management is knowledgeable, Work is fulfilling, Schedule allows for work/life balanceGreat place to work and provide great customer service to clients. I work day for me started around 6 am in the morning. I would be the first to arrive so I was the tam member that came in and st the pace for the rest of the staff for the day. I learned how the government works and what it take to please your supervisors as well as the community. Management  was more hands off, which I loved as long as you knew your expectations and performed. Co-workers, some worked just as hard as you, some did not. Some were long term, and some were not, with that approach. The hardest part was management having a difficult time making sure everything was communicated effectively and everyone on the same page. The happiest part of the job, was knowing that you save someone from losing their home are their hard earned possessions or property.The Temple office is a great place to work.  The people are friendly and the work environment is good also.  I have learned a lot from them and they seem to be very helpful.Fast paced. Garnered teamwork skills that were fundamental for career development. Growth potential. Various training opportunity's. Great place to network, and reliable management to learn from.USDA has a fantastic mission and tools to help Rural America. The policies and leadership are so political that the wrong people and projects are receiving assistance. Employees are not encouraged to think outside the box by management and each office is very local and very clicky.Monday thru Friday jobI learned a lot about personnelworking independently I enjoy about the job nice co workers and also like working as a teamPhones, emails, scheduling, detail sheets, Travel Arrangements, vouchers.  Assisting field employees and supervisors with questions and problems.  Working with other departments to resolve issues.The incumbent possesses knowledge of the principles, practices, concepts and theories of law (Federal and State), regulations, and policies as they relate to the servicing and liquidation of guaranteed loans. The incumbent uses this knowledge and skill to apply techniques to obtain and evaluate a borrower's ability (or lack thereof) to reinstate a delinquent loan and to conclude whether a borrower has the potential to repay the loan.Management could get too micro manage and only care for production instead of being people oriented. Customer service is not their priority but making their numbers. Coworkers are hard worker but afraid of management and losing their job. The most enjoyable part of the job is that we could make a difference in people's lives, and that is satisfaction enough.I job shadowed a lab technician. There was not much I could learn about benefits or other employees. The work environment was more constricted to a specific area.I work in an agency that helps farmers improve their land.  We have a very diverse group of employees.My job is to maintain files and assist the various groups with the administrative duties, answer phones, put postage on our system and to ship the UPS packages each day.  Each day is a varied set of duties...just depends on the day and what is going on in the office.  I enjoy learning new processes and trying new projects.  I have learned to be very flexible!While performing the duties as a Consumer Safety Inspector I was responsible for product and it's wholesomeness. It was to be unadulterated and free of contamination.I learned that inspite of what the company or plant wanted it was my job to make sure the American Consumer was served and not the plant.My co workers were good people and mindful of the importance of the work they did.The hardest part of the job? Getting beyond the tediousness of the job. I enjoyed serving the public above all else.Everyday was very productive we had to multitask and think on our feet every minute while on the job. I loved fighting the fires that was the most enjoyable part because you do something that is selfless in a sense that you love to do. I learned alot from everything to how sharpen blades on a lawn mower, to operating a Fire truck that was the size of a semi and building firelines to contain a fire with a bulldozer with a plow on the end hitched to it.This was my first position I held with the US Government.  It was a great place to begin my federal career.  After a few years of being there, I transferred to another position within the Dept. of Agriculture that was closer to home.Working for USDA is great.  They provide excellent work schedule options to accommodate you.   Good co-workers and good support from upper management.I loved working for the USDA they try to work with you in every way possible and provide you with what you need to get your job done efficiently. Their Management is well staffed and experienced so they are very knowledgeable and dependent.
