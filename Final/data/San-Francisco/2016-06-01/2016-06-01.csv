182,183.0,"Senior Data Scientist, Big Data Products",Asurion,3.8,823.0,"This company offers lots of great supports to its remote agents. I enjoyed my team members and leaders. Supervisors and coaches were always available and willing to helpDaily routine varies based on the most current situation which could include system down time, weather or missing personnel. I learned several coaching techniques that provided excellent results.Management was reactive never proactive and is isolated from each other and staff.Co-workers are nervous, high attrition in the 12-14% monthly is expected. Employees making the 1 year mark or remaining after that point are becoming progressively rare. Training and recruitment are the most challenging, with the high attrition the requirement in a small town are taxing.Working with the associates and exceeding goals was extremely challenging and fulfilling.While working as an onboarding technician for Asurion, our typical work day was pre-planned with appointments for meeting new hires or existing agents. We would help install their work software or ensure their computers were meeting our current technical standards. I learned a lot of IT troubleshooting experience while there, and had a couple of amazing supervisors and teammates. The hardest part of the job was probably ensuring that our quality standards were met in a particular field where they were always changing. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to solve computer hardware/software related issues because a good puzzle is hard to beat.Asurion was a great work environment. My co workers and I worked as a team. Management is well rounded because they try to do everything they can to accommodate your needs. At Asurion, I was always on a set schedule from 2-11. I had Tuesdays and Wednesdays off. I was working full time. The benefits were great. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with rude customers over the phone. They would talk over you, curse you out, and really say harsh things to you. I just learn to tune them out and help them the best way I can. Working there was pretty stressful. I was in my own little cubicle, and  I didn't really have anybody to talk to. There really wasn't a way for me to socialize unless I met up with my coworkers on my off days. I love the fact that i had my own space, my own desk, my own computer, and everything. Unfortunately, I got to the point where I couldn't really take it anymore.  It wasn't enjoyable anymore.While Asurion states that it promotes from within, there's very little evidence of it.  Internal jobs may be posted, but they've already have someone in mind.  It's all about who you know and if you're in the 'click'.  You may be qualify, but you won't get the job unless you know someone.  Management just want to chain you to the telephone and expect more for less compensation.  It's merely a place to get a pay check while you diligently look for a better job.   Asurion will proudly claim to hire a lot of people in the area, but what they don't tell you is that they cannot keep good people, because they get burnt out, used and abused.Asurion is a great place to work and they are military friendly as well as diverse.  I picked up alot of management skills as well as my ASPECT training.    The hardest part about the job is adjusting to the ever changing world of technology and the way it impacts customers.  They have great benefits and will work with you to try and give that job/ life balance that you need to be successful at both.  Management is good, advancement in management becomes limited due to good leaders staying true to their position and wanting to improve upon their leadership/ management skills.When this place was NEW there was a great work culture  that was dedicated to taking care of the people that worked for the company. Since it has changed to Asurion it has been less about people and more about the bottom line. Has had so many policy changes its hard to maintain what needs to be followed and the tenure has been a revolving door.Atypical day at work is like talking to a million people, dealing with different attitudes and problems, and the environment around you is something you would have to get used to each day. I have learned at this job that certain things can make a person angry but its up to you to calm them down. Then once you calm them down the call flow will be easy. Management is really management type. They are really good people. They care for you as if it were them. Co-workers at this job can be some good associates and then you will find that person/people who will make you not wanna work there anymore. The hardest part of the job is dealing with people thru the phone and you can't help them enough over the phone and it makes you wish you were there to go ahead and fix the issue. The most enjoyable part of the day would be your lunch time and breaks. Also when you get that customer with so much respect and love that you could feel it thru the phone.Great place to work if all you want is salary and benefits. Terrible work life balance and no endorsement of advanced education. Overall I am glad for my time there as I earned my first Director title there. I still keep in touch with the people I worked with there although 99% of them have moved on as well.While historically known for its phone insurance and device protection, Asurion has turned into a tech-first company, with a focus on better customer experience and breaking grounds in the support and product fields. It was great knowing you are part of something that helps people every day, and having the freedom of a collaborative environment let me be creative and solve problems with fun, outside the box ideas. The folks are great, and you get to work with people from all disciplines and backgrounds and feel like your work has an impact on both the company, its clients, and the customers.Compensation is decent. Work life balance is terrible. There is no such thing as sick days and all bonuses are tied to the carriers ridiculous metrics. Instead of them grading us we get graded down if a customer would not recommend the carrier to a friend. Hmm, so because they have billing issues then thats our fault. The culture is ok, they try to make you believe its greater than what it is. Soon after getting out training those that have been there a while set you straight.   The turnover is so high, its basically a revolving door of employees. Your shifts change every few months. Basically if you don't rank high in the center you get what shifts no one else wanted. Management is unlike anything I have seen all based on favoritism and who chats up the higher ups the most. Tech leads have no idea how to provide support and the systems work when they want. I wanted to like it but at this point I am actively searching for another environment. It says something when only 25% of a training class sticks around and then of that within a month that gets cut in half. Honestly if you care about your work life balance and stress keep looking.You will find:-Many opportunities to earn incentives.-So-so management-Poor system infrastructure and support (things are always    freezing/crashing/or not allowing you to access them at all) be prepared to connect with the service desk, regularly.-Opportunities to raise your pay grade, quickly.-Inflexible scheduling-Fantastic benefits!The people I work with are incredible, and they make my work environment welcoming and responsive. The job has taught me valuable multitasking skills, as well as excellence and efficiency in customer service situations. My management team is effective and available for consultation on a consistent basis. The hardest part of my job are the short time frames in which to complete training exercises and simulations, but this has made me a more adaptable individual both in and outside of work. By far, the community at Asurion is my favorite part of the job.some managers are amazing some don't deserve the position. but you'll find that anywhere. if your a temp make every decision very carefully. if your full time you'll be fine unless you complain to HR about management then you'll be harassed until you quit.A great place to work that stands behind its philosophy of promoting from within. This was my first call center job and within six months of starting I was promoted to Supervisor. The opportunities are there for those who choose to take them. There are several in house benefits such as a fully loaded game room, snack bar, VIP lounges and weekly dress up days. The compensation is adequate and there are bonuses for performers.always job security, and great health benefits. Food for all the staff on weekends. Fun events like crazy hair da,y and jersey Thursday. Great incentives to get up to 600 extra on your paycheck just for doing your job correctly.This call center is like any other.  I have worked here for years and the culture has gone downhill.  You will encounter very unprofessional employees and the company is not transparent with what they say.   You get to work and count the minutes until you leave.  The monetary compensation and benefits are a joke.I enjoyed success at Asurion because I was willing to work hard and the company is great at acknowledging hard work and dedication.Asurion has been a great place to work overall. The pay and benefits are good. I work in Case Management. I started on front line Technical Support and advanced up to Case Management after 4 months of being on the job. I quickly moved up to Team Lead and was given a temporary supervisor position while another supervisor was out on medical leave. Some of my co-workers were great. I really liked the One Team effort of the majority. There is really no hard part to the position. I consistently made the top 10 of 180 Case Managers. The most enjoyable part is helping the customers resolve their issues. Management is decent. The worst part about the job is the Work at Home program for Directv is being cancelled by ATT.Like working for the company there always there when you need the help and they are always there when you need the help with the bad calls but overall good company to work for and the benefits are amazing.this company makes it pretty much impossible for you to have any type of work life balance. compensation is minimal for the area. i would never work there again.","10,000+",San-Francisco,San Mateo,CA,2016-06-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/1d0f8f78-2b7e-4b09-b50e-4d28a25225e6?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
