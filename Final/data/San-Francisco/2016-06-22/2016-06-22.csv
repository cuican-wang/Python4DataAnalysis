436,437.0,Per Diem Clinical Laboratory Scientist - Environmental,Ascend Clinical,3.8,4.0,"It gets very busy during first week but it's workable. Good company to work for. Great co-workers. My only complain/concern about Ascend is that the don't appreciate their on-call/per diem employees more than they should since they are the ones finishing the work during busy week. It was very disappointing when they announced via email that the they would be giving out bonuses during the Holidays only to discover that we (on-calls/per diem) were not included. It seems like every time they have an employee appreciation, we (the on-calls/per diem) are forgotten. We work just as hard if not harder than the regular employees. Hopefully it changes.I learned a lot and I enjoyed working in there.Nice people to work withExcellent teamwork Offers chemistry, hematology, microbiology and immunology analysis for dialysis patient demographic.I work for Ascend Clinical formerly known as Satellite Laboratories Services for almost 7 years. A typical day at work was to check all the emails to find out what what going on for the day. I learned a numerous amount about laboratory testing, and dialysis.I had great managers who were also great at at helping me advance in my career. We were a strong department and all the co-workers work together to get the priorities completed. The hardest part of my job is when we received over 800 tubes during busy week, and the labels were not labeled corrected.The most enjoyable part of the job was when we has Dialysis Week once a year. It was very festive, when had games, won many prizes, such as ipod's, computers, dishwhere, dvd, luggage. We were treated with much respect.",,San-Francisco,Redwood City,CA,2016-06-22T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/a19bc190-ad43-46dd-940b-b19ef12b3cf9?mescoid=2900515001001&jobPosition=27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
