There was no teaching involved, even though they claimed to. The communication was awful and some of the employees would party on the companies dime at vendor conferences. Very unprofessional.A typical day at work consisted of 8-11 hour work shifts. i've learned how to receive, ship, consolidate, pick and return orders. The hardest part of the job is meeting hourly or daily quota. Some days were better than others. The most enjoyable part of the job was the experience I gained and the people that i met.",,San-Francisco,San Mateo,CA,2016-11-08T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/eb7e45c5-4cf5-44b4-b541-79e671eeaa2a?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
