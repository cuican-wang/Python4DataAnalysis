It was an amicable departure.Excellent company with innovative technologies and open to creative thinking.  Wonderfully talented individuals/co-workers and a world-class management team.  Travel was definitely a tough part of the job, but interacting with so many diverse companies was hugely rewarding.  A typical day at work could range from booking travel, to conducting audits, issuing reports, closing reports, maintaining metrics, and attending meetings to report out findings.Wonderful forward thinking company. Treats patients and employees amazing.-Lots of travel 90%-Extensive learning in genetics and rare disease-Management is very forward thinking and looks at business from all angles-Co-workers are highly skilled and very accountable-Hardest part of the job is the extensive travel-The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new clientsI loved working at Biomarin. It is one of the the best companies I have had the pleasure to work at. The management is among the best I have ever seen.This was a temporary position.  Did not like this position. No communication with supervisor.  I data entry all day here had questions supervisor was not around to answer questions regarding the project I am working onExciting place to work providing very dynamic environment with great people.Lots of state of the art IT projects to get involved with providing an excellent place to work.Good Projects, Poor management, Not Rewarding Invention / Hard Work / ""Out Side the Box"" Thinking, Denying Credit when it is Due",,San-Francisco,San Rafael,CA,2016-11-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/04158c15-06d4-49a4-8456-856bcda15554?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
535,536.0,Research Scientist - Machine Intelligence,Siemens,4.1,4200.0,"at siemens the training is great the employees are friendly and there is no limit to how much you can make in terms of uncapped commissionsThe job and responsibilities were changing from hard copy to electronic.  This was challenging and gave me a pride of satisfaction after learning the tasks.  Enjoyed being a team player and working with management.  The most challenging part was the constant changing of the software and testing until the application worked correctly.  The most enjoyable part of my joy was the contact with the employees that I had to interact with in my job.Company went through many C-level management changes in the 6 years I was there.  It eventually resulted in the loss of the biggest federal contract the division had- Siemens has a wide range of products.- Siemens invests a lot of billions to develop the employees.- The team is helpful and hard workers.- The internal competition is very st rong.I was an intern at the company during a summer. Overall it was a great experience, the staff was friendly, the pay and international benefits were great.Siemens is a great company with great vision. They are career oriented and certainly are forward looking. They take a great deal of pride in producing products that improve the world.Great company to work for had safety lunches every week we were safe cared for there employees and treated me good vary professional people and companyLearned a lot quickly.  There was a mix of contractors and employees and everyone got alone.   Siemens acquired Acuson and things started to change.it was a great company to work for I learned a lot from this company and it was good pay and also good people to be around would like to work for the company long term. they teach you everything you need to knowits very nice to work in this company it has a very nice management and they pay good and it has a very good benefits.they also giving a seminar for some employees every year.This was a stable work environment. This why I work there I work there for 26 years. My only for leaving is that my retire came too early. This was challenging work it involved installing intricate medical machines in Hospitals around the world.I benefited greatly during my time at Siemens. I learn a lot about my trade and how to manage it. They also gave me the opportunity to start a management career.Held positions of responsibility ranging from Manufacturing, Procurement, Planning, and Logistics for rapidly growing company specializing in the Oil, Gas, and Mining related industryThe job is fine, the work is fine, for the most part, the people are fine (if you can tolerate the nepotism) but dealing with the local management is the bad.Responsible for all customer owned product that is sent to the repair facility.Manages tool room for production to receive all direct material to facilitate repairs. Manages 40 million dollars of direct material14 direct reportsSiemens is a great company and rewards accomplishment and proactively supports employee development. Encourages and celebrates individual success and shared goals.I went to Siemens as a contractor and was offered the chance to work full time for them. It was the best decision I made. The pay was awesome! The benefits were great! Especially wonderful were summer hours and telecommuting. Couldn't ask for anything better. Negatives - I had a new boss every year. Reviews were harder and harder every year with near impossible goals.I thoroughly enjoyed working at Siemens, however there are too many chiefs and not enough indians. No one was ever on the same page and there was always confusion.Here at Siemens I have many roles. They give their employees the chance to advance which is great. Compensation and benefits are amazing. My co workers make my job easier.I worked up ther for a month in the electrical division syarcuse ny office. Im a field service gen/engine tech. Was promised a vehicle  with gas card before I started. That never happened. I was doing service work from my own vehicle. I also could have hired a secretary  on my behalf. Way to much paper work. 12 Pages of paper work for a pm. Crazy. There system is awfull. Benifits are good but u paying for.  Money was not worth the hassle.  Great supiv. Loved him was not his fault. Also to much back stabbing going on. I quit and moved on.  Think about going to work in the generation division for this company.  Thank you.An excellent workplace where I have been educated further in my Equipment Finance and portfolio management career. Once a division with an increasing portfolio willing to bid and finance various types of industries and transactions, SFS is shortening its vision of what to finance, limiting it more to Siemens related products and industries.","10,000+",San-Francisco,Berkeley,CA,2016-11-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/1d4b8dfc-62fd-4970-b171-9b7760ce519c?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=21,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
