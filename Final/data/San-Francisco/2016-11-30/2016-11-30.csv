43,44.0,Senior/Principal Software Engineer - Analytics Platform,Workday Inc.,3.6,19.0,"I've worked for other software giants, and no one compares to Workday! Their comp and onboarding for sales rep is like nothing I've ever seen. The benefits dept is also making huge strides in the family leave policy for 2017. Can't say enough great things about Workday!!Workday provides a great work/life balance and the opportunity to grow your skill set.  I enjoyed working with a diverse group of individuals and look forward to new opportunities.Hiring spree has resulted in the standards falling especially for the way middle level managers have been hired.  Many of the junior level managers to mid-level managers do not deserve to be managers in the company.  This is fast becoming another Oracle.Workday is the first technology company that I worked for that allows me to use the technology daily and it is the exact same software we sell to prospects.I was recruited by Workday and ended up relocating to Pleasanton from the east coast.  I had hoped Workday a place where i could stay for quite a while but ultimately this was not a good fit for me.  As an SME with over 20 years experience in my industry I was very anxious to develop and delivery best of breed functionality into my product area.  Although the developers, qa and documentation people were great, I found to be the middle and upper management inflexible and stuck in their old ""ERP"" ways given most or previous Peoplesoft or Oracle employees.  If you have background from a best of breed solution and want to work for Workday make sure you get a demo of the product before accepting a position at Workday.Workday places it's employees first in all core values. from that fundamental discipline all other values fall into place and a superior product is developed.If you didn't work around the clock. You didn't get respect. New management that has been coming in has no respect. The culture was dead when I got terminated. However people acted as if nothing had changed. New management loved people who made spread sheets, but didn't care or turned a blind eye to those who really did work.I was terminated for being late when I was never given a warning. And in-fact some of the late was work related from being on call. I got sick of trying to make my manager happy when he was doing noting but lieing to me, so I accepted the termination with little resistance.Don't get me wrong. There is some good things still at workday. But don't expect the great place to work as solid gold. Managers ask you to lie to please CEO and management on the public best place to work surveys. I always told the truth. It was a good place for me, till about a year ago.Its all about the money because they went public.Working at Workday was complete go to market strategy for a subsection of prospects. This required multiple marketing strategies and specific communication cadences to help deliver the Workday message.Here is a CEO that is a billionaire and starts another technology company because he does it for the love and his ""passion"" for technology! I call him the ""Picasso"" of technology and the culture here is reflective of his love to this work. How many leaders can you say that about?Typical day read all emails and handle all priorities. Daily check of all kitchens and copy areas. Handle all service request and complete in a timely manner. I have learned how to time manage my workload and prioritize. I really liked my job there was no negative as far as workday. The toughest part of my job was my manager. I truly believe that upper management should not hiring family members within the same department.Great company to work for.  Customer Success is the key!  Good eye on the product. Long hours and they treat their employees well.Big ideas but no knowledge how to achieve them. Management is dated and clueless how to update their aging software. Want innovation but have no experience on the process to create innovative products. Be prepared to be blamed for their lack of knowledge. Have your resume ready for your next job interview.Great place to work but be ready to work more hours than there are in a day.Co-workers and management are all of high-caliberMake sure to get as much feedback from managementKnow who you have to impressFun and Fast moving environment with great leadershioJust know that yours and anyone's job is on the line everydayGreat top management, and bottom hard working level engineers. The middle management are full of politic. It has turn the company into political power house. The company double and nearly triple in size in less than a year and half, and created huge gap and confusion from top to bottom.I love working for Workday, unfortunately, my project is ending so I have to leave.  I love Workday for the following reasons:They like to use cutting edge technologyThey are completely professionalThey change around everyone's jobs every 6 months or so which keeps people happy.I had high hopes of success here, but it was not a good fit for me. I don't know why, but the overall energy is better for a young, just-out-of-school herd of eager folks, I think.On-boarding is the “mechanism through which new employees acquire the necessary knowledge, skills, and behaviors to become effective organizational members”Helps your ""new hires"" make the transition to becoming:• productive• well-adjusted• and a happy contributing members of your company/teamPost (Corporate) ""lift off orientation on-boarding"" ranked low on the list of hiring priorities – poorly designed and even more poorly executed if there was one in place.No on-boarding at multiple organizational levels post (Corporate) ""lift off orientation"" – spent a great deal of time operating blind.• On-boarding at ""Location Level"" was nonexistent. i.e., Next steps? Working From Home? Go to Local Office? Contact Info? Office supplies?• On-boarding at ""Departmental Level"" was sporadic at best. Very California ""centric"".• On-boarding at ""Team/Job Level"" – No real interaction or introductions if you were not in the California offices. No ‘Go-to Person’ as a contact/mentor. Experienced very little peer/colleague camaraderie. ""everyone out for themselves"" or ""got my own problems"" or ""no time"".• On-boarding at ""Individual Level"" was nonexistent. Travel Policy? Expenses? Emergency Contact List? Appropriate Contact Protocol? Department Manager failed to make expectations clear.- how would individual performance be assessed?- bonus and promotion criteria/opportunities?- clear and written “objectives” that stated accountable and measurable ROI were non-existent.- generalized discussions on “time to productivity” was all over the map depending on conversation  more... and WHO you were speaking with.- never presented with documentation as reference, guidance, expectations or accountability.Terrible, Terrible, Terrible!  lessVery happy customer base that helps with referrals.  A challenge is to find companies that will replace all of their existing HCM applications, and getting them to justify a premium.","5,001 to 10,000",San-Francisco,San Mateo,CA,2016-11-30T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/1c774328-6672-4251-8320-41056cf22bbd?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The salary is not bad and you feel fulfilled because of it.Good team, manageable workload, Good Management, Learnt several new skills like Java, Spring, Oracle etc. More Vacation. Helpful Co-Workers.Good company to work with but IT moving to India.  There is career advancement and opportunities to work in other countries.Enjoyable place to work. Would like to see more stability and less change.  Micromanagement is everywhere and the next change is always just around the corner. It is hard to be effective in an environment where you are always looking over your shoulder.good balance of work. Director mgrs have positive attitude. difficult to get things completed. Overall there is a positive work environment.Good work-life balance; nice people. Good pay and benefits.  Nice and supportive culture. Management is supportive and company offers lots of opportunities for career and personal growthI worked there for a lot of years.No teamwork. Lack of cooperation. Bad decisions are common place.Management seems more interested in furthering their personal careers than making quality products.Casual depending on what location. Nepotism and Favoritism, Typical coworkers some you love to work with other. Constant change and learning. okay company to work for.Thomson Reuters set up yearly goals that make no sense which are mandatory. they do not assist in career development so employees are left confused by them.Tax and Accounting Department doesn't seem to be doing the things necessary to have long term employment for their sales personnel. Products are outdated and over priced, the way people sell them now devalues their prices in the first place, creating two seasons where you can sell products - q2, and q4. Pay was continually downgraded - they would up your base salary and completely soften your commissions. The third year of my employment I would have had to sell 150K more than I sold my second year to make the same amount of money. Pressure from management to make a certain number of dials a day, you're monitored, and if you don't hit your numbers - whether sales or dials you are on this ice. Out perform your team and go two hundred percent of quota? you're still there late at the end of the month, and management is extremely quick to forget your performance if you have a lackluster quarter due to their poor business strategy. The training here is top notch, and the managers are mostly good.Working here opens the doors to so many opportunities.  Their training for interns puts more emphasis on preparing you for the future you desire than a future with the company, and the VP of Customer Operations takes the time to learn everybody's names and get to know you pretty well.  Strong emphasis on work/life balance at this company.  They ask that you don't take your work home with you, and they are heavy on the coffee breaks.Overall great place to work!The benefits are declining, the management i always changing and their is always uncertainty as to who will be in charge the next week and if you will have a job.TR has a great company culture as a whole. I worked in the ONESOURCE Product Support as a contractor, your time there is obviously limited. Unfortunately, they have a habit of promising certain things and not following through with those promises. Management in my department was incredibly unstable, restructuring is needed. Managers are really just seeking to look good to their own bosses, everyone else is overlooked and is disposable. The job itself was great, I learned a lot and it's valuable information to carry in the future. My biggest complaint is the management consistently lying. Typical day at work is extremely structured, you come in, must be ready to go at 8am and not a second later. 30 minutes of break time for the full day, can divide it up into 15 minute breaks or smaller. I learned more about the tax process, it's information I know I can use later on. Management (read above). Coworkers are great, we're all in the mess together so they make it better to be there. Hardest part of the job is dealing with an unstable management team, the job itself is fine. I enjoyed the job greatly, learning a lot and feeling like you accomplished helping others.It's easy and you know what to expect going into work. There isn't much variety however the management team is nice and helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job is the quiet atmosphere and independent work environment. I learned more about excel with this position.Nice place to work , good work life balance . Good opportunities to learn new technologies and they have a very good management to support the latest trends.Management is pleasant, generally expects around 40 hours/week.Coworkers are pleasant and knowledgeable about the tasks at hand.Constantly learning and working with new programming paradigms.Thomson Reuters is a good company that has a lot of opportunity for growth but struggled to place the company in the correct vertical due to the type of business that we were part of.Most team members worked remotely so we had weekly conference calls to provide progress and updates on progress. We had the chance to work independently as well as collaboratively.My co-workers were the greatest--very supportive and willing to help out to meet deadlines if necessary.My boss held monthly information meetings to help us learn new skills that would enhance our job performance.Thomson Reuters is a top-ranking information services company with over 50,000 employees.  Senior Management did not hesitate to lay off as many people as they possibly could, but they never gave up on their bonuses.  Though, my working experience was great, but the phase was pretty rough.  I really enjoyed the technical aspect of the project, and don't regret the opportunity.Great company to work for, good people.  The management was great to work for.  The company provides a good workplace environment.  They provide many learning opportunities as well.TR is constantly changing management hierarchy which became a bit tedious and confusing. As with large companies of this nature, the bottom line is saved for the stockholders. Massive layoffs were expected on a bi-annual basis with very little domestic back-filling. Most of the technical development was moved to a consulting firm in India which had competing objectives with TR and made the job more difficult than it should have been.","10,000+",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-11-30T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/c41b38d4-1f60-447d-b300-f9f94112776c?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=10,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
73,74.0,Associate Data Scientist - New Grad,"Salesforce.com, Inc.",4.3,161.0,"Amazing industry with great growth potential. Hardest part of the job is management and changing dynamics of roles. Company culture is sometimes not what it seems.Rosetta Stone is committed to making sure that learning languages is fun, easy and accessible.  The atmosphere is laid back and the teams all combine together to make sure the job gets done.Salesforce company culture, benefits, work/life balance and flexibility are pretty good.  There are certain areas within Salesforce that are much better than others (R&D/product side of the house, HR, etc) seem to be run very well, care about their employees and have great career development in place.  IT, has the same benefits, but lacks both the career growth/development opportunities, and positive management.  I'd suggest if you are considering Salesforce and are technical go to R&D and steer clear of IT.  Otherwise, loved the culture and environment.Have good experience everyday.Learned new subjects.Has a great management.Good friends to find.New things to learn all the time.Salesforce is an booming future technology, making customers access easy by completely moving to cloud with good customer requirement customization application.Amazing peopleAmazing projectGood cultureFun and WorkHardest part : nonemost fun part : always new things, people have visionlot of internal growth opportunitiesThe company will take care of its employees and it's fostered a very positive work culture, perhaps the best I've been part of.Great place to work.

Great company to work for and lots of trainings to learn from.Company's Ohana is great.Work on Salesforce database. Tasks depend on the specific project you are working on. flexible on arrival time, as long as you put in your hours and get the job done.Salesforce is an amazing opportunity to learn about the world of information technology in the cloud. There is an incredible steep learning curve and bombardment of information however the longer you stay the more you start to grasp significance and advantages of each vertical. Salesforce is one of the best companies to experience and they have upward mobility for anyone willing to work for it.Great company with really good intentions. However, they want/need to expand exponentially and that leads to a little confusion. Lots of resources (maybe too much) and some overlap which can lead to confusion. I felt that it was almost becoming a production line and this left little room for creativity and also to ""find your fit"" from a personality perspective.Great company to work for. Great learning experience with trainings and company culture.Lots of room for growth and ability to move within the company. Employees are treated very well.Work hard and play hard attitude. They follow there 1/1/1 philosophy. The employees are well diverse. Everyone is nice and kind.A typical work day at Salesforce consist of emails, meetings, written communications, and networking. In my role, I learned about leadership such as event coordinating, volunteer coordinating, public speaking, and being resourceful. The work culture is very diverse by age, cultural background, and education level. The most enjoyable part about Salesforce is that it's a company that's an advocate on volunteering and philantrophy. They encourage employees to give back to their community or a nonprofit organization. I've never heard of that concept until I worked for Salesforce.It is a great place with very smart people. There are many opportunities in this huge and still growing company. Great 1:1:1 model and success platform.I implemented 5 Documentations to Sales and Marketing Executives  to understand Renewals Business Processes. I managed 7 projects on a tight deadline.

190,191.0,Data Scientist,"TEKsystems, Inc",3.9,1400.0,"The Portsmouth NH office is good at matching you with their clients needs.TEKsystems was very happy with my performance at Sprint at all times.  They were truly a wonderful agency to work for.  They went out of their way to make my work experience at Sprint truly rewarding by stopping by to check on me.  They usually praise me in front of upper management.  That truly made me feel valuable.Even though I work for TEKSystems on a 3rd party global service contract as a Business Systems Analyst, the client is who we support with labor and our experiences. The client is disorganized and does not understand process improvement. They spend lots of time filling out FDS's and other documents that have no standards. Working for TEK is great but for the customer our group is underutilized.I would never work a contract position or use TEKSystems to place me into any position ever again.  Every opportunity they have presented me with was grossly underpaid, and the positions and work environments misrepresented.  Contractors are nothing more than a cash cow for them, and they treat them as such.  I was lied to about many things, such as provided parking (that actually cost me $11.50 per day) to the integrity of the managers at the client site.  I regret working with TEKSystems, and they have literally cost me THOUSANDS of dollars and ruined my holidays.  Stay FAR FAR FAR away from TEKSystems in Omaha NE.They sign you up and make sure your in the program all is great for about the first month and a half. Then they tell you you can't apply for other jobs ant they will not let you forget that, Then they spring on you that your contract is no longer gonna go how long they said it was going to g, which means no job until they find you something else so your basically stuck with then once you sign onEverything i learned came easy with how helpful everyone was and how well everyone worked as a team to get everything done on time. We helped move along the company for the cut-over and go-live projects to allow them to use the new software and scan guns. With that we stuck around to help train employees how to use the scan guns and troubleshoot mistakes and wrong actions.I have been doing contract work (on and off) for TEKsystems about 3+ years.  Their staff is always very helpful and address my needs when it comes to work.  They take care of their employees and make sure that the job they place you in is a good fit.  I really enjoy working with them and their eagerness to help.I have worked for Teksystems under the Pensacola, FL office and my experience was good. But the Teksystems in the New Orleans office is horrible lol. I dnt know where they get their recruiters or account manager from buy they are so not qualified. They do not do their homework but expect you to do yours, completely unorganized. If Teksystems is a ""Tech"" company, they should know IT terminology and not some notes from a website. I wouldn't work for Teksystems of New Orleans, I'll try another office.To be successful, you have to commit at LEAST 10 hours or more to your job. You can leave ""early"" at 5:00-5:30, but will have a lot of judgement from other people in the office. If you consistently, leave at that time your integrity to the company will be questioned. The company culture is amazing and so much fun, but if you don't want to live at work I don't recommend it.As with all staffing agencies the primary function is to find qualified, and reliable help for a client. Sometimes this takes all focus off of the worker and makes them feel like a number rather than a person. TEKsystems has been able to balance the relationship beautifully. Caring not only for the client but the people they send to those clients.Working with company has been a great experience compared to other staffing companies.  The recruiters stay in constant contact with you and ask questions about your current assignment.I enjoyed going to work everyday. This company is a recruitment company that strives to help the client as well as the employee. A typical day was to meet with my client and go over the goals for the day/week. the hardest part was working with the city people. The best was working with our contractors.My day consist of imaging laptops and desktop internal configurations desktop support tier 3 machine builds. I have a proven track record of meeting deadlines and service level objectives and have good judgment and to whom to escalate problems to various levels of the IT chain of command. I also have a proven track record deploying Window 7 as the lead tech and as a Deployment tech working with the project team and business unit contacts to confirm specific list of applications for each user to be migrated in a business group unit/group.TEKsystems has two primary business lines - (1) IT Staffing, and (2) Consulting Services.I was part of the latter, called TEKsystems Global Services.  During the selling and delivering of consultant services, we worked closely with the staffing side to acquire additional roles needed to fulfill the engagement.  The two organizations work virtually seamlessly together and make a great pairing.TEKsystems is a great place for your career - beginning, middle and end!Working for TEK means getting paid to be a contractor. If you are a contractor, you are treated as a replaceable cog in a machine and afforded that level of respect, especially if you work for state government via TEK. This is a good company to work for in terms of salary, but don't plan to stay in this role.TEKsystems is an excellent place to work. They provide high level training and maintain an excellent company culture. This promote from within company offers opportunity to expand your career at a faster rate than most Fortune 500's. I truly enjoy the people I work with!Working at TEKSystems has been an experience. Personally I haven't found pleasure because of the type of work I am performing on top of the fact the work life balance is non existent. The people you work with are great but there is always someone people are willing to help more than others which is essential to being successful.this is the tech industry production is essential. Environment changes from fast paced to slow, you must be flexible.When environment slows down more experienced co-workers are willing to share their   knowledge with less experienced workers.TEKsystems is a nice place to work.  Like any other company it has its positives and negatives.  I enjoy the work environment, the work life balance in my current role and the people I work with.learned many useful tips, and taught some.hardest part of the job was knowing that you had no benefits or raises available. Enjoyed working with most of my co-workers, always willing to help each other.This is a great entry level position to get experience in the IT field, however with no PTO and no paid holidays, it makes it tough to stay with it for more than a year. It helps get the experience for your resume to acquire a more steady career in the near future.","1,001 to 5,000",San-Francisco,Martinez,CA,2016-11-30T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/6dd46047-9de6-4ebd-99c5-0a757bbe42af?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
