120,121.0,Data Scientist 2   Utilities SaaS Analytics,Oracle,3.9,1000.0,"The experience I have gained here has challenged me and allowed me to continue to learn and explore. It has also helped me to understand the environment of a large corporation. I enjoy my co-workers and learn something new from them everyday. Since we are scattered across the country, its challenging to not have hands-on training, which is the hardest part of my job. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to know my customers, being their support contact, and researching their needs.Oracle is good company to work. Offers a lot of opportunities. Learned about NPI process steps. Financially very strong.This required a lot of travel so if you do not like traveling this could be a problem.  There is not much office interaction and management is usually remote.My time at Oracle was tremendous. The products, services and people are truly amazing. I learned what it takes for an enterprise organization to function within the technology industry. Great co-workers, great leaders.My employment was through an acquisition. The company is not very friendly towards the customers or employees that it acquired. The processes only work well for Oracle and not so much for acquired companies. The internal processes are very difficult to navigate and it will often feel as though you have to fight to get things accomplished. Nothing is resolved quickly.This job was great to work at and learn but unfortunately I did not foresee much room for growth. My co-workers were always willing to lend a hand and so was the business manager. Sadly, many people would leave the company after a few years due to little opportunities in career advancement and compensation.Working at Oracle/Taleo I have learned the HR tracking applications.   Within this application, I am supporting existing clients, consultants with basic configuration questions and bug related issues.   Working on this application requires indepth troubleshooting skills, patience, excellent customer service skills.The company is a huge mix of millennials and a little bit of professionals. The pay is okay, could be better. After a Re-org and now the acquisition of NetSuite, the future seems dim. Seeking something new, bur taking my time as it is not awful here, just not settled in and really don't plan to do so.* dynamic work environment* inexperienced management* not so steady co-workers* frequent organizational changes* learned a lot on Oracle's engineered systemsIt was challenging, but people do want and need Consulting Services from Oracle.  It is more a matter of the sales setup, in terms of who gets credit for what, which turned out to be the most challenging part of the job.Set boundaries early as it relates to your personal life. Average hours worked were 50+hrs. Great colleagues - intelligent hard workers. High emphasis on automation.Oracle is a very good company to work for. I worked from home, and become very good at figuring things out on my own. Their intranet is where you find out what you need to know. Due to many mergers and acquisitions, there were always new products to add to our sales portfolio. With the move to cloud based technologies, ongoing learning is part of the culture. I enjoyed the learning experiences while working there, and the people are top notch to work with.Oracle provided me with a lot of amazing resources and opportunities. At the same time, the culture is a bit stale and management didn't seem to care much about our success.Good job advancement.  Benefits were good, but they were a little pricey.  I had the ability to work from home.  My manager allowed me to manage my own schedule.Friendly enviornment at workplace. You get more work-life balance, its like fun and work at your workplace with your colleagues. Apart from work, you get good social network with your co-workers and in other team members.Its a place you go to for a good work life balance. However, if someone is looking to work in a challenging and high growth environment - this is not a place for him/her.Oracle is a great company to work at if you want to save money in your 401K, not a good place if you want to enjoy your job. I can only speak for the sales department. It's easy, but not many people like it.Oracle is well established company with lot of technical and business depth and a stable place to work at. The company is in a process of going through change in order to respond to the changes in the industry.Excellent Work place, would def recommend working at Oracle. good team environment and a potential to make a good living.Company provides a lot of support for training, but upward mobility is limited unless you have a supportive manager. Patches are inconsistent. High turnover.Awesome people to work for. Great management and location. They work hard to allow advancement in the company. Would work there again.","10,000+",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-10-06T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/2d96f7a7-29da-49ca-a097-473d42f4a81b?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
