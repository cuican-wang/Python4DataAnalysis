111,112.0,Data Scientist (macys.com),"Macy's, Inc.",3.7,14600.0,"A typical day at Macy's consists of selling women's shoes to customers, while maintaining a positive attitude and openness to questions or concerns, while ringing up customers and making sure that there is a clean and orderly sales floor for people to shop. With this job I have learned to deal with the personalities of others and to be more open to changes and also to aim high in all that I do.  My co workers and I usually work as a team and cover each others shifts when needed. The hardest part of the job is making sure everything is done on time, due to the many steps and the doable responsibilities. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and being able to earn small token s of appreciation, like extra money and discounts. And of course Management; which is great. Management at Macy's understands that there is more to life than just the store. Allowing the needs of its employees to be met as best.Macy's is a company that i do not recommend staying in for more than 3 years. Managers are unprofessional and do not help the growth of their associates. They do work with your schedule to an extent. The managers are only concern with what benefits them as well as their Macy's card statistics. Again I would not recommend anyone staying passed at least 2 years with this company.Macy's is a great place to work as well as shop. I enjoyed being a salesperson. This job prepared me to working in a salesperson type atmosphere and helped with all communication skills.Working in Macys they gives you the option to have a flexible schedule , it may be minimun pay but atmosphere of store its pretty great. I liked working in Macys.Working for Macy's I personally learned and had complete access to the tools needed for success. Working here I received something known as a Macy's Stars which congratulates awesome customer service.The atmosphere is great to work in and the staff is really friendly and outgoing. its easy going and a great experience for retail.I did not like the way my job ended here. There was no notification from my manager in person, just a message on the scheduling thing that my employment would be ending because I was seasonal. With the closing of Cortana Mall's Macy's, their employees transferred, while I was replaced by a fulltime employee from Cortana.Macy's management team as well as the support team all work together to complete the goal for the day. Friendly staff whom all love thier jobs and etc.I liked working with macys, easy work and easy to learn. Poor management in my opinion. Different management would bring me to reapply.A typical day consists of marking down merchandise that has been scheduled by corporate.  Goal is set to have in the 90% completion by Wednesday of each week.Daily frustration is working by the inadequate and uninformative markdown sheets and unorganized stockrooms.Nice company with a lot of great perks. Really enjoyed my time here, it's just too bad it didn't last long because it was a seasonal job. Other then that the job is pretty laid back.I always start my day in the home dept. Working on towels and bed/blanket/pillow, and start off doing recovery work. The most enjoyable part of the job, is learning new things, and trying something new too! Like recovery work with the Christmas ornaments and decorations, recovery work in the Kids, Men, and Women dept. The hardest part is dealing with some customer myself, sometime I try my best to be independent, and try to help them by myself. Sometime I end up asking other co workers for help though. I learned how to tell the different brands of towels, beds/pillows/blankets, and different brands of clothes too!Its a very good company in which to advance but it requires allot of dedication and hard work requiring many hours of overtime.-Provided apparel sales and excellent customer relations.-Answered department phone inquiries.-Kept all merchandise displays in an orderly manner.-Reviewed cash operations for accuracy and restocked inventory.-Market & solicit customers to apply for a macy's card.-Provided detailed information on new products.-Determined a target market & revised a strategy to get customers to purchase different products.Overall Macy's is a wonderful company and they treat their employees well. They are pretty flexibly with your scheldule and are willing to work with you.♣	One of the main responsibilities that I had at my job was to provide excellent customer service. Customer service was a huge deal. Providing good customer service brings clients back to shop at your store. It is all about engaging with customers, making a connection, and bringing sales. ♣	Some of my responsibilities as a sales associate was to help customers, keep the floor nice and clean, stock the floor with new merchandise, inventory, fulfillment, and keep updated with new sales that were going on in the store.I learnt a lot of things like how to use the register for cashier and comfortable in counting cash. The co-workers are very helpful.There is no hardest part because everything is easy and i am a quick learner.I desperately needed a job so I accepted the Macy's job. I worked overnight almost 12 hour shifts for around $8 hr. I did my job a long with my supervisor's for the same pay. I was promised a raise but never got it.This was a holiday part time position. Cannot rate it right now. This is a very long application and I don't have time to spend on this all day.Macy's started as a holiday position in the Christmas department.I got to set up all the holiday displays and trees, I handled  all the ornaments holiday decorations sales. After the holidays they decided to keep me and i worked in the ladies department. I loved working there.I enjoyed the fast pace environment and helping my customers. The people that i worked with were friendly and everyone had a really great attitude.The opportunities for advancement werent numerous but you had the ability to transfer to many of the different departments so you were always learning new and valuable things that made you more efficient.Good working environment can be boring at times.  But very fun to be around and interact with different people. And it can be good cause you can develop your people skills.","10,000+",San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-10-15T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/a952fc13-f9d2-4dff-8fab-f63f6f69e012?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=15,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
