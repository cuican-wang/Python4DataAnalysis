123,124.0,Data Scientist - Forecasting,"Rodan & Fields, LLC",4.4,48.0,"The job culture, the trainings, the team, the camaraderie.. it's definitely a dream come true! It takes time to plant seeds and advance, but the entire biz plan is worth the dedication.The Sales Support department is an absolute mess. Systems are always crashing, management is too busy or incapable of answering questions or basic follow-up. Other departments are slow to respond to important inquiries. Generally too much paperwork and red tape to go through to get anything meaningful done.The pay, benefits and company culture make the company a great place to work overall, but the Sales Support department is in need of a huge revamp.Initially, the company was fantastic and the job was pretty enjoyable. Then the company's consultant and client base grew exponentially, we were understaffed, short stocked, dealing with outdated and troublesome software systems, our resources for appeasement were limited, micromanaging us seemed like the goal because other departments were not performing adequately & then dealing with screaming phone calls -we were getting chewed on both ends, all stick & no carrot. The company kept wanting suggestions to combat the high turnover rate but they just didn't listen. Options for overtime & weekend hours to catch up on the backlog of emails or calls eventually became pretty standard or else it would become mandatory. Of course, there were impressive incentives offered but after a while, those dwindled in the direction of underwhelming. Promotions were available but competitive and sometimes those decisions were perplexing. Benefits (dental/health) were pretty top notch, 401k planning, and at the time, they were attempting to offer stock options but those couldn't be cashed until you had been there 3+ years. The only saving grace would be the coworkers who felt more like family and were wonderfully supportive while saving your sanity.Great culture, very poor mid management.  Growth outpaces the intellect in the building but hey, at least there is growth!  Good pay, good perks including a box at Oracle arena!If you can weather the storm of the chaotic management stylesand overall internal strife that has been happening over the change in the C level folks, then go for itYou work for yourself.  It is a multi level marketing company that sales skin care products.  A typical day would be trying to sign up customers to purchase the products, check on current status's of other orders.Love this company. I started two years ago and really impressed by the support and growth that is available. Highly recommend this company.Joining up with Rodan + Fields was the best decision I've ever made. This job has been such a blessing to my family. I am able to work without compromising my valuable family time.Amazing skincare that actually works!  I was hesitant to try it, let alone become a consultant for Rodan + Fields but now I can't live without the products. I love the skin I'm in!As an Independent Consultant for Rodan and Fields, you have the perfect work life balance. You work as little or as much as you like. The opportunities are endless. The hardest part of the job is just getting off the ground. The leadership is beyond what I have ever experienced.very social, but not consistent, when sales are good money is great, tedious almost all of the time and thats what i loved the most, pyramid company, not stable enough for my family especially financially hard with my special needs sons dr. billsFun work place, with wonderful people to work with. Growing and developing skills needed in a job force and real life.Wonderful experience of good skin care, learning to care for your skin and teaching others how to do so. It's wonderful to spread such a wonderful message and advice! Really does change lives.It is a wonderful way to help my friends and family with their skin complaints with products that work and a reputalbe company that cares about it's sales reps and customers. The difficult part of the job is trying to bring up the product in daily conversation and not pushing the intrested party too hard. But its keep the balance of sales rep and helpful friend that is key to being sucessful. Also learning useful marketing skills to help grow and expand my clients and awareness.The products are amazing, and it can be as structured as you would like.  I enjoy using the products and the people on my team which keeps me involved.I love meeting new people, the perks and just the fact that you can stay home with a flexible schedule, where if you have kids you can take them to their sports and school without a worry who can pick them up !!!Great community of people who are overall incredibly supportive and helpful.  Work when and where you want.  I love having extra spending money when I get paid and look forward to it being more than that.Work from home, set my own hours, I am the boss get to work with a fabulous team and product developers. I'm home with my son when he needs meGreat place to work. Great people. Make sure that when you apply, you apply for something you really want to do. Make sure you recognize your worth, so they can respect your work!A typical day is contacting individuals who I feel may be interested in purchasing skincare for problem areas.   I have learned being persistent and following-up is very important in sales and I can't be disappointed if someone is not interested.  I am an individual consultant, however, I work with a team who work together and motivate each other.   I love meeting new people and telling them about Rodan+Fields.  Typicially, a win win for everyone.  Better skin and I make money!Rodan and Fields allows me to work in direct sales on my own time. I can make as little or as much money as I want. Advancement is based on my own personal drive and willingness to succeed. I enjoy fitting my business in my life a few hours a week and I am my own boss.Doctors Rodan and Fields created Proactiv and from the success of Proactiv, they started Rodan and Fields.  It is an amazing company that offers continuous learning, advancement, and fantastic products to market and sell.  They provide all the tools and training to build successful teams.  I don't have a typical day at work because it is a business that it done on my terms and on my time, so it is very flexible.I have learned more about recruiting, leading, and building a team and profitable customer base. I manage a team of over 20 other consultants.The hardest part of the job is rejection.The most enjoyable part of the job is celebrating with people when they experience amazing results of our products or achieve financial security.",,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-10-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/38471eff-fcbc-4399-8d02-7a05cca3f4e9?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
