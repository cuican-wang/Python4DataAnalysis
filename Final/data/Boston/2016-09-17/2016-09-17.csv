126,838.0,New Grad - Data Scientist,ViaSat,3.7,63.0,"People were friendly, the view was nice, nothing extremely exciting. Felt like a typical medium-large company. A really good place for long term, steady employment.A typical day is jumping into phone queues that are each stacked 10 calls deep waiting, because of some change that R&D made overnight without telling anybody about it.  I learned that if you try to care about every angry person calling in, you will be destroyed from the inside out by stress.  The management needs to be completely replaced.  They make up rules about performance without sharing them with the employees, ignoring written policy, and don't tell you that you have been breaking said rule until you have broken it enough times for them to have cause to fire you.  It was probably because I was making a lot more than the new people they had started hiring, and they are trying to weed out the older generation of employees so they don't have to pay as much.  Coworkers are great for the most part.  The hardest part of the job was the stress and anxiety that was brought on by just walking into the building.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the friends that I made over the 2 years I worked here.22 mile per day bike ride every day, every year.Able to work at my own, accelerated pace without restriction.Very stable product line.There's a great lack of coordination of projects, technology and strategies between divisions.  Each does its own & is very close hold about sharing.Good company. Had been contracting with ViaSat Inc in Carlsbad from Nov 2013 to till date.Would refer others to work here.Will be the leader for inflight wi-fi in the next 5 years. Culture is great in Carlsbad but needs work in the Denver office. Good people work there and they have great benefits.Very laid back but productive companyThe benefits are outstandingA lot of opportunities for employmentThe chance to work on groundbreaking technologies.Terrific company. Appreciate the ability I was given to learn and advance. I would recommend ViaSat to anyone in the industry.This was not for Viasat as a whole, this was for a Sub-Contractor company out of Alabama. They where extremely un-professional, paid in a different way every time and we had to request a list of what we had been paid for. The product I can still stand behind, it is a very good service that is fast and reliable as long as it's installed correctly. The company as a whole, I never had any issues with. Just this one sub-contractor (Bama PC Comm in association with Perfect 10) was very hard to deal with, and I suspect they are running a scheme against their installers.I was only an intern for a summer and it was my first job. But everyone was very polite, friendly, and understanding. I can't comment much more on the company culture other than perhaps it was a bit...boring? The salary and benefits were excellent though.Viasat had a great work culture, room for advancement in department as well as lateral advancement possibilities.  Great bennefits and diverse groups to work with.Great product lines.The people at ViaSat were extremely friendly and worked very hard at their jobs.  Great benefits and compensation.  Good work environment.I feel happy to work here.Good support from collegues.I feel good working with this company.I enjoy working life with this company.Its a nice time to work here.ViaSat is an excellent place to work for self-starters and people who can think creatively. Anything is possible at ViaSat, which can be difficult for people who definite rules.Layoff common without reason. Upper Manager does not know what is doing.  Layoff common. Do not give good directions. They have too many meetings.I tell you, hopeless grief is passionless;That only men incredulous of despair,Half-taught in anguish, through the midnight airBeat upward to God’s throne in loud accessOf shrieking and reproach. Full desertness,In souls as countries, lieth silent-bareUnder the blanching, vertical eye-glareOf the absolute heavens. Deep-hearted man, expressGrief for thy dead in silence like to death —Most like a monumental statue setIn everlasting watch and moveless woeTill itself crumble to the dust beneath.Touch it; the marble eyelids are not wet:If it could weep, it could arise and go.Able to set work hours as long as you worked 8 hours.  You had to be self-sufficient, which I really enjoyed.  I learned to build multiple cable assemblies.  I learned the Viasat ways and their procedures.  The management had an open door policy.  My co-workers were great to work with.  They were willing to help whenever needed.  Always open to suggestions,  worked great as a team.  The hardest part of my job was managing my time with all the work I had.  The most enjoyable part of the job at Viasat  was the work and the people that I was associated with.Awesome place to work, the culture is amazing.  The work you do is innovative and fun.  very exciting place to work, always working with changing technology.I had a great time interning for this company. They offered challenging yet manageable tasks. I was assigned to a group of interns that matched my skills and experience. The work environment was very friendly and they offered many benefits such as a nearby gym, volleyball courts, and cafeteria.Unfortunately, I have been having difficulty re-contacting any previous connections.Enjoyed the working there because of the co-workers, the facilities and the culture. The opportunities for advancement seemed limited.It is a very nice work place to work, people are very friendly, no free lunch but has some snacks supplied for overnight engineers","1,001 to 5,000",Boston,Quincy,MA,2016-09-17T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/1256edf2-b674-424f-97e4-ac1422c54b25?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=5,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
