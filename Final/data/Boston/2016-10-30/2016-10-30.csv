199,911.0,Machine Learning Engineer (Research Scientist),"Analog Devices, Inc.",4.3,107.0,"Analog is a great semiconductor company with some really good managers who act as mentors as much as directing tasks.  My only complaint (as of 2004) was the pay.  They figured bonus and stock options as part of the package, but both were very unreliable over the 6 years I worked thereGood pay and benefits, shut down between Christmas and New Years.  Communication could be better.  Transitioning from Hittite Microwave to Analog Devices has been tough.I learned SCHEMATIC and PWORK to prepare detailed electrical and mechanical drawings for new product development.Create CAM files for a copper clipboard.Assemble boards for testing and stock and order parts for staff of 25.Analog opens room to his employees to grow within his organisation.Analog creates a channel where all employees can bring innovative ideas or thoughts.Human rights at Analog are treated fairly and equitably, and that created a very friendly work environment.1) I checked voice mail and worked on spread sheets. 2) Pretty neat tricks with their custom  spread sheets3) Very helpful.4) Didnâ€™t have any5) Knowing it was going to end.6) Learning a job I had no experience at.  Wish I could have leaned more.Worked with a confidant IS team that assisted one another with daily activities that consisted of SOP, troubleshooting user issues and time-lined projects. Management works well with team members and co-workers meet daily for trouble case updates.It was my pleasure to have been a part of this company, but unfortunately, the company closed that is why I had to look for another job to sustain my and my family's daily needs.A typical day at work when I first started with the company was great, especially when we were Hittite, when it became Analog things changed and it wasn't as great as it was when I first started.  I got to learn new software packages and use an old one which was alright.   As far as coworkers at this company we had good ones and then coworkers that were just out for themselves and not wanting to help the people that needed help.I'd say the hardest part of the job was when people didn't communicate and a person would have to find out on their own when things were changed around and no one would say anything.  communication in any company needs to be better.I enjoyed the work at my company especially when I first started, but then when the bigger company came in and there were a lot of changes it wasn't a happy go lucky place anymore.Company provides innovative projects to work on everyday. A lot of technical knowledge is contained in senior engineers.A great company with excellent benefits. I worked in an environment where my job skills and intellect was fully utilized for the betterment of my career goals.My day started at 3 pm.  and I was always busy pushing product outand it ended at 11 pm.I leaned a lot of different thing work for Analog devices the differentproduct's that we processes through the different machines.Management was great he always would give long lunches when we mad our production was meet.My co-workers were great people.  Sometimes we would get together on our day off our when we got of work.The most hardest part of my job was always being in the clean room with full gear on.the most enjoy able part of my job was learning the different machines.Small teams working on leading-edge tech products.  Strong R&D and leaders in the areas they play in, but little commitment to fight for market share in new areas.  They are good at creating new product categories.Pro: Great company and culture for working. Management is encouraging of new ideas but slow to adopt any.Con: Projects move slow.I had a good boss and I liked the working hours. I liked working with sap. It is a very good software package. I had to figure out if the invoices needed to be taxed or not.Several significant reorganizations company-wide have taken place over the last 5 years. The latest reorg in  Oct 2014 moved directors and senior management into new roles across the company. Technology and segment groups were joined under general managers (new structure). Same reorg also resulted in significant layoffs (at least 10% of staff) and many teams have been understaffed in key areas. This paralyzed the company for at least 6 months.  According to rumors internally, requisitions are awaiting signature and hiring will start up again this fall (particularly in the product lines).First full time job where i starting in the manufacturing side putting circuit boards together.  Worked my way up not to being the shipper receiver and have been doing that for the last 2 years.It used to be a wonderful place to work. It is too bad that things have changed. Analog is now just another company with short sighted management interested only in the stock price. Employees are now just another commodity. The company has performed layoffs in spite of the fact that it had plenty of cash and was not losing money. People are routinely apprehensive about the annual layoffs in the November/December timeframe. Because of this, a vicious competitive environment has been fostered where backstabbing is the norm done by people who mistakenly feel that it will make them more secure. It does, however, still offer one of the best 401K plans available.Great wealth of technical expertise with the company.  Good work-life balance.  Upward progression limited, re-organizations occur almost yearly.I was with Analog Devices for 2 years, contracting the first contract was for 6 months, they extended the contract but never became full time. My manager was very happy with my performance, but due to financial status they had to laid off all contractors.I love working at Analog Devices,  Great and fun environment.An outstanding work atmosphere with helpful co-workers.Good company with good benefits. Every day I learn something new, which is my favorite thing at this company. Management is also good. We all get along, and work together to complete jobs on time with quality. The hardest part of the jobs is to complete work on time since there is not enough employees.","5,001 to 10,000",Boston,Cambridge,MA,2016-10-30T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/c87ea325-34bd-47b0-ab7c-1d7755097c95?mescoid=1700190001001&jobPosition=8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
