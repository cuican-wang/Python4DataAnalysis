17,729.0,Biostatistician,Justice Resource Institute,3.7,40.0,"This company does a lot of good for many people.  As a non profit company there are not many pay raises but the benefits are decent.  My coworkers are dedicated to helping the youth.  Management at the program level are considerate of their employees.Co-workers are great and the individuals cared for. Management expects way too much for the money they pay with little or no incentives to stay working hard and not much room for advancement. Pay raises are not guaranteed unless company profits and everyone gets one. They keep pushing more and more responsibility unless you stick up for yourself.great kids, great staff, good hours, good place, good money, wonderful management, friendly people and atmosphere, only reason i left was to stay home w kids otherwise i would still be thereI like working there been there for a while. They only thing is they don't pay enough money that's all. They really help they kids and want the best fro them. A typical day at work is a restraint if they kids don't act up. I've learn many things from working in these field, i believe people can over come anything and change and function normal. I like some and some like me, I don't like when people are doing the kids wrong so i don't like some people because of that. The hardest part is restraint. The most enjoyable tings are is the outing and when the kids are happy.Management isn't that great. The residents have more voice then you do. If you don't have seniority and you have an issue you will be heard but, they take it like a grain of salt. The benefits are great. The pay could be a little better for what the job entails.The supervision at this company sucks.  They are unethical in their practices.  Require workers to drive almost 2,000 miles a month for client care.  They force overtime but refuse to pay for it.  They expect one person to do the work of five different people.  The morale around the office is that everyone wants a new job.  I would strongly suggest not working here.I fully enjoy working with JRI, their leadership is incredible. I've learned many new skills over my decade working in the agency.I love the environment in which I work, I love the people I work for. I enjoy that changes are being made for the better within the program. The pay is not great, but that of any human service worker is not.JRI is an ok place to work, have very good benefits. The workers have a very good sense of unity. I like the fact that I'm busy all the time, if you are not afraid to work hard then, it's perfect. Flexible hours.There is no room to expand or grow within the agencies. Salary increase is non existent.The average lifespan of a JRI employee, to my knowledge, is 2 years... and this is why.  It's a job where people come to get entry level experience, may move up, but only meekly because the options are few and far between, and the ceiling is pretty low.  There are no incentives to stay.  Vacation time does accrue quickly but it maxes out at 4 weeks.  No performance reviews, no contact with management to give feedback or voice concerns, no raises based on merit or length of employment, no maternity benefits (other than those legally mandated), and the expectations are high.  Work holidays, nights, and weekends.  Be available by phone always.  If it takes over 40 hours you are expected to do it- with no compensation.  The clientele is great, most of the colleagues are too.  There are some pretty excellent training opportunities but JRI won't ask if you want them, you have to seek them out and then ask for funding.  The overhead is so much and the 8-10 VP's of JRI get paid BIG BUCKS, but where are they???Working for Justice Resource Institute has been great in the sense that it feels like coming home. It's a great supportive environment.The peer support is great and fun, energetic group of mixed age people . We share our ups and downs and collaborate to find solutions to pressing matter as a team....that's the most enjoyable part of the job. The down side of the job is lack of advancement. within the company.Worked at one of the residential schools (live and attend school on site) with adolescent females. There is room to advance, camaraderie amongst direct care staff, immense training and education given weekly, and the chance to work in both the residential and educational capacity.The pay was too low for the amount of responsibilities. They did have rather good benefits.  It was hard to move around and move up.Great team of individuals both co-workers and management. Very caring and dedicated to it's clients and staff.Lots of support.Company cared about it employees. Offered many incentives as well to make people want to work there. HR is great and management is the best ive seen in a while.I was hired as part of a management team who were tasked to develop three new group homes and behavioral programs, policies and procedures for the rehabilitation of adolescents with a variety of behavioral, cognitive, and psychological disorders.  A month into the job the funding that had been projected as forthcoming from DDS fell through.  Consequently, so did the planned management and staffing structures.  I elected to move from group home management to the position of clinical case manager so that the Assistant Group Home manager whom we had already hired was promoted to Group Home Manager without a raise in pay, but did not suffer a pay cut.  Once opened, a typical work day saw me traveling to one of the three group homes where I provided individual, family and group therapy.  My work day included case management, ensuring that all providers to include DDS and DCF were on the same page with progress and delivery of services.   I worked closely with direct care staff to ensure best practices toward building therapeutic alliances with the residents.  The most difficult part of the job was the extended travel.  The group homes were located between Chesterfield (Norwich area) and Thompson.  Often I would be called on to be at Thompson for staff training and then travel to two or more group homes for unexpected meetings mostly having to do with one of the children requiring crisis intervention.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being part of a like-minded team who practiced a gentle and consistent approach to behavioral change, and who refrained from shaming, blaming  more... or judging in order to manipulate behavioral compliance.  lessA nurturing atmosphere with a supportive administration. If you are positive and a hard worker looking to support families, then this is the place to be.I enjoyed working at JRI. They have a wonderful benefit package.The hardest part of the job was having a supervisor that was unavailable. The staff that I worked with became like family. Amazing group of men and women.The individuals that we worked with, helped create that bond.This was an entry level position as a Residential Counselor. I soon became a Supervisor. I have found this to have been the best Company that I have ever worked for. I would not hesitate to take a part time position with them anytime. Great Administrative Residential DirectorGood team work. Learned from supervisor and other coworkers through wonderful communication skills and trainings. Great support systems set in place and a community you can trust. Flexible work schedule.Good place to work, Hardest part of the job was the always schedule and transport. I moved up to management fast. Co workers are ok, I learned a lot about human services and developmental disabilities. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the clients everyday and knowing that I helped them get a job.",,Boston,Needham,MA,2016-11-11T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/biostatistician-job-needham-ma-us-173855302.aspx?mescoid=1500153001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

There were many mini-perks in addition to a fantastic work atmosphere and community. I got free coffee, free yoga classes on Tuesdays during lunch, free lunch on pay days, and my own cubicle as an intern! I enjoyed being treated as part of the team and was permitted to do things that other interns in other companies would never be able to do! I can't say enough good things about this company.

195,907.0,2017 Summer Internship - Computational Biologist - (Job Number: 1602764),Takeda Pharmaceutical,4.0,287.0,"I have worked for Millennium/Takeda for 5 years now and I have grown so much within the the commercial side of the field.  My typical day is requires following up on action items, communicating to CMO of status updates and upcoming activities, as well as addressing any documentation excursion or revisionThe job was fantastic in that the company gave me all the resources needed to educated physicians.  This made the job more enjoyable and opened a ton of options to be successful.Management and coworkers are dedicated to excellence.Very challenging timelines make work-life balance a constant struggle.The best part of this job is knowing that the world will be just a little bit better for the work that this company does.It's a great place to work with bad management.the money is good but there's no use in the money when your never out of work only long enough to sleep. They also go through new people all of the time because schedules are sometimes not good. You can't have a life and work this job it's not possible.I would start the week by looking at my schedule which would tell my what materials I will be testing for the week and any other responsibilities to be carried e.g. water sampling, monitoring stock levels, waste runs. I would then get any paper work I would need issuing by a senior analyst and print of  any specifications which will be need on the day of testing. I would carry out the tests required in the most efficient timing which allows me to maximise my work day to the most. As this was my first job from graduating I have learned so much from the experience of what its like to work in a industry setting and the time lines which need to be met. I got along with everyone in my work place, the management were so understanding and very easy to approach with any problems, as well with my co-workers they would help me with any queries I had especially when I first started.The hardest part of the job was in my first few months of employment and it was referring to the pharmacopoeias as I was not familiar using them, but as time went on I became comfortable using them. The most enjoyable part of my job was the challenge of performing new more difficult techniques and tests that I had not had the opportunity to perform yet.Good work colleagues. Good management in Germany and Japan.However its sad that your production is remotely controlled from Singapore. One time a mistake was made, then later in Sept this year an old Chinese witch from our Singapore office came to our office and gossiping rude things behind our backs and lecturing some of us in the office and cafeteria - making us Germans sound like we are incompetent! All because a colleague was tired and made one mistake.. like they never make mistakes themselves! Very poor morale.A typical work day consist of traveling to 10-12 accounts and engaging with doctors about different disease states such as Gout, Diabetes and Constipation. Most day I provide breakfast and lunches to offices to build rapport with office staff and doctors.The company is undergoing huge change with new US Commercial President and newer CEO.  The culture is no longer one of honesty, integrity, and fairness like its Company Values profess.  Every year I was employeed with Takeda, we had a change in organizational structure and potential layoff. In addition to the organizational flux, management in some departments are poor leaders, promoted because they 'get the job done' but with little regard or support for their team that has worked hard to contribute to their success.  I would caution anyone looking for a stable company with fair and impartial leadership to pursue Takeda at this time in their career.	Developed detailed programs with NPLs that cover planning, initiation, execution, monitoring, and close out phases.	Use MS Project and other programs to outline specifics for program milestones, requirements, payment schedules, subcontracts definition, technical work description, staffing, integrated master schedules, and budgets 	Worked as a liaison to build coalitions among the various stakeholders and negotiated authority to move the project forward to meet the timelines	Monitoring program performance (technical, cost and schedule) through direct interaction with NPLs is a weekly routine.My co-workers were great and I had a great time with them.

This includes weekly field rides with my team where we review numbers, business strategies and developmental plans.  My style is as a partner who expects a lot, but never asks anyone to do anything I would not do myself.  The hardest part of the job is just being able to have a good work life balance.  Best part is seeing people develop and get promoted into future leaders of the companyDevelop and train 11 sales reps on a daily basis while managing a specific geography and all the products in that area. Develop business plans to hit company goals with the purpose of developing future leaders of TakedaTakeda offers some great benefits to its full-time employees, however, like most positions, if you are a contractor, they pile on the work with no real benefits.Many organization changes are currently underway.

Need more companies like this in the Lake County area.Great place to work. Great employees and great managers. Managers are real world. Takeda give responsibility and accountability at the local level, which allow individuals to determine their strategic approach.There is a great environment among the workers, act like a family all together. There was a management change(head change), which the workers were not really happy about with the new management system.I worked with contracts, and adverse events.I worked with some amazing hardworking coworkers.really enjoyed my time working as a Temp with Takeda.Assisted with the launch Takeda’s new drug NINLARO® with Patient Advocacy and Commercial/Marketing team.
