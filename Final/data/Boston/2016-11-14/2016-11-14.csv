193,905.0,"Senior Statistical Programmer - Cambridge, MA",Array BioPharma,3.4,5.0,"It was a great learning environment at first, was under great lead. Until that person left and then instead of fixing issues, things were 'band-aided'. After working there 8 months I still had no permissions or local admin rights to perform any task other than helplessly assign tickets to the appropriate departments for checking. After months and months of begging and constant nagging for the required access to do my required duties, I was let go due to lack of work, when we had been wrecklessly and desperately looking for new temps for many weeks prior. Not a company for advancement at all for they are only in it for the profit and layovers and not the actual work being done. I met some VERY amazing people in there and I wouldn't change meeting those folks for the world. I learned a lot about relationships and how having certain relationships with other parts and cultures of the company helps you grow stronger as a whole professionally and personally. And that's the kind of behavior we need to grow a career and maintain doing something we are passionate about.company overall has good prospects but senior leadership doesn't communicate, support staff, or make good decisionsProgram teams are open with the expectation of all contributing. Training and team support were always there. Access to senior managers. Program and project teams always current in all functional areas and invited to help address challenges.Array provides all the tools needed to advance projects and programs, excellent access to the literature through journal subscriptions, enthusiastic library resources, sophisticated chemical search engines with many of the staff current on the latest findings in both discovery and early clinical information.Stimulating working environment with the opportunity to work with brilliant world class chemists and biologists in drug discovery. I learned a great deal about the process required to move a compound from discovery to formulation to testing thru GMP/FDA certification. Typically I processed orders from sourcing and requisition to completion including order placement, tracking and expediting to delivery. Managed suppliers and negotiated contracts.The most challenging part of my job was dealing with the work habits of one of my co-workers.The most rewarding aspect of working with the Array team was knowing that the drugs we created were produced in order to alleviate illness and improve health and well being.Strong medicinal chemistry capability and solid drug discovery capability with an established record of success.",,Boston,Cambridge,MA,2016-11-14T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/7fb54147-1c73-47fc-a56e-fcd4340a4267?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
