114,826.0,Data Scientist,Panjiva,4.0,1.0,"Panjiva is a global trade data provider. They take US and foreign customs data, re-package it to make it searchable, build in apps for ease of use, and sell access to the data to companies from mom and pop to Fortune 500. A typical day includes heavy customer/client engagement, weekly meetings with internal teams, and a push for daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly goals. Depending on the day of the month, these calls to action can become quite motivating or frustrating. The hardest part of the job is the hours, and the expectation that you're tied to your desk. Business hours are 9:00am-6:00pm daily. Oftentimes, lunches are taken from your desk if at all. And for various reasons, there's always work to be done-which is what you're signing on for with startups. Not a downside necessarily. Just a fact. Great people, great product. But not the right role for me at this point in time.",,Boston,Cambridge,MA,2016-10-26T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/fb0a5523-aa9c-43ed-81d9-20367f522685?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=25,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
151,863.0,"Senior Statistician, Data Analysis (152793)",Merck KGaA,4.4,8.0,"I was part of a 6 month internship for this company and it was enjoyable throughout. The interns would hold weekly get togethers at bars across the city which really facilitates making friends particularly when you come from across the world like I did. The company promotes this behavior by having a Merck sponsored events. My office was very friendly, even though at times there was a language barrier they tried their hardest to include me in everything. The work was flexible, you can arrive as early as 6 am and leave as late as 8 so long as there was another employee in the lab, which there typically was. The work was at times challenging, at times interesting, and a few other times a little dull but typically it was nice. Work is done in a clean room environment, at least with the area I was in, and all the clothes are provided for you. Overall, it was a great experience.I work at Bioreliance, subsidiary of Merck. Low pay but  has a better job security as they always want more people. It has a high turnover rate as people leave for better paying jobs.Fun Family Feel.  Work with different generation all in the Life Science division is great because of the knowledge exchange.",,Boston,Billerica,MA,2016-10-26T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/3e6f801f-6624-4a77-b7eb-68cd71285b2e?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=30,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

241,953.0,Associate Research Scientist,Northeastern University,4.3,201.0,"I worked as a graduate research assistant which was unpaid but helped me learn a lot along with other students. I had my mentor guide me and help me answer many inquiries which taught me a lot.I work about 20 hours a week and it has taught me organisational skills. I organize towels in the closet and make sure that appropriate individuals enter the facility and no outsiders cross the gates. The management is very supportive and very understanding. If I have to drop a shift due to some academic work they are very understanding regarding it. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I got meet undergrads from different cultural backgrounds and we have become good friends now.This was a great way to make friends who were students trying to learn more about the Video Production aspect of the Athletics Department at Northeastern. I volunteered for the experience and it gave me the necessary basic skills in order to handle camera equipment appropriately.Northeastern University has a very large campus in Boston, which offers everything students need in the way of bookstores, eateries and a beautiful library.It is very international and has an excellent standard of education. The academic staff is highly qualified and co-workers are generally very helpful. The Global Pathways, College of Professional Studies organizes meetings for instructors, which is a good opportunity for the rather large teaching staff to meet up and exchange ideas.There is little to no possibility of advancement when hired as a part-time adjunct instructor. The workload varies and is unpredictable. No benefits, no job security.1. become a better organized with daily job activities.2. communicate with others effectively.3. Process magnetic materials, including: mechanically milling of     ferrite powders, formation of green bodies, heat treatment         studies   of compacts. 4. Fabricate and test toroids as high frequency permeability and    permittivity inductor cores, mechanically alloyed permanent    magnets, magnetostrictive materials, low power loss MnZn-ferrites    and low magnetic/dielectric loss Z-type ferrite.-I learned a lot about what it means to navigate heavy administrative tasks and politics in the work place-I grew as a supervisor -A love of diversity and inclusion, and helping create environments where this was a safe space for students and staff-I learned how to give feedback to staff including supervisors, peers, and subordinatesI had the great pleasure to work as a Office Assistant,Intern at Northeastern university, for  two months. I had the opportunity to work at the Department of Physical Therapy.My responsibility was to help with administrative tasks including making photo copies of student's files; Developed and maintained positive working relationships with other; Supported staff to reach common goals.Northeastern offers great benefits but the pay is not as great. There are a lot of opportunities to move within the University, but some offices remain stagnant. Overall it is a positive place to work and there is a level of excitement as the University moves up the ranks nationally.Great flexibility and time off policy (can depend on the dept). A week off for christmas and every holiday possible off. The pay is poor in most departments until you reach the director level. Everything moves slowly through northeastern and the systems are not fit to support the growth of the university. Great retirement benefit after two years. If you are going to work here, consider your boss/ dept just as much as the job itself.School is growing fast. As a graduate student, I felt there were not many professors working on a research actively, even young professors doing only services such as department works, teaching..  Only a few professors are working on a research.Meet with professors a few times a week to discuss the field of study/research I was working on. Would be assigned deadlines and goal to accomplish tasks and present to the professor. Fairly independent but professors were open and willing to help as neededGreat teaching university for employees, wonderful team model, excelled at job duties, co-workers approachable and resourceful, great work life balanceShadowing a PhD student during experiments and then carrying out replicates. I learnt time management among other laboratory skills. I've had quite friendly co-workers and mentors.NEU is a fast-growing staple of the Seattle tech scene. The staff is awesome, very attentive and willing to help. It's a great place to work and there are always opportunities to take leadership roles since the campus is growing so quickly.Worked as a teaching assistant. Work of course relies on the professor under whom you work. I have had the privilege to work under some very good professors and the experience has been very good.Review and submit payroll for employees.Make sure all areas are staffed throughout business hoursUpdate Digital signage programsAssist with any customer service needs- i.e phone calls and general questions about the establishment.Reserve and manage west addition window advertisement requestAssist Lost and found programNortheastern University is the perfect place to learn and practice engineering. I gained a lot of academic and research experience through the course of my master's.The two top things about working for Northeastern are the students and great co-workers.  There is a lot of coming and going of students due to co-operative education jobs and studies abroad. This presents challenges but is also exciting.Lucky to be hereHave been here since 6 months.Got opportunity to be here.I was working as an research assistant where treatment with employee is excellent.Good place to work. You do have to listen to directions and do as much as you can even when not asked. Great personnel and really calm place to work!!gooood place to learn everything.
