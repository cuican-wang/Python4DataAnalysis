147,859.0,SAR Image Scientist – Data Exploitation,United Technologies Corp,3.9,352.0,"When we were selling product, there were several challenging projects to work on that made each day a satisfying experience.  Today, this company has extensive business issues with no viable product offerings and no new products on the horizon.   The original workplace culture placed a large emphasis on empowering the employee, but that culture has deteriorated significantly since being acquired by UTC.UTC had great pay and very good benefits. Management and organization was in constant re-org after re-org over which was stressful.Besides what you hear in the news about Carrier and 1500 production positions being off-shored. This is a well established company in the community and is continuing to grow.Salary is good.  However, health benefits are THE WORST I've seen.  Borderline illegal.  Management is inefficient and is more focused on multiple international meetings rather than getting anything accomplished.  This is definitely not a place for someone in the Software world.  Be warned.I can't give a good review. I mostly worked in a different building than most of my co-workers. But the time I did spend with them was a very professional experience.UTC is a gigantic corporation.  Being so large, there would appear to be ample opportunity for career advancement within and outside of its various business units.  However, there appears to be favoritism at work, especially when considering UTC has grown as large as it has by buying other smaller corporations.  Depending on where you started in the business, your career might be limited if you were a part of one of those acquired business units (see Goodrich).I worked in the manufacture and technology department building circuit boards and working the AOI machine.  We made circuit boards for a lot of technology systems.Worked on assembly line, also was a lead person, learned all the jobs on the line to assist the workers who would fall behind or be absent.This is a good company to work for with steady work and great employees to work with.  Like any company it has its ups and downs  but overall I would give it a positive rating for sure.The work environment was good with an emphasis on safety procedures and safe guards on equipment. I learned many manufacturing skills and what it takes to succeed. The plant employees are very friendly and helpful. The management however is not very helpful when it comes to advancement opportunities.A typical day for me is to come in, check which machinery or equipment have maintenance checks due. I perform those as a first priority given there are no technical difficulties with the machines on the production lines. When a machine goes down and isn't running that is my first priority is troubleshooting and repair. I order and submit requests for any spare parts that are needed for approval. I also complete side projects assigned to me such as researching equipment models to develop operator PM's or adjusting work spaces to make room for new equipment, etc. The hardest part of my day would be the amount of work that can drop on me all at once. It is only myself and one other technician that covers the shift so if either of us is out and multiple issues come up at once, we can become overwhelmed fairly quickly. For me, the most enjoyable part would have to be all of the nice coworkers and people I have met. Also, I feel accomplished when I repair electronics and get them up and running smoothly.Great place to work.  Everyone is very friendly and helpful.  I was offered many opportunities to do work outside of my role and take on extra projects.Working as a contractor is a good foot in the door. Although there is minimum opportunity for employment directly through the company, the environment is great and the people are very helpful.I have learned a lot about Excel and PowerPoint as we work extensively on both of them. Though some processes need overhauling.I had an exceptional career with United Technologies.  I traveled and had experiences only one could dream of.  I was laid off in December of 2008.  I understand  being a Financial Analyst why they laid off 7,500 salaried employees.  Many had 25+ years.  They could hire younger people pay them have the wage I was making and save the company a considerable amount of money.  It's been a challenge finding suitable employment in this field.  Unfortunately, I understand this happens with many individuals after working at UTC.Most employees are extremely unhappy with the culture, but stay due to financial obligations. Management does not keep employees informed on changes in the organization.I finished my degrees  thru the UTC scholar program, worked  26 years, laid off  after most work got outsourced away from our group UIThe company suffers from severe nepotism and unfortunately hires supervisors who do not really understand the aspects of their area of responsibility. Apparently quality procedures are not mandatory but merely a suggestion to some. Management is overly obsessed with charts and graphs that do not reflect actual workflow. The mindset is severely ""pro production"" and supervision will try to find ways to side step quality processes to meet master schedule.This was  wonderful company to work for and the job responsibilities were challenging.    I enjoyed all of the projects - senior management conferences, developing and help design in conjunction with an outside contractor floor plans, product displays, exhibitry and graphics within corporate specifications for our trade show booth.Recently United Technologies has become infamous in the news.  It is planning on sending its last American factory to Mexico.  More on this later; I should describe my time at work first.After my freshman year of college, I got a summer job doing factory work for a relative's employer (will not specify which relative, to help maintain anonymity).  Despite the overtime, which included five weekends and normal two-hour extensions on days, I think it was worthwhile getting this experience.  We learned of each overtime at the end of the previous workday's shift.  The overtime was given because the company had a lot of orders to fill.  The company had a policy of having us work no more than two weekends in a row.I liked the assembly line and part preparation tasks, though others might think otherwise, because I could work pretty quickly at those tasks.The hardest part of my was easily the mandated overtime.  Being a recent hire, having low seniority made me one of the first to be selected for overtime.Coworkers were a bit vulgar for my tastes, but then again, they were working for twelve to fourteen dollars an hour, and my tastes are more traditional than among the general population.Ultimately, this was a fair enough first taste of work.  That was three years ago, however, and the company has changed a little since then.The highest level of leadership seems to be made of nothing but, as my relative calls them, ""bean counters.""  The transition of factories out of the United States was predominantly to reduce federal taxes, not, as many people think, to save  more... money on salaries.  The taxes far exceed the salaries.  My relative, as an engineer, enjoyed being able to work right next to the assembly line, where boards could be tried out fairly quickly and engineers could work out any problems more directly.  Apparently United Technologies has had management problems for some years now, with the executives unwilling to spend money to upgrade the facilities, but this scenario takes the cake.If I were rating the company based on my past experiences, I would give somewhat higher ratings.  As it is, I rate the company based more on how my relative feels.  lessTypically day to day I work monitoring and supporting with issues reported by customers, suppliers and customer service. I learned EDIHQ perfectly and JDE. Co-workers helped a lot. The hardest part of job is we got an issue with JDE server side, for that I worked day and night to resolve the issue. Mapping and attending team meeting is the most enjoyable part.","10,000+",Boston,Westford,MA,2016-08-12T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/359a2a96-0079-4657-a56f-687aa16e834d?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=26,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
