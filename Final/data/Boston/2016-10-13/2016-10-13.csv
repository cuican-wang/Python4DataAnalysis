121,833.0,Data Scientist (Senior Level),Philips Lighting,4.2,32.0,"- Worked in Research and Development group focused on LED lamps and fixtures- Ran a variety of tests on both prototype hardware and customer returned products- Modified programs that increased efficiency on testing products (Microsoft Visual Basic)- Assisted Engineers with daily problemsi love some of the management at the company, but very much disapprove the office politics. i have learned a lot about SQL and data management. as well as learning more about the company operations. dearly would love to progress from department but can be difficult to management acceptance. great environment to progress in, but you must be able to network and know other colleagues.Work was relatively easy. Learned to work as a team. Upper management wasn't that great. Floor management was excellent. Co-workers were awesome. Plant is now closedInnovative lighting manufacturer that outpaces most competitors in product efficacy and product offering.  Challenges of recent transition are dissipating and growth is in the hands of management.Philips Lighting is a decent company but is in the midst of major strategic changes which affect its employees dramatically at this time.  The industry is trying to reidentify themselves causing  major swings in direction.Looking for something I enjoy. Great place to grow and be productivePhilips make old and new fixtures. Anyone interested can purchase. They have plenty to choose from. U would not be disappointed.Could be a good place to work, but new processes changing constantly.  Multiple manufacturing and design locations, headquartered in Europe, sometimes feels like you are just a number.I was a field representative so you needed to be a self-starter and highly motivated without management telling you what you needed to do. I worked independently from my co-workers but we did interact by phone on a regular basis.I Very much enjoyed working for Philips, but I am not a union person and was forced to join the union.  Very pleasant work atmosphere.I love working there also I learned a lot about putting light fixtures together to blanking n forming parts to make a fixture. I love learning about lights fixturesManagement used to be great but went down hill the last couple of years.  Philips is heading away from direct representation and going with agencies in many markets.  Customers hate that move.Employees are always focused on their job and they try to maximize it everyday.It is a very team style of work where everyone does their part individually to better their progress all together.I am currently working 1:00 pm to 9:30 pm, and would like to change my hours to daytime hours to better serve a company.  This would give me more flexibility for personal time in the evenings.","10,000+",Boston,Cambridge,MA,2016-10-13T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/85629718-d667-4c6a-a6f3-98ce47f33335?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=32,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Double standards for new people, while the favorites could do whatever they wanted.  Too expensive to sell in such a commodity market.This place rocks, if your young ambitious to learn and grow within the company. They take the time to teach and grow you into a senior/management position whichever you decide. Good enviroment for those that are fresh out of school and want to learn the Medical Device Business, however if you have been in the industry for over 8 years you might hit the glass shield to quick and you tenure is shorten since their corporate office doesn't like paying for pension...Start early in the day. Processing returns inspector, inspect returned packages from customers. Management is norm for a large company. Fun fast beat environment and co-workers make day go by fast. Hardest part of job learning new skills. The most enjoyable part of the day is doing a good job.Arrive at my cubicle and turn on my computers and other equipment in order to begin the workday. I( make sure I have a note pad readily available so if notes needs to be taken I can be prepared, and then I log into the phone and began  taking calls from customers and answering questions, processing orders, or making changes to customer accounts. I've learned to always be patient and considerate when assisting a customer and although they may not be right, but to give them the benefit that your are attentive to there needs. I feel Managers at Nobel needs more training in promoting and adhere to policy and procedures, and the hardest part of being an employee at Nobel is trying to grasp the entire technical aspect of there products and the most thing I enjoyed is everyone willingness to helpIt has an atmosphere where you are not micro managed and your inputs/ideas are taken into consideration and implemented if deemed fit.Nobel Biocare offered tremendous opportunities for both personal and professional growth, Their sales team was top notch and their leadership was forward thinking. The industry around Nobel appeared to be crumbling. As Nobel Biocare's primary product is Dental Implants and related components, when dentists as a whole began to struggle, premium providers did as well.Daily worked with some of the best sales people in Orange County and San Diego going on call (both cold and warm) to a variable selection of clientele; from the cream of the crop, the struggling new practitioner, and the upset log-time customer from years before.Enjoyed the pace, the camaraderie, and the holistic approached to business growth under management (most of which are no longer there).New HR department, New upper Management with no idea how to manage, has taken them years to learn the process and still have no idea what they are doing.Huge brand recognition with this company.  Great solution based consultative sales approach.Swiss Company with much of there marketing and strategies coming from Europe, not the US.Poor upper management with no comprehension of how to run a manufacturing facility. Decisions are made without input from the local management.No job security.Its a good place to work, unfortunately headquarters is in Zurich and upper management are moving all positions to Zurich and there are no opportunities to grow in US.Great company with good advancement and benefits.  Traveled extensively throughout USA and supervised a direct selling sales force of 50+I really enjoyed working at Nobel.   I learned a lot got to travel and gained alot of knowledge.I learned many aspects of different processes and equipment.embrace change and challenges; enjoyed helping customers in all walks of lifeGood company good products. Pay well.Alot of trainingGood cultureThe position of a Customer Support Representative was based in a Call Center that consistently provided 5 Star Customer Support. Co-workers always worked as a team to get orders placed in a correct and timely manner in order to gain our customers loyalty and repeat business.  As a Customer Support Rep it was our responsibility for processing orders for dentists, laboratory technicians, purchasing agents, dental auxiliaries and Nobel Biocare Sales Representatives through in-bound phone, fax, mail and e-mail.  Assured orders were correct and accurate, gave special pricing such as discounts, shipping information and documented product complaints in accordance with company guidelines per FDA and OSHA regulations. Kept abreast of current products and procedures as required by company standard operating procedures.   Hardest part of the job was sometimes making a management decision with little or no supervision. (Keeping the customer satisfied and problem solving)The most enjoyable part of this job was satisfying the customers needs and hearing how much they appreciated our help.  Worked for Nobel Biocare for 14 years started as a Government Customer Support Rep for 10 years dealing with over 200 accounts world wide. The last four years still handled Government along with civilian customer accounts.A typical day at Nobel Biocare was working with friendly people (co-workers and management included) in a very well managed, fast paced productive environment. All days were steady with the inbound receipts of product, and the processing of outbound customer orders. I learned many things while being employeed there. I was very eager and wanted to know how to do everything, which paid off over the years of being employeed there, by starting at an entry level position and working my way up to management (supervisor). Training others, writing reviews, addressing issues when they arised, coaching employees, delegating and prioritizing, assessing and evaluating operational processes while seeking ways for improvement, order pulling and inventory control are amongst some of the things that I learned. Hard time during the job were minimal. Some minor challenges that occured were just exceptions that come and go, but never made me not want to go in on a daily basis. Some of the descision making and planning of certain things could have been handled differently and would have acheived more success. I enjoyed going to work everyday due to how well the organization was being managed, having the opportunity to learn new things, as well as all of the friendly people that work there.","1,001 to 5,000",Boston,Framingham,MA,2016-10-13T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/37446b2d-20b9-460d-b128-3e3c9f7f7d94?mescoid=1900254001001&jobPosition=16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
