127,839.0,Data Scientist,Rovi Corporation,3.5,21.0,"Worked with some fantastic people. In fact, made lifelong friends with a few of them.Had a fantastic ad ops director, not a micro-manager, but she was always accessible.I felt the salary was not very competitive. There is a chance to grow, but it's quite slim, meaning if you don't seize a chance to get promoted, it could be another several years before another you see another chance. And the thing I was least impressed with: they're willing to put sooo much pressure and work on their lowest level employees. They really want to squeeze every drop of effort out of you. Doing a good job? Great, your workload has just increased as a result. It's like they think we are robots sometimes. After working there several years, I was happy and relieved to finally resign from my position. Those are the CONS. Here are the PROS: a nice company culture. I really liked all my colleagues and even management are generally pleasant people. So much so that we were happy to do things together outside work. The company will put on seasonal events like Summer Olympic Games or a Pumpkin Carving Content so we can all just have fun and have a few drinks. Working hours are flexible, which is nice to meet your personal schedule. Benefits are pretty good (health coverage, 401k contributions, ESPP, and health club reimbursements (up to 50% of cost up to $500 per year). Time-off is very nice (4 weeks paid time, in addition to 10 holidays and 1 floating holiday). Rovi does not drug test new hires.I have worked at Rovi for 1 year and 6 months, it was a fun place to work especially my co-workers. The deadlines from the clients sometimes will make you work overtime because the contents could not wait. Unfortunately they outsourced my position back in April.I enjoyed most everyone I worked with.  Management seemed to care about their employees.  Unfortunately, their most profitable piece of software is being phased out by multiple ISP's thus creating attrition with an already thin group of team members.I am a liaison between several different entities withiinand outside network organizations. I have learned how to work with different personalities and work styles. We are able self motivate is very keen on Work/Life Balance. They promote time with your family or outside of work with then entail productives work environment.I have had the pleasure of working with a dedicated, intelligent and hard working group of people. Unfortunately, our parent company, ROVI does not value the devotion our group has to our work.  Constant micro-managing, layoffs and outsourcing have given a once proud and healthy workplace low morale and has killed the amazing culture we had.I have heard of many unsatisfied employees but that is likely due to a cultural shift after a change in CEO.  The new leadership worked hard to get the company back on track and it appeared to be working.  I worked remotely and traveled frequently.80% of my time at the company was enjoyable - talented, fun people to work with on new technologies and interesting projects.  However, the last few years were not.  IT restructured and tried to define itself as a service component but I was not lucky enough to see the final outcome if it did come to fruition.Uptight and unfair management.  Who you know not what you can do. micro management.I worked at Rovi in Tulsa, OK from July 2013 to May 2014. I enjoyed my job and my the work environment. They were very flexible on scheduling and days off when I needed them. There was a constant stream of people being let go, forced to quit, or laid off though. This created a lot of workplace gossip and a lot of unknowns.Rovi was a nice place to work. I would like to go back. Unfortunately, the division I worked for was sold and I was laid off. Their in house software development continues but it remains to be seen what comes of it. I believe Rovi is undergoing some changes and relocation at the moment. My experience there was nice.Job work / life balance is non-existent. Expected to work overtime all the time. Constantly short on staff. Unrealistic expectations. Upper management is detached from reality and their employees. Good benefits, compensation could be much better. Many positions are underpaid.Everyday is always different, very fast pace. Need more resources in the development team.Overall, Rovi Corporation is an excellent place of employment.Push, push, push - otherwise you will not succeed at selling Rovi's interactive properties.  My day would start from 8:30 AM to 5 PM, Monday to Friday. Being a Rovi employee brought out the best in me. My managers and coworkers were a pleasure to work with and are knowledgeable in both their actual jobs as well as with the mission of the company. The hardest part of the job has to be actually getting there. I live 18 miles away but the commute can take well over an hour. Besides the commute the actual job and environment are all a pleasure. The most enjoyable part about working for Rovi are their incentives for continuing to strive to be a better employee and person. They put together a lot of out of office activities and offer bonuses for producing hard work. The draw back is job security and advancement. I've known several employees that have been with the company for years only to end up leaving because job advancement is scarce.• Rovi is a great place to work; there is never a dull moment at any given day. Plenty of opportunities for career advancements.• At this company employees are exposed to new challenges throughout their careers. This is in turn helps employees learn new skills.• Very open and approachable management, all managers treat employees as peers and with respect.• Excellent co-workers make day to day work a pleasure.• Due to company offices spread across the world at times one might feels they have to work day and night, attending conference calls etc.• The work place environment, freedom to make decisions allows a person to achieve their best.I had the pleasure of working under great managers. They were really good at giving direction and guidance and their feedback was always constructive and helpful.I had awesome co-workers who were very helpful and there a really high morale with the group. Even between those that are in different departments there is a strong team bond.certify DVD and PCDVD products for Analog video copy protection. Some of the finest professional employees in my career.Awesome, competitive perks!
