257,969.0,Radiation Oncology Physicist,Tufts Medical Center,3.9,147.0,"I enjoy working there. The enviroment is good and my co-wokers are easy to get along with. We all help each other out all the time. The one main downside is there is a lot of down time. With my specific job, I don't have a lot of contact with the patients unless I am helping one of the nurses or the patient is going into the Operating Room for a procedure.On a typical day, my job requires allot of focus and attention to detail. Leaning to work with and understanding fee schedules has been a great learning experience. Our management is fairly descent and compromised of very intelligent people who are faced with many challenges. My coworkers are great and easy to get along with. The hardest part of being and underpayments specialist, is getting the claims to pay additional reimbursement, keeping up with the high volume of claims needing an appeal and following up with the insurance to ensure an appeal has been received and sent for review.Fun work place with supportive management, focused on building a great product and a great culture. Strong leadership.my coworkers are like busy bees we are all constantly working on something. from the minute the office opens at 6am to 6pm at night. analyzing claims and their payment history for departments and working closer to reduce the amount of denials.if you enjoy the downtown setting, you will enjoy this work culture. great people. good working hours. great location and drive.The management sucks but co-workers were lovely . I had a good boss who taught me a lot and very great colleagues. They have good benefits for post docs but i hated that we had to sign in when we got to work but no one cared that we always worked overtime .They pay very little money, but want to work you like a slave. It's not worth working there if you can get hired In Another hospital.This hospital has been a pleasure to work at. From the top hospital executives, leadership, day to day staff and ancillary personnel, this hospital cares about its patients and staff.Very professional staff, helpful, courteous, and knowledgeable. The care that is given is to every patient it outstanding. Patient centered care is the number one priority throughout the entire clinic, from the front desk staff to their visit with the MD/NPs.Learned more than I thought possible during my time in this lab. Right from the start the PI wanted to challenge me since he knew I was being challenged with my difficult major as a biomedical engineer. Provided me with very important projects that I had to take complete responsibility for completing with the best of my ability. Very supportive lab members that were always willing to provide assistance and even let me watch them perform their daily lab tasks so that I could learn about the many skills and steps that are required for research and drug development.i work with kids so i deal with alot of smiling people even in the  adult areas. The pay is slightly low but decent. The turnover rate is very high due to managers that dont treat their employees with upmost respect. As a starter job it would be great.I love my job.   The doctors that I work for are amazing.  My job is coming to an end, so I need to find new employment. I never would have left this job!Tufts is a fast paced hospital and not minute is wasted there.   My coworkers made it all possible.The hardest part of my job was to get everything done (especially all the managerial things).The best part was the patients, in various states of illness, I was able at times to alleviate their stress, fear and anxiety.I loved my work at Tufts, even though it was tough.I have no complaints about my job.  the experience that I am receiving will be very beneficial to me in my endeavors.  I enjoy the staff and I truly enjoy each patients that I see each is so differentI left Tufts for 10 years to try different areas of nursing. I maintained relationships with several of my coworkers. The hospital is a true ""community/family"" environment. People are kind and caring, they rally together to help each personally and professionally. I continue to learn new procedures and advancements regularly. It's very rewarding to see patients stop by to say hello on their follow up visits when they're feeling better.The most difficult part of the job is watching some patients/families come to terms with terminal diagnosis. It's emotionally draining watching people suffer when they're in denial.A typical day at work at Tufts is that I arrive at 6:00am not due in till 7am but like to uncover all the rooms and make sure things are adequately stocked for the day and ready to roll as soon as patients check in!.  Tufts is an extremely busy practice in cornea, retina,plastics and glaucoma and we all work well together keeping the flow as smooth as possible and helping each other when needed.   The most enjoyable aspect of my job is with the patients, making sure they feel safe and questions are answered.  The hardest part of the job is leaving!Tufts Medical Center is a highly respected hospital and they didn't get that reputation for nothing, the staff here are great people to work with and there is plenty of room for advancement. Currently being in school to get my Associates in Medical Information Technology, Tufts offers many opportunities for me to learn different aspects of the medical field.A typical day at Tufts Medical Center in the Internal Medicine residency training program starts off at 7 AM with inpatient rounds. As a resident, I am the main doctor in charge of running all matters regarding patient care. I am supervised in my decisions by the attending physician, however the autonomy given to residents to run our teams is amazing here. I learnt to practice evidenced based medicine independently during  my time here. Since rotations are divided by sub-specialty of Internal Medicine, I learnt to practice medicine under physicians from several different backgrounds. My co-workers are very hardworking and self motivated, and the ancillary staff in our hospital is very supportive. The hardest part of the job is having a balance between work and life, however this improves with practice and by learning essential time management skills (which I have). Because I feel I have excellent communication skills, the easiest part of the job for me is talking to patients and their families.Teaching hospital with many interesting people to meet.  Good central location in Boston.  Near South Station.  I have enjoyed the many interesting people I have met.Staff was very knowledgeable and easy to work with. Very helpful. Grew my professional skillset during my time here, and really learned a lot about myself.- I come in work and take orders from the coworkers - I learned not to work there for a while- Managers are always watching you, very demanding- Coworkers were always watching me, report to manager bad rumors, they don't like Temps- The hardest part of the job was the commute, salary, and the treatment they gave me- The most enjoyable part of the job was none",,Boston,Boston,MA,2016-09-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/d322eabd-432f-4e37-b38e-f1603925da7b?mescoid=1900257001001&jobPosition=31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
