18,730.0,Senior Purification Scientist,Danaher,3.7,101.0,"Work there was like anywhere else,you do your job everything goes fine.I worked in many areas in plant, we made craftsman tools and packed them to be shipped to sears and other places.Their was a lot of good people working there and miss seeing them every day.The hardest part of the day was when four or five trucks came in at same time to be loaded, it was like none stop and some times overtime.no sure how things are nowadays but compensation was good, work balance was good, plant director ok, good place to learn lean tools.Hight pressure company that works you 7 days a week 14 hours a day.   Set unrealistic expectations.   The initial interview are all smoke and mirrors, and change on you after you start.They also gave me insights on the job Description also. Good place to work.I enjoyed working there.Good Benefit's.work sometimes, 7  Days.I enjoyed my time at Danaher Motion, I held a number of positions there, as I worked there for 30+ years. The management created a lean work atmosphere, that challenged us as a team. The hardest part of the job was to make our daily rates. We all pitched in as a team to make our rates, and our work experience enjoyable.Daily working with customers world wide through emails and some phone calls.Learned more about end of life management. Management changed during my time here. Too many changes all at once made things very difficult. No change over time to accommodate changes. Retired too many people all at once with a huge loss in contacts and information.Co-workers for the most part was easy to work with most of the time.No collaboration with other areas to stream line processes.Working with data collection and system conversions.Trains its leadership on ""Danaher Business System"" principles. Leaders are then expected to drive rigor, build talent that promotes the DBS culture. The result is every employee thinks and solves problems like a scientist. Status quo is constantly questioned and business model continuously strengthened.Great! Very professional staff.  Team work environment. client focused. Exemplary Client Service and satisfaction integral and non negotiable. Wonderful place to work.Good company to work for. Very busy!!Customer care has expanded many roles and back up many other divisons in the company.A typical day is answering the phine to customers calling for repairs, returns, or want to place an order.Data entry for orders, returns, repairs, etc. Creating UPS labels for returns, Entering credits.My coworkers were always friendly and helpful, as was the management team.The hardest part of my job was the stress of a complaining customer. The most enjoyable part was being on the morale team and planning team building events for the staff.I liked working for Danaher.The Danaher company that I worked at was wonderful, pre-Danaher. When Danaher takes over, although tough, the business improvements are definitely good for the business. The people, however, suffer. There is complete lack of concern for long-term employees; people who have no other skill than what they have been doing for 30-40 years. They do not want old people or old ""tainted"" culture. If you are young and ready to climb a ladder, this is the place for you. Otherwise, steer clear.management your co-workers,working with good and nice people,the hardest part of the day was trying to work with some people that didnt wont to do their job.It was a good place to work and a good company to be involved with the company is associated with Sears and machining making tools.Many opportunities to learn, but very few opportunities to advance.  Work/Life balance non-existent.  Feel like you are an infidel if you need to work at home, call out sick, apply for FMLA or handle personal family matters.  Currently, there are NO managers as all have left for other, more lucrative and appreciative opportunities.Executive leadership does not follow through on engaging employees or developing them for growth.  There is a whole division of employees who are heavily engaged in helping the business leaders implement company strategy, but are completely ignored and continuously unrecognized.This job was challenging and i love a good challenge. I found this job very rewarding. The 200 people that reported to me were an absolute pleasure to work with. Together we built a great team and became the top in this facility.Most days I would just go in and just get right in to working,  Everyone was really nice and approachable never any problems in the workplace.Working at Danaher is very frustrating since Priorities are swapped like underwear.I learned so far that even the most skillfull people can be disabled by mismanagement.A very busy place to work, I learned a lot about parts and packaging and shipping.Co-works were very friendly and helpful.I have worked with Danaher for over 2 years now and have been promoted to 3 positions within a 6 month span. I went from machine operator, to Cybron Production and Scaling, to Quality Assurace Technician. Paying attention to detail and the need to learn more than my assigned postion, I am able to advance in my knowledge and understand how the departments work together to produce the desired outcome of parts and assembly. I enjoy leaning how to make new molds, how to adjust them, and gaining knowledge of what is part does for each customer we produce for. The engineers work closly with me to teach me details of their work, so I may improve constantly on my job in quality. I work closely with management in my daily work schedule where I feel free to make suggestions or offer advice to make operations more organized or improved as well as follow instructions given to me, I work overtime and in the place of those that may need to miss a day.I work weekends when needed and other shifts when needed.Although, just an intern, they treated me very well. There was not anything particularly hard about the job, my duties were fairly easy. I enjoyed my years there.High customer service demand. Most work was done individually without much team work. Required a lot of push demands instead of being able to be proactive. Requires more communication between departments internally. Customer service is required for internal just as much as an external customer. Getting to personally talk with my regular customers in other service centers. Emails and instant messaging doesn't always work for explaining issues.Good company with good products. Ability to learn new technology and challenge yourself. work environment friendly and fun.","10,000+",Boston,Framingham,MA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/senior-purification-scientist-job-framingham-ma-us-176770844.aspx?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

99,811.0,Data Scientist,Wayfair LLC,3.6,101.0,"This was a very fun company at the beginning of my employment, however due to company growth and corporate driven decisions it lost everything that made it once cool.  It is no longer about the people that work there, it is about the performance and the idiotic metrics that they wish to track and pursue.  The management is headed steadily downhill.Great place to work for anyone who likes a call-center environment. Mgmt means well and sincerely tries to assist the salespeople in meeting their goals, but the overall corporate future is very uncertain and so mgmt is forced to deal with and adapt to new major business challenges all the time. Mgmt also tries to keep morale strong with positive employee interactions and perks. Best compensation pkg I've ever heard of for call-center work.If you are an IT professionals I would highly discourage applying here. Manager is clueless and the work environment is horrible. You know that one IT Guy; everyone hates because he is an ahole? Now, imagine him as your manager micromanaging you and HR on his side. ""My way or the Highway"" Management Style. Your suggestions and professional experience will not apply to someone who is always right.I love my new job at Wayfair, especially the culture and work environment. It is a call center and comes with those inherent drawbacks (long hours sitting staring at a computer, can be noisy, etc.) but there are all kinds of incentives, activities, contests, awards, and rewards. Starting pay for CSR is more than I was making after three years at another call center. I love my coworkers, and we make it fun every day. After just a few months, I've have opportunities to do other jobs, and there is a ton of potential for advancement if you're up for it. And if that's not enough... FREE SNACKS!if u r on visa dont join. bad work life balance. only fixing bugs no feature development. management doesnt care about you. they will get rid of you in 3 months or 6 months if u r not exceptional. its a place where fun goes to die. they have a program called labs. that they hire college grads and get rid within 3 months. if you are experienced developer and hired on visa you are left with no employer after 3 months. dont join unless you are exceedingly confident you can perform. if you are on visa donot join. after 4 hours of interview they still evaluate you till 6 months and will fire you any moment. constant change in your department will make you very nervousfree beer and snacks do not make up for unsatisfying and unrewarding work. super siloed work environment, no privacy, open space, abysmal and non existent management. young immature employees with bad attitudes. PTO depends on seniority, average health benefits. 4% match. good life and work balance, lots of company parties and outings, job in it self is unrewarding and super narrow scope.Offered a variety of flexible shift schedules to meet the needs of all employees. A very fast paced environment with heavy incoming call flow. Monthly one on one reviews with supervisor. Constant potential to move up in the company. Very friendly atmosphere with a nice group of diverse co workers.Laid back work environment. Although alot of downtime waiting on trucks to be loaded and other employees were allowed to stand around and talk and laugh while others worked. Hardest part of job was to have to ask for a team lift every time you had a box too heavy 180 lbs or higher which was often. That's the only reason I left the job. Loved it other than the daily heavy lifting.Great benefits and compensation and initially culturally it was great but it changed within a few months of being hired become more corporate and gray.Wayfair was an amazing place to work with fabulous training and awesome people. There is a relaxed environment with supervisors and employees that truly care about the customers and company!Great culture. Not all management great, but mine was excellent. Diverse culture. They don't care about about religion, race, tattoos, piercings, nor orientation. As long as you do the job well, that's what they care about. free coffee and snacks. Unorganized teams. Too demanding in some departments.Fantastic experience with one of the largest growing E-Commerce companies in the world. My co-workers were extremely talentated and helped me grow professionally on a daily basis. I learned how to develop long term business deals and strategies with corporate 500 companies, how to use CRM systems such as Sugar and Salesforce, write code using SQL, and to think outside the box on a daily basis.The money was great, but what an employee had to go through to achieve the level I did is a hard task. I left being One of their Best in Sales. No write ups, no warnings. With this in mind, We could NOT resolve minor very minor issue(s).this company was fun to work for bosses would bring snacks and had prize raffles around the holidays everybody worked hard and together the get the work done sometimes when we finished early if you wanted to leave they would you they tried to make work fun so that you would work and have a good time doing it.Great place to learn about the ins and out of the e commerce business. They have great trainings available for you and encourage you to learn everything you can. Every day things are changing. You have to be ready to head in a different direction on any given day.The Bangor location is full of fun!  Everyone is so happy; it is a happy and upbeat work environment; the managers are phenomenal; the application and interview process was smooth and quick; this is the best company in Bangor, Maine!Wayfair is an amazing place to work and a very fun advirment. There is always something happening and it will keep you on your toes. Working at wayfair will always be a great memory.Worst company in Boston, underpaid, bro culture, disorganized management. They need to focus in hiring quality employees and investing in them and not just hiring for headcount. Would not recomentdWayfair is a fun and interesting place to work, but it has a start-up feel and things change drastically on a daily basis.  They are not profitable and recently had to lay off many employees in the B2B sales department.Not bad, no advancement. Terrible pay.The benefits are good, the atmosphere is relaxed and is easy to operate in regards to the rules. It is a very clicky atmosphere and only the cool kids are able to advance.It is one of the most fun work place ever. It is a great place to work and has awesome benefits.

My typical day is requires following up on action items, communicating to CMO of status updates and upcoming activities, as well as addressing any documentation excursion or revisionManagement and coworkers are dedicated to excellence.Very challenging timelines make work-life balance a constant struggle.The best part of this job is knowing that the world will be just a little bit better for the work that this company does.Good work colleagues. Good management in Germany and Japan.However its sad that your production is remotely controlled from Singapore. One time a mistake was made, then later in Sept this year an old Chinese witch from our Singapore office came to our office and gossiping rude things behind our backs and lecturing some of us in the office and cafeteria - making us Germans sound like we are incompetent! All because a colleague was tired and made one mistake.. like they never make mistakes themselves! Very poor morale.It's a great place to work with bad management.the money is good but there's no use in the money when your never out of work only long enough to sleep. They also go through new people all of the time because schedules are sometimes not good. You can't have a life and work this job it's not possible.The company is undergoing huge change with new US Commercial President and newer CEO.  The culture is no longer one of honesty, integrity, and fairness like its Company Values profess.  Every year I was employeed with Takeda, we had a change in organizational structure and potential layoff. In addition to the organizational flux, management in some departments are poor leaders, promoted because they 'get the job done' but with little regard or support for their team that has worked hard to contribute to their success.  I would caution anyone looking for a stable company with fair and impartial leadership to pursue Takeda at this time in their career.A typical work day consist of traveling to 10-12 accounts and engaging with doctors about different disease states such as Gout, Diabetes and Constipation. Most day I provide breakfast and lunches to offices to build rapport with office staff and doctors.	Developed detailed programs with NPLs that cover planning, initiation, execution, monitoring, and close out phases.	Use MS Project and other programs to outline specifics for program milestones, requirements, payment schedules, subcontracts definition, technical work description, staffing, integrated master schedules, and budgets 	Worked as a liaison to build coalitions among the various stakeholders and negotiated authority to move the project forward to meet the timelines	Monitoring program performance (technical, cost and schedule) through direct interaction with NPLs is a weekly routine.I was happy to dive into this position and learn.It was a great educational experience and can take this anywhere!•	Transcribe all recorded medical, educational, and legal audio and video-recorded material including medical meetings, operative reports, patient histories and examinations, discharges, x-ray reports, progress reports, legal and educational sessions.•	Thorough knowledge of medical, legal, and educational transcription guidelines and practices.•	Extensive medical and legal terminology knowledge.•	Ability to understand diverse dialects and accounts.•	Excellent communication skills necessary to perform all essential job functions.The job was fantastic in that the company gave me all the resources needed to educated physicians.  This made the job more enjoyable and opened a ton of options to be successful.Hire, develop and train 11 sales representatives to be able to effectively sell our products to their physicians.  This includes weekly field rides with my team where we review numbers, business strategies and developmental plans.  My style is as a partner who expects a lot, but never asks anyone to do anything I would not do myself.  The hardest part of the job is just being able to have a good work life balance.  Best part is seeing people develop and get promoted into future leaders of the companyDevelop and train 11 sales reps on a daily basis while managing a specific geography and all the products in that area. Develop business plans to hit company goals with the purpose of developing future leaders of TakedaAssisted with the launch Takeda’s new drug NINLARO® with Patient Advocacy and Commercial/Marketing team. Spearheaded the creation of a multicultural team to address the disparities of the African American community in the Multiple Myeloma therapeutic area. Brought in the Dream Foundation to create Dreams for Multiple Myeloma Patients to promote Dreams for adults with Multiple Myeloma.Great place to work. Great employees and great managers. Managers are real world. Takeda give responsibility and accountability at the local level, which allow individuals to determine their strategic approach.There is a great environment among the workers, act like a family all together. There was a management change(head change), which the workers were not really happy about with the new management system.Takeda offers some great benefits to its full-time employees, however, like most positions, if you are a contractor, they pile on the work with no real benefits.I owe this organization much gratitude for giving me the opportunity to work with a great sales force, develop much of my skill set over a long period of time and allowing me the appropriate education needed for continued work in the medical industry.My co-workers were great and I had a great time with them. But their human management was bad. They don't care about employees advancement.Many organization changes are currently underway. Great part of the company is that there are 1/2 day fridays to ensure work life balance.Great Company! Good Benefits and Employees. Good work life balance and overall place to work. Need more companies like this in the Lake County area.I would start the week by looking at my schedule which would tell my what materials I will be testing for the week and any other responsibilities to be carried e.g. water sampling, monitoring stock levels, waste runs. I would then get any paper work I would need issuing by a senior analyst and print of  any specifications which will be need on the day of testing. I would carry out the tests required in the most efficient timing which allows me to maximise my work day to the most. As this was my first job from graduating I have learned so much from the experience of what its like to work in a industry setting and the time lines which need to be met. I got along with everyone in my work place, the management were so understanding and very easy to approach with any problems, as well with my co-workers they would help me with any queries I had especially when I first started.The hardest part of the job was in my first few months of employment and it was referring to the pharmacopoeias as I was not familiar using them, but as time went on I became comfortable using them. The most enjoyable part of my job was the challenge of performing new more difficult techniques and tests that I had not had the opportunity to perform yet.I worked with contracts, and adverse events.I worked with some amazing hardworking coworkers.really enjoyed my time working as a Temp with Takeda.","10,000+",Boston,Cambridge,MA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/d875c90f-0d25-45f3-9ec9-cf80553f0c2c?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=29,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

362,1074.0,Senior Statistical Programmers,Parexel,3.6,243.0,"Excellent organization with work life balance and career development.Provides good benefits in terms of health and other aspects.Parexel is a CRO.  My job consisted of regulatory review, submitting protocols to IRB.  I reviewed invoices for payment.  I enjoyed working with sites and co-workers to help get a protocol started in a timely manner.  We worked at a fast pace and always willing to help each to make the project successful.The people at the company are great.  co-workers are very supportive. Management is bad. Productivity is measured by numbers which is fine except management keeps changing what is important and defining goals that are loaded with buzzwords but are fundamentally useless on a day to day basis.  Learning is OJT which is fine. there is always a budget crisis.  But the people are really great and the sense of humor at non management levels is enjoyable.Good work place to begin once career, the management try their best to ensure that everyone imbibe the Parexel culture. working here really gave me the opportunity to learn a lotWhen you arrive in the morning, you check emails for any updates or any critical changes in the DB. You get to learn very quick how to be proactive for the good management of the DBThe job is very demanding, although you do not need to have a specific professional formation. It is a huge company so that you learn to work along with people from all over the world. The environment is very nice, and mostly young people from 20-30 years old work there.I worked there for years and decided to leave after my last review.  I was held back from promotion for not completing something that wasn't included in my goals.  There workload is heavy, it's difficult to get promoted and the department goes through frequent reorgsManagement of clinical category (Patient Recruitment); responsible for strategic oversight and management of supplier relationship management, spend/savings targets, MSA negotiations, score card and rate cards. Strategic Sponsor Partnership management over 3 main Partnerships - Procurement Lead.PAREXEL is a good place to work however there is limited career growth opportunities.  Also there is a decline in senior management oversight, leadership & support within Quality but overall a good starting point for experience.PAREXEL has a good work and fast paced environment. Learn many aspects of Early Phase Clinical Research. Diverse work group and opportunities to travel nationally and internationally.They do offer training in new departments. It is a very educational company for new young college students. The staff is very friendly.Company is growing rapidly and hiring many new employees. Great co-workers! Work life balance is not a priority for management.Co-workers are very helpful.  The team mindset is relatively active in most projects.  Unfortunately, transitioning to a more challenging study is very difficult.I have worked for PAREXEL for four years and have gotten good employee reviews. I have applied for over forty positions internally and have been turned down without notice or feedback. I brought it up to my manager's attention, and also HR's attention. all they had to say is keep up the good work. On the other hand people in my department with ONLY high school diploma or less than a year of relevant experience get promoted to manager or Team lead. The company mission states merit based excellence. HOWEVER, it is not merit based its who you know.Overall a daily work day was full of productivity contacting sites and retrieving, and reviewing regulatory document for IRB submission, and approval. Managing my time which allowed me to stay in top of my sites to achieve patient enrollment to clinical trial. I find being a part of an industry which support improving the quality of life for patient less fortunate is very rewarding.Over all Parexel was by far the greatest job I have had.I would have liked to have turned it in to a career, but with the company restructuring and moving to PA. there was no other option but to seek employment else where. but on a typical day our teams focus was on customer satisfaction. Ensuring all orders are picked, pack and shipped out accurately.professional  coworkers, standard process. and nice place to self development.  exposure to different theraputic areas.I started out as a temp with PAREXEL.  I was allowed to work independently and always made my deliverables in a timely manner.  Having worked with PAREXEL for over 16 years it was and is an excellent company to work with.  Although timelines were tight, the moral was great and I highly recommend this company to anyone.  Management is great.Global CRO with excellent personnel who strive to make a difference. Talented senior management. This company provided my first introduction to Oracle E-Business Suite and Hyperion applications.Excellent company to work for. Have never had any concerns to mention.  The group I work with is excellent and work great together as a team.Very compliant and conservative work environment. Lot of trainings and focuses on quality a lot. Very detailed understanding of Regulatory affairs.","10,000+",Boston,Waltham,MA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/47f5d87b-fd65-4083-b02d-6df6aee6e149?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
