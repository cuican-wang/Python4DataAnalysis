I also do western blotting, DNA/RNA isolation, DNA subcloning, and real time PCR as routine tasks.I also work on mice for many years. I do breeding, genotyping and section.A typical day at work started with report . Meeting with  each patient, assessments of each patient, vitals, treatments, medications, dressing changes and all patient care. From there organizing my time to make sure all tasks are completed by the end of my shift. Many times my co-workers and I would help each other to care for patients when needed. The Hardest part of the job was sometimes to give every patient the amount of time with me as I would have liked. I very much enjoy providing quality patient focused care to each and every patient I care for.Wonderful company. Friendly atmosphere. Great opportunites for growth and advancement.Working at FCA seasonally has been a great job and opportunity to go to school, but still have a job during the holidays.",,Boston,Cambridge,MA,2016-01-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/33006734-5338-4d0e-a1f7-8d5789d78979?mescoid=1500153001001&jobPosition=31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
