9,721.0,Sr. Scientist,Sanofi US,4.1,1400.0,"Fast paced environment with quickly changing priorities. Most employees are friendly an contribute to a comfortable work culture.Management has poor understanding of what goes on.  Workers are treated very poorly and there is a cover up ""mentality"" when it comes to compliance.Great place to work because of the people. The culture has changed over the years but is hopefully on its way back to a positive place.A good french company with lot of esay-to-work employees.As many big companies, it's sometimes difficult to make the project going forward.Very productive and relaxed workplace. Managers held open door policy and interacted with employees. Worked on a team and did individual work as well. Involved standing and sitting for periods of times.Checking emails for urgent matters was the first thing I did every morning. I learned to prioritize and what it means to work as a team.  Working along side management help me to grow professionally and it gave me the confidence that I needed to push myself to levels I did not think I could achieve. The people I worked with not only were my partners at work but we became a family.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the reorganization of the company.  A lot of changes came very quickly and we had to adjust to new faces and new responsibilities.  Our strength was how we all came together and embraced the changes.  The work, changes and obstacles will always be there but when you have a group of people that are willing to work as a team it makes coming to work enjoyable.Sanofi is a solid company with great products. I had a great time working in Sanofi and my learning experience took me to a higher level in the business. My colleagues were awesome people very focus and dedicated to the business. The most enjoyable part of the job was developing people and the dedication that the company have for the benefit of the patients.Fantastic benefits and extremely flexible work/life balance.  Overall great company to work for. Financial forecast process can be painful dealing with French corporate office.This was a great place to work. The people were friendly, caring, and helpful. The pay was a little low but there was a very good balance of family life.Sanofi is a great pharmaceutical company that takes pride in the concern for their employees, in patient care, and development and marketing of cutting-edge drugs. Overall, Sanofi is a great place to work with many benefits and continued educational possibilities.Definitely learned a lot and given the opportunity to implement the acquired skills. If asked, I would definitely refer individuals to this employer. I'm sure they'd appreciate the experienceBeautiful company, safety is extremely important Everyone's experience is differentAt the end of the day you are there to work so just do it and go home.Job was great. Co-workers were awesome. In general contractors were treated as a different class of people and let go based on length of stay rather than performanceUnrealistic expectations. Poor employee morale due to poor leaders. High employee turnover due to poor management. The company owns you due 24/7 365 and runs lean. Too many projects which takes away from running the operation efficiently. HR is no better.Love what the company does for the world. However, it's hard to move ahead at times. Great benefits, and vacation time, etc.-Nice people to work with-Workload is manageable-There is always work to be done-Strict compliance-Promotions are not easily given in many positionsGood challenging work. Ability to work remotely. Always pushing the cutting edge of technology. Nice to work in an environment that is focused on improving the quality of an individual's life.The Sanofi Oncology department in Malvern, PA included a talented group of trial managers, data managers, project managers and senior managers who delivered challenging studies within timelines and budget. The closing of the Malvern,PA facility in June 2011 resulted in the loss of a many great team members and clinical research experts.A work day begins by finding out what lines need to be filled and where you will be placed.  By working at Sanofi i've learned Aseptic techniques, and other processes.The organization as a whole has been quite enjoyable to work for over the years. Too bad the location is closing and moving operations oversees, most likely to France.I was reasonable for building and  sterilizing equipment for the other departments in my building, as well as training other coworkers.",,Boston,Waltham,MA,2016-11-17T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/sr-scientist-job-waltham-ma-us-176303645.aspx?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
12,724.0,Principal Statistical Programmer (Home Based),PAREXEL International Corporation,3.6,243.0,"Excellent organization with work life balance and career development.Provides good benefits in terms of health and other aspects.When you arrive in the morning, you check emails for any updates or any critical changes in the DB. You get to learn very quick how to be proactive for the good management of the DBGood work place to begin once career, the management try their best to ensure that everyone imbibe the Parexel culture. working here really gave me the opportunity to learn a lotParexel is a CRO.  My job consisted of regulatory review, submitting protocols to IRB.  I reviewed invoices for payment.  I enjoyed working with sites and co-workers to help get a protocol started in a timely manner.  We worked at a fast pace and always willing to help each to make the project successful.The people at the company are great.  co-workers are very supportive. Management is bad. Productivity is measured by numbers which is fine except management keeps changing what is important and defining goals that are loaded with buzzwords but are fundamentally useless on a day to day basis.  Learning is OJT which is fine. there is always a budget crisis.  But the people are really great and the sense of humor at non management levels is enjoyable.Company is growing rapidly and hiring many new employees. Great co-workers! Work life balance is not a priority for management.PAREXEL is a good place to work however there is limited career growth opportunities.  Also there is a decline in senior management oversight, leadership & support within Quality but overall a good starting point for experience.The job is very demanding, although you do not need to have a specific professional formation. It is a huge company so that you learn to work along with people from all over the world. The environment is very nice, and mostly young people from 20-30 years old work there.Co-workers are very helpful.  The team mindset is relatively active in most projects.  Unfortunately, transitioning to a more challenging study is very difficult.professional  coworkers, standard process. and nice place to self development.  exposure to different theraputic areas.PAREXEL has a good work and fast paced environment. Learn many aspects of Early Phase Clinical Research. Diverse work group and opportunities to travel nationally and internationally.They do offer training in new departments. It is a very educational company for new young college students. The staff is very friendly.Management of clinical category (Patient Recruitment); responsible for strategic oversight and management of supplier relationship management, spend/savings targets, MSA negotiations, score card and rate cards. Strategic Sponsor Partnership management over 3 main Partnerships - Procurement Lead.I worked there for years and decided to leave after my last review.  I was held back from promotion for not completing something that wasn't included in my goals.  There workload is heavy, it's difficult to get promoted and the department goes through frequent reorgsVery compliant and conservative work environment. Lot of trainings and focuses on quality a lot. Very detailed understanding of Regulatory affairs.Excellent company to work for. Have never had any concerns to mention.  The group I work with is excellent and work great together as a team.Global CRO with excellent personnel who strive to make a difference. Talented senior management. This company provided my first introduction to Oracle E-Business Suite and Hyperion applications.I have worked for PAREXEL for four years and have gotten good employee reviews. I have applied for over forty positions internally and have been turned down without notice or feedback. I brought it up to my manager's attention, and also HR's attention. all they had to say is keep up the good work. On the other hand people in my department with ONLY high school diploma or less than a year of relevant experience get promoted to manager or Team lead. The company mission states merit based excellence. HOWEVER, it is not merit based its who you know.Over all Parexel was by far the greatest job I have had.I would have liked to have turned it in to a career, but with the company restructuring and moving to PA. there was no other option but to seek employment else where. but on a typical day our teams focus was on customer satisfaction. Ensuring all orders are picked, pack and shipped out accurately.Overall a daily work day was full of productivity contacting sites and retrieving, and reviewing regulatory document for IRB submission, and approval. Managing my time which allowed me to stay in top of my sites to achieve patient enrollment to clinical trial. I find being a part of an industry which support improving the quality of life for patient less fortunate is very rewarding.Discrimination in the employees. Laid off people on the discrimination of likes and dislikes.The management is very biased. No projects in the company , the employees are not friendly , the managers also not very understanding.","10,000+",Boston,Billerica,MA,2016-11-17T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/principal-statistical-programmer-home-based-job-billerica-ma-us-176274124.aspx?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
13,725.0,Contract SAS Programmer,Alkermes,3.9,18.0,"I wasn't there very long so but it was a great environment to learn about GMP.  People, and culture was great and there was great teamwork.Alkermes has an exceptional work life balance and compensation but very poor leadership at the Director level. The company does not promote collaboration between groups and in fact reprimands employees who desire to learn about and meet other key stakeholders that may affect your work. The company in my experience has inadequate training programs that are job specific and expects you to perform at a high level with zero to no training or guidance regarding your Job. The business has a culture of working in silos with strict restrictions on being able to communicate with other people across the organization. Be aware that when you interview for the company the team sells the opportunity to collaborate and bring new ideas, but when you do they may come at the cost of your continued employment. The company is still developing new process and is still junior in this area.Great company in its infancy before becoming a major CNS player.  I currently promote Aristada Injection to all Institutions, CMHC's, and private practice psychiatrists in the Worcester/Western, Ma area.it is a great place to work, with great people. very fast paced and willing to help people move up into higher positions if they have the skills.A great company helping to improve peoples lives!A great culture as well!aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaPeople are generally friendly and communicate well. Room to grow and learn inside after hire. Promotions are available with time. Great benefits and retirement plans. They really care and want people to be happy and taken care of.I was a contract employee at Alkermes.  It was close to home and although it was NOTHING like what they described, it was a good job.  Both the staffing company and the internal management I interviewed with stated it was a lab type job, but it was really a manufacturing-general labor type job that had nothing to do with the degree I received.  Because I was a contract (temporary) employee, I received no vacation or sick days, no benefits, was not allowed to partake in the small raffles (VIP parking spot, vacation day, baskets, etc.), and did NOT receive a shift difference in my pay even though I worked 2nd (afternoon) shift.  I was recently let go because so-called internal moves; this had been planned for a week, yet I was not informed until Saturday, a weekend day we are not scheduled to work, and also informed that my locker would be cleaned out and sent to me.  My supervisor was not consulted in this matter and therefore could not even break the news to me.  Although this may be a great company to work for if you are fortunate enough to be a full time employee, the temporary employee status is definitely not one to recommend, and since 90% of their company is hired through the same staffing company on a temporary basis, I wish every contract employee there the best of luck and hope they do not get what I did not deserve.Excellent company. Great environment, lots of room to grow and advance your career. Would work there again given the chance.Be clear about the role and responsibility during the interview processThis company takes care of its employees and creates a good environment in which to develop your skill set and further your career.I enjoyed working at Alkermes.  I learned a lot about the Pharmaceutical Industry.  Now I understand why some medicines are so costly.Inspected medicine powders before formulating into medicine capsules, Learning procedure for medicine production steps.Staying seated almost the whole 10 hrs. Some requirements for job not so rewarding . Rewarding part of job was Making boxes and filling them with medicine to be accounted for and documented and put in the freezer for holding till ready for capsule filling.Quiet office.Nice people.I was only a temp there so I am not in the position to be writing a review of the company. I enjoyed my experience there and it seems like it would be a great place to work long term.The product is great and the accounts that work within the market are very dedicated to their patients.",,Boston,Waltham,MA,2016-11-17T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/contract-sas-programmer-job-waltham-ma-us-176237977.aspx?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

This is a large company so it does take some getting used to if you are coming from a smaller company (i.e. company policies/procedures etc can make it challenging.).Amec Foster Wheeler is a great company to work for.  They are competitive with salary and benefits, and they work hard to keep their employees.  The work environment is very comfortable, and the stress and pressure level is very low.every day our general forman preaches to us about ways to "" get our money"" inciting to get us fired. Our supervision wants us to do it their way and not the right way. Its honestly a poorly ran job site.Worked here for a year as front desk, awesome co workers. I was a temp therefore that is why I am no longer working there. Understanding boss and great atmosphere. Great company!I gained a great deal of experience.  Worked with many levels of management.  Relaxed but professional atmosphere.  Truly a work family at the local officeTypical work environment, you have good and just get along workers. Working doing equipment and piping is enjoyable. Making layouts work in existing plants is both interesting and challenging. Management helps to get the required items you need to do your job.great company.safety department always making sure we were all following safety rules and regulations. to keep us safe.I will go back any time if the opportunity was given.Joined a successful stormwater and water resources group.  Very good staff and solid leadership.  Large corporate structure that is impersonal.  Minimal appreciation for long hours and hard work.I enjoy working for this company, not only do they show there employees the up most respect but they follow up with there employees to see if the job expectation is able to be preformed to the best of the employees ability.Love the people.  Very team atmosphere.  Great place to growLots of opportunities  Always looking to improve and challengeVery much a work family atmosphere.Read and interpreted blueprints, plans, and drawings to ensure specifications were met.  Measured and cut iron and other materials to size specifications.  Collaborated with workers and managers to plan job requirements, timeline, and scope.  Performed flagging and signaling duties directing workers engaged in moving loads to ensure the safety of workers and materials.  Constructed, assembled, and connected structures, columns, and beams using bolts, hand and power tools.  Grinded metals to smooth and quality finishes.  Maintained work areas, tools, and equipment in a safe, orderly, and clean manner.  Followed all standards, rules, regulations, procedures, practices, policies, guidelines, directions, and codes to ensure safety, efficiency, compliance, productivity, quality service and workmanship.The company expects a lot of work,  labor, and places more expectations everyday. The worst part is you are threatened daily for not meeting goals or asking for a fair wage.After Foster Wheeler was being bought out by AMEC, changes to the employment roster was coming.  Good place to work with good insurance.Projected a position that was opened and laid someone off six months after they started.  Company is being affected by the oil/gas industry and not sustaining work for employees.This merger if Amec and Foster Wheeler was a very tough one.  Half of the company in Houston has been laid off. No one could foresee the oil and gas market having the troubles it now hasOn a typical day I provide numerous reports to various departments that include headcount, salaries, KPI, and government requirements.  It is sometimes very challenging because of the fact that my company is a Global company and has various systems that manage the HRIS and Finance for each Business Unit. My job is rewarding because I have spent many years working on all the different systems and truly understand how to manipulate the information to create the reports required of me.Some days we'd be overworked and aggrivated with management. On other occasions it would be completely different and fun. Plenty of water provided constantly through the day.All the people I worked with were very nice and friendly. I enjoyed all my tasks at this position and learned a lot about Instrumentation and engineering codes and standards.I learned a lot with working with different projects with different lead engineers! Building and designing panels and wiring diagrams. Worked in a very professional workplace setting! Hardest part of the job is when work is getting slow and lose out on bids for big projects and they have to shorten their staff!  Most enjoyable is when work is overflowing and getting overtime!! Learning and working with great people!  AMEC FOSTER AND WHEELER is a great company!Every day was a learning experience for me. What I enjoyed doing the most was working on the transformer units. Everything about them interests me. Looking forward to learning about turbines and would definitely take action if given the opportunity to attend Turbo School.Amec Foster Wheeler is a nice place to work. The atmosphere is pleasant and welcoming. Employees to mind helping employees.

Lack of leadership skills in higher management. No innovation.AIR Worldwide is a pioneer in the risk industry. Employees enjoy a good work/life balance, an effective management team, and challenging innovative work. People are from all over the world and most have advanced degrees which makes the environment even more stimulating. Two thumbs way up!Great benefits and location.  The nature of the business and global presence makes it difficult to have a good work life balanceThere is diversity among the ranks, however women are not equally represented in management.I learned how important is QA position for the product. I used to give feedback to the project leads which help them in development of the product.I enjoy working for AIR Worldwide. The people are great, the management is all right - there are few strange policies, but overall are pretty good.I wish the management would have little more trust in people and allow to work remotely. The company looses too many knowledge in good employees due to their migration, and not willing to keep them on staff working from their new homes.Solid company, great opportunity for advancement, but has its drawbacks as well.","1,001 to 5,000",Boston,Boston,MA,2016-11-17T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/2d480471-b8e8-4ff3-8bc7-8e4a0dbc045a?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=33,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
