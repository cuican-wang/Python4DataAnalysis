148,860.0,"STATISTICAL DATA ANALYST, SPH School of Public Health, Data Coordinating Ctr",Boston University,4.1,185.0,"Boston University is a great place to work with excellent benefits and time off. A lot of diversity. You will learn how a large university operates.Supervise, train and otherwise maintain the day to day operational effectiveness of the Housing and Rental Department. Train new personnel, update techniques for continuing employees, monitor and assign workloads, measure effectiveness and design and implement goals for each employee.Handle delicate cases, analyze confidential and personal information to effect resolution. Interaction with students, staff and superiors providing information, answering questions, receiving complaints, take orders and requests in behalf of the University.Great mentorship in a supportive environment. Some drudgery when executing repetitive experiments. Friendly coworkers. Management sometimes doesn't provide enough structure. Freedom to solve problems creatively.Although it is had to say between departments. Wanting to work there for years and finally getting in the experience was not what I expected it to be. Manager was very demanding and not understanding about personal issues or well-being.Loved working there, great staff, excellent organizagtion. Worked there for almost 5 years, reasonble pay for management but and had to resign due to very stressful commute .BU will give you as much responsibility as you can handle. No politics. Decency and interesting people to work with. Wish they were here in warm Sarasota!My overall review isn't the best due to management and how staff are treated, to the point that even directors of different departments state the same.Boston University has something for everyone. They are always striving to improve the education that is provided to their students.I learned a ton from working with the student workforce. They brought a certain energy that is unique to a University setting. I found that most of the staff shared a common goal to do their fare share while keeping it a enjoyable place to work. I was blessed to have great leadership to learn from and grow as a young professional.The most challenging part of my particular job was dealing with last minute requests, or unforeseen technical issues.It was truly a blessing to work with such great young adults and future leaders, making all the hard work enjoyable.A quiet and non disturbing environment that gives you enough time to finish your tasks and research in a timely manner. The co-workers are all highly educated and professional which provides a nice educational environment.I worked and studied at BU for a very long time. Few of my instructors were tenured, and part time faculty get paid very little. I got no monetary recognition or reward for my degrees though relevant to my job. I know that BU's Personnel office only pays salaries based on a position's demand and how easily it can be filled. Management rarely shows any appreciation for loyalty or anything else. Given the cost of higher ed right now, if you can avail of the tuition benefit, use it and leave ASAP. Otherwise, avoid BU if at all possible. They abuse workers and students while obsessing over bottom lines and perpetual inferiority to Boston's other colleges.Great place to work, everyone here is very respectful. At times it can get stressful because of the work load. You're never not working because you have to be on call but that comes with working in the IT dept.It is a great experience to practice public speaking and communication with others. Also, the work load is reasonable, professors are friendly and other TAs are nice.This job required the delivery of foods and beverages to soup kitchens and churches in the surrounding Boston area. I was able to meet a lot of generous people from many backgrounds who all wanted to give back. Working with co-workers was rewarding because we were all their for the same thing.I have been an intern at BU in the IT department for the past two years. It is a great place to work, the work atmosphere is busy, co-workers are very helpful.BUASC is a great environment if you don't want to grow. The department needs structural shift to meet the needs of the younger generation.Boston University provides an excellent benefits package and encouragement to grow within one's own department and across the institution.It is a challenging internship in many ways.  Often I lead and work with people who are much older than I am, while I am in the leadership role.  I must be able to work with a large variety of people.  Because of the necessity for the Chapel to be a safe place, there is a certain level of decorum that must be maintained.  It has been a really wonderful learning experience.Very energetic team of employees, get to learn a lot on the job. Supervisors are very experienced, and are ever ready to help with any problems that might crop up.The hardest part of this job: It is always hard to get a article to support our opinion about our researchI learned how to combine real world business with theory in books. I enjoyed to work with my Professor. He is a creative person.Working in the Medical campus' research lab was everything you would expect. No thrill and no frill. Great for those who want to have an easy full time job and go for their tuition remission benefit and get a graduate degree out of it part-time. Be prepared to work hard for juggling school and work though, it's do-able but not fun.This is a very interest place to work. Some co-workers were wonderful . Management wasn't big on communication. The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting persons from different places and dealing with all personalities.",,Boston,Boston,MA,2016-12-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/567c611d-20eb-4118-8e14-5c7866bc17ba?mescoid=1300087001001&jobPosition=27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
155,867.0,"Chief Scientist, Marine Mammal Surveys",New England Aquarium,4.3,28.0,"Overall the New England Aquarium is a great environment to work as a team when commutation is clear and given by all team members. Very educational even for the employees whom dont work interacting with the animals. Very informative regarding current sea life news. Everyone is nice and eager to help each other out.It was a harboring environment that allowed to grow and become a better individual and employee.By far the best management I have ever had. They care and never make you feel inferior.IT was awesome working with the rescue department and learning all about sea turtles. You get to see the rescue and rehab procedure from when they come in to when the turtles are released. You also get to help the Vets examine the turtles as well as feed themThey expect 3 - 4 days a week 9 - 5 completely unpaid work. The only benefits are free access to the aquarium and some discounts on local museums.During my time at the NEAQ I met the best people to work with they trained me and taught me so much about a non profit organization. I learned a lot about different animals. I also felt like I learned how to master public speaking because after the proper training I was talking in front of an attendance as big as 500 people. The hardest part of the job was probably knowing I couldn't go far in the company because i was so young at the time and I already went as far as I could in the company.Different then what you would expect. Strict and hostile environment. Very low pay. Alot of drama that it feels like high school and it doesnt make it stress free to come inFast paced environment and very social place. showing customers and the children a wonderful experience . Excellent place to gain customer service and make bonds with those who comeMy day start at 8:00 am, I do check all my employees that are schedule they are on time. after check all my area , I do go to my office to check email and any request. I do paper work, order, schedule, inventory, Meeting. Also I do check all area are running properly from our expectation.Worked with all around amazing people and could not have asked for a better experience as my first internship.A typical days include taking and recording temperatures, observing the animals, cleaning husbandry tanks, daily feedings, and interacting with the public whenever possible. Hardest part of the job, be willing to constantly be on your feet- running up and down MULTIPLE flights of stairs, carrying heavy things. Don't be afraid to get dirty. Most enjoyable part of the job- all of it. I loved every single part of the job.NEAQ is a wonderful workplace with a great mission and wonderful employees.  Part time jobs pop up occasionally, but if you haven't been volunteering there for the last few (or 20) years, good luck getting an interview.  Very difficult to move up or into higher or full time positions.A typical day would start by taking inventory of all the food for the day, followed by counting and distributing the cash drawers to the cashiers. Once opened for business, I'd go back and forth between the snack bars and make sure everything was running smoothly. I would help the co-workers or cover lunches / breaks when needed. At the end of the day, all the drawers were tallied up again and reports were presented to management. The hardest part of the job was having to ask cashiers to explain unacceptable negative or overage in the cash drawers.I loved working at the NEAQ, it was probably one of the best jobs I have ever had. No matter what your job title is, it's like you're a part of a family. Everyone knows everyone and regardless if you're cleaning toilets or checking PH levels, you will leave knowing a ton more about aquatic life than when you first came in. I met some of the best people while working there and it was unfortunate that I was not able to work there anymore.I loved working at the aquarium the people that you would meet everyday were everyday people. Got to work with children and teach people about what you knew. You were the teacher at the aquarium not the other way around. It was a way for me to share my knowledge with the people around me. The management and the Co-workers were awesome people outgoing and understanding as well as very helpful when you had a question!I served as a Cashier/IMAX theater host for Box Office as well as a Reservationist in Reservations over a span of two years. Daily, I engaged dozens if not hundreds of culturally diverse tourists working at the Aquarium. There is never a dull moment at this place. The Box Office management is a professional team and they make it a fun environment to work in.A wonderful mission and non-profit organization to be apart of. However, through the retirement of key management and a strong will to change overal corporate culture. I am seeking an enviornment that is best suited to match my drive and passion, verses a relaxed and passive approach to important buisness issues and development.Best place to work part time, it's fun, educational and the very interesting. I love that place and i always meet new people from different countries that come here just to study the behaviors of seaa animals.NeaQ is a fun and friendly place where you can be yourself, and with the right management, they are flexible with your hours. LOVE this job because it is flexible with schooling. Just be on time and show up to work, and you will be great!Initial time commitment required, very flexible after that. Excellent staff and friendly volunteers. Very hard to move into a paid position due to interest and a very low turn over on job openings.Telemarketing Supervisor for Spring and Summer Annual Campaign.Recruited, trained and supervised a team of fundraisers in support of the aquarium's environmental, educational and research programs.  The position was fun and challenging.   However, it was clear from the beginning that it was a ""temporary"" position.  I heard from numerous staff that they were converting the position into a data base admin position and would be outsourcing in the future.At the end of the summer campaign they released me and indeed they converted the position and outsourced. (I got calls from them from time to time).One issue is that at the time they used a database for fundraising called RAISER'S EDGE.   They brought in a trainer for a few days and we had a whirlwind tour of the system.   I never truly became proficient in it beyond basics.For 5 years I've worked here and I haven't gotten tired of it yet. There are so many amazing people as well as the beautiful animals. After all, work is a lot more fun when you get to talk about fish!the greatest job a teen or a adult interested in the world of water could ever have. Wonderful co workers amazing guest and lots of things to learn from this job .",,Boston,Boston,MA,2016-12-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/3deb975f-bd8c-4c5b-a30c-2598950ce268?mescoid=1100001001001&jobPosition=34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
156,868.0,Food Technologist,Welch's,2.8,14.0,"The company has a great culture and provides for a good work-life balance.  I am used to working in a fast-paced environment and find that a ""sense of urgency"" is lacking in the Company.Company forces overtime all the time there is no family life when you work for them. All they care about is the almighty dollar.Left a decent job with steady house to work at Welch's Northeast. As part of my job offer i was told i'do me bounced between 2nd and 3rd shift, I would also be learning a ""skilled labor"" job that paid $6 more an hr. I was also informed that they did not force you to work double. What they failed to mention was that being bounced around was day-to-day not week-to-week. Their schedule department has no idea what they are doingoing and there is no rhyme or reason to what they are doing. They don't release a schedule until the day before and will often change it several times  through out the day. Was scheduled for 2 doubles within the first 6 days I was there and they also failed to schedule in the skilled labor job they promised. When I tried to speak to hr about all these issues they simply enter responded with ""I'll accept your resignation.""It wasn't a bad place to work or anything. management and workers were friendly.  I just worked on the line keeping it running on my end.  Only worked there for three months till I went to Grand Valley State University.The company was a good place to work ,but it closed down during the hard economic times. I learned a great deal of technical experience while i worked there .Welch's is one of the best companies I've ever worked for 18 years, all the way at the top with management to my former co-workers. It was more like family. We ALL pulled together to make the company run like a well oiled machine. I've learned a lot. They will be missed!A typical day at work involved working together as a team, which we did very well.  The camaraderie was very nice.  This helped me learn how to function with a diverse work force.  The hardest part of this job was the fact that the line was very fast-paced, and it was sometimes difficult to keep pace.  However, this also fueled my determination to do the best I could in keeping up; it became a daily goal for me to be better than the day before.If management had a clue of what it takes to do our jobs, this could be a great place to work. It is a slave master mentality now. With very little knowledge in management. But most dangerously they think they know what they are doing. Some people are permitted to get away with not doing their jobs, while others are highly scrutinized. In many ways it seems like upper management is trying to destroy the company.  Very sad.I miss the job it is a good place to work I got good training their and typical day; get turnover from previous shift,carryover work etc, assign jobs for technicians, monitor production lines, optimize performance. Monitor support utilities-waste treatment, refigeration plant for bulk storage. steam supply etc. Learned; skills in dealing with subordinates, peers, higher management.Management;High performance, fast paced, focusedco-workers;great group of people, dedicatedHardest part of job; 50-80hr/wk normalMost enjoyable; developing subordinates skills, solving challanging issuesCoworkers were very helpful and worked together as a family cause they considered themselves as one. The job was easy and fun while the money earn was a lot then use to. The time of shift having to work was nice and never overwhelming surprisingly giving the fact I had no days off for a start month.Was nice to work with the people. learned new things everyday. Management wasn't very good.Strat plan initiated by CEO and COO had head count reductions and 90% closing of plant as way to increase grower proceeds over 3 years. The result was releasing good people at the corp and plant level, however not one upper mangement position at the plant level was let go! They are a prominant part of the issues that have plaqued the company (Plant) for years. Still a lot of good people there wondering how long it will be before they shut the plant down and have all product co-packed.A day at work was typically started in a shift meeting where we were informed of what was happening for our shift. Not always was the information correct but once we went to our work areas our coworkers were able to tell us what was happening with better detail and accuracy. The work environment felt like at times combative with the attitude that management was better than all the other people. While they tried to make us feel as though out opinions mattered it was obvious to us that it was a show. The company overall was a good company for the most part to work for. We had good pay and benefits but the overtime was never addressed satisfactorily and more times than not so many people with families did not get much notice or consideration when it came to overtime. What made the job tolerable was the family like group of people that I worked with. We all watched each others kids grow, we helped each other with tough family issues and laughed and cried together. I miss that the most.",,Boston,Concord,MA,2016-12-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/f2903680-4596-4a8e-b33f-ba3f5551d2d4?mescoid=1900238001001&jobPosition=35,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
