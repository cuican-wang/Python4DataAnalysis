261,973.0,Research and Development - PhD - Human Safety Toxicologist,P&G,4.1,1800.0,"Proctor & Gamble has a great history of promoting within their business. I managed over 150 employees and practiced this on a daily bases. I coached employees to be hard working and improve their people skills.Procter and gamble was a good experience warehouse job. I like the people and the hands on work that I had to complete daily. The pay rate was good and the management was really good with benefits.it a nice warehouse with fast pace workers.We had to pick up material from the machines with the forklift and take them back to there assigned spots. We continually repeated the same steps till all material was cleared off the floor.duties would include: inspection of forklift that I was assigned to that day, after which I would spend the rest of the shift scanning warehouse product and then moving the product efficiently to desired location.The people of P&G are amazing. The recruiting and testing process is very rigorous and I believe it always has been.  So you have the opportunity to work with the most amazing people.  People are able to make significant contributions at every level.  Most employees are very driven to succeed so the work environment can be both challenging and inspiring. Overall P&G is a great place to work!Sign into Walmart log, scan and inventory products, designed plan-o-grams and end caps. Management was very nice but also took her job seriously in a very professional manner. I had no coworkers but was required to interact with store staff. The hardest part of the job was when store personnel would not cooperate. The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexibility.I enjoyed the place that why I stayed there for a long time and ate good food while I was at it. But to tell one the truth I would probable make this one of last place to get hired because the work is tiredsome.Great place to work. This was also an huge company so it required the workers to work in a timely manner so that the customers would be satisfied with what they would receive.Great company. P&G is very interested in training their employees and encourages their employees to be the best they can be.P&G is a great place to learn and grow. Starting out, I was given incredible responsibility and enabling latitude to solve problems and build the business. This growth experience has helped shape me into the professional I am today.I really enjoyed working proctor in gamble but it wasnt flexible with my dauthers medical appointments so my assignment was ended, but overall was a great job to work.I worked with a great group of people. My job was selling new and existing items that were authorized by various warehouses, into the grocery stores in my territory. I had fantastic people to call on, and unbelievable coworkers.P&G hires the best people, it's a great place for leadership development. You get a lot of responsibility even early in your career. Most of the people that work for P&G are very proud of it.The company is a very large company with multiple manufacturing sites around the world.  The benefits are very good, but salary is strictly determined by manufacturing sites management and years of service.Good place to work, rotating shifts is the hardest part about working there. worked with good people and your job is secure with good benefits and retirementNot guaranteed work the hours are fine. They're just really unorganized . And the co-workers are allowed to do whatever they want. Use profanity etc.P&G has state-of-the-art manufacturing processes and technologies.  A very professional and respectful place to work.  They are also committed to and invest much time and money into the training and empowering of their employees from a skills perspective.There was no typical day here. Each day brought something different, this was one of the things that made it great. I learned that working in production was great. The hardest part of leaving this company was the hardest part of this job. Management and Technicians were college graduates at this Company. the most impressed  part of this job was the skill based system. I was considered a leader and did extensive traveling for the company to up grade people systems and it is still in progress today. Had it not been for the weekly rotatating of shifts I would have never left this Global Company.  One of the most enjoyable things here was learning maintenace of equipment. Management had an open door policy.Good for some. Not good for others. Strong company. Good people  good brands.  Nice working envirmemts. Work from home option.Great company to work for and to learn from. Employees are great, very smart, and hard working. Customers are at the forefront of everything we do.I have spent many years at P&G and can only sing their praises.  I have been able to have a long and fulfilling career at the company.  The company culture and people there are wonderful, supportive and embrace everyone.","10,000+",Boston,Boston,MA,2016-07-26T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/e05cb94d-30fe-4ec0-8b51-6aacab44d035?mescoid=1900305001001&jobPosition=35,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
