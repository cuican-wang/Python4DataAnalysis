296,1008.0,Physician (Physician Scientist),Department of Veterans Affairs,4.0,2300.0,"Excellent, top notch professionals work here. Cumbersome processes across the board make it difficult to produce great work.Loved my experience working with veterans and involving in programs such helping the homeless and interacting on different levels with far strong oral &written communcation skills.I enjoyed working a at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Will miss everyone. My upcoming retirement is January 3, 2017. Looking forward to part-time employment helping others.Although I enjoy my job, the workload is extreme. Work environment is stressful, only due to workload. Supervisor is extremely helpful and understanding when it comes to home life.Government job so all of the standard good things like Job Security but this is not a good place to advance. Supervisors would rather hire from another VA for promotions so they don't get accused of favoritism by promoting within. So, even though you may work hard and excel at your position, you will be treated the same as those who do the bare minimum. Sooner or Later even the most motivated workers figure this out so you either move on or become a bad employee.Upper management did not communicate well with staff members. It is a very political job and promotions are hard to get. Paid well.The place is ever-changing from new management to new rules every other day. The constant changes can cause much chaos, but on the other hand, it is very rewarding when you know you have helped a Veteran in a positive way.The path lab is a great area to work. Management is supportive of advancement. Co-workers are considerate. I abhor filing, but enjoy typing dictation.Have enjoyed my time working here. Has great opperunities for career advancements, and working there is simply rewarding in itself.Working with the staff has taught me more about the veterans that are in need of assistance. The breadth of knowledge that i have received , as well as the varied tasks that your staff manages daily provided an environment that was both exciting and challenging.The VA obviously doesn't do their research when hiring contractors. ATP2 has Cassandra House who has made threats to employees. Austin, TX VAFSC. LackWorking with the vets in the hospital, nice coworkers how to get along the hardest part of the job getting up in the morningIt is a place where residents are well taken cared of and protected against any form of abuse. Management takes action as it happens. Good team work among staff. Good learning environment.Very supportive staff. Flexible work schedule. Learned that many tasks are ongoing, so if you need quick gratification this is not for you. Overall very nice place to work. Ability for autonomy.Organized Clinic appointments for out-patient care, and assisted with scheduling appointments for Physical Therapy and the VA MOVE Program. Management and co workers were usually nice. The most enjoyable part was helping Veterans.Difficult to progress once in if at too low a level, prior experience is does not matter as much as being at a certain pay grade for an amount of time.Steady work, no layoffs, nice people generally, serving the veterans.  So, the job can be rewarding. Personal development is not encouraged. Creative thinking is not encouraged. Cost savings are not encouraged on projects. Many functions are inefficient.enjoyed helping the veterans and all patients they need to know that there is someone here to help them with the rules of there insurenceMy experience here was good with other agencies that I worked with was good. I did not like the policy that as a case manager I would not be permitted to attend the funeral of those Veterans who were my clients, this bothered me the most. Depending on the value of the Veterans belongings families were not notified. A lot of dishonesty going around.As a work study student, I gained valuable experience working with veterans, their spouses and other members of the student body.  This position is great for gaining experience to use in future careers.I worked as a volunteer and the experience was great. I worked with a friendly staff who gave me my first work experience. They tought me phone relay, I worked in the mail room and they were great","10,000+",Boston,Bedford,MA,2016-10-07T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/d07527c5-fc94-4555-af68-5360646a3e73?mescoid=2900470001001&jobPosition=35,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Sooner or Later even the most motivated workers figure this out so you either move on or become a bad employee.I love the benefits and love the Government Holidays off. I love the fact that we always get the weekends off.I learned to how to become very efficient and very organized, since I started working at the VA.Hardest part of my day is finding enough time, to call all our patients to get them scheduled for their appointments.Greet veterans as they walked in. answer multi-telephone line, took minutes for meetings, check emails and forward to appropriate counselors, ordered supplies, process veterans payments, timekeeper for the office of 30, took picture Id's for new employees, open and sorted mail. It wasn't a hard part of the job. Love to stay busy. Also assisted veterans with completing their vocational rehabilitation applicationsChallenging work day in monitoring and interacting with Veterans to provide /advocate and provide safe and  adequate services for our Nations Veterans. The learning process involves how to efficiently promote customer services. Management is often effective in promoting adequate /up to date trainings.It was a career position but the work culture was not what I expected it to be. The frustrations occur with management that are promoted when they behave badly. The organization is now going through a paradigm shift, and the hope is with younger talent the work culture will get better.A typical day at work consists of providing quality work to a diverse group of patients, I've learned to be patient understanding all the different dynamics in patient care with the role of being a leader. I have affiliated myself with Peer Positions, Group Leadership and give my employer exemplary work to receive the highest evaluation for performance and dedication to the VA 5 years in a row. The most enjoyable part of working for the VA is that I am giving care to every culture of patients and doing it gladly to those who served with their lives to give us these freedoms.A typical day at work is busy unless the unit is full, and therefore no admissions are coming. I learned what teamwork really look and feel like for once. Management was excellent and go above and beyond for the staffs request. My coworkers overall were easy to get along with, I still keep in touch with some of them. The hardest part of my job was when I would have to work in palliative watching patients expire and then performing post mortem care. I honestly can't say what was the enjoyable part because there were so many enjoyable moments. This job at the VA changed my life literally.Being a Federal civil servant is a tough job but being one at the Department of Veterans Affairs, especially in a hospital setting, serving veterans, is great.  The biggest challenge is not serving veteran patients, but rather other staff who don't believe in human freedom.  But never fear, the VA finds ways around and through these people.  It's government work.  You cannot just fire people; in fact, you cannot fire them at all.This was my first full-time job.  Although I had worked previous part time jobs in college and between full time. This gave me an appreciation for veterans and what they were entitled to.  At that time, it was easier for veterans to use their home loan benefits but some also struggled with staying in their homes.  I learned a great deal about real estate, claims and processing new home loans.The job itself is relatively demanding and requires a very intensive, months long training.  However, once you understand the job the days fly by. The people who work there are kind, you don't really come into contact with managers, and the hardest part of the job isn't that hard, you just have to buckle down and do it.I enjoying helping out veterans and this position give me and opportunity to give back.  I enjoy working to assist other people and working with the VA I feel like what I do assist numerous people.  I work 8 hours a day five days a week.  I have worked on both sides of the picture.  I have assisted active duty personnel and now I assist veterans.  I feel that communication between upper management and  supervisors could be improved.  What I do it is all about the numbers.  But I feel if we could be more detailed it would cut down on errors.I would open the day with printing the daily schedule for each provider. Check in the patient and review their insurance and take payment if need be. I would also schedule for follow up appointments. I would have a list of new consult patients I would call and schedule for future appointments. If appointment was over 30 days I would add them to a list for them to use ""Veterans Choice"" and find them a provider within the network that they could use /see before their appointment at the VA hospital. If they did, I would forward the medical information to that provider. I would print follow up appointment letters and sent them out to the patient.LPNs are instrumental in providing holistic care to all residents through accurate assessments and medication administration. I was well-mentored as a new nurse and was able to develop important nursing skills.  I was the charge unit of each individual unit as needed and it was my responsibility to coordinate and manage CNAs in the care of the residents I was accountable for.  The hardest part of my job was adapting to limitations within the state-run facility.  The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to improve quality of life for my residents and to bring peace of mind to their family members.Great employer to interact with staff and patients and families.  Majority of work performed was a combination of utilization review on charts and hands on in the field home health with assessments of patients enrolling in home health services and follow up and treatment on current patients within the program.It definitely slides downhill. Everyone has to much on there plate but if you're an LPN or below you are at the end of the slide. No breaks and 10 minute lunches are the norm....yet the RNS and providers don't know and they don't care because it's not they're problem. RNs have it''s not my job disease and will let a Vet wait for hours because it's beneath them to checkin a walk-in.  Then they lie to you about not knowing. Frustrating place to work. The Vets are OK. Some of the providers act like it's their own private practice and are very disrespectful toward non provider staff. I've never been treated with such condenscending arrogance,  and I've been an LPN for over 15 yrs..The hospital is a great place to work most people are friendly and willing to help you, great experience in the medical field learning new challenges and update in a hospital environment and great working with Americas greatest hero's OUR VETERANS!!!Very high pace environment with great compensation. However, management poorly manages people with a diverse background and acts unprofessionally at times. Management is not supportive of employees and can be harsh with deadlines. The culture is very punitive and negative.check messages often, check patients into clinic and made followup appointments. contact providers when their patients check in, or cancel appointments. I have learned different systems that the Veteran's Hospital use. Management is always there for discussions, suggestions, and family issues. My co workers are team players and get along with everyone.The hardest part of the job would be not enough time to go out for lunch. i do enjoy working with people from different background,The typical work day consisted of organizing files, scanning  and uploading them to the current server. I learned that no matter what your duty was you always had to finish what you started. My co-workers were amazing, friendly and very supportive. The hardest part of my job was locating the exact dates of a term. I really enjoyed this job and serving as a person who contributed.","10,000+",Boston,Bedford,MA,2016-10-07T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/2bfe1be1-3637-4cfb-813f-4a9823984fce?mescoid=2900470001001&jobPosition=23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
