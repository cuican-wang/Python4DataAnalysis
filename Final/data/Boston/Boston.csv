The energy and vibe is welcoming and I would recommend anyone to apply. I learned a lot of things in the first two weeks.I would usually come in, put my bag in the locker room, clock in, go to my manager ask them what they want me to do that day and go do that. The managers are really nice and outgoing, I pretty much get along with everybody. The hardest part sometime might be with a customer that won't let you do your job and them arguing with you. The best part I think is just working with my co-workers and helping out a customer that needs help with an item.Stay away from these guys Incompetent never call never get updates.Why do I waste my time with these used car salesman outfitsthis company is fun and it teaches you that you shouldn't be afraid to talk to people. Also that everyday you work that you are never doing the same thing. the people that work there are amazing people they make me work hard.There is never a dull moment and there is always a constant buzz in the atmosphere.

Do not make near the median income for the metro area I live in.  Health benefits are not great .The job is virtual/work from home and I have found it a good place to work.  However, since it is work from home, they are strict about you always being at your computer unless you're on a break.I have been working at UHG for some time. The work environment is excellent.  It is a big company and not all departments have the same culture. The salary and benefits leave you wanting.The pay is minimal. The over time is manadatry.The company is very large. Over last 5 years the company has gone to a work at home platform. Very hard to find a manager unless you are being corrected.Would love to work for them again but of course under new management. Loved what I did. Loved all my previous supervisors, team lead and managers.It is an ok place to work.  There is nothing spectacular to say, you log on the computer, you work, you go to lunch, you log back in, you work some more, you log out and go home. You come back the next day and you do the same thing. The end.no cell phones on the floor you have to lock away your purses and cell phones in a locker and you can not use paper at all on the call center floor. it is like you are in jail. however it pays the bills.Answer anywhere from 60-80 inbound calls on a daily basis assisting health care providers for claims, pre-certification, and benefits.Most enjoyable part of my job is learning something new each day.Good culture of people, the training for the position was really bad.  Did not cover anything that we actually do; so not prepared once we got started.  Very punitive in nature regarding these issues.  Employee accumulates ""defects"" for items they were not trained on; they call it a ""coaching opportunity"".Fun eventful work days. They gave free food for lunch of your from any stand in the stadium. great team work. i learned a lot i didn't know about basebal.lDuring my current project, I've met with many employees from many different backgrounds. Everyone I met was great to work with and passionate about the work they do.UHC Oldsmar is all about your call numbers not about its' employees.Management at best is very young with no experience. It's a good old boy network and if they like you your are not written up with below standard numbers or the days you miss don't count toward your attendance. If you like being a robot this JOB is for you.... If you don't kiss a** you will not be in the click!I love the culture within the company,there is room for advancement as well as competitive pay. I have acquired many skills within the company and the continuous innovation.This job was the stepping stone into my bookkeeping background. I worked directly for the accounting supervisor and the CFO.Very positive company, with a great benefit package.I loved my job with this company. I had a great support system and excellent work/family balance. I had a family illness and was able to work through all my crises.Could be a great place too work.  Not a clear focus on the marketplace direction. Hard to accomplish goals with monthly management changes.  good coworkers.  Ability to work from home, which limited the amount of commute time.seems difficult at first but as you start to understand it becomes easier. great place for advancement if you can make it thru the first year.the job itself is a great career, it is a fantastic feeling knowing i made a difference in someones life.  I enjoy helping families in need and doing everything i can to solve their issue.Worked as a Hadoop developer in United Health Group for nearly 2 years as a fulltime employee in offshore Hyderabad, India location. It is indeed a wonderful experience and team is well managed.It was a professional work environment, where they do take the best care of you possible. Individuals were always friendly and welcoming.Great Company! Always working to improve and implement better Service for the Customer. Compassion is very big in this company.

I have applied for over forty positions internally and have been turned down without notice or feedback. I brought it up to my manager's attention, and also HR's attention. all they had to say is keep up the good work. On the other hand people in my department with ONLY high school diploma or less than a year of relevant experience get promoted to manager or Team lead. The company mission states merit based excellence. HOWEVER, it is not merit based its who you know.Over all Parexel was by far the greatest job I have had.I would have liked to have turned it in to a career, but with the company restructuring and moving to PA. there was no other option but to seek employment else where. but on a typical day our teams focus was on customer satisfaction. Ensuring all orders are picked, pack and shipped out accurately.Overall a daily work day was full of productivity contacting sites and retrieving, and reviewing regulatory document for IRB submission, and approval. Managing my time which allowed me to stay in top of my sites to achieve patient enrollment to clinical trial. I find being a part of an industry which support improving the quality of life for patient less fortunate is very rewarding.Discrimination in the employees. Laid off people on the discrimination of likes and dislikes.The management is very biased. No projects in the company , the employees are not friendly , the managers also not very understanding.","10,000+",Boston,Billerica,MA,2016-11-17T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/principal-statistical-programmer-home-based-job-billerica-ma-us-176274124.aspx?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
13,725.0,Contract SAS Programmer,Alkermes,3.9,18.0,"I wasn't there very long so but it was a great environment to learn about GMP.  People, and culture was great and there was great teamwork.Alkermes has an exceptional work life balance and compensation but very poor leadership at the Director level. The company does not promote collaboration between groups and in fact reprimands employees who desire to learn about and meet other key stakeholders that may affect your work. The company in my experience has inadequate training programs that are job specific and expects you to perform at a high level with zero to no training or guidance regarding your Job. The business has a culture of working in silos with strict restrictions on being able to communicate with other people across the organization. Be aware that when you interview for the company the team sells the opportunity to collaborate and bring new ideas, but when you do they may come at the cost of your continued employment. The company is still developing new process and is still junior in this area.Great company in its infancy before becoming a major CNS player.  I currently promote Aristada Injection to all Institutions, CMHC's, and private practice psychiatrists in the Worcester/Western, Ma area.it is a great place to work, with great people. very fast paced and willing to help people move up into higher positions if they have the skills.A great company helping to improve peoples lives!A great culture as well!aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaPeople are generally friendly and communicate well. Room to grow and learn inside after hire. Promotions are available with time. Great benefits and retirement plans. They really care and want people to be happy and taken care of.I was a contract employee at Alkermes.  It was close to home and although it was NOTHING like what they described, it was a good job.  Both the staffing company and the internal management I interviewed with stated it was a lab type job, but it was really a manufacturing-general labor type job that had nothing to do with the degree I received.  Because I was a contract (temporary) employee, I received no vacation or sick days, no benefits, was not allowed to partake in the small raffles (VIP parking spot, vacation day, baskets, etc.), and did NOT receive a shift difference in my pay even though I worked 2nd (afternoon) shift.  I was recently let go because so-called internal moves; this had been planned for a week, yet I was not informed until Saturday, a weekend day we are not scheduled to work, and also informed that my locker would be cleaned out and sent to me.  My supervisor was not consulted in this matter and therefore could not even break the news to me.  Although this may be a great company to work for if you are fortunate enough to be a full time employee, the temporary employee status is definitely not one to recommend, and since 90% of their company is hired through the same staffing company on a temporary basis, I wish every contract employee there the best of luck and hope they do not get what I did not deserve.Excellent company. Great environment, lots of room to grow and advance your career. Would work there again given the chance.Be clear about the role and responsibility during the interview processThis company takes care of its employees and creates a good environment in which to develop your skill set and further your career.I enjoyed working at Alkermes.  I learned a lot about the Pharmaceutical Industry.  Now I understand why some medicines are so costly.Inspected medicine powders before formulating into medicine capsules, Learning procedure for medicine production steps.Staying seated almost the whole 10 hrs. Some requirements for job not so rewarding . Rewarding part of job was Making boxes and filling them with medicine to be accounted for and documented and put in the freezer for holding till ready for capsule filling.Quiet office.Nice people.I was only a temp there so I am not in the position to be writing a review of the company. I enjoyed my experience there and it seems like it would be a great place to work long term.The product is great and the accounts that work within the market are very dedicated to their patients.",,Boston,Waltham,MA,2016-11-17T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/contract-sas-programmer-job-waltham-ma-us-176237977.aspx?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

16,728.0,Speech Scientist,Amazon,3.7,10100.0,"Amazon is a fast-paced, exciting place to work. I highly recommend anyone to apply. Management was strong and colleagues were great.A typical day is a 10 hour shift where management is expected to arrive 1 hour early and leave 1 hour late - in order to prepare for the day and then report on the days results to upper managementI have learned a lot working for Amazon, i have developed my leadership skills tremendously. I have gained experience in developing a team, in performance managing hundreds of direct reports. I have gained knowledge in lean methodologies and performed a multitude of process improvement initiatives.You have to be a certain type of person to succeed in this role. It is most definitely not a 9-5 type of job. The hours are long and the expectations are high. The payoff is good when you have the right team and are in a department where you can flourish.Amazon allows its associates to advance and develop their career opportunities through different programs but the amount of work and mandatory overtime required makes it a very hard and exhausting place to work. The balance between personal and work life becomes difficult to manage due to the amount of hours required to work and the compensation and benefits are not worth it.Even though Amazon can be a fun place to work with many incentives, fun activities, holiday celebrations and more, the tasks become repetitive and boring after a few months making it difficult for the associates to stay motivated.I worked at Amazon for a few months, as well as Integrity Staffing. For one, they are very unorganized. They provide very poor training but expect high rates with little errors. I only got trained for 5 hours on my first day and the other half of the shift I worked in the MOD. I got fired for productivity, which was due to poor training. I learned how to  perform my job better while I was on my final write up and getting retrained, however it was too late. I asked managers several times to move me so I wouldn't lose my job but nobody seemed to care. I worked there for 2 months and got fired. Managers were very rude to me as well. One manager told me if I didn't speed it up I was going to get terminated. I really didn't enjoy my time at Amazon, I feel like they didn't give me a chance.Though Amazon is a growing company, upward mobility only exists for those straight out of college or former military. The pay is well below industry standard at all levels. Management is typically inexperienced and unguided. Though there are many different schedules to work, Amazon is quite rigid with transfers of shifts and departments. Mandatory overtime is commonplace and there are more than six weeks of black out annually, in which vacation time is not allowed to be used. The education program is a joke as you are only allowed to pursue a handful of career paths, all of which amazon only assists to an associates degree which is useless in almost every field. The hours are long, tedious and physically demanding. Injuries are commonplace but the onsite medical staff is extremely rude and uncaring so most people hide injuries and seek out their own medical care.10 hours spent on your feet all day and constantly moving across an incredibly large three level warehouse describes a normal day.  Half of my coworkers did not want to be there and their lack of motivation or sense of doing things correctly ultimately made the job far more difficult to accomplish.  Management seems only to care about the numbers, nothing else.  Since speed of work is everything you better hope you don't run into a problem (there were always problems) since resolving it means you need to walk to a specific station and you also need to hope you aren't 5th in line.good benefits but not a job to make a career out of, they treat their workers poorly. The management team needs some improvement and the pay is not worth the hours they are asking for.The co workers don't work together as a team and everybody is for their self.To me its a great job to start out from but not a job to stay for years.The only thing that's good about this job is the benefits one of the main reason why i still currently work their but the money doesn't support my family needs.The hardest part about this job is all the changes they make unannounced.,the relationship with the management teamand the empolyees.I do not enjoy this job so i'm currently searching for further employment.I worked there for 2 years and took the buyout. They have little events and play games sometimes that are fun but...Never have I been anywhere so micro-managed in my life. If you were breathing wrong, they dinged you for it. They set high rate goals and play favorites heavily. I was a favorite of my manager and got a lot of perks. I tried to work hard, but once they terminated that manager, I was sent back to packing from being a Lead. If you can suck up and don't mind a brown nose, you can make it there no problem. If you want a paycheck and that is it, you can do it. If you want to make a career, keep looking unless you have a MBA.Being a quality auditor for Amazon.com was a great job. Although it was sometimes repetitive warehouse work, I was always rewarded with great wages, challenging situations, and most importantly an unlimited opportunity for advancement. I was also inspired by a CEO that has a devotion for community, family, and the less fortunate. A humble man who wants to see the world improve. That simple idea provided me with motivation. This is a perfect example of a self-made man who started with a small garage operation and turned it into a huge success. The company also excels at the most important part of business, phenomenal customer service.I enjoyed  working  there, was fired  due  to not meeting  rate, which I wasn't  informed  of a rate system  being that I never worked  in wherehouse before, they should  inform new hires of the productivity  requirement,  which they don't, so they will know what to expect, they make everything sound  good at orientation, meanwhile  never telling  new hires what is expected  of them in order to keep your jobs, there  more harder on pickers than packers, that company  is not fair to all there employees, a lot of favoritism. They are a very unfair  company  to work for, I couldn't  even appeal my termination, they made a mistake  and I wasn't  employed for 90 full days, so I can't appeal there  decision, totally  unfair, so I could never work for  them again. Wow  what an incentive for being  fired  you guys suck to the fullest.The particular site I worked at was not adequately staffed since day one. This caused a lot of strain on staff with daily tasks, reports and case load. First site I worked for was great, however the last site was severely lacking in all areas. It depends which site you go to as to the individuals success. This company is very metric driven and does not put the needs or care of the customer or associates working for them ahead of the metrics. Their processes need significant improvement internally. Otherwise it was a great experience at my first site, which is how most of the sites should be run.Awesome managers who listen and work hard to resolve any issues you have. Positive work environment and feedback from co-workers all the way down to human resource.Hardest part of my job was adjusting to walking on the cement floors for 10 hours and finding smaller items quickly.Most enjoyable part of the job was the prizes we won for our efforts and meeting my co-workers.I learned how to work hard and feel proud to finish a job to completion and that hard work pays off! I also learned great time management skills and how to be attentive to detail.One of the worst places I ever worked. I hate how they treat their employees like a number, HR is the worst ever!! There is really no structure, rules changes everyday, to many kids. Coworkers are awesome, the managers, ops managers don't have degrees in their positions. Managers have to many favorites. You really have to kiss butt to move anywhere or try to learn new positions. This place is nothing but about NUMBERS....Could be so much better, if only they cared about their employees.I recently quit working with Amazon and had many reasons for leaving. I had a difficult commute which was the primary factor in my departure. During my time there, my leadership team was always vigilant in making things better for our associates and our customers. I have had the opportunity to work with some really great people and the culture and internal advancement opportunity was great. The majority of my managers were really wonderful people that worked hard to support me and help me develop in my career.Amazon is a continuous improvement environment. They stand behind their principles, one of which is dealing with ambiguity. With stock prices soaring, the prospect of receiving compensation in the form of stock, as well as competitive wages in management roles the job seems alluring. All management roles go thru a rotation of departments, times, and days. This is an effort to round out each candidate to help them rise thru the ranks. This can be tough for anyone with smaller children. The fast paced environment can also lead to meteoric rises for some and wastelands of underdevelopment from others. Conference calls are attended by yes men and eager pleasers who aren't willing to push back on the view from the top.Amazon is a difficult place to work. My job was not stable you never new if you were going to have a job then next day. The management was very poor. They would always run out of equipment and you would have to figure out how to do your job with out your tool. Co-workers were very plesant, we would all try to keep a positive attitude and be up beat.Working at Amazon I learned a lot. I have learned how work threw difficult time in a work environment and how to suck it up and work with whom ever you may have to work with. Long hours and hard work is a lot easier with a positive attitude.Everything about this place reminds of prison, from the orange vest they make you wear, to the safety line you have to walk in, to the constantly working on your feet. Your not being paid to think just work. Supervisors always on your back, similar to a Corrections Officer. Your hard work gets unnoticed so don't try and give 110%, try 65% instead. Work is extremely easy but boring. It's hard to get fired, you pretty much fire yourself by constantly being late or not showing up for workAmazon.com fulfillment Center is an okay place to work. They work you like a dog with working long hours for minimal pay. The benefits of physically working there do not outweigh the costs associated with this type of manual labor. Amazon benefits are good for healthcare, time off, and having an annual picnic. The management always is new and don't necessarily know what they are doing, thats why there is a high turnover rate with management and other employees.There is nothing but drama, drama, drama, backstabbing at this place i mean you have a CEO who is the 3rd richest man in the united states and we work for pennies! Ive been employed almost 5 years and just this week got a 75 cent raise so i make 13.75, but new employees starting are making 11.50 to 12.00 and they just started, does anyone see a problem with that? We have a very big turn over especially MANAGEMENT most of the are kids and dont have a clue! AMAZON cares about its customers, but as far as its employees they dont care how much time we are away from our familes, terrible attendance policy, try to limit our time to go on a BATHROOM BREAK! They claim they do so much for us, we work for everything we are entitled to like our stocks we are given but we have to pay the taxes on them, so basically we are paying for them twice we have to work for them then pay the taxes on them. Our HR department is a joke they are not nice and hateful! You ask a ? And you will get 20 different answers, or i dont know i will have to get back to you ( weeks later)You cannot get full time work.  Management seems disorganized. No explanation of what a PA's job actually is so they appear to be doing nothing but staring at computer screens.  Same with management. Staring at computer screens.   High turnover rate.   No promotions, no raises.   Option to become ambassador and take on more responsibility without more pay. Training was a joke.   Weird clapping and chanting at beginning of shift. All about increasing productivity without any rewards.Amazon is an amazing place to work, it's diverse culture, meeting people from all walks of life is just a blessing. Management's open door policy, where everyone is there to support you and make your work easy, fair and achievable goals are set. your opinion no matter how small is heard, makes me feel belonged and important.Priority to safety, amazing healthcare benefits, career choice plan, outstanding maternity/paternity leave, paid personal time off etc.. i could go on and on.","10,000+",Boston,Cambridge,MA,2016-11-29T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/speech-scientist-job-cambridge-ma-us-176844136.aspx?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
17,729.0,Biostatistician,Justice Resource Institute,3.7,40.0,"This company does a lot of good for many people.  As a non profit company there are not many pay raises but the benefits are decent.  My coworkers are dedicated to helping the youth.  Management at the program level are considerate of their employees.Co-workers are great and the individuals cared for. Management expects way too much for the money they pay with little or no incentives to stay working hard and not much room for advancement. Pay raises are not guaranteed unless company profits and everyone gets one. They keep pushing more and more responsibility unless you stick up for yourself.great kids, great staff, good hours, good place, good money, wonderful management, friendly people and atmosphere, only reason i left was to stay home w kids otherwise i would still be thereI like working there been there for a while. They only thing is they don't pay enough money that's all. They really help they kids and want the best fro them. A typical day at work is a restraint if they kids don't act up. I've learn many things from working in these field, i believe people can over come anything and change and function normal. I like some and some like me, I don't like when people are doing the kids wrong so i don't like some people because of that. The hardest part is restraint. The most enjoyable tings are is the outing and when the kids are happy.Management isn't that great. The residents have more voice then you do. If you don't have seniority and you have an issue you will be heard but, they take it like a grain of salt. The benefits are great. The pay could be a little better for what the job entails.The supervision at this company sucks.  They are unethical in their practices.  Require workers to drive almost 2,000 miles a month for client care.  They force overtime but refuse to pay for it.  They expect one person to do the work of five different people.  The morale around the office is that everyone wants a new job.  I would strongly suggest not working here.I fully enjoy working with JRI, their leadership is incredible. I've learned many new skills over my decade working in the agency.I love the environment in which I work, I love the people I work for. I enjoy that changes are being made for the better within the program. The pay is not great, but that of any human service worker is not.JRI is an ok place to work, have very good benefits. The workers have a very good sense of unity. I like the fact that I'm busy all the time, if you are not afraid to work hard then, it's perfect. Flexible hours.There is no room to expand or grow within the agencies. Salary increase is non existent.The average lifespan of a JRI employee, to my knowledge, is 2 years... and this is why.  It's a job where people come to get entry level experience, may move up, but only meekly because the options are few and far between, and the ceiling is pretty low.  There are no incentives to stay.  Vacation time does accrue quickly but it maxes out at 4 weeks.  No performance reviews, no contact with management to give feedback or voice concerns, no raises based on merit or length of employment, no maternity benefits (other than those legally mandated), and the expectations are high.  Work holidays, nights, and weekends.  Be available by phone always.  If it takes over 40 hours you are expected to do it- with no compensation.  The clientele is great, most of the colleagues are too.  There are some pretty excellent training opportunities but JRI won't ask if you want them, you have to seek them out and then ask for funding.  The overhead is so much and the 8-10 VP's of JRI get paid BIG BUCKS, but where are they???Working for Justice Resource Institute has been great in the sense that it feels like coming home. It's a great supportive environment.The peer support is great and fun, energetic group of mixed age people . We share our ups and downs and collaborate to find solutions to pressing matter as a team....that's the most enjoyable part of the job. The down side of the job is lack of advancement. within the company.Worked at one of the residential schools (live and attend school on site) with adolescent females. There is room to advance, camaraderie amongst direct care staff, immense training and education given weekly, and the chance to work in both the residential and educational capacity.The pay was too low for the amount of responsibilities. They did have rather good benefits.  It was hard to move around and move up.Great team of individuals both co-workers and management. Very caring and dedicated to it's clients and staff.Lots of support.Company cared about it employees. Offered many incentives as well to make people want to work there. HR is great and management is the best ive seen in a while.I was hired as part of a management team who were tasked to develop three new group homes and behavioral programs, policies and procedures for the rehabilitation of adolescents with a variety of behavioral, cognitive, and psychological disorders.  A month into the job the funding that had been projected as forthcoming from DDS fell through.  Consequently, so did the planned management and staffing structures.  I elected to move from group home management to the position of clinical case manager so that the Assistant Group Home manager whom we had already hired was promoted to Group Home Manager without a raise in pay, but did not suffer a pay cut.  Once opened, a typical work day saw me traveling to one of the three group homes where I provided individual, family and group therapy.  My work day included case management, ensuring that all providers to include DDS and DCF were on the same page with progress and delivery of services.   I worked closely with direct care staff to ensure best practices toward building therapeutic alliances with the residents.  The most difficult part of the job was the extended travel.  The group homes were located between Chesterfield (Norwich area) and Thompson.  Often I would be called on to be at Thompson for staff training and then travel to two or more group homes for unexpected meetings mostly having to do with one of the children requiring crisis intervention.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being part of a like-minded team who practiced a gentle and consistent approach to behavioral change, and who refrained from shaming, blaming  more... or judging in order to manipulate behavioral compliance.  lessA nurturing atmosphere with a supportive administration. If you are positive and a hard worker looking to support families, then this is the place to be.I enjoyed working at JRI. They have a wonderful benefit package.The hardest part of the job was having a supervisor that was unavailable. The staff that I worked with became like family. Amazing group of men and women.The individuals that we worked with, helped create that bond.This was an entry level position as a Residential Counselor. I soon became a Supervisor. I have found this to have been the best Company that I have ever worked for. I would not hesitate to take a part time position with them anytime. Great Administrative Residential DirectorGood team work. Learned from supervisor and other coworkers through wonderful communication skills and trainings. Great support systems set in place and a community you can trust. Flexible work schedule.Good place to work, Hardest part of the job was the always schedule and transport. I moved up to management fast. Co workers are ok, I learned a lot about human services and developmental disabilities.

The management created a lean work atmosphere, that challenged us as a team. The hardest part of the job was to make our daily rates. We all pitched in as a team to make our rates, and our work experience enjoyable.Daily working with customers world wide through emails and some phone calls.Learned more about end of life management. Management changed during my time here. Too many changes all at once made things very difficult. No change over time to accommodate changes. Retired too many people all at once with a huge loss in contacts and information.Co-workers for the most part was easy to work with most of the time.No collaboration with other areas to stream line processes.Working with data collection and system conversions.Trains its leadership on ""Danaher Business System"" principles. Leaders are then expected to drive rigor, build talent that promotes the DBS culture. The result is every employee thinks and solves problems like a scientist. Status quo is constantly questioned and business model continuously strengthened.Great! Very professional staff.  Team work environment. client focused. Exemplary Client Service and satisfaction integral and non negotiable. Wonderful place to work.Good company to work for. Very busy!!Customer care has expanded many roles and back up many other divisons in the company.A typical day is answering the phine to customers calling for repairs, returns, or want to place an order.Data entry for orders, returns, repairs, etc. Creating UPS labels for returns, Entering credits.My coworkers were always friendly and helpful, as was the management team.The hardest part of my job was the stress of a complaining customer. The most enjoyable part was being on the morale team and planning team building events for the staff.I liked working for Danaher.The Danaher company that I worked at was wonderful, pre-Danaher. When Danaher takes over, although tough, the business improvements are definitely good for the business. The people, however, suffer. There is complete lack of concern for long-term employees; people who have no other skill than what they have been doing for 30-40 years. They do not want old people or old ""tainted"" culture. If you are young and ready to climb a ladder, this is the place for you. Otherwise, steer clear.management your co-workers,working with good and nice people,the hardest part of the day was trying to work with some people that didnt wont to do their job.It was a good place to work and a good company to be involved with the company is associated with Sears and machining making tools.Many opportunities to learn, but very few opportunities to advance.  Work/Life balance non-existent.  Feel like you are an infidel if you need to work at home, call out sick, apply for FMLA or handle personal family matters.  Currently, there are NO managers as all have left for other, more lucrative and appreciative opportunities.Executive leadership does not follow through on engaging employees or developing them for growth.  There is a whole division of employees who are heavily engaged in helping the business leaders implement company strategy, but are completely ignored and continuously unrecognized.This job was challenging and i love a good challenge. I found this job very rewarding. The 200 people that reported to me were an absolute pleasure to work with. Together we built a great team and became the top in this facility.Most days I would just go in and just get right in to working,  Everyone was really nice and approachable never any problems in the workplace.Working at Danaher is very frustrating since Priorities are swapped like underwear.I learned so far that even the most skillfull people can be disabled by mismanagement.A very busy place to work, I learned a lot about parts and packaging and shipping.Co-works were very friendly and helpful.I have worked with Danaher for over 2 years now and have been promoted to 3 positions within a 6 month span. I went from machine operator, to Cybron Production and Scaling, to Quality Assurace Technician. Paying attention to detail and the need to learn more than my assigned postion, I am able to advance in my knowledge and understand how the departments work together to produce the desired outcome of parts and assembly. I enjoy leaning how to make new molds, how to adjust them, and gaining knowledge of what is part does for each customer we produce for. The engineers work closly with me to teach me details of their work, so I may improve constantly on my job in quality. I work closely with management in my daily work schedule where I feel free to make suggestions or offer advice to make operations more organized or improved as well as follow instructions given to me, I work overtime and in the place of those that may need to miss a day.I work weekends when needed and other shifts when needed.Although, just an intern, they treated me very well. There was not anything particularly hard about the job, my duties were fairly easy. I enjoyed my years there.High customer service demand. Most work was done individually without much team work. Required a lot of push demands instead of being able to be proactive. Requires more communication between departments internally. Customer service is required for internal just as much as an external customer. Getting to personally talk with my regular customers in other service centers. Emails and instant messaging doesn't always work for explaining issues.Good company with good products. Ability to learn new technology and challenge yourself. work environment friendly and fun.","10,000+",Boston,Framingham,MA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/senior-purification-scientist-job-framingham-ma-us-176770844.aspx?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I enjoy speaking with and helping clients from across the country while learning new skills to improve productivity.Great company that placed me with GF to work for. Challenging and rewarding! Learned so much in a year and the role really kept me challenged. HR dept. was supportive and overall a great team to work with. Would recommend this company to work for. Overall great culture and values!I had the best recruiter and they pay well. What you see is what you get with them! I just wish they had more opportunities in my area! They are professional but down to earth.Had a great experience with Yoh and would definitely work with Yoh in the future.  There are established and have good relations with the facilities the assist.Great company, terrible clients, no control over MSP. I enjoyed working virtua/remote, not all roles are this way. The major concern was the quality of our clientsA fulfilling day at work that involves challenges & accomplishments; learning from co-workers and being a team player, with a management look up to. The most enjoyable part of the day is the entire day. I learned something new every day and had a strong sense of purpose.•	Performed ELISA technique by using plates coated with contaminant proteins in toxoid preparation in order to indicate if the antibodies to contaminants were responsible for the discrepancy •	Maintained impeccable standards in chemical inventories, safely disposing of waste and accurately calibrating laboratory equipmentDuring my time with Yoh services I was able to learn the proper procedures and methods of a pc deployment project and I was also able to learn basic pc troubleshooting skills.Extensive Corporate Organizational Transition Process to provide an accurate response. The Management Team was also undergoing a major transition process which filtered to the new employees. The communication from the Executive Team to the team members was lacking and much to be desired.I was a Recruiter at Yoh for a little over 3 years.  During my tenure the company had difficulties paying contractors on time, answering contractor questions, or generally running back office operations.  There is little advancement opportunities.  It is nearly impossible to make the Incentive Trip for producers.  Yoh is unable to recruit good talent and after 3 years I know why.they have allowed me to work with benefits. It's nice to have an Human resources, information technology, payroll and all other administrative type of people/representatives available and with separate and individually listed easy to find phone nos.this job was exactly what I was hoping it was going to be, I loved this job. we were working on prototypes and conducting experimentsA typical contract company, poor management, lack of integrity, long work hours, and no raises for one whole year or Per Diem when other contract companies were providing it.They supply good income and a steady employment. If you have an issue they will help you. They also provide good benefits such as medical benefits.Good place to work. Management responds to contact with the employee. Diverse employment market. Easy to communicate with. I liked working for them.YOH is the only contract company that has ever allowed job security including benefits and vacation time.  I would highly recommend.This temporary opportunity came at a good time. It was an absolutely wonderful job which I enjoyed. There were no benefits due to the temporary nature but otherwise, I would highly recommend this company to anyone looking for a high quality job.The HR department constantly requested and then finally SENT my Social Security Number in plain text over the internet.I cannot imagine a company not knowing better then this. Have they never even seen a TV commercial?Just imagine, people from this company setting up computers for clients?As a contracting company, Yoh made the process simple and easy to navigate. The on-boarding process was flawless, and their management staff was pleasant to work with.Staffing recruiters are professional and helpful, responding via email to questions and concerns in good time. Allows for the option of a flexible work schedule.Good pay. Does not offer health insurance. Don't get aid time off until you have been there 1 year. They do offer a pretty good 401",,Boston,Cambridge,MA,2016-11-29T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/associate-scientist-protein-analytics-job-job-cambridge-ma-us-176810932.aspx?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

44,756.0,"Lead Software Engineer, Analytics",Cengage Learning,3.6,135.0,"Cengage has a great atmosphere and a lot of great people. The Tech ed product they offer really does help students excel.My job is not like most others within the company, so the experience is different than others.  There seems to be little direction for new employees and little to no training.  The on boarding process leaves much to be desired.I loved everything about this company. I worked there for seven years and only left due to health issues and to raise my child. Would go back in a heartbeat!A sales job that doesn't want you to sale and sabotages your attempts to satisfy the customer every chance they get so your efforts are doubly hard. Bonus structure changes constantly.Credit and collections for assigned territories.  Customer service and solving customer complaints.  However, the outsourced our department and many lost their jobs.In an everchanging digital environment you must be able to change with innovation. The company has gone from a traditional book publishing company to an Educational Technology company. Loved the change but wasn't fond of all of the layoffs due to price drops.I absolutely loved the customers!Had a good time and made good money. The people are very nice, also very easy to figure out what to do. Good hours alot of over time, good benefits if you work full-time.The job is a solid job and offers decent benefits.  Work-life balance is pretty manageable when outside of rush period.  When college is in-session, it can be incredibly stressful.Management is awful and needs improvement.  When I transitioned from one product group to another after nearly 5 agents left, there was little to no organization.  The only structure that was provided for this training was out of my own accord and one of the agents who was also quitting because they were expected to do too much for too little. I was ultimately targeted and forced to quit.  I was denied a position switch as well as an annual raise over a write-up through chats, which should have been handled through HR in the first place (once again, bad management). This company is engrossed in more nepotism than I had originally thought.  If you lick everyone's boots, don't have a sense of humor over chats, and don't present ideas to management then you'll be fine.  They seriously don't like you giving ideas, no matter how good they may be.  I've received responses such as ""Why did you even ask that? You should know how it works around here.""I worked at this place for a few years .As a stockpicker  u have to pick100 cases an hr if u can't then they write  you up , after so many write ups ur in the office getting getting ur butt reamed.  Managment does what its wants to do you can express your views and opinions but you're just wasting your breath . And there is also favoritism if you are buddy-buddy with the leads and supervisors then you usually get the easier jobs. If not then u get sent to returns which really sucks cause u have to process 115 cartons per hr or u get a write up . Its all about numbers . Then there's the attitudes the drama and the morale which was at an all-time low .lm  glad I got outta there. But the pay was decent and the benefits were good.The job is fine. It's not the work. Its the lack of employees who actually work.AND apparently one shift gets water cups and bottled water and other shifts don't since those shifts aren't as important. AND one of the shifts work overtime, while another shift gets credit and ice cream trucks for a great job. AND management must have a quota for those type of employees since they say nothing. AND I have never heard a floor manager be able to talk to employees the way this companies do. Unfortunately, a few good employees have to work for the team on a shift. When you need a paycheck, that's why you continue to do it. For the entitled employees that don't have to do anything except sit in bathroom for 20 min at a time, 6 times a shift...congrats at finding a job that allows it.I love working here. There are plenty of ways to establish a career and you work with hard working people who are willing to work any amount of hours needed to get the job done so there isn't any left over for tomorrow or the next shift. It is a 24 hour company with guards who stay on site even on holidays. It is a very secure building who give those of all backgrounds second chances.Honestly a horrible place to work. Most of my coworkers had some kind of mental deficiency, including 2 kids who had Downs Syndrome, which I would be blamed when they messed up. Those who didn't were people coming right out of rehab, which yes, is good of the company to hire such people, but considering there was almost no opportunities to advance, it was not a place I would like to work at long term. Also ,they had us working more so they could show off to tour groups coming through what they were doing, rather than for doing and completing the actual work.Made lots of friends, work-life balance is great, flexible hours and can work from home occasionally. Work on a ""team"" but actual tasks are done solo.My first experience working in a smaller company.  Their technology is top notch.  I did not work here for very long it was a three month contract.  I was hired to get a large project off the ground, IE. put scope together, get stakeholders onboard with the project.Lead a team of ten sales representatives to successfully sell in the higher education market.  Responsibilities include training, sales presentations, technology demonstrations, and assist with sales team development within the team.  Other responsibilities include business development and promoting institutional sales models at higher education institutions by meeting with professors, deans & administrators.   Create and market events within the IL district for college level faculty and administrators.  Events are strategically planned and executed by the Engagement Specialist in order to help drive revenue.Cengage Learning offered me the ability to work remotely and perform my job without being micro managed daily.  I loved working for them in my contract roll.Each day my coworkers and I would be led in stretches and then to our stations, which in my case was to operate a shrink wrap machine  with one other person and/or scan boxes and apply stickers appropriately. After that we would have to fulfill specific work orders- preparing packages of books ourselves, shrink wrapping them, and then boxing them up to ship. Management was pretty good. The worst part would be the combination of the work itself with the hours worked. ""Mandatory overtime"" became commonplace. Ten hour days, 5-6 days a week of just the activities described above. That would have to be the hardest part. I worked with a lot of good friends from high school over the summer. Spending time with them was the best part of the job.Great place to work to make a difference in education industry. Exciting new products are being build here. Great place for both long and short termCengage Learning is a good place to work for innovators.  It's a casual environment where teamwork is valued.  The challenge is to stand out during tough economic times, poor sales or re-structuring.Good environment, fast paced, technically challenging, remote management, which provided some challenges for communication and direction.You are the CEO of your own territory. As an outside Learning Consultant, you work from home and on college campuses year around. Using the company car provided, a typical day starts with driving to one of my college campuses and spend the day meeting with Professors about their course materials. Acting as a true consultant, I work to find the solution that answers their needs for their course and engaging their students inside the classroom. Everyone in the company is high energy and eager to help you secure adoptions and hit your sales goal. As a company, however, their biggest goal is not just about reaching a sales goal, but changing the face of Higher Education and engaging students more than ever.",,Boston,Boston,MA,2016-09-24T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/db41ff2c-bd6e-45d8-b3b3-07322653d18f?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

50,762.0,LCMS Applications Scientist,Agilent,4.2,270.0,"I had the privilege of working with great people. Would recommend others to work here. I worked here for almost five years.Agilent is a good place to work and corporate management has secured a competitive edge in many of the products that are manufactured. The facilities are excellent.Good company to work for with a nice, clean, temperature controlled environment with a good work/life balance. Competitive and comparable salaries and benefits to other companies in the area.Agilent is a solid company with good prospects.  They have made some good business moves in the divestitures.  The management is experienced and and seem to be executing on a good strategy.productive and fun workplace with ping pong tableI had a great work life balanceGreat coworkers and work environmentHaving too many levels in organization, slow pace, silo culture.This job help me understand the importance of handling material and delivering chemicals in a timely need matter. A typical days job requires you to, cycle count weekly reagents, SAP transactions, working with buyers, planning weekly pick-ups with the vendor.I was fresh out of college when I started at Agilent and the team took me on with open arms.  This was a great place to learn and develop my career, as the entire company was welcoming and helpful.Though the work itself can become a little tedious, this is a wonderful place to work. The culture at agilent is amazing, and all of the employees are always ready to help with anything.I love my job my job with Agilent and look forward to many years of employment within the company. The company has a great work life balance..Not competitive in today's market, claims wants to be a leader in the life sciences arena. Has a long way to go!Agilent is a left behind branch of HP.  Its continuous struggle to modernize it's culture is plagued by the old HP residual culture which supports large unaccountable layer of bureaucracy that suppresses innovative spirit.  Having a great idea is not good enough and often innovator is intimidated by those who is not accountable for any relevant task.  This company culture reminds me of communism, job security means 100% brown-nosing your superior and learn how to hide in plane site with lessez-fair.  Agilent needs new leadership blood, same people cannot improve its old culture because they don't know what to change to.  Agilent needs to redefine itself form ""Old HP"" image, it needs at least to be ""New HP"".Agilent was a temporary position that allowed me to explore the world of technology. It allowed me to use my IT education to assist in helping customers. Coworker in particular spent 70% of time on Facebook, Facetime and talking on cellphone (no exaggeration) which was distressing to see especially when as a new worker I had to go to her when a question arose and had to wait till she finished.I thoroughly enjoyed my position and the interfacing with other division people that went along with my responsibilities.  An excellent place to seek employment.PRO'S: job security, training/furthering education, stock/benefits. Very flexible with schedules and family oriented. Most positions allow you to work from home at least part time which can be an added perk for most.CONS: not a lot of job advancement because their current upper management have been in those positions for long periods of time. (good for older generations, bad for the younger generations). I can't speak for all of the Agilent locations but at the Santa Clara location (HQ), there were very few employees under the age of 35 - culturally and socially different than many other large companies within the bay area.Great job which involves sales of chemical analysis equipment. The job entails calls and faxes to get service contracts.

The primary corporate focus now appears to be saving for the bottom line and not innovative product development or customer satisfaction.Acquired by Modis.  Talented and innovative technology professionals—and the companies they work for—drive today's rapidly evolving IT industry.

92,804.0,Cognitive / AI Data Scientist,Quintiles,3.9,491.0,"Great people, management is not always aware of how processes, transition, and the clinical model and career pathway workKeeping up with tested slides and properly storing them. Organizing and keeping up with lab equipment was very important as well as carrying many medical files and placing them in alphabetical order. Great environment to work in, hardest part was carefully placing the slides in their storage area having to be extremely careful. Easiest job I would say keeping up with the records and maintaining the lab equipment and assisting others.A typical work day was pretty med range as far as stress levels go and the work loads are not to bad. You go in, wait for a delivery truck to drop off your work load and then you began your work which takes about 2 1/2 - 4 hours and you are on your feet the whole time.I learned better time management and to speak up if I had an ideal that may better the business. Nothing good to say about the Management team so I won't speak on it. Co-workers are like family. The hardest part of the job was trying to remember all of the protocols to are continently being changed every few weeks. Second half of the work day which was light and some of the positive people I worked with was the most enjoyable part of the job.The job I was hired for didn't have long to really take off.  After a few weeks, my boss learned that his new boss was transferring the project we were working on, over seas and the whole team would need to look elsewhere for a position - either within Quintiles or outside of Quintiles.A company with lots of opportunity to do different work projects, however it does not afford those opportunities to those lacking experience in specific jobs, therefore not a great place for growth.Develop recruitment strategies and an enrollment plan with the investigator and site staff to meet recruitment goals in coordination with the Global Monitoring Plan project recruitment plan and conducts evaluation, initiation, routine monitoring and close out visits at each assigned study site, as outlined in the Global Monitoring Plan.Decent pay scale, benes, and bonus opportunity in management.  The lab business unit has always been chaotic without enough applied vision.  Clients generally allowed to dictate timelines.  A lot of good people on staff, but burnout is a significant problem.  The merger with Quest Clinical Labs brings potential for significant change, but uncertainty ahead, especially for redundant resource bases.Quintiles is a great place to work.Competitive wages.Competitive insurance.Many opportunities for upward mobility.Quintiles provides a stable environment within an evolving and changing market.Quintiles is a great company to work for ten years. Excellentsalary with benefits including gas card, car allowance as thejob requires travelling to physician offices in Greater Philadelphia.Team spirit and positive environment. Leadership encouraged.Job security is a plus if you make it to permanent employee, but temps are hired and fired with reckless abandon. Very little mobility in the company that isn't predetermined. Management is toxic and underhanded, with almost no transparency and a lot of ""because I said so"" reasoning that has no place in the work environment.If one makes permanent employee, be prepared to have drastically increased responsibilities over time with little to no increase in pay as a result. Low starting pay, and doesn't even increase to stay competitive with inflation.Strong background in project management, technical training, and support. Ability to balance complexity and partner with all levels within a multi-national environment. Analytical, articulate, and diligent.Management treated employees with respect and listened to ideas from the field.  They truly cared about the individual as well as the companies bottom line.Its like home, like a family you never want to leave.  I am only a temporary associate who works on the Medicaid team.  I am stationed at my own desk, with very little micro managing. Self starter and goal oriented, to get the job done.technology. work flexible.(telecommute). Client visits. Vendor services.Great name in information industry, new tools and products.largest vendor industry.Very good company to work for. The employees work very well together in getting the projects done on time with a very hard working teaming atmosphere.Good company to work for. There are several opportunities to learn and grow.

Salary was good, and the employee gym.  Everyone was excited to work for this companyWorking at Quintiles was a great experience.  They take care of their employees and help them further their careers by offering opportunities to grow and advancement.They are slow to promote but very understanding with life events and giving a good balance of work to family life. Depending on your role you work at your own pace to produce results.Pros: Work/life balance, benefits, vacation, and compensation. Cons: High turn over rate within engineering department.

93,805.0,Principal Data Scientist,Aetna,3.8,1800.0,"Aetna is a good company to start out a career in. It is a small, family owned company, however room for advancement is narrow and opportunities do not arise as quickly as one would expect. The typical day to day is a fast moving environment that includes quick problem solving, on the spot customer relations, and high attention to detail. Co-workers are wonderful, and everyone is willing to jump in to lend a helping hand. Management is supportive and always available to work with and talk to when/should a problem or need for help is called upon. The hardest part of the job is time management due to the ever changing day to day responsibilities. I enjoyed the daily grind and electrical side of my duties.I did not check the ""job security"" rating due top the fact that my tenure at Aetna/Coventry was a contractual position through U.S.Tech Solutions, Inc, .a New Jersey based staffing company. Atypical work day revoled around speaking to and contacting customers regarding medicare benefits using the computer to enter information into the data base.  I learned quite a lot regarding health benefits and members need for information.  Management and coworkers were excellent.  There were no real difficult aspects of the position and the most enjoyable part regarding  the position was theteam work atmosphere. Enjoyable work place because different coworkers would bring donuts and coffee and pot luck lunchesVery effective with time management to meet various deadlines.  Must communicate effectively with internal and external customers regarding billing, accounts receivable and installation of new customers and revisions of existing customers.  Must daily reconcile payments received for book of business and allocate to various benefits and confirm that the reported information falls within our edit limits. Must be aware of various differences in state legislations and how it applies to benefits.This experience has been wonderful with regard to my co-workers. Everyone is supportive of each other and we celebrate our successes. People take accountability for their actions rather than looking for a scape goat. The hardest part of the job has been that it is predominantly a work from home position. It would be nice to have the opportunity to be in the same room with the co-workers for projects etc. That being said, the most enjoyable part of the job is working at home. It is easier to be productive when working solo as there are minimal distractions.I entered into Aetna Better Health of Ohio with great expectations. My hope was to be with this company until retirement. From the start, I felt that management was very eager to just push me around into different categories and the right hand did not know what the left hand was doing. A LOT OF TURNOVER!!! Providers are constantly told we have your claims, appeal, dispute information, then they call back after 30 days, then they are told, sorry your information is lost, resubmit it again, this is done after 3 times in a row, going on 2 years now. Very unethical company. I am glad I no longer work for them. Benefits were ok, similar to what the members have....Aetna has been a great company to work for. I've had the opportunity to express different departments allowing my knowledge to expand from behind the pharmacy doors to adjudication and transcribing request. My experience expanded beyond the pharmacy area and into medical. Patient management was a different experiences  that I grew to understand and appreciate  the medical field. Leading me to get a degree in Healthcare administration.Been here 3 years and my department management is horrible. If your not a favorite of the managers forget about raises and help all together.  Cases are piled on you and then when you fail qa it is all your fault. Complaining to HR is useless.  Mangamemt will throw ypu under the bus to save themselves.  Health benefits are a joke. High deductible and premiums. Only perk is they offer work from homeI was with the company for 23 years. I worked in  Enrollment, Coordination of Benefits and Accounts Receivable. When I was the supervisor in Accounts Receivable my focus daily was to ensure the payments were processed timely. I worked well with my peers and coworkers. I enjoyed most was the people I worked with. I didn't have any experience  in Accounts Receivable in 1996 when I was hired and they gave me an opportunity. I learned everything and I enjoyed coming to work daily.Enjoyed working at Aetna.   Insurance benefits could have been better but, good enough.  Management was good and enjoyed  working with them.  Some of the mangers were better than others, as with most big companies.  Salaries were raised to meet cost of living expenses, which was great!The recent changes to the healthcare requirements as defined by ACA caused major changes to the plan administration and plan benefits.  Aetna's focus on living healthy lifestyles played a termendous role in the successful implementation of the changes and the positive results.  There were some negatives as well, such as reducing staff by transitioning some positions to offshore vendors.  One of the most difficult things to overcome was meeting customer demands with a much leaner staff.  Everyone works extremely hard every day and puts the members first.  On days when I was able to make a difference in someone's life by expediting a claim payment or providing information on plans which were critical in the member making the best decision for his/her healthcare needs is the most enjoyable part of my job.  Healthcare is very complicated and can be confusing to many people and they need guidance, especially in situations where the decision is critical healthwise and financially.I am currently with the company but seeking a position outside Aetna.  Promises made to me when negotiating for my hire were not kept, my role keeps expanding with no adjustment in salary, and an exemplary review resulted in about the same pay increase as an average employee. I believe there is significant pay disparity between myself and a male colleague with the same skills, education, and experience.Used to be the most excellent company to work for; however, much is lacking today in terms of production expectations and deliverable quality within those expectations. The ability to provide excellent customer service is hindered due to the unreasonable standards of production.Company will work you to the bone with volume that is completely unmanageable with expectations that you will meet deadlines.  No lunch breaks.  No compensation for overtime worked.  Upper management very slow to approve positions, even though employees are burning out from work stress.Job is very challenging everyday, I truly love my job just would like to be compensated for my I bring to the company. the most important part of the job is helping providers with members, providing the correct benefits and processing claims correctly. I have learned so much with Aetna, how to display good customer service values. Always putting the providers or the members needs first.salary employee ending job 10-12 hours/day X5 days/week,  Poor life balance. Not even enough time to exercise, though they advocate this. Since new manager took over in Spring she has not talked with staff, only my direct boss has team meetings weekly. Alot of required meetings are a BIG waste of time, new programs started prior to being tried on smaller scale, protocols in place and questions answered.A typical day at work consists of processing a minimum of 12 medical claims per hour, based on CMS guidelines. Over the past 2 years on this team I have learned a lot about the coding and how to make sure the claim is ok to pay. The management I honestly very good people, the co-workers are very friendly and eager to assist  with any  help that may be needed. The best part of my day is knowing I have did my job and did it correctly.Good work culture in the Portland office but very poor compensation and benefits. I would not like to work there again. The company expectations do not match the compensation. Experienced several issues with my benefits. Employees can't afford the health insurance the same company provides.I have learned so much working at Aetna.  In essence I group up there.  I learned how to file, to manage, provide great customer service and how to be on a team.The management I have encountered have always been fair, accommodating and helpful with your career choices.My co-workers are like family which is the reason I have been here for 27 years and 15 of them within the same unit.The hardest part  and most challenging part of the job would be the multi-tasking.  A lot of different balls in the air.  This is what makes the job exciting to me.The most enjoyable part of the job is the atmosphere of the workplace the interaction with the clients and the ability to work in a non-micro-managing atmosphere.Aetna was a great place to work.  The management is very supportive . A typical day was talking to the agents about their commissions and computer work to make sure they get it on time.-I learned how much a little extra effort is really appreciated here-The management was really good. Great leaders- Mixed emotions on the coworkers-hardest part of the job was dealing with computer glitches -best part of the job talking to all the agents. They are great..Don't work for Aetna if you can't deal with a lot of stress. They used to be a good company but terrible now. Benefits are bad and no job security  in the call center. They expect way too much and put tons of stress on their employees. It's not worth itprefer not to be negative great place to work if youre lucky to be in a good organization. last management team was disconnected worried only about numbers not interested in feedback or improvement suggestions.","10,000+",Boston,Boston,MA,2016-12-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/7673bcef-8c08-463c-b78a-5599df260f24?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Seeing how your work assisted with the growth of the company was rewarding. The company also values their employees (employee appreciation events, amazing benefit, great management).I expect this company to go out of business within the next five years. Leadership is lacking and everyone is more interested in holding on to what little they have rather than trying to make things better.The job was to gather missing information for the processing of student loan applications. No real interactions between co workers. You are always on the telephonesI don't forward to going to work like I use to.  Their use to be a lot more opportunities.  Management shows favoritism, speaking up will get you fired.Very busy, fast-paced environment that advocated a high importance of culture and teamwork.  Positive mission that supported a balance between loan payment and a personal understanding of student, post-graduate responsibility.If you like to sit around and do nothing this is the job for you. A bunch of zombies walking around.Friendly working environment. Benefits are great and many different training's offered to help us enhance our skills. The hardest part of the job,particularly in my department is it's repetitive nature. the repetitive aspect can become tiresome and directly affect how well you perform on a daily basis. I do however, enjoy my co-workers and most of my management team.As an intern, I was glad to be accepted as a valued member of a fast paced production team. They treated me as an equal and entrusted me with crucial tasks on a biweekly basis. The tasks required of me ranged from quite simple, such as making slight visual tweaks to the site, to creating the entire front end of one of their web apps from scratch. I learned quite a bit about web development and its best practices during my time at ASA and made some great connections. My co-workers were generally very helpful and fun to work with. My favorite aspect of the job was that I was able to influence the direction of the final product to some extent. As the website is targeted at college kids close to my age, I was asked to give my own thoughts on how to more effectively advertise ASA's services as well as make the site more intuitive and enjoyable to use. They took notice of every one of my suggestions and were very grateful for my input.On a everyday day basis the job involves a high level of calls incoming and outgoing where those incoming were priority over outgoing ones. Each of my co-workers work as a unit to minimize the high level of calls waiting to be serviced and with the support staff we were able to control that level. The hardest part of the job was not having enough data to serviced our customers more efficiently, while the most enjoyable part of the same job was getting the job done when customers are satisfied with their counseling.There was never a typical day. The diversity in my responsibilities, the energy of my team and the culture made being a work fun.I especially appreciated the autonomy I had in my role. My manager was available when needed, but trusted my judgment.  ASA's commitment to community allows employees to participate in events and programs outside of ASA. The people are amazing!Awesome place, mission and people.. it just need to find a way to make money and wish them the best in that.Very friendly atmosphere, as well as professional environment.Great place to work. Love my coworkers and management is great.Good company with great people.  Looking to  drive revenue through sponsorship.  Company is very profitable and is looking to create an additional revenue source.- 8 hr work per day- Front end development, includes html CSS, javaScript, JQuery and some framework like dust, foundation.- Co-works are nice- The Company has a casual atmosphere but the employees are business professionals.- Management is well informed with an open door policy.- The staff are friendly and knowledgable.- It was always enjoyable to come to work each day. Great location with a lot of public transportation options.Worked among very intelligent product management team that drove technical enhancements on a number of platforms. Enhancements created enormous growth of partner clients and overall loan volume.Nice place to work, but department don't work well together.I thought ASA was a great place to work. However, advancement was pretty much non-existent. When they decided to develop an extensive web development team, there was hiring from outside... not letting, for the most part, internal engineers gain experience. That was the biggest issue that I had. The tech experience I had when I started was what I had when I left.","501 to 1,000",Boston,Boston,MA,2016-11-30T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/d420768f-166d-4a21-a7ea-7657a54f2754?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

It is no longer about the people that work there, it is about the performance and the idiotic metrics that they wish to track and pursue.  The management is headed steadily downhill.Great place to work for anyone who likes a call-center environment. Mgmt means well and sincerely tries to assist the salespeople in meeting their goals, but the overall corporate future is very uncertain and so mgmt is forced to deal with and adapt to new major business challenges all the time. Mgmt also tries to keep morale strong with positive employee interactions and perks. Best compensation pkg I've ever heard of for call-center work.If you are an IT professionals I would highly discourage applying here. Manager is clueless and the work environment is horrible. You know that one IT Guy; everyone hates because he is an ahole? Now, imagine him as your manager micromanaging you and HR on his side. ""My way or the Highway"" Management Style. Your suggestions and professional experience will not apply to someone who is always right.I love my new job at Wayfair, especially the culture and work environment. It is a call center and comes with those inherent drawbacks (long hours sitting staring at a computer, can be noisy, etc.) but there are all kinds of incentives, activities, contests, awards, and rewards. Starting pay for CSR is more than I was making after three years at another call center. I love my coworkers, and we make it fun every day.

Very friendly atmosphere with a nice group of diverse co workers.Laid back work environment. Although alot of downtime waiting on trucks to be loaded and other employees were allowed to stand around and talk and laugh while others worked. Hardest part of job was to have to ask for a team lift every time you had a box too heavy 180 lbs or higher which was often. That's the only reason I left the job. Loved it other than the daily heavy lifting.Great benefits and compensation and initially culturally it was great but it changed within a few months of being hired become more corporate and gray.Wayfair was an amazing place to work with fabulous training and awesome people. There is a relaxed environment with supervisors and employees that truly care about the customers and company!Great culture. Not all management great, but mine was excellent. Diverse culture.

My co-workers were extremely talentated and helped me grow professionally on a daily basis. I learned how to develop long term business deals and strategies with corporate 500 companies, how to use CRM systems such as Sugar and Salesforce, write code using SQL, and to think outside the box on a daily basis.The money was great, but what an employee had to go through to achieve the level I did is a hard task.

Boston site is the smallest of the three sites.Productive fan place to work and culturally diverse. Coworkers are helpful and cooperative.

They have a great work/life balance program and they even offer a shuttle program for a low cost to individuals to ensure they have transportation to and from work.Safe place to work, nice co-worker and a great place to make friends. Don't know about benefits because I was a temporary employee.Merck has great history, surround talent people, advanced techniques, excellent research environment, good benefit; I pretty much enjoy working at Merck.A typical day would be to check all pending correspondence that required follow-up and perform those tasks, move on to new work as needed and keep an eye on needed changes.I have learned the importance of understanding different communication styles.I take full responsibility and bring issues to closure either through my own skills or tapping into more experienced management.My co-workers have always bee over a wide range of diversity.The hardest part of any job is identifying priorities and watch for shifting priorities to address them in a timely manner.I love interaction with people and tending to their needs.Durham VBF, could use more restructuring. Need managers that have experience and people skills. The culture needs to be restructured also. Work-life balance in nonexistent.

105,817.0,Insight Studio Senior Data Scientist,Deloitte US,4.0,3600.0,"- A lot of interactive with client's finance deparment- Need to grasp new concept very quickly- Requires attention to detailsTypical day at work is managing staff and deliverables in engagement and working directly with your contacts at the client. Co-workers are almost all young, and everyone is fairly social. Management varies widely depending on project. They have time-flexibility.Good Compensation Benefits, good peers and managementSkill enhancement - There are so multiple opportunities to increase your skills and the management provides many options to exercise one's talent and grow in the company.The compensation is excellent at Deloitte. The only problem is the people they hire. Young college graduates, no experience from top tier schools who thinks they know more than someone who's been in the business for years. This creates a very poor culture, many people have that bro mentality, and the females they hire know nothing about products, but they are physically attractive. It's more than the service but an image at Deloitte. Looking to leave to a company like Oracle. Advancement is also contingent on who you know.Not the job for you if you don't like to travel. Usually you'll have to travel to no name towns. Hit or miss on the project team members, could be great could be terrible. Lot's of ambiguity. Get paid well and have great benefits. Very strict promotion schedule, not at all a meritocracy. Very hierarchical with big headed partners that think they are God's greatest gift to the world.I've had a great and diverse experience in the firm. Coming in as an MBA intern, there are few if any better options. People overall are friendly, but it is a ""Big Firm"", ""Small feel"" environment, so it will largely depend on the team/engagement that you end up in. Compensation is at par with the industry, without being above or below. Overall a good place if you want to pursue a long term career in consulting.Good people and work ethic.  Would recommend to those new graduates to consider working for Deloitte.  Great access to leadership (Partners) for all questions and guidance (mentoring program).  Excellent opportunities in advancing your career and education.Nature of consulting is not for everyone but Deloitte is the best place to be in Consulting.  Deloitte is bit more conservative than other Consulting firms.  The standards are higher and the expectations are greater than other firms.Company culture is very poor, tends to be an environment where everyone attempts to look busier than they are in actuality. Not an inclusive environment at all. Collaboration is lacking here sadly. Depending upon performance review you can be ""counseled out"".Benefits were really good, PTO, health stipend etc.This company gave me a step up immediately out of college and taught me a significant amount in a short period of time. Though the learning curve is steep, the people I worked with were very intelligent, and personable. The major issue with the company, is that you will have multiple busy seasons and a small amount of work-life balance. Many people are jaded into believing that working a 12 hour day is normal. The best part of the job for me was the people I worked with, and the amount that I learned, however, it was not worth it for me to give up years of my life for quick advancement.  I learned many things in 2 years, such as: how to manage people, running a full audit engagement from start to finish, professional etiquette while travelling and managing multiple jobs, time management in extreme situations, meeting tough deadlines, running meetings, Sarbanes Oxley 404, filings such as 10-K, 10-Q, S-3, acquisition procedures, opening balance sheet, reviewing prior auditor's workpapers, etc. I have worked with companies that make $100M to $30B on an annual basis. I am glad to have worked with this company, and appreciate all that I have learned, but am happy to be leaving.Work life balance and compensation are a big minus in deloitte. People are fired more. Work culture is the best that I have seen in the consulting firms that I have worked onGreat and fun company to work for with great compensation and benefits. Overall the management and leadership is good depending on what department you work. You definitely wake up and want to go to work and I love the diversity and Deloitte is very bit on diversity.Deloitte is a great place to start your career in terms of the exposure you get to various industries, types of roles/responsibilities and opportunities. If you can find your niche, align with the firm's strategy and build the right relationships, you can go far here. Upper management is trying to improve work/life balance with a new ""well-being"" campaign, but the micro-culture on individual teams continues to be what dominates your life.Overall good place to work, Business minded atmosphere, lot of high profile clients, I would recommend this company for anyone with intermediate to experienced skillsDeloitte as a whole is a great environment to work in. All the people (peers and upper level) that I've worked with are friendly, approachable and willing to help. I never once had an issue with anyone at the firm. Deloitte offers a great benefits package (medical, vision, dental, 401k etc.).From the moment I walked in the door in the morning there was a positive vibe that the team could achieve whatever it set out to do. We were all very heads down and would achieve our work on or before the allotted deadline with the expected level of quality. If we needed to gather as a team, we did it quickly and managed to achieve the expected outcome.The environment there really fostered a learning environment. I've learned how to deal with difficult situations and how to manage upward.The hardest part of the job was the administrative ""red tape"" surrounding having security settings changed.The thing I enjoyed most was the satisfaction that the customer had with our product that it was working as expected with the appropriate level of quality.Work pressure is more. Work-life balance is not good. salary is less compared to peer companies. Not many projects are there with the company. people get rolled -off more often.Great company with a good brand. Internal workings of firm didn't meet external reputation. It benefits the practitioner to have grown up in the firm. There's no path to success for experienced hires.There was no constant, partners were moving, colleagues were moving or leaving, a state of constant flux.  Loved my job, thought it was secure as the key administrator/researcher for a team, but politics of those higher up muddied the waters.very nice work culture.Good compensationNew opportunitiesgood team spiritGood managementJob securitygood life balancegood projectsgood benefitsDeloitte has a great culture, awesome benefits (PTO, work/life balance encouragement, flexibility, etc.), and opportunities to advance through the company.I worked for 5 years in consulting and 3 years in an internal role. All 8 years were challenging, but what I experienced in each role was very different. There is a lot of pressure to perform well, which provides stress but also a lot of opportunity to learn and grow quickly - hence the high reward. Unfortunately, with this high pressure comes a lot of unreasonable expectations that hinder work/life balance and create unnecessary stress. There are also a lot of politics that you deal with - at Deloitte and at the client. Overall, it was a good place to start my career, but my health and personal relationships would probably be better if I had only spent a few years at Deloitte and left for a less stressful company.I was a Senior Consultant in Strategy and Operations. I joined Deloitte after graduating from a full time MBA program. If you weren't at Deloitte prior to business school - don't even consider it as an option. I was let go around the 2 year mark, despite receiving top performance ratings on all of my projects (6) and being told I was 'on track' to be promoted. There is no support for new hires, and when sales go soft, non-GSAP is the first group to get cut...regardless of performance. Further, the staffing process at Deloitte is AWFUL. As a new hire, you are expected to network your way into projects.  That would be all well and good if there were enough decent projects to go around, but there aren't. By my estimate, 80% of the work that Deloitte does is one step above staff augmentation - very little executive level interaction or strategic thinking. If you don't have an existing network, you WILL end up on these projects...it's just the way it works","10,000+",Boston,Boston,MA,2016-11-09T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/8d2690e8-ac81-43ea-81cd-ceaef2e5ac8f?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

The internship was challenging and was one of the best experiences as a graduate student. As part of the internship, I was fortunate to work with the chief medical information officer.Was contracted for an assignment in the AR department.  At the time, the department was not very organized but the staff are pleasant to work with.At Infor Manila, they try their best to keep their employees from leaving by keeping them engaged and interested while at work. Every month, there are activities that you can join, from sportsfests to hackathons.Depending on which team hires you, it could either be a blessing or a curse. In my case, I was part of a team with twenty members. During my tenure at Infor, people have come and go from the team but all left without burning bridges. My team loved to have fun and is the loudest of all the teams in the department but when it comes to work, we delivered. And I am proud to have been part of that team.specialize in enterprise software ranging from financial systems and resource planning (ERP) to supply chain and customer relationships Work pace changes from day to day, can be fast paced at times. Large company means resources and there are plenty. Opportunity for growth and advancement. Professional atmosphere.The ability to work with teams both from inshore and offshore with a variety of backgrounds and experiences is very rewarding. The company’s culture is based on  best practice processes thus providing the prefect ground to continue individual learning, improvement and growthThere were both negatives and positives of working at Infor.  I do miss some of my coworkers and enjoyed the work that was involved in the requirements gathering.  I feel that the BAs need to really be development / IT folks.Infor Manufacturing is a purpose-built solution suite that manages the complete manufacturing operation, from financials and scheduling to shop floor management, quality control, and analytics.It is a fun place to work. People are very collaborative here and work/life balance is the key component here for resources retentionNot micro managed, always work to do.  Wide variety of projects to get involved in.  Team effort atmosphere.  Lots of longevity with current employees, so it is hard to get promotions etc.Fun workplace with supportive management. High learning curve and honor to work with some distinguished experience team members.I worked for this company for 3 years.  Averaged 60 hours a week and never received a raise, extra time off or pay for over time.  At the annual Christmas parties we heard how well the company was doing but that never turned into anything for the employees.  Management is very disconnected from the workers.I was very satisfied.working here as a Technical Consultant.  Great benefits and great management.  Drawbacks included over 80% travel and international engagements.Infor has very good products, but management is not in alignment with projects and the PMO office does nothing to support project teams, only look for weaknesses and then does nothing about them when reported to senior managementI worked for Lawson Software that was acquired by Infor.  The 2 companies are night and day.  Lawson was a great company to work for, work and life balance.  Infor is  only interested in achieving results.  You are on 24 X 7Typical day at work includes gathering requirements from the project manager to evaluate scope. We then have meetings with the development and quailty team to dish out the requirements. At times these requirements are very easy, but hard ones are also there. We have a release party every year which is good.Acquisition is their middle name.  Not a people company.  Only true positive was ability to work from home.  Little to no change of advancement.Team building was a big part of my role. Infor was a great company to work at for three years. My colleagues and I made great team membersVery pleased to show up here each day.  Excellent environ, pleasant atmosphere, knowledgeable staff, courtesy abounds, primary aim is to ensure the clientele is satisfied beyond expectations.They had a huge translation department but have decided to not to have in house translators.Fun people to work with, great manager, sorry that they decided to extinguish the translation department.It was also a wonderful experience. That's were I learned everything about localization and translation, that's where I started my career. Have great memories of that place.Corporate environment setting. Not a lot of socializing although after work events are provide every so often.

They take US and foreign customs data, re-package it to make it searchable, build in apps for ease of use, and sell access to the data to companies from mom and pop to Fortune 500. A typical day includes heavy customer/client engagement, weekly meetings with internal teams, and a push for daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly goals. Depending on the day of the month, these calls to action can become quite motivating or frustrating. The hardest part of the job is the hours, and the expectation that you're tied to your desk. Business hours are 9:00am-6:00pm daily. Oftentimes, lunches are taken from your desk if at all. And for various reasons, there's always work to be done-which is what you're signing on for with startups. Not a downside necessarily. Just a fact. Great people, great product.

We got students pumped about Spotify and had a blast doing it.Such a great company to work for! The work life balance is phenomenal and there are plenty of perks. Such as free catered lunches, free concerts and company events.I made sure that the guards that were on the shift with me were moving around and making sure no one entered into the work space of spotify.I learned a lotSpotify is very laid back, fun people, free food.Free concerts and other events.There are no hard part to the job. Everyone do what they are suppose to.Managers are very helpful.overall the people are great!Sold Spotify premium packages to different college students.Held different marketing events on Campus. Influencing college students to pay for subscriptions was difficult, but I made it easy by being sociable and making the process fun.I loved temping at spotify, it was the best job I've ever had so far! Unfortunately it was a temporary assignment and I was not able to stay.Spotify was such a wonderful place to work! There was an ongoing sense of community between co-workers and departments, a consistent flow of information keeping us updating on the latest digital trends, and the open opportunity to showcase new ideas to peers that could further the overall advancement of the company.Spotify created many wonderful incentives for the Campus Influencers.  However, the management and organization of the position was not done efficiently.It's a great place with great culture and perks.  Employees all enjoy hanging out together and are all friends outside of work.  Mostly everyone on the ground are open minded about meeting new people and trying new things which creates a great lunch environment.  (People often eat together during lunch time and sit with different people)However because it's managed by leads in a different country, Sweden, it's often times hard to align interests between the different cultures.  Poor managers are allow to remain in senior positions because there hasn't been enough documented cases to see a trend in the poor management.  Communication about changes in the organization from Sweden to the US is often lacking and unclear.Everyone at the company works super hard but that doesn't mean there isn't room to have fun. There was countless video games, ping pong tables, couches, pool tables, snacks and so much more all over the office. I was part of the office management team and we catered to all of the employee needs.

Attending various requirements gathering sessions with SMEs.Working on Visio diagrams and swim linesFantastic culture of caring and dedication. superior infrastructure with excellent systems and training. Many perks and great benefitsThe manufacturing environment was stressful due to the ""shift wars"".  Management did not care about the workload left over from one shift to the next. The schedules were also uneven and recognition was only given to a select few. Performance was evaluated by the amount of projects or meetings an employee participated in and not the actual work performed. Promotions were given to their "" favorites"". Management was unprofessional bad mouthing other supervisors and managers in front of employees. Bad environment to work in if you are serious about your work. Lack of accountability and various  issues that were constantly overlooked. If you weren't part of the ""click"" you were pushed aside and trampled upon. Experienced employees were not taken seriously while the"" favorites"" were compensated. Completely opposite of the supposed company values.Company truly does care about the patriots and puts them first. Company is going through some changes now and it will be an interesting year.During my time Biogen Hemophilia was a mostly separate entity that was collaborative with the R & D group in Cambridge. That system had its drawbacks but it did allow for rapid decision making and clear communication within the group. We did have a management change during my tenure and while it did lead to some staff turnover, the development of the drug candidates continued rapidly and the quality of the science continued to be excellent. In the last two years at Biogen I personally spent much of my time overseeing assay development and sample testing for both pre-clinical and clinical studies. I learned about cell line development and characterization, clotting assays, SOP writing and review as well as how to implement and execute testing in a GLP setting.The hardest part of the job was meeting deadlines and keeping up with regulatory reporting guidelines that governed our types of assays.The most enjoyable part was seeing our candidate molecules go from early pre-clinical studies into human trials and have real, positive impact on patients' conditions. My colleagues were very talented, driven scientist that worked well together and were dedicated to delivering the highest quality science to back the development of life-changing therapies.A wonderful environment filled with dedicated and caring peopleTruly dedicated to helping people.

Anyone interested can purchase. They have plenty to choose from. U would not be disappointed.Could be a good place to work, but new processes changing constantly.  Multiple manufacturing and design locations, headquartered in Europe, sometimes feels like you are just a number.I was a field representative so you needed to be a self-starter and highly motivated without management telling you what you needed to do.

124,836.0,Sr. Data Scientist,Aetna Inc.,3.8,1800.0,"Aetna is a good company to start out a career in. It is a small, family owned company, however room for advancement is narrow and opportunities do not arise as quickly as one would expect. The typical day to day is a fast moving environment that includes quick problem solving, on the spot customer relations, and high attention to detail. Co-workers are wonderful, and everyone is willing to jump in to lend a helping hand. Management is supportive and always available to work with and talk to when/should a problem or need for help is called upon. The hardest part of the job is time management due to the ever changing day to day responsibilities. I enjoyed the daily grind and electrical side of my duties.I did not check the ""job security"" rating due top the fact that my tenure at Aetna/Coventry was a contractual position through U.S.Tech Solutions, Inc, .a New Jersey based staffing company. Atypical work day revoled around speaking to and contacting customers regarding medicare benefits using the computer to enter information into the data base.  I learned quite a lot regarding health benefits and members need for information.  Management and coworkers were excellent.  There were no real difficult aspects of the position and the most enjoyable part regarding  the position was theteam work atmosphere. Enjoyable work place because different coworkers would bring donuts and coffee and pot luck lunchesBeen here 3 years and my department management is horrible. If your not a favorite of the managers forget about raises and help all together.  Cases are piled on you and then when you fail qa it is all your fault. Complaining to HR is useless.  Mangamemt will throw ypu under the bus to save themselves.  Health benefits are a joke. High deductible and premiums. Only perk is they offer work from homeEnjoyed working at Aetna.   Insurance benefits could have been better but, good enough.  Management was good and enjoyed  working with them.  Some of the mangers were better than others, as with most big companies.  Salaries were raised to meet cost of living expenses, which was great!Very effective with time management to meet various deadlines.  Must communicate effectively with internal and external customers regarding billing, accounts receivable and installation of new customers and revisions of existing customers.  Must daily reconcile payments received for book of business and allocate to various benefits and confirm that the reported information falls within our edit limits. Must be aware of various differences in state legislations and how it applies to benefits.Company will work you to the bone with volume that is completely unmanageable with expectations that you will meet deadlines.  No lunch breaks.  No compensation for overtime worked.  Upper management very slow to approve positions, even though employees are burning out from work stress.Aetna has been a great company to work for. I've had the opportunity to express different departments allowing my knowledge to expand from behind the pharmacy doors to adjudication and transcribing request. My experience expanded beyond the pharmacy area and into medical. Patient management was a different experiences  that I grew to understand and appreciate  the medical field. Leading me to get a degree in Healthcare administration.A typical day at work consists of processing a minimum of 12 medical claims per hour, based on CMS guidelines. Over the past 2 years on this team I have learned a lot about the coding and how to make sure the claim is ok to pay. The management I honestly very good people, the co-workers are very friendly and eager to assist  with any  help that may be needed. The best part of my day is knowing I have did my job and did it correctly.I entered into Aetna Better Health of Ohio with great expectations. My hope was to be with this company until retirement. From the start, I felt that management was very eager to just push me around into different categories and the right hand did not know what the left hand was doing. A LOT OF TURNOVER!!! Providers are constantly told we have your claims, appeal, dispute information, then they call back after 30 days, then they are told, sorry your information is lost, resubmit it again, this is done after 3 times in a row, going on 2 years now. Very unethical company. I am glad I no longer work for them. Benefits were ok, similar to what the members have....I have learned so much working at Aetna.  In essence I group up there.  I learned how to file, to manage, provide great customer service and how to be on a team.The management I have encountered have always been fair, accommodating and helpful with your career choices.My co-workers are like family which is the reason I have been here for 27 years and 15 of them within the same unit.The hardest part  and most challenging part of the job would be the multi-tasking.  A lot of different balls in the air.  This is what makes the job exciting to me.The most enjoyable part of the job is the atmosphere of the workplace the interaction with the clients and the ability to work in a non-micro-managing atmosphere.When I took the position I was excited in the advancement opportunity I was told about, however, as time has gone one, because of department structure and the high turnover rate it is not possible to advance in the company as I expected. I have goals for my career and am not complacent at an entry level position for long term, so that is why I'm looking for other options to pursue my career.**My direct supervisor is amazing, the rest of the management team is so driven by numbers that they take little time to invest in their employees.I worked as a for Aetna/Coventry in Richmond VA. This is the worst place to work. They base performance on how team leads and supervisors like  you. They also choose poor Team Leads to train new hires. If you are not liked you will not be properly trained. `I would not recommend working for this company unless they change Manager Supervisors, Senior Techs base any advancement on who likes you.A great place to work. Great management. Good team mates. Nice enviorment. Great building. Good cafe. Bad system issues. Good place over allAetna is a great company with strong leadership.  There is a strong culture for Work/Life balance and there is always continued education opportunities.  Co-workers are dedicated and great team members.this is a good place to get really experienced in customer service, they teach you dedication, and discipline, and bonus high volume great room for advancementgood compensationgreat trainingPoor management, they don't give raises and they don't promote from within. I've worked for them for 2 years and still haven't got a raise.Good work culture in the Portland office but very poor compensation and benefits. I would not like to work there again. The company expectations do not match the compensation. Experienced several issues with my benefits. Employees can't afford the health insurance the same company provides.Management is terrible at the Southfield,MI location. In adequate training. No room for growth or career advancement. Everyone typically does their own thing. Very unfriendly and unhelpful. A lot of favoritism is shown at this location. The pay is great, but it's a stressful job at times.Aetna was a great place to work.  The management is very supportive . A typical day was talking to the agents about their commissions and computer work to make sure they get it on time.-I learned how much a little extra effort is really appreciated here-The management was really good. Great leaders- Mixed emotions on the coworkers-hardest part of the job was dealing with computer glitches -best part of the job talking to all the agents. They are great..Aetna is a good company. You would go in and know what you would need done and be able to work on your own with a supervisor/manager handy when needing assistance. Management was good to work with schedules and time off. Upper management was always changing and wanting vague information at times. Aetna has acquired many smaller companies and is always trying to convert the staff to their systems.  this is an extra burden to anyone who was bought out and leaves a lot of uncertainty in the direction the companies take.The culture at Aetna seems very member focused and company is views the job as more than just a job. Aetna is very driven in reshaping healthcare and focusing on the needs of its members. I enjoy working here because it also supports employee work/life balance. The employees feel valued and that they are contributing to the company.","10,000+",Boston,Boston,MA,2016-09-23T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/28b2b604-17b4-4bb9-a353-948fb2e14587?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=3,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

126,838.0,New Grad - Data Scientist,ViaSat,3.7,63.0,"People were friendly, the view was nice, nothing extremely exciting. Felt like a typical medium-large company. A really good place for long term, steady employment.A typical day is jumping into phone queues that are each stacked 10 calls deep waiting, because of some change that R&D made overnight without telling anybody about it.  I learned that if you try to care about every angry person calling in, you will be destroyed from the inside out by stress.  The management needs to be completely replaced.  They make up rules about performance without sharing them with the employees, ignoring written policy, and don't tell you that you have been breaking said rule until you have broken it enough times for them to have cause to fire you.  It was probably because I was making a lot more than the new people they had started hiring, and they are trying to weed out the older generation of employees so they don't have to pay as much.  Coworkers are great for the most part.  The hardest part of the job was the stress and anxiety that was brought on by just walking into the building.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the friends that I made over the 2 years I worked here.22 mile per day bike ride every day, every year.Able to work at my own, accelerated pace without restriction.Very stable product line.There's a great lack of coordination of projects, technology and strategies between divisions.  Each does its own & is very close hold about sharing.Good company. Had been contracting with ViaSat Inc in Carlsbad from Nov 2013 to till date.Would refer others to work here.Will be the leader for inflight wi-fi in the next 5 years. Culture is great in Carlsbad but needs work in the Denver office. Good people work there and they have great benefits.Very laid back but productive companyThe benefits are outstandingA lot of opportunities for employmentThe chance to work on groundbreaking technologies.Terrific company. Appreciate the ability I was given to learn and advance. I would recommend ViaSat to anyone in the industry.This was not for Viasat as a whole, this was for a Sub-Contractor company out of Alabama. They where extremely un-professional, paid in a different way every time and we had to request a list of what we had been paid for. The product I can still stand behind, it is a very good service that is fast and reliable as long as it's installed correctly. The company as a whole, I never had any issues with. Just this one sub-contractor (Bama PC Comm in association with Perfect 10) was very hard to deal with, and I suspect they are running a scheme against their installers.I was only an intern for a summer and it was my first job. But everyone was very polite, friendly, and understanding. I can't comment much more on the company culture other than perhaps it was a bit...boring? The salary and benefits were excellent though.Viasat had a great work culture, room for advancement in department as well as lateral advancement possibilities.  Great bennefits and diverse groups to work with.Great product lines.The people at ViaSat were extremely friendly and worked very hard at their jobs.  Great benefits and compensation.  Good work environment.I feel happy to work here.Good support from collegues.I feel good working with this company.I enjoy working life with this company.Its a nice time to work here.ViaSat is an excellent place to work for self-starters and people who can think creatively. Anything is possible at ViaSat, which can be difficult for people who definite rules.Layoff common without reason. Upper Manager does not know what is doing.  Layoff common. Do not give good directions. They have too many meetings.I tell you, hopeless grief is passionless;That only men incredulous of despair,Half-taught in anguish, through the midnight airBeat upward to God’s throne in loud accessOf shrieking and reproach.

You had to be self-sufficient, which I really enjoyed.  I learned to build multiple cable assemblies.  I learned the Viasat ways and their procedures.  The management had an open door policy.  My co-workers were great to work with.  They were willing to help whenever needed.  Always open to suggestions,  worked great as a team.  The hardest part of my job was managing my time with all the work I had.  The most enjoyable part of the job at Viasat  was the work and the people that I was associated with.Awesome place to work, the culture is amazing.  The work you do is innovative and fun.  very exciting place to work, always working with changing technology.I had a great time interning for this company. They offered challenging yet manageable tasks. I was assigned to a group of interns that matched my skills and experience. The work environment was very friendly and they offered many benefits such as a nearby gym, volleyball courts, and cafeteria.Unfortunately, I have been having difficulty re-contacting any previous connections.Enjoyed the working there because of the co-workers, the facilities and the culture.

127,839.0,Data Scientist,Rovi Corporation,3.5,21.0,"Worked with some fantastic people. In fact, made lifelong friends with a few of them.Had a fantastic ad ops director, not a micro-manager, but she was always accessible.I felt the salary was not very competitive. There is a chance to grow, but it's quite slim, meaning if you don't seize a chance to get promoted, it could be another several years before another you see another chance. And the thing I was least impressed with: they're willing to put sooo much pressure and work on their lowest level employees. They really want to squeeze every drop of effort out of you. Doing a good job? Great, your workload has just increased as a result. It's like they think we are robots sometimes. After working there several years, I was happy and relieved to finally resign from my position. Those are the CONS. Here are the PROS: a nice company culture. I really liked all my colleagues and even management are generally pleasant people. So much so that we were happy to do things together outside work. The company will put on seasonal events like Summer Olympic Games or a Pumpkin Carving Content so we can all just have fun and have a few drinks. Working hours are flexible, which is nice to meet your personal schedule. Benefits are pretty good (health coverage, 401k contributions, ESPP, and health club reimbursements (up to 50% of cost up to $500 per year). Time-off is very nice (4 weeks paid time, in addition to 10 holidays and 1 floating holiday). Rovi does not drug test new hires.I have worked at Rovi for 1 year and 6 months, it was a fun place to work especially my co-workers. The deadlines from the clients sometimes will make you work overtime because the contents could not wait. Unfortunately they outsourced my position back in April.I enjoyed most everyone I worked with.  Management seemed to care about their employees.  Unfortunately, their most profitable piece of software is being phased out by multiple ISP's thus creating attrition with an already thin group of team members.I am a liaison between several different entities withiinand outside network organizations. I have learned how to work with different personalities and work styles. We are able self motivate is very keen on Work/Life Balance. They promote time with your family or outside of work with then entail productives work environment.I have had the pleasure of working with a dedicated, intelligent and hard working group of people. Unfortunately, our parent company, ROVI does not value the devotion our group has to our work.  Constant micro-managing, layoffs and outsourcing have given a once proud and healthy workplace low morale and has killed the amazing culture we had.I have heard of many unsatisfied employees but that is likely due to a cultural shift after a change in CEO.  The new leadership worked hard to get the company back on track and it appeared to be working.  I worked remotely and traveled frequently.80% of my time at the company was enjoyable - talented, fun people to work with on new technologies and interesting projects.  However, the last few years were not.  IT restructured and tried to define itself as a service component but I was not lucky enough to see the final outcome if it did come to fruition.Uptight and unfair management.  Who you know not what you can do. micro management.I worked at Rovi in Tulsa, OK from July 2013 to May 2014. I enjoyed my job and my the work environment. They were very flexible on scheduling and days off when I needed them. There was a constant stream of people being let go, forced to quit, or laid off though. This created a lot of workplace gossip and a lot of unknowns.Rovi was a nice place to work. I would like to go back. Unfortunately, the division I worked for was sold and I was laid off. Their in house software development continues but it remains to be seen what comes of it. I believe Rovi is undergoing some changes and relocation at the moment. My experience there was nice.Job work / life balance is non-existent. Expected to work overtime all the time. Constantly short on staff. Unrealistic expectations. Upper management is detached from reality and their employees. Good benefits, compensation could be much better. Many positions are underpaid.Everyday is always different, very fast pace. Need more resources in the development team.Overall, Rovi Corporation is an excellent place of employment.Push, push, push - otherwise you will not succeed at selling Rovi's interactive properties.  My day would start from 8:30 AM to 5 PM, Monday to Friday. Being a Rovi employee brought out the best in me. My managers and coworkers were a pleasure to work with and are knowledgeable in both their actual jobs as well as with the mission of the company. The hardest part of the job has to be actually getting there. I live 18 miles away but the commute can take well over an hour. Besides the commute the actual job and environment are all a pleasure. The most enjoyable part about working for Rovi are their incentives for continuing to strive to be a better employee and person. They put together a lot of out of office activities and offer bonuses for producing hard work. The draw back is job security and advancement. I've known several employees that have been with the company for years only to end up leaving because job advancement is scarce.• Rovi is a great place to work; there is never a dull moment at any given day. Plenty of opportunities for career advancements.• At this company employees are exposed to new challenges throughout their careers. This is in turn helps employees learn new skills.• Very open and approachable management, all managers treat employees as peers and with respect.• Excellent co-workers make day to day work a pleasure.• Due to company offices spread across the world at times one might feels they have to work day and night, attending conference calls etc.• The work place environment, freedom to make decisions allows a person to achieve their best.I had the pleasure of working under great managers. They were really good at giving direction and guidance and their feedback was always constructive and helpful.I had awesome co-workers who were very helpful and there a really high morale with the group. Even between those that are in different departments there is a strong team bond.certify DVD and PCDVD products for Analog video copy protection.

Overall, salary and benefits at the firm are great other than the vacation policy (15 days for employees that have worked less than 5 years)Accelerated learning platform with great benefits/ perks. Think of it as a highly paid MBA. Great culture, different from all other consulting firms; will definitely develop you as a person and position you to achieve your career goals.A compartmentalized and regementalized top-down environment leading to massive amounts of inefficient effort. Decorum wins over substance. Excellent benefits.Amazing company to work with. The co-workers are smart which helps you indirectly, as you are working in a very competitive environment.The HR people need to be more pro-active thoughThis is a repeat of the last survey. I do not understand why we have to continue to do this just to place our resume online. Nice benefits at this companythe pace is very rapid. I star by having breakfast at the cafeteria, we were really spoiled, having everything we may want for breakfast. it doesn' t take long though, but it delights our day.I start the day by going over my emails and my boss s ones, organize, archive some answer or dispatch some. I follow up very closely the calendar, which is an important task to do. organize meetings that may include dozens of people fro different countries with different time zones and try to find a suitable time for everyone which can be impossible sometimes, but we make it happen. I also organize marketing events starting by the invitations, the catering and also the venue. it s so rewarding when a marketing event meets big success. I had wonderful boss, hard working, serious organized, and knows exactly what he wants and on the top of that very human.I really enjoyed working at BCG.Ultimately I needed to leave because there wasn't enough room for me to advance when I was ready, but I miss working there.  The culture is amazing, and I love the people there.High impact client workVery intelligent and humble co-workersGreat emphasis on training and feedbackAwesome network of dedicated and smart peopleThe best and most supportive co workers I have ever worked with.Hardest part of the job was trying to impress my boss, easiest was everything that came naturally to me; ex. organizing, event planning, setting up lunches, contacting vendors, emails.Most enjoyable was getting to be creative in different things. Wrapping presents, thinking of ways to make the office feel like home, décor for lunches/events, etc.Overall great company, atmosphere and  lovely co-workers. I absolutely adore working here! I couldn't imagine life without BCG. Constantly learning knew things!An Excellent top 100 company to be employed for!  This company supplies its clients with superior services and attention to their financial needs.  The work environment is superior and the professionalism is exemplary.Consultants are expected of a lot. Due to the large number of MNC clients who are operating in different time zones, client meetings can often occur at inconvenient times, resulting in long hours. Overall BCG Shanghai was a great place to intern as a start to a career due to exposure to clients, the consulting industry, and knowledgable, driven coworkersExcellent Corporate Culture, expansion plans and success rate is impressive.Management is excellent, treat consultants as employeesThis company values money over everything. Integrity and empathy are not visible within the Houston office. Next years ""best companies to work for"" will illustrate the cracks within this company.A typical day for me at BCG started with hearing about any urgent issues from my coworkers and/or checking my emails for any tickets or issues. Every day was a little different, one day I might be re-imaging laptops the next I might be doing inventory for supply orders, or providing onsite support at a meeting. Day to day varied quite a bit. Having IT support in the office, when most of the office is traveling frequently, means having to balance between office and online support. For me it was great because I enjoy fast pace work and providing customer service. A great group of people both personal and professional.  Management very supportive and fair.  I enjoyed my coworkers the most, they were the best part of my day.This company is excellent. The work was very easy to accomplish. The manager is awesome. Great working environment. I was able to come in ten minutes early so I could leave ten minutes early to go to my afternoon job.I have never worked for a company like BCG before. The expectations are high which makes you always want to go above and beyond to meet and maintain those standards.We work hard and play hard. You can't beat the benefits package. There are not many places that take care of you the way that BCG does.Great company to work for, it gives a decent push at your resume. The work environment is ideal for a productive time at BCG. The learning is based on an advanced knowledge sharing between the employees, you can clearly feel that people at BCG do not work for themselves, they strive for an excellence in business that the company represents. I'd say that is what makes BCG different than any other company you can work for, it's bigger than yourself, it's contribution to the world of tomorrow.BCG offers the opportunity to work with some of the best minds on todays most challenging business problems. The firm provides an opportunity to be on the inside track of cutting edge thought leadership. Coworkers are collegial, interesting, and driven while the management organization is very flat. However, much is expected out of employees and the hours can be quite long. The learning curve and relationships formed at BCG overshadow the long hours as a great place to cut your teeth in the strategy world or if you have the stamina, to shape the business world over a longer period of time.* Great medical benefits, lack of advancement, the hardest part of the job is separating work/life* Management is not very supportive",,Boston,Boston,MA,2016-09-09T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/68e8ffd5-da70-4691-95b8-ac42af982cc5?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=8,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

Fun and exciting.i loved the fast paced environment, kept me focused and diligent on my task at hand. learned how to effectively complete task's in a efficient manner. loved the management, when the company grew i felt like i grew too.I really enjoyed working at Rapid7. If they had made an offer after my internship, I would have taken it in a heartbeat.  The people are great and I found the work to be fulfilling.Not recommended for seasoned administrative professionals. Not an empowering environment for powerful females due to management.Long hours but a great place to work with good people. A lot of people get burned out so you have to be able to roll with the punches  and come in ready to work everyday.This company is in the best position industry from a sales perspective. Security is a hot topic these days and companies are required to own the products/ services they provide. All in all worth working here if you can keep up with a fast paste work environment.There is nearly always something interesting and challenging to work on at Rapid7. Team members are fun to work with and quite competent. The SDLC is mostly agile.Work/life balance is very good. Results are by far more important here than logging hours. There are generally core hours when meetings occur leaving schedules relatively flexible.Executive management is approachable and happy to discuss any ideas or concerns.Most days I come and leave when I feel like; as long as I get my work done and communicate my status at our daily standup, everything is good. I'm able to work from home when I need to. Deadlines are in place, but the workload is rarely a burden. The different teams are fairly silo'd, so it may be different depending on where you land. Despite high salaries, good benefits, and a flexible workplace, turnover is fairly high. I think upper management may be trying to optimize too much sometimes.Progressive company with amazing security products and services. Talented co-workers, eager to learn and accelerate their careers. Obtained advanced knowledge of security applications, best practices and compliance regulations across many industries. My position required weekly out-of-state travel. Had the opportunity to meet great people in the IT Security and related fields.I have been with Rapid7 for almost two years now and without a doubt it has been the most satisfying, exciting and growth oriented experience of my career. This is a company that embraces innovation and new ideas, encouraging their employees to push what is possible. The people are really smart and also very dedicated to succeed. There is unlimited growth potential and the executive team really invests in their groups, from learning initiatives to career planning. Oh - we also have a ton of fun here too. It is not often I would say it is ""fun"" to go to work every day, but Rapid7 makes me often feel that way. We have a high bar for who we hire - but if you are up to it you should definitely check us out.I have been here for 6 years and often get asked why I have been here as long as I have. Here are my reasons:*Love the people I work with and work for. Everyone is passionate about what they do and care about doing quality work. Also, people are not afraid to roll up their sleeves and get their hands dirty. No such thing as 'that's not included in my job description' - (and yes, this includes upper-level management - on a technical or non-technical level).*Career advancement opportunities. This is a combination from rapid7 growth and working hard. If you are going above and beyond, you will get career advancement or transfer to a department you're interested in getting into. If you are doing what's 'required,', you will not see opportunities.*Piggy-backing off bullet point #2, it's fun being part of a growing company; every year is different and presents a set of new challenges.Things I wish I could change:*Benefits are average, nothing remarkableSuch an amazing mix of innovation, culture, passion, and a work/life balance is encouraged!Run, don't walk, from this place.  A bunch of kids playing with the toy they're being paid to push. Management a joke.Great company to work for and definitely an exciting place to work.If you have a decent career, don't ruin it by gambling on Rapid7. This is the main purpose of my review, to prevent another person from making the same mistake as myself and others who joined this company.Typical day: work 10 hours at home or office. Work can be very interesting to very boring.Learned: rule engine programmingManagement: or lack thereof, terribleHardest part: not doing proper research on this company before joiningEnjoyable part: co-workersPros:# good co-workers, depending on your luck# challenging work# ability to work from homeCons:# incompetent management from CEO to manager level. Company changes directions multiple times in quarters while not hiring additional resources, there is essentially no plan. Managers need training, a lot of them are highly technical people who have been promoted to manager level too soon.# insane work hours... I would put the daily average at around 10 hr / day for the core engineering teams. I have never seen employees work this long before, of course some overtime is understood but overtime all the time?# high level of bureaucracy and back biting and little chance of career advancement.# lack of proper QA, testing is usually 2-4 days before release to publicManagement does not care about you as a person - its you, the number. Peers are very shrewd and have defined cliques (yes, it is like a middle school). Weren't there from the beginning? Don't even bother trying to fit in. Very loud music is played constantly, footballs and soccer balls are tossed around - makes having a serious client conversation very difficult. Management also does not care about customers. It's a ""boiler room"" type environment where you are required to just call without strategy and if you don't, you get reprimanded. The Sales team is one giant joke that revolves around a lack of strategy, poor management and silly rituals. Every time someone closes a deal, you have to listen to someone bang on an OBNOXIOUS gong and then you are required to waste 10 minutes high-fiving everyone on the floor. If you do not, you are reprimanded. Conversations are had at full volume, with some reps yelling profanities and making very inappropriate jokes - despite you having to call customers simultaneously. Its a company that cares more about how ""cool"" the people are that come in the door, rather than if they are quality employees and can actually perform the job. If you don't jive with their silly culture, you will be made aware of your place on the outside. Long story short, if you want a job where you have potential to advance and actually learn how to sell effectively, this is not it. Your growth will be stunted by political BS, favoritism, and an overall lack of appreciation for the individual.",201 to 500,Boston,"Cambridge, MA, Alexandria, VA, El Segundo, CA, Austin",TX,2016-07-29T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/ac794991-a3e9-499f-8675-9383a99dc671?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

135,847.0,Data Scientist Intern,"EnerNOC, Inc.",3.6,30.0,"EnerNOC goes well out of its way to make the employees happy; whether that's free coffee/snacks, gym access, resources, benefits or just compensation. They pay well, come with a good reputation and the culture at OMP is great! Where they fall short is their mismanagement with company direction (i.e. we switched our corporate focus 3 times in my less than 1.5 years). I enjoyed my time there, but definitely felt there were some dodgy things happening in the background. I would definitely recommend the company, but don't get comfortable - things could change drastically, without any warning.I gave only one star for each category based on the recent massive layoffs that completely exposed the gross incompetence of senior management and their crass disregard for the adverse effects on so many who were only hired in the last two months.  There were many new employees hired since July to work within the company's EIS offering.  Unfortunately sales were slow and costs were high so they decided to cut hundreds including those who they recently lured away from other jobs and opportunities.  Those people are left with one week's notice, upon which their insurance benefits expire and truly pathetic severance packages.  These people were victimized by the company.  Was senior management so incompetent and out of touch with the numbers that they would continue a steady stream of new hires?  Or are they really that crass that they simply did not care about what they were doing to individual lives?  Take your pick because in either case, they are not to be trusted.Great people and management.  Very fast paced environment.  Lots of opportunity to learn and grow your career.  Small enough to make an impact and meet executives.In Energy management company like Enernoc Demand Response does has tough challenges due to Government interference on rulingsGreat place to work. It was definitely a meritocracy. Good ideas were put into place.I was able to have a good work/life balance while working there. I did notice other teams where work/life balance seemed to be strained.I was able to work remotely quite a bit, but this seemed to be a team-by-team decision.EnerNOC is an extremely fast paced organization, but in some regards lacks critical experience.  Most of the staff at EnerNOC are fresh college graduates which breeds a launching ground for these folks to the rest of their career (Not necessarily with EnerNOC long-term).  This type of work force also lends itself to a lack of vested interest in objectives and goals and promotions to folks that may not be completely qualified.EnerNOC provides first rate demand response, procurement and energy management software. The company has doubled in size in the last few years and had few competitors in terms of track record, focus and quality/breadth of offering.Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. This is expected to become a big company in the energy industry.EnerNOC is by far the worst company I have ever seen.. Everyone is a phony, hard charging type of clown that would push you in front of a train for a buck. Turnover is relentless, the work is mundane and management is useless. Rumor is that the idea for the company was stolen from another student at business school, like all good ideas.You will quickly be an expert in any department you work in and will be treated valuably. It is hard to maintain a work/ life balance in some departments, however in others it is cut and dry. Ultimately I have had a great experience, and have been treated great since day one. My managers respect me and are always my advocates.EnerNOC is growing fast and is not for everyone, but if you give it a try and have internal drive- you will NOT be disappointed.Interview process was very thorough but now I see why- the employees here are truly best and brightest. Many also have major accomplishments outside work- truly work hard play hard! As an Engineer was pleasantly surprised at the major investments company is making in technology!I cant say enough about the great people! I cant speak to past but it appears the company has made a tremendous investment in ensuring the employees concerns were heard and working hard to create culture of people that are not ony challengd but rewarded and given the flexibilty to have the work life balance that was previously lacking. My goup in particular has a tremendous promotional rate- the inside sales team (BDA's) - truly a feeder pool for outside sales roles.Good place to work and reccommend it to one and all. No hassles with management, and environment is very peaceful & conducive to learning while working.I took this job because of grandiose talk during the interview about how they were going to make the world a better place and were excited to create green technology. After working there for a little while, I realized they only wanted mechanics that could add. Almost all of my time was spent in machine rooms or adding up kWhs on the computer. The company was so against using computers that almost everything we did had to be printed out numerous times. Any time a new idea was presented, it was immediately shot down by management, even if it had the potential of increasing productivity by a lot. Other companies will pay better and have you do less work in the industry. Everyone generally leaves within a year of starting here.Manager didn't know processes of their own employees, and the department had very weak procedures and controls. People don't stay more than a year. The managers have no idea whats going on.I was hesitant to join after some of the reviews online- i was pleasantly surprised to see that little of that actually rang true. YES it is a challenging environment but I was actually seeking that in y next employer! You are surrounded by talented people always willing to help (in my opinion). Also it may be cliche but it really is work hard play hard- my previous employers eliminate the ""fluff"" like social events, holiday parties, employee recognition awards- EnerNOC appears to be committed to keeping the entrepreneurial environment they set out with. Engineering has Innovation days that you only task is to come up with an innovative idea- regardless of topic- for a techie like m- that's a huge plus!It was a great place to work. Had an opportunity to research new and latest technologies. The co-workers are great and very supportive. I did not like though working alone, I am more of a team player. Management is great, and encourages new ideas.EnerNOC is a great place to work if you don't have a family and don't like to sleep. Whatever you do will never be enough.An interesting place to work. Smart, younger workforce routinely being pulled in a million directions with varying results and varying levels of engagement.Culture between depts and floors can vary. Fast paced and stressful in Engineering, but outlets exist in fooball table, kayak, and paddle boards.A great collection of smart people who are motivated to contribute to a mission-driven organization and change the way the world uses energy.","501 to 1,000",Boston,Boston,MA,2016-02-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/7acfc55a-b7a8-4fa2-9441-420da4cb9bef?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=14,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Given the volatility of the market and industry there is uncertainty on where the company where go and thus career advancement is not the easiest.I worked as a consultant, writer and video producer on a contract basis for six months. This is a vibrant, exploding and dyadic company run by the best technology and creative professionals in the business. People are valued for what they bring to the company and rewarded for excellent work. The culture is collaborative, entrepreneurial and positive. It is one of the most exciting places I have ever worked.I've had the pleasure of working at Millennial Media from the time it was about 50 employees to the joint Millennial/Jumptap company of 650 employees. In all that time I've had fantastic mentors, opportunities to advance quickly and a great work/life balance. The culture at Millennial fostered the relationships that made the employees my second family. The attitude is work hard when you need to but then take time for yourself when your work is finished. I would recommend the company to anyone.Fun workplace, but bigger Data Science focus is needed.  Also, some upper management changes would be nice in some offices outside Baltimore.Millennial Media is a great place to work, the culture is a true start up feel with energetic and intelligent co-workers.Fun atmosphere to work in, company is growing at a rapid rate, good location, causal dress.Locations are great, the industry segment is growing exponentially, and there are opportunities to grow, but it's all second place to the people.This was probably the best job I've ever had or will have. The people there are all concerned about working together, rather than worrying about only their jobs. They are committed to the people around them, and to the job at hand.I loved working at Millennial.  Since I have left, there has been a shift in leadership - this was needed all along and I am optimistic that the changes will help move the company to the next level.I built up the QA Team from 1 to 8 team members.  Went from waterfall to agile in 2 years.  The experience was invaluable and has enlightened me as to how to do it right and be successful.

140,852.0,Data Scientist,Bose,4.2,325.0,"I had been with Bose in various positions for the past ten years.  There were a few years due to the economy that caused some anxiety, but for the most part it was a great company to work for.  Due to changes in the electronics industry, the company had to restructure and my job was affected by the changes.I used to cover resellers over three states, and really learned how to stay organized and to best make use of my time.  Relationship building and gaining advocacy in short visits was critical and with my sales background was able to get very measurable results in short time periods.It was a very sad day when I had to leave Bose, but also exciting to know that I can take the training and relationship building skills with me to another career, and start the next chapter in my life.Bose is a great place to work, but going through changes due to challenging market,  Work life balance was good, benefits are good, and most management is very good.I very much enjoyed my time with Bose. The only reason I am no longer employed with the company is my location was outbid on rent from another company so we were forced to close. I enjoyed my job, interacting with my coworkers, and the company itself. Bose truly cares about it's employees and that shows through competitive salary, great bonuses and awesome benefits. 10/10 would work for the company again!Fun place to work, true ""open door"" policy at all levels of management. Company has an employee first attutude.Great products for home theater and audio.Having the ability to meet new people as they get to experience the sound of Bose, is exhilarating. I work at a company where I get to be surrounded by music and co workers that are just as passionate about music and a stress free life with the amount of systems we have to bring out the best needs of any customer that walks into our store.Working at Bose is a very positive and well built infrastructure. All the tools and resources are provided to make it the best place you have ever worked. I was with the company for 7 years. A lot of changes took place in 2015.I have worked here for many years and I would have to find an amazing opportunity to make me want to leave.  People typically live out there career at Bose.I thoroughly enjoyed working at Bose. The benefits and work environment is absolutely amazing! The company takes care of their employees and management to the highest level!Its a great company to come and work and help customers with any concers. I get to learn a lot from each customer that comes in to the storeA typical day at work seems to be more stressful than most. The company puts a lot of pressure on you to sell products, even to people who do not wish to buy.Upper management at Bose is a mixed bag. The research and development side is brilliant, while the marketing and branding departments are stuck in the 1980's. It is for this reason that the company has been losing ground to newcomers, even when Bose products are equally priced and of superior build quality.As for the working environment I can't complain one bit. It treats its employees fairly and the benefits are substantial. However, due to immobility at the top, job security becomes an issue as the company see's its ROI drop year after year.It was a great experience, just wish there was a place for me to grow in there as a young professional.The employees make this a very nice place to work.  An excellent place to network if you are a musician.  I was given the opportunity to perform in several great musical encarnations.Working for a luxury brand is a fantastic experience. Everyone is familiar with Bose, so I don't have to spend 10 minutes explaining who we are, and what we sell.Most enjoyable has to be helping a variety of different people with finding the correct product to fit there needs. Working with my co-workers is a joy and the ability to learn from them when I first started was awesome. My Manager and Regional Managers are great team to work for just great attitudes and great energy.They respect and value employees. They have solid corporate values and bring out the best in you. Since working at Bose, I have had a deep understanding of process improvement.I enjoyed working with people in great environment. I learned a lot over the years, but I miss Dr. Bose. I hope new management will make this even better place. Only time will tell.Sales is sales no matter where you go. At least you do not have to fold clothes, right? Good management willing to help. Wish they treated there seniors staff as good as new staff.New leadership has changed company direction, lack of communication has affected my opinion of company and morale.Great place to learn new skills. Learned SAP and learned a vast amount of knowledge with excel and communicating with other DC's to rectify inventory discrepancies.I worked there for 4 years in tech support. The people you work with each day are great. It was what made the job. During that time the company's goals seem to have shifted. Moving up is very difficult unless you personally know the person making the decision.My experience here was overall good. There was, however, very little supervision and management throughout the warehouse. everyone was just kind of on their own, so if you wanted to work, you worked and stayed busy, and if you didn't, you didn't, and eventually got called out. I found it impossible to move up and worked in every single department without any sort of acknowledgment. This place would be better if their sales were better, and if they paid more attention to their employees.","5,001 to 10,000",Boston,Framingham,MA,2016-11-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/ea5fee5d-622e-4bc9-b428-44ab5c53a86e?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=19,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

A lot of great talent.Overall, MathWorks is a good place to work.  The product has very loyal users and continues to grow and evolve.  The devotion of the customers continues to make working with MATLAB a fun place to work.  But as in all companies the company can also be directly effected by the direct manager.Great company to work for if you are a Developer Or Quality Engineer. Your performance will be reviewed in terms of what work you do otherwise it is difficult to survive.I am moving for my boyfriends new job and have to leave this amazing company because there is no location where I'm going.Warning: This company will ruin you for life. They are incredible and I highly doubt I will be able to find a company this amazing again.They are picky with who they hire so if you get an offer consider yourself lucky. CEO- amazing, managers- amazing, growth potential- amazing, benefits- amazing.Ok, I'm getting repetitive. I have worked for many large companies before and none compare. I am sad to be leaving and wish MathWorks nothing but success in the futureIt's a great company with great benefits, but lower salary than most other companies within the same industry. (This comes from many departments within the company). It's very hard to improve anything because it always goes back to ""it's the way it's always been"" situation. Managers don't notice/value the time/work hard working employees put in, which makes it very hard to move up within the company.Assisted with the creation of lesson plansLearned how to teach teenagers math and make it as enjoyable as possible. The coworkers were really involved into teaching others and helping me learn the process of teaching kids.I interned in Mathworks in Fall 2015. I learned about the MATLAB editor and compiler. Mathworks is a very cool place to work with.Even as a new intern, I was given a lot of responsibilities.Great people, great work. Lots of interesting projects going on. I enjoyed interning here. The main focus is on quality.Awesome place, awesome almost everything about it. Interesting work, great people to work with, and great benefits. Pay is more than industry average, but slightly less than inner-city Boston or Cambridge (like 10% less, since they are almost an hour outside of the city).MathWorks does everything it can to listen to the staff and make their lives easier. Happy people make for a collaborative culture and you feel like you make a difference.Awesome to be worked there.Working there gave me an immense pleasure in exploring my ideas and applying them in practical.The work culture is very serious and focused. The food is amazing. The benefits are good. Manager was a very co-operative and nice.Worked as a sales support intern, treated me extremely well.Great co-workers, friendly atmosphere, solid amount of work and opportunity.Atmosphere is fantastic.  However, not a lot of room for career growth.  Great way to gain experience.  Most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you helped make a difference for your customers.- Typical days at work involved team meetings, one-on-one meetings with team manager and reporting the progress every alternate day.- Hardest part involved researching  to develop the prototype for my project and debugging to get the desired result.- Overall, An awesome place to work with a fun-loving and high-energy team where co-workers are very supportive.Weak Middle ManagementThe hardest part of the job is managing the expectations of each level from management to end-users and coworkers.  Management micro-manages under the guise of collaboration. Had to play arbitrator between upper and middle management. Huge discrepancy between the role that was sold to me and the role that others expected. My manager explained role one way and my coworkers had completely different expectations of my role which caused enormous problems, then my manager was frequently absent and when present was largely unavailable to deal with infighting.HR is like a high school clique - unapproachable and doesn't have the time for anyone not in their crew.Recruiters will give you the rainbows and unicorns version of the company culture, but it only applies to one or two departments. Any other department is hit or miss.MathWorks has a strong corporate culture with variations for the team.  One can tell that the executives have thought through the mission/values and they actually follow that.  Most employees are very intelligent and motivated.  You need to find the group that you fit in because each one is different.  This also makes working across teams in a large projects difficult.I  learned a lot of team working skills, improved communication skills and had an hands on experience in working with cutting edge technologies.As a Master's student, Mathworks gave me a wonderful opportunity to learn and shape my career.Looking for a larger company that is a little less process oriented and more focused on gettingt the job done.The MathWorks has a good work culture and offers a lot of opportunities to demonstrate and develop your skills.","1,001 to 5,000",Boston,Natick,MA,2016-10-27T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/418950f3-3ab9-418f-b498-28d24fa808ac?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=20,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

145,857.0,Data Scientist,United Technologies Corporation,3.9,352.0,"When we were selling product, there were several challenging projects to work on that made each day a satisfying experience.  Today, this company has extensive business issues with no viable product offerings and no new products on the horizon.   The original workplace culture placed a large emphasis on empowering the employee, but that culture has deteriorated significantly since being acquired by UTC.UTC is a gigantic corporation.  Being so large, there would appear to be ample opportunity for career advancement within and outside of its various business units.  However, there appears to be favoritism at work, especially when considering UTC has grown as large as it has by buying other smaller corporations.  Depending on where you started in the business, your career might be limited if you were a part of one of those acquired business units (see Goodrich).The work environment was good with an emphasis on safety procedures and safe guards on equipment. I learned many manufacturing skills and what it takes to succeed. The plant employees are very friendly and helpful. The management however is not very helpful when it comes to advancement opportunities.I had an exceptional career with United Technologies.  I traveled and had experiences only one could dream of.  I was laid off in December of 2008.  I understand  being a Financial Analyst why they laid off 7,500 salaried employees.  Many had 25+ years.  They could hire younger people pay them have the wage I was making and save the company a considerable amount of money.  It's been a challenge finding suitable employment in this field.  Unfortunately, I understand this happens with many individuals after working at UTC.I worked in the manufacture and technology department building circuit boards and working the AOI machine.  We made circuit boards for a lot of technology systems.The company suffers from severe nepotism and unfortunately hires supervisors who do not really understand the aspects of their area of responsibility. Apparently quality procedures are not mandatory but merely a suggestion to some. Management is overly obsessed with charts and graphs that do not reflect actual workflow. The mindset is severely ""pro production"" and supervision will try to find ways to side step quality processes to meet master schedule.I worked at this facility prior to UTC owning it, it went through many changes started out as Gulton Data Systems, Goodrich acquired it then UTC. Management was constantly changing which I feel did not help the business at all. The business has had no failures for 45 years in space, which I attribute to the actual workers not the management. The environment could be be very stressful but we all worked well under pressure.The most enjoyable part were my coworkers...This was  wonderful company to work for and the job responsibilities were challenging.    I enjoyed all of the projects - senior management conferences, developing and help design in conjunction with an outside contractor floor plans, product displays, exhibitry and graphics within corporate specifications for our trade show booth.Typically day to day I work monitoring and supporting with issues reported by customers, suppliers and customer service. I learned EDIHQ perfectly and JDE. Co-workers helped a lot. The hardest part of job is we got an issue with JDE server side, for that I worked day and night to resolve the issue. Mapping and attending team meeting is the most enjoyable part.Work was 8 hours a day without any overtime potential.Watch out for the bait and switch of the job you agreed to start with responsibilities and  area/work type once you start at the plant. Some direct work employees are great, some had very opinionated of contract employees as dead beats and emphasized it several times.Most enjoyable part was to  correct and complete all the manufacturing process revisions 4 months earlier than what was forecasted. Documented assembly processes that weren't corrected for 4 years.Salary is good.  However, health benefits are THE WORST I've seen.  Borderline illegal.  Management is inefficient and is more focused on multiple international meetings rather than getting anything accomplished.  This is definitely not a place for someone in the Software world.  Be warned.I can't give a good review. I mostly worked in a different building than most of my co-workers. But the time I did spend with them was a very professional experience.I have learned a lot about Excel and PowerPoint as we work extensively on both of them. Though some processes need overhauling.Most employees are extremely unhappy with the culture, but stay due to financial obligations. Management does not keep employees informed on changes in the organization.Excellent introduction into the Aerospace world. Hands on experience on manufacturing of Printed Wired Boards is essential to achieve unsurpassed knowledge in the Aerospace Industry.A typical day for me is to come in, check which machinery or equipment have maintenance checks due. I perform those as a first priority given there are no technical difficulties with the machines on the production lines. When a machine goes down and isn't running that is my first priority is troubleshooting and repair. I order and submit requests for any spare parts that are needed for approval. I also complete side projects assigned to me such as researching equipment models to develop operator PM's or adjusting work spaces to make room for new equipment, etc. The hardest part of my day would be the amount of work that can drop on me all at once. It is only myself and one other technician that covers the shift so if either of us is out and multiple issues come up at once, we can become overwhelmed fairly quickly. For me, the most enjoyable part would have to be all of the nice coworkers and people I have met. Also, I feel accomplished when I repair electronics and get them up and running smoothly.At one time, UTC was a company that encouraged employees to grow opportunities and become more versatile and valuable to the company.  Over the last few years, the company has taken the focus off employee growth and  training. It is a decent place for young people to get a start, but it is not a company to stay with for the long term. Get some experience and get out.Besides what you hear in the news about Carrier and 1500 production positions being off-shored. This is a well established company in the community and is continuing to grow.This is a good company to work for with steady work and great employees to work with.  Like any company it has its ups and downs  but overall I would give it a positive rating for sure.Working as a contractor is a good foot in the door. Although there is minimum opportunity for employment directly through the company, the environment is great and the people are very helpful.Makes good engine nacelles.Management weak.Engineering weak.Co-workers are excellent.I worked on the inner fixed structure.

Great for someone who is a bachelor and has alot of time on their hands.This is an awesome place to work. great company.Great people. something new everyday is a rewarding challenge. Awesome MGT team.pay was great for this area.unless you are a full-time employee (not contract) then the benefits are non-existent. no job security. they let me go one day without notice after coming back from vacation. my termination sheet said one reason but the reason to the unemployment office was different. nissan corporate does appreciate their employees, the managers that I worked for only appreciated certain people.Great company to grow and move up in your career.  Employees were great to work with.  Management was fair. The work load was heavy and a lot is put on your plate.My review of Nissan North America is that the company continuously strives to compete with other auto makers to ensure that its customers receive the highest quality vehicles possible.Great place to work no bad reviews. Plenty of hours. Just spend more time there than home. They are a production company so you will be working at a fast pace but always be safe.Typical day here is very easy. i Park cars and greet customers who need their car serviced. From time to time i would give customers shuttle rides to their destination. One of the hardest part of this job for me was saying something silly to the customers while talking lol. Its a very comfortable environment.I work overnight on the truck frame line, and iv'e been there over 2 years. Its a challenge but I am looking to advance and move up to a better position. I have been very appreciative of the opportunity and look forward to playing a bigger role as part of the Nissan community.Very easy to work forSimple work pathsEasy to work with ManagementFamily atmosphereWarranty was hardest part of jobKnowing the Company was growingI usually start my day off around 12:30pm with a 15 minute meeting and then jump into work immediately. In the position I work in, I receive orders, and search for the parts in our warehouse. I have learned through my job, how to process orders and have come to understand the importance of time management. Also, how to properly prioritize my work day.The hardest part of job is just the remedial part of it.The job was pretty descent. It had it pros and it cons. I really think that they need a Union. They are professional but managers will fire people about the points when they had doctors excuse.Nissan provided me with opportunities that I've never experienced in any other work environment. They gave me tools and information to take with me everywhere in life making me overall a better employee.Not to much to say you will have to find out for yourself everybody experience is different. you just might leave without a headache and a car. I hope this info was usefulVery fast paced work environment. Difficult to move upward in management unless part of the Good Ole Boy Nissan club. Upper Management consists lifetime Nissan Employees and are reluctant to promote outsiders regardless of experience or performance. Excellent compensation for Supervisors and Managers. Work/Life balance is non-existent. All work and room/time for family affairs.Do not apply, they rant and rave how the ferman family takes care of their own yet treat their employees like dirt. Nissan expects you to get a rating score minimum of 965 out of 1000 or else you are failing. The surveys are based off the entire process and not just your experience with the guest so any step of the process outside of your control can fail you and potentially put your job in jeopardyManagement is great, but lots of mandatory overtime. Nissan's meaning of mandatory definitely means mandatory. Nissan benefits offer paid sick time off, but they don't expect you to use it.This is the best cilvilan job I ever had. The starting pay is great, and the opportunity to advance within the company is great. during my time there the company thrive and everybody was happy with their job. I really enjoyed the annual bonuses that Nissan provided to all there employees. The bonuses make you really feel appreciated.Great company to work for with excellent benefits 401k and retirement plan. It is very hard to get vacation time due to people having seniority have priority and can take a day at a time killing a week for everyone else.Everyday I went to work I gained knowledge. I learned the difference in ways of assembling a vehicle. The hardest part of my job was trying to make the plant more productive, meaning I might be required to request certain things moved, more hours given to employees, getting rid of unnecessary scrap or defects on the assembly line. I really enjoy the interactions with my fellow co workers.No family life, No  integrity within upper management. Hard to get your vacation time off if more than one other person is off in your zone.  Your family life will suffer from all the overwhelming overtime.","10,000+",Boston,Franklin,MA,2016-10-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/6afa70d0-ed43-44e2-9b4b-48a61fd3bd76?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

I enjoyed all of the projects - senior management conferences, developing and help design in conjunction with an outside contractor floor plans, product displays, exhibitry and graphics within corporate specifications for our trade show booth.Recently United Technologies has become infamous in the news.  It is planning on sending its last American factory to Mexico.  More on this later; I should describe my time at work first.After my freshman year of college, I got a summer job doing factory work for a relative's employer (will not specify which relative, to help maintain anonymity).  Despite the overtime, which included five weekends and normal two-hour extensions on days, I think it was worthwhile getting this experience.  We learned of each overtime at the end of the previous workday's shift.  The overtime was given because the company had a lot of orders to fill.  The company had a policy of having us work no more than two weekends in a row.I liked the assembly line and part preparation tasks, though others might think otherwise, because I could work pretty quickly at those tasks.The hardest part of my was easily the mandated overtime.  Being a recent hire, having low seniority made me one of the first to be selected for overtime.Coworkers were a bit vulgar for my tastes, but then again, they were working for twelve to fourteen dollars an hour, and my tastes are more traditional than among the general population.Ultimately, this was a fair enough first taste of work.  That was three years ago, however, and the company has changed a little since then.The highest level of leadership seems to be made of nothing but, as my relative calls them, ""bean counters.""  The transition of factories out of the United States was predominantly to reduce federal taxes, not, as many people think, to save  more... money on salaries.  The taxes far exceed the salaries.  My relative, as an engineer, enjoyed being able to work right next to the assembly line, where boards could be tried out fairly quickly and engineers could work out any problems more directly.  Apparently United Technologies has had management problems for some years now, with the executives unwilling to spend money to upgrade the facilities, but this scenario takes the cake.If I were rating the company based on my past experiences, I would give somewhat higher ratings.  As it is, I rate the company based more on how my relative feels.  lessTypically day to day I work monitoring and supporting with issues reported by customers, suppliers and customer service.

148,860.0,"STATISTICAL DATA ANALYST, SPH School of Public Health, Data Coordinating Ctr",Boston University,4.1,185.0,"Boston University is a great place to work with excellent benefits and time off. A lot of diversity. You will learn how a large university operates.Supervise, train and otherwise maintain the day to day operational effectiveness of the Housing and Rental Department. Train new personnel, update techniques for continuing employees, monitor and assign workloads, measure effectiveness and design and implement goals for each employee.Handle delicate cases, analyze confidential and personal information to effect resolution. Interaction with students, staff and superiors providing information, answering questions, receiving complaints, take orders and requests in behalf of the University.Great mentorship in a supportive environment. Some drudgery when executing repetitive experiments. Friendly coworkers. Management sometimes doesn't provide enough structure. Freedom to solve problems creatively.Although it is had to say between departments. Wanting to work there for years and finally getting in the experience was not what I expected it to be. Manager was very demanding and not understanding about personal issues or well-being.Loved working there, great staff, excellent organizagtion. Worked there for almost 5 years, reasonble pay for management but and had to resign due to very stressful commute .BU will give you as much responsibility as you can handle. No politics. Decency and interesting people to work with. Wish they were here in warm Sarasota!My overall review isn't the best due to management and how staff are treated, to the point that even directors of different departments state the same.Boston University has something for everyone. They are always striving to improve the education that is provided to their students.I learned a ton from working with the student workforce. They brought a certain energy that is unique to a University setting. I found that most of the staff shared a common goal to do their fare share while keeping it a enjoyable place to work. I was blessed to have great leadership to learn from and grow as a young professional.The most challenging part of my particular job was dealing with last minute requests, or unforeseen technical issues.It was truly a blessing to work with such great young adults and future leaders, making all the hard work enjoyable.A quiet and non disturbing environment that gives you enough time to finish your tasks and research in a timely manner. The co-workers are all highly educated and professional which provides a nice educational environment.I worked and studied at BU for a very long time. Few of my instructors were tenured, and part time faculty get paid very little. I got no monetary recognition or reward for my degrees though relevant to my job. I know that BU's Personnel office only pays salaries based on a position's demand and how easily it can be filled. Management rarely shows any appreciation for loyalty or anything else. Given the cost of higher ed right now, if you can avail of the tuition benefit, use it and leave ASAP. Otherwise, avoid BU if at all possible. They abuse workers and students while obsessing over bottom lines and perpetual inferiority to Boston's other colleges.Great place to work, everyone here is very respectful. At times it can get stressful because of the work load. You're never not working because you have to be on call but that comes with working in the IT dept.It is a great experience to practice public speaking and communication with others. Also, the work load is reasonable, professors are friendly and other TAs are nice.This job required the delivery of foods and beverages to soup kitchens and churches in the surrounding Boston area. I was able to meet a lot of generous people from many backgrounds who all wanted to give back. Working with co-workers was rewarding because we were all their for the same thing.I have been an intern at BU in the IT department for the past two years. It is a great place to work, the work atmosphere is busy, co-workers are very helpful.BUASC is a great environment if you don't want to grow. The department needs structural shift to meet the needs of the younger generation.Boston University provides an excellent benefits package and encouragement to grow within one's own department and across the institution.It is a challenging internship in many ways.  Often I lead and work with people who are much older than I am, while I am in the leadership role.  I must be able to work with a large variety of people.  Because of the necessity for the Chapel to be a safe place, there is a certain level of decorum that must be maintained.  It has been a really wonderful learning experience.Very energetic team of employees, get to learn a lot on the job. Supervisors are very experienced, and are ever ready to help with any problems that might crop up.The hardest part of this job: It is always hard to get a article to support our opinion about our researchI learned how to combine real world business with theory in books. I enjoyed to work with my Professor. He is a creative person.Working in the Medical campus' research lab was everything you would expect. No thrill and no frill. Great for those who want to have an easy full time job and go for their tuition remission benefit and get a graduate degree out of it part-time. Be prepared to work hard for juggling school and work though, it's do-able but not fun.This is a very interest place to work. Some co-workers were wonderful . Management wasn't big on communication. The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting persons from different places and dealing with all personalities.",,Boston,Boston,MA,2016-12-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/567c611d-20eb-4118-8e14-5c7866bc17ba?mescoid=1300087001001&jobPosition=27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The interns would hold weekly get togethers at bars across the city which really facilitates making friends particularly when you come from across the world like I did. The company promotes this behavior by having a Merck sponsored events. My office was very friendly, even though at times there was a language barrier they tried their hardest to include me in everything. The work was flexible, you can arrive as early as 6 am and leave as late as 8 so long as there was another employee in the lab, which there typically was. The work was at times challenging, at times interesting, and a few other times a little dull but typically it was nice. Work is done in a clean room environment, at least with the area I was in, and all the clothes are provided for you. Overall, it was a great experience.I work at Bioreliance, subsidiary of Merck.

Free in office snacks and drinks, breakfast catered each Friday.his place is run like a frat house - you're either in, or out. Extremely unprofessional management who run the company like a private and inappropriate club.TripAdvisor is a great company with amazing perks and benefits for employees.  People can move up quickly within the organization if they are smart and ambitious.  However, some people get promoted too rapidly up the organization.  They may be great at their jobs but do not have any people management skills.  Overall I think TripAdvisor is a great place to work if you have the right supportive manager.The culture is very collaborative. Colleagues are nice and helpful. Working hours are flexible. Hold you job accountable and get jobs done.good sight , my only problem with the sight is when a customer gives a company a bad review they can dispute it and have it removed it does not give a true evaluation of the restaurantI was so entitled to my cubicle. My job was eliminating duplicates which was a job that could excel could do in three minutes.I did not find anything challenging or to prove my skills at all at this job.Great company to get experience but there is little opportunity to grow. They have great benefits, great lunch options and snacks. The company is growing and with comes typical growing pains.Promises. Promises. Promises.   Promised me everything when I started .  It was great for the first few months!   We moved to a beautiful new building , lot's of perks/benefits... with not so many kind people. Respect level is low. The only employees that are seeing any type of financial gain are senior level management and senior level engineers.   You will  NEVER meet your goals.  They are unobtainable. The yearly review process is ridiculous. No pay raises.   The turnaround is huge.  A revolving door.  HR is useless.  They are so disorganized and uneducated on policies and procedures.  If I needed an answer to a question, no one had it, or they had the wrong answer. Wouldn't pick up phones.  It was quite frustrating. The Vacation rentals president was nasty and rude. As for the free lunches.. attractive but not worth the pain and suffering to work there. They do have a bar on site. These perks do   attract the younger culture.TripAdvisor is a great place to work. Smart people work there but less arrogance which makes the work environment easy to work in. All of the benefits also makes it worth while, but beware sometimes can be a bit overwhelming in terms on working a lot.The best thing about TripAdvisor is the people who work there. Everyone is incredibly smart and always pushing the company forward in new ways. My understanding of the industry grew incredibly during my time there. Surrounding yourself by smart people is always a great benefit. Free lunch everyday isn't bad either, especially if it's restaurant quality! Management has high expectations and people usually start packing up around 5:30.In general, I agree with one of the prior reviewers, whose ""Cons"" for TripAdvisor read: ""Unfocused and immature management, a highly enefficient [sic] workplace with minimal room for career advancement.""However, I don't agree with everything this person said - there's a lot more to it than that.Let's start with the negatives (bear in mind, this is based on my own experiences as well as those of others - but is not necessarily universal):1- Much of the middle management (including Directors) was promoted from within. This sounds good - why is it bad? Because they are high-performing, type A folks promoted for their individual contributions and tenure, NOT for their managerial skills and potential. This means that a key layer of management is, as the other person put it, ""unfocused and immature."" This leads to micro-management, squabbles, and general dissatisfaction - as well as inefficient hiring practices. Speaking of...2- The hiring process is terrible. Communication - which should be good, since there's a dedicated, internal recruiter between the candidate and the hiring manager - is often slow and tough come by, and there can be long lags in the process for no good reason. The recruiters are hit-or-miss - many are fantastic, but the better they are, the more likely they are to be saddled with far more positions than they should have to handle.3- Part of the hiring issue is that candidates interviewing for individual contributor roles are often interviewing for 2-3 roles at a time - contributor, senior contributor, and even associate (junior) contributor at the  more... same position - without being told. So if someone comes in to interview for a Senior Engineer role, but doesn't have the experience, they could be offered an Engineer position - but they didn't know that was an option until they received the offer. This is ""sand-bagging"" at its worst, and some hiring managers are more guilty of it than others, but the fact that it's allowed at all is unfortunate.4- Career advancement of direct reports doesn't seem to be at all interesting to the middle management layer. There's a general attitude of ""Show me you want to move up, show me you deserve to move up, then convince me WHY you should move up... and I'll consider it"" among the managers and directors, rather than them acting as allies and advocates and helping their team members advance. This could be because the company doesn't want people moving up the ladder too quickly, but it causes good people to leave the company too early if they're at all ambitious. Now for the good (and there's a lot):1- The people (individual contributors) are fantastic. I've never worked with a more intelligent, enjoyable group that loves to solve problems.2- The pay is competitive-plus.3- The benefits are extraordinary. From the fitness/gym/sports reimbursement to the travel benefit to free lunches five days a week in a brand-new, catered facility, it's clear that the company wants to make their employees happy... at least with superficial things.4- Chance to work on exciting products. 5- Equity in a billion-dollar (revenue) company.6- (and this is a huge one) Exciting brand with a great reputation among other companies, especially in the Boston area. If you succeed at Trip, other companies know that you can do the work they ask of you, and will come calling. So 2 years of Trip on your resume will get you plenty of interviews for a one-level bump at a number of other firms.I enjoy working for TripAdvisor, and recommend it to friends. It's not for everyone, and the cons can be dealbreakers for some people, but it's a good place to work with diverse, friendly coworkers, good pay, and a fun overall experience.  lessI love writing and photographing the reviews I deliver.  I have focused on Hotel's, restaurants, and things to do.  TripAdvisor is based on individuals who write about their experience that forms a consortium for a particular place.  Being a chef myself, and customer focused, I always will meet the manager, and get a brief story of what I am writing about to personalize it.  This is a passion of mine and am a Top Contributor of TripAdvisor with many badges and followers who read my reviews. I would love to incorporate my experience in the food, hospitality and travel that I have years of experience doing.On the good side, people are quite diverse and interesting, but management is extraordinarily immature and unfocused, with their products reflecting this mood: this is the mega-mammoth of travel services, and it just about sums it up - big, grotesquely uncultured and massively inefficient.Imagine having 10+ years of experience but reporting directly to someone who has half that... and has never shipped a new product before he/she joined the firm. Your days feel empty, scrambled and uneventful, and you are being micromanaged (that's what people do when they perceive you as a threat or when your product management role is downplayed to the level of a technical project manager, whereas your contribution to the product's roadmap is limited to writing technical documentation). Chances of career advancement? Zero to none.Shame on me - I should have known better: when you have shipped roughly 5 times more marketable products than your hiring manager, your career is going nowhere... and sadly, no one cares that the department is managed poorly.Ironically, if you do get hired into an environment like this and are good at what you do, you *will* be perceived as a threat unless you are good at playing dumb. Combine this with the fact that many of their developers are overseas and you will have to collaborate by getting on the phone at 4am or 9pm a couple of times every week, and this will not sit well with you unless you are a workaholic willing to work for a 10+ year old company that iterates products like there is no tomorrow but offers you zero equity in return for your  more... hard work.  That said, I am quite unexcited about working for TripAdvisor or for any of its subsidiaries (e.g., Viator) again in the future, even if my pay is much higher.  lessExciting opportunities working at a fun, lively HQ with ""speed wins"" mentalityIf you are into the culture of fast paced for the sake of fast-paced, then this is the place for you, and if you are an engineer you are in a good place, but unfortunately, the positives of this company do not extend to the administrative positions, where the Human Resources department is hostile, ineffective and joyless, and that extends outward. Benefits and compensation were great, but not worth the bad feeling you leave each day with.Company provides great salary, fun work environment along with health benefits. They focus on keeping you happy by catering lunch 2-3x week snacks, coffee etc. Amazing place to be part of .","1,001 to 5,000",Boston,Boston,MA,2016-11-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/22dcce74-385c-4999-a212-5fd72a3acb71?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I later handled up to 6 week loss which involved making payments to patient, followed up on reports from doctors care and processed accordingly.  My management staff encouraged us to advance if we proved ourselves.  The hardest part of the job was handling injured patients that wanted more or thought they needed the benefits if their claim was denied.  The most enjoyable part was knowing i accomplished goals set by myself and management team and moving ahead with career.The company is up to date and ok with colored hair, tattoos, body modifications, and self expression to generate a very relaxed culture. Unfortunately, even though certain choices are ok with dress code or the ethics guidelines, there are team members, both front line service and sales and higher ups, that will judge you and formulate a very snarky opinion and not be afraid to show it. Favoritism runs rampant in the Traveler's office, and the work is monotonous. The pay, benefits, and close friends that you get from working there can be worth it.. but its ultimately if you can handle getting paid good money to work in a high school environment.Great company, well diverse group, offer inhouse training and classes, flexible hours, great vacation, good benefits, offer 401lk, job posting available, opportunity, equal treatment, good locationsThe job has good benefits. Company is full of middle management that micro manages and focuses on outcomes that benefit the company rather than individual customers. Steady presence of '2-faced' employees. Toxic corporate culture.Great opportunities for advancement for employees if mobile. Above average compensation with bonus potential. High expectations that are measurable and achievable. Work/Life balance has been a focus in recent years but still needs balance.There is NO Work/ Life Balance. They requirements and expectations are HIGH to ""Meet"" in order to stay a float and or ""Exceed"" in your job you can't have a LIFE outside of work. Although the Benefits are great, Insurance, PTO, etc. The Compensation is minimum is any! A raise is minimum and not something that would be expected every year. There is NO incentives for accounts bound/ issued, Audits exceeding goal, and or business growth at the end of the year. This was not what I was expecting as I came from Mortgage, in that field/ procession there was incentives all the time. It would push everyone to close more accounts, follow up on the customer surveys etc. Management is also ""by the book"" there is no ""Flexibility"" We are all adults working for a ""Living"" dealing with a micromanaging manager for me is defiantly an adjustment for me. I come from a manager and team that knows what needs to be done at the end of every day. If my job is being done, goals are being met or exceeded I don't feel it's necessary to pay for a ""Baby sitter"".You are well trained in your job expectations but there are many requirements you are expected to meet. If you preform well, the compensation is generous, but if your performance is average, so is your compensation. Also, there is a clear separation of powers between upper management and employees which make management intimidating and unapproachable.Understaffed for amount of work that expected. Management does not have a clue and was unresponsive to requests for changes. High amount of turnover in our department.A typical day at work consists of communication between myself and coworkers and managers. I learn everyday that there are creative and innovative solutions to solve problems. I manage a team of appraisers in efforts to coordinate their daily workloads. The hardest part of my job would be outages in the field, however this is where I get to exercise my strategic mind set. The most enjoyable part of job is know that at the end of the day I've helped our customers!You get out what you put in. Work hard, stay away from typical office drama, be present, and be vocal about your ambitions and you will succeed.  Remember, you are there to work and put your best foot forward and it will be noticed. The management is great and always have time to help.  Bonuses are good and not hard to obtain.  You're not micromanaged as you're an adult and capable of adhering to your schedule, plus your bonus is dependent on it. There is a really great family type of atmosphere here and you will become part of the group in no time!typical day at work was going thru your case load, and figuring out which formulas or programs were needed to prove/disprove numbers that people(clients , other areas in Pru) said were not correct.

The work culture is really amazing with great focus on work-life balance. Everyone working at Travelers takes great pride in the fact that they work there which I found very inspiring. Plenty of opportunities to grow at the firm and learn from senior leaders.No work life balance. Upper Management is defiantly the boys club. You are forced out if you don't agree with them. 90 hour work week for minimum pay. Coworkers were fantastic. When I had my own personal loss I was told I could not take time off and was put on a performance plan.In reference to working within this department, you can expect to be provided unrealistic output requirements. Being paid on a salary basis, expect to spend your nights and weekends as well as any FTO time working to meet the monthly expectations. And if you do not achieve them, you will be placed on warning. Miss them again, and the verbal warning turns to written and so on until you are terminated. There is no support for newly hired employees in the profession, but who are held to the same guidelines. There has been a large amount of mid-level management turnover as well.

I have learned a lot about billing, coding and scheduling.  I have spent the past 20 years working in the medical field and love working with people.  My co-workers are very kind and professional and caring people.  I think the hardest part of my job is seeing the sickness and illness around me and knowing that there is not a lot I can do to help the patients get well.  The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing patients return and get well.Like everything, workplace has benefits and disadvantages.  The benefits are the benefits, but not an environment that i found management wanted anyone to be able to grow.I loved the patients and the position i played but the co workers were very unprofessional. however, I got hurt on the job and was in properly informed of the procedures and was unlawfully terminated so I had to leave that position with unemployment and there was and action suit and there were so many complaints besides mines.During a typical day I manage a que of 15-20 members that I reach out to too follow up on care management needs, questions or concerns. Management and my coworkers are great and very easy to get along with. I work in a very collaborative work environment. The hardest part of my day is making sure I reach out to all of my members. The most enjoyable part of my day is the satisfaction that I get when I'm able to provide quality care management.A very high paced work environment. you have to be able to multi task. The hardest part of the job i would say is keeping up with the non compliant patients. the doctors are awesome to work with as well as the nurses.BMC HealthNet Plan has a great mission to serve the underserved population of both Mass and New Hampshire, while maintaining strong institutional ethics.Worked in the operating room under the direction of my superior. Maintained and managed supplies with accuracy, to ensure sufficient supplies were readily available for patients going into surgery.

While working at Boston Medical, I've learned, how to work more with a team and how to be a medical record clerk. The management at Boston Medical was always there to assist you if needed. My co-workers were like my second family. We were always there for each other, eve outside of work. We've made some pretty good memories together. The hardest part of working at Boston Medical was trying to read the doctors' handwriting. Sometimes I couldn't understand it at all, and I would need help from my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of working at Boston Medical was being able to do something that I loved. A Medical Record Clerk may not seem of much importance to many people, but I think that it's a step closer to change lives y helping people.Great work environment. Wonderful management team that shows concerns about welfare and work – life balance of staff members. There was good comradery among pharmacy staff membersThe benefits as far as health insurance, 401k are great. But there is little room for growth and management needs trainingBusy place where you can learned from a variety cultures, great team work.  Great Medical Insurance (FREE), only pay for Dental, also my medications only cost me $5.00 at BMC pharmacy.A typical day at work is very fast pasted. Ive learned so much being in the float pool. Being in the float pool I was exposed to all aspect of patient care. From labor and delivery to cardiac patients. The staff was great very helpful. Hardest part of the job would would be low staffing. Most enjoyable everyone works as a team.I worked at a call-center for BMCHNP. a typical day at work would consist of answer calls for patients and helping them with insurance information and changes. the most enjoyable part about my job is being able to help people. my co-workers were friendly.Boston Medical Center is a teaching facility which enables employees to become familiar with different career paths while employed.I have made life long friends.  We learned and explored about different cultures.  It was a wonderful experience.  Great preparation for work.I assisted all types of members with all types of issues but I enjoyed every minute of the experience. I loved my co-workers who assisted me whenever possible.I have been with the company since December 2015. I am content with where I am at this point in my tenure with BMC. I look forward to continuing the learning of various products and services offered.I had an excellent experience working at Boston Medical Center. Gained a lot of knowledge working with top rated Oral Surgeons in the US.One of the most rewarding things I experienced was working with the patient population and I consistently had compassion for the patients.Boston Medical Center is a city hospital which gives back to its community, We are a heavily traveled hospital with never a dull moment. Unfortunately we tend to a lot of overdoses and gunshot victims. My position is in charge of calling codes whenever a patient is in distress ex: code blue, respiratory response, emergency surgical airway. We are also in charge of answering all calls that come through the main switchboard and transferring them to their destination.The first 12 years was night shift customer service, computer repair calls. Worked holidays and weekends in the emergency room lot chaos and mayhem at times The most enjoyable part of the job was the kids that came in to the emergency roomgood company to work for. they treat u good and with respect, pay is good and alot of good people to work with. I recommend this job.",,Boston,Boston,MA,2016-07-06T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/c2a354b6-2e29-49f7-a545-710b6b2d2915?mescoid=1500143001001&jobPosition=33,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
155,867.0,"Chief Scientist, Marine Mammal Surveys",New England Aquarium,4.3,28.0,"Overall the New England Aquarium is a great environment to work as a team when commutation is clear and given by all team members. Very educational even for the employees whom dont work interacting with the animals. Very informative regarding current sea life news. Everyone is nice and eager to help each other out.It was a harboring environment that allowed to grow and become a better individual and employee.By far the best management I have ever had. They care and never make you feel inferior.IT was awesome working with the rescue department and learning all about sea turtles. You get to see the rescue and rehab procedure from when they come in to when the turtles are released. You also get to help the Vets examine the turtles as well as feed themThey expect 3 - 4 days a week 9 - 5 completely unpaid work. The only benefits are free access to the aquarium and some discounts on local museums.During my time at the NEAQ I met the best people to work with they trained me and taught me so much about a non profit organization. I learned a lot about different animals. I also felt like I learned how to master public speaking because after the proper training I was talking in front of an attendance as big as 500 people. The hardest part of the job was probably knowing I couldn't go far in the company because i was so young at the time and I already went as far as I could in the company.Different then what you would expect. Strict and hostile environment. Very low pay. Alot of drama that it feels like high school and it doesnt make it stress free to come inFast paced environment and very social place. showing customers and the children a wonderful experience . Excellent place to gain customer service and make bonds with those who comeMy day start at 8:00 am, I do check all my employees that are schedule they are on time. after check all my area , I do go to my office to check email and any request. I do paper work, order, schedule, inventory, Meeting. Also I do check all area are running properly from our expectation.Worked with all around amazing people and could not have asked for a better experience as my first internship.A typical days include taking and recording temperatures, observing the animals, cleaning husbandry tanks, daily feedings, and interacting with the public whenever possible. Hardest part of the job, be willing to constantly be on your feet- running up and down MULTIPLE flights of stairs, carrying heavy things. Don't be afraid to get dirty. Most enjoyable part of the job- all of it. I loved every single part of the job.NEAQ is a wonderful workplace with a great mission and wonderful employees.  Part time jobs pop up occasionally, but if you haven't been volunteering there for the last few (or 20) years, good luck getting an interview.  Very difficult to move up or into higher or full time positions.A typical day would start by taking inventory of all the food for the day, followed by counting and distributing the cash drawers to the cashiers. Once opened for business, I'd go back and forth between the snack bars and make sure everything was running smoothly. I would help the co-workers or cover lunches / breaks when needed. At the end of the day, all the drawers were tallied up again and reports were presented to management. The hardest part of the job was having to ask cashiers to explain unacceptable negative or overage in the cash drawers.I loved working at the NEAQ, it was probably one of the best jobs I have ever had. No matter what your job title is, it's like you're a part of a family. Everyone knows everyone and regardless if you're cleaning toilets or checking PH levels, you will leave knowing a ton more about aquatic life than when you first came in. I met some of the best people while working there and it was unfortunate that I was not able to work there anymore.I loved working at the aquarium the people that you would meet everyday were everyday people. Got to work with children and teach people about what you knew. You were the teacher at the aquarium not the other way around. It was a way for me to share my knowledge with the people around me. The management and the Co-workers were awesome people outgoing and understanding as well as very helpful when you had a question!I served as a Cashier/IMAX theater host for Box Office as well as a Reservationist in Reservations over a span of two years. Daily, I engaged dozens if not hundreds of culturally diverse tourists working at the Aquarium. There is never a dull moment at this place. The Box Office management is a professional team and they make it a fun environment to work in.A wonderful mission and non-profit organization to be apart of. However, through the retirement of key management and a strong will to change overal corporate culture. I am seeking an enviornment that is best suited to match my drive and passion, verses a relaxed and passive approach to important buisness issues and development.Best place to work part time, it's fun, educational and the very interesting. I love that place and i always meet new people from different countries that come here just to study the behaviors of seaa animals.NeaQ is a fun and friendly place where you can be yourself, and with the right management, they are flexible with your hours. LOVE this job because it is flexible with schooling. Just be on time and show up to work, and you will be great!Initial time commitment required, very flexible after that. Excellent staff and friendly volunteers. Very hard to move into a paid position due to interest and a very low turn over on job openings.Telemarketing Supervisor for Spring and Summer Annual Campaign.Recruited, trained and supervised a team of fundraisers in support of the aquarium's environmental, educational and research programs.  The position was fun and challenging.   However, it was clear from the beginning that it was a ""temporary"" position.  I heard from numerous staff that they were converting the position into a data base admin position and would be outsourcing in the future.At the end of the summer campaign they released me and indeed they converted the position and outsourced. (I got calls from them from time to time).One issue is that at the time they used a database for fundraising called RAISER'S EDGE.   They brought in a trainer for a few days and we had a whirlwind tour of the system.   I never truly became proficient in it beyond basics.For 5 years I've worked here and I haven't gotten tired of it yet. There are so many amazing people as well as the beautiful animals. After all, work is a lot more fun when you get to talk about fish!the greatest job a teen or a adult interested in the world of water could ever have. Wonderful co workers amazing guest and lots of things to learn from this job .",,Boston,Boston,MA,2016-12-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/3deb975f-bd8c-4c5b-a30c-2598950ce268?mescoid=1100001001001&jobPosition=34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
156,868.0,Food Technologist,Welch's,2.8,14.0,"The company has a great culture and provides for a good work-life balance.  I am used to working in a fast-paced environment and find that a ""sense of urgency"" is lacking in the Company.Company forces overtime all the time there is no family life when you work for them. All they care about is the almighty dollar.Left a decent job with steady house to work at Welch's Northeast. As part of my job offer i was told i'do me bounced between 2nd and 3rd shift, I would also be learning a ""skilled labor"" job that paid $6 more an hr. I was also informed that they did not force you to work double. What they failed to mention was that being bounced around was day-to-day not week-to-week. Their schedule department has no idea what they are doingoing and there is no rhyme or reason to what they are doing. They don't release a schedule until the day before and will often change it several times  through out the day. Was scheduled for 2 doubles within the first 6 days I was there and they also failed to schedule in the skilled labor job they promised. When I tried to speak to hr about all these issues they simply enter responded with ""I'll accept your resignation.""It wasn't a bad place to work or anything. management and workers were friendly.  I just worked on the line keeping it running on my end.  Only worked there for three months till I went to Grand Valley State University.The company was a good place to work ,but it closed down during the hard economic times. I learned a great deal of technical experience while i worked there .Welch's is one of the best companies I've ever worked for 18 years, all the way at the top with management to my former co-workers. It was more like family. We ALL pulled together to make the company run like a well oiled machine. I've learned a lot. They will be missed!A typical day at work involved working together as a team, which we did very well.  The camaraderie was very nice.  This helped me learn how to function with a diverse work force.  The hardest part of this job was the fact that the line was very fast-paced, and it was sometimes difficult to keep pace.  However, this also fueled my determination to do the best I could in keeping up; it became a daily goal for me to be better than the day before.If management had a clue of what it takes to do our jobs, this could be a great place to work. It is a slave master mentality now. With very little knowledge in management. But most dangerously they think they know what they are doing. Some people are permitted to get away with not doing their jobs, while others are highly scrutinized. In many ways it seems like upper management is trying to destroy the company.  Very sad.I miss the job it is a good place to work I got good training their and typical day; get turnover from previous shift,carryover work etc, assign jobs for technicians, monitor production lines, optimize performance. Monitor support utilities-waste treatment, refigeration plant for bulk storage. steam supply etc. Learned; skills in dealing with subordinates, peers, higher management.Management;High performance, fast paced, focusedco-workers;great group of people, dedicatedHardest part of job; 50-80hr/wk normalMost enjoyable; developing subordinates skills, solving challanging issuesCoworkers were very helpful and worked together as a family cause they considered themselves as one. The job was easy and fun while the money earn was a lot then use to. The time of shift having to work was nice and never overwhelming surprisingly giving the fact I had no days off for a start month.Was nice to work with the people. learned new things everyday. Management wasn't very good.Strat plan initiated by CEO and COO had head count reductions and 90% closing of plant as way to increase grower proceeds over 3 years. The result was releasing good people at the corp and plant level, however not one upper mangement position at the plant level was let go! They are a prominant part of the issues that have plaqued the company (Plant) for years. Still a lot of good people there wondering how long it will be before they shut the plant down and have all product co-packed.A day at work was typically started in a shift meeting where we were informed of what was happening for our shift. Not always was the information correct but once we went to our work areas our coworkers were able to tell us what was happening with better detail and accuracy. The work environment felt like at times combative with the attitude that management was better than all the other people. While they tried to make us feel as though out opinions mattered it was obvious to us that it was a show. The company overall was a good company for the most part to work for. We had good pay and benefits but the overtime was never addressed satisfactorily and more times than not so many people with families did not get much notice or consideration when it came to overtime. What made the job tolerable was the family like group of people that I worked with. We all watched each others kids grow, we helped each other with tough family issues and laughed and cried together. I miss that the most.",,Boston,Concord,MA,2016-12-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/f2903680-4596-4a8e-b33f-ba3f5551d2d4?mescoid=1900238001001&jobPosition=35,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

178,890.0,Machine Learning Software Engineer/Data Scientist,TripAdvisor,4.0,27.0,"reat benefits - free HMO, on site fitness classes and paid yoga classes. Free in office snacks and drinks, breakfast catered each Friday.his place is run like a frat house - you're either in, or out. Extremely unprofessional management who run the company like a private and inappropriate club.TripAdvisor is a great company with amazing perks and benefits for employees.  People can move up quickly within the organization if they are smart and ambitious.  However, some people get promoted too rapidly up the organization.  They may be great at their jobs but do not have any people management skills.  Overall I think TripAdvisor is a great place to work if you have the right supportive manager.Promises. Promises. Promises.   Promised me everything when I started .  It was great for the first few months!   We moved to a beautiful new building , lot's of perks/benefits... with not so many kind people. Respect level is low. The only employees that are seeing any type of financial gain are senior level management and senior level engineers.   You will  NEVER meet your goals.  They are unobtainable. The yearly review process is ridiculous. No pay raises.   The turnaround is huge.  A revolving door.  HR is useless.  They are so disorganized and uneducated on policies and procedures.  If I needed an answer to a question, no one had it, or they had the wrong answer. Wouldn't pick up phones.  It was quite frustrating. The Vacation rentals president was nasty and rude. As for the free lunches.. attractive but not worth the pain and suffering to work there. They do have a bar on site. These perks do   attract the younger culture.Great company to get experience but there is little opportunity to grow. They have great benefits, great lunch options and snacks. The company is growing and with comes typical growing pains.TripAdvisor is a great place to work. Smart people work there but less arrogance which makes the work environment easy to work in. All of the benefits also makes it worth while, but beware sometimes can be a bit overwhelming in terms on working a lot.The culture is very collaborative. Colleagues are nice and helpful. Working hours are flexible. Hold you job accountable and get jobs done.good sight , my only problem with the sight is when a customer gives a company a bad review they can dispute it and have it removed it does not give a true evaluation of the restaurantIf you are into the culture of fast paced for the sake of fast-paced, then this is the place for you, and if you are an engineer you are in a good place, but unfortunately, the positives of this company do not extend to the administrative positions, where the Human Resources department is hostile, ineffective and joyless, and that extends outward. Benefits and compensation were great, but not worth the bad feeling you leave each day with.I was so entitled to my cubicle. My job was eliminating duplicates which was a job that could excel could do in three minutes.I did not find anything challenging or to prove my skills at all at this job.In general, I agree with one of the prior reviewers, whose ""Cons"" for TripAdvisor read: ""Unfocused and immature management, a highly enefficient [sic] workplace with minimal room for career advancement.""However, I don't agree with everything this person said - there's a lot more to it than that.Let's start with the negatives (bear in mind, this is based on my own experiences as well as those of others - but is not necessarily universal):1- Much of the middle management (including Directors) was promoted from within. This sounds good - why is it bad? Because they are high-performing, type A folks promoted for their individual contributions and tenure, NOT for their managerial skills and potential. This means that a key layer of management is, as the other person put it, ""unfocused and immature."" This leads to micro-management, squabbles, and general dissatisfaction - as well as inefficient hiring practices. Speaking of...2- The hiring process is terrible. Communication - which should be good, since there's a dedicated, internal recruiter between the candidate and the hiring manager - is often slow and tough come by, and there can be long lags in the process for no good reason. The recruiters are hit-or-miss - many are fantastic, but the better they are, the more likely they are to be saddled with far more positions than they should have to handle.3- Part of the hiring issue is that candidates interviewing for individual contributor roles are often interviewing for 2-3 roles at a time - contributor, senior contributor, and even associate (junior) contributor at the  more... same position - without being told. So if someone comes in to interview for a Senior Engineer role, but doesn't have the experience, they could be offered an Engineer position - but they didn't know that was an option until they received the offer. This is ""sand-bagging"" at its worst, and some hiring managers are more guilty of it than others, but the fact that it's allowed at all is unfortunate.4- Career advancement of direct reports doesn't seem to be at all interesting to the middle management layer. There's a general attitude of ""Show me you want to move up, show me you deserve to move up, then convince me WHY you should move up... and I'll consider it"" among the managers and directors, rather than them acting as allies and advocates and helping their team members advance. This could be because the company doesn't want people moving up the ladder too quickly, but it causes good people to leave the company too early if they're at all ambitious. Now for the good (and there's a lot):1- The people (individual contributors) are fantastic. I've never worked with a more intelligent, enjoyable group that loves to solve problems.2- The pay is competitive-plus.3- The benefits are extraordinary. From the fitness/gym/sports reimbursement to the travel benefit to free lunches five days a week in a brand-new, catered facility, it's clear that the company wants to make their employees happy... at least with superficial things.4- Chance to work on exciting products. 5- Equity in a billion-dollar (revenue) company.6- (and this is a huge one) Exciting brand with a great reputation among other companies, especially in the Boston area. If you succeed at Trip, other companies know that you can do the work they ask of you, and will come calling. So 2 years of Trip on your resume will get you plenty of interviews for a one-level bump at a number of other firms.I enjoy working for TripAdvisor, and recommend it to friends. It's not for everyone, and the cons can be dealbreakers for some people, but it's a good place to work with diverse, friendly coworkers, good pay, and a fun overall experience.  lessCompany provides great salary, fun work environment along with health benefits. They focus on keeping you happy by catering lunch 2-3x week snacks, coffee etc. Amazing place to be part of .The best thing about TripAdvisor is the people who work there. Everyone is incredibly smart and always pushing the company forward in new ways. My understanding of the industry grew incredibly during my time there. Surrounding yourself by smart people is always a great benefit. Free lunch everyday isn't bad either, especially if it's restaurant quality! Management has high expectations and people usually start packing up around 5:30.I love writing and photographing the reviews I deliver.  I have focused on Hotel's, restaurants, and things to do.  TripAdvisor is based on individuals who write about their experience that forms a consortium for a particular place.  Being a chef myself, and customer focused, I always will meet the manager, and get a brief story of what I am writing about to personalize it.  This is a passion of mine and am a Top Contributor of TripAdvisor with many badges and followers who read my reviews. I would love to incorporate my experience in the food, hospitality and travel that I have years of experience doing.On the good side, people are quite diverse and interesting, but management is extraordinarily immature and unfocused, with their products reflecting this mood: this is the mega-mammoth of travel services, and it just about sums it up - big, grotesquely uncultured and massively inefficient.Imagine having 10+ years of experience but reporting directly to someone who has half that... and has never shipped a new product before he/she joined the firm. Your days feel empty, scrambled and uneventful, and you are being micromanaged (that's what people do when they perceive you as a threat or when your product management role is downplayed to the level of a technical project manager, whereas your contribution to the product's roadmap is limited to writing technical documentation). Chances of career advancement? Zero to none.Shame on me - I should have known better: when you have shipped roughly 5 times more marketable products than your hiring manager, your career is going nowhere... and sadly, no one cares that the department is managed poorly.Ironically, if you do get hired into an environment like this and are good at what you do, you *will* be perceived as a threat unless you are good at playing dumb. Combine this with the fact that many of their developers are overseas and you will have to collaborate by getting on the phone at 4am or 9pm a couple of times every week, and this will not sit well with you unless you are a workaholic willing to work for a 10+ year old company that iterates products like there is no tomorrow but offers you zero equity in return for your  more... hard work.  That said, I am quite unexcited about working for TripAdvisor or for any of its subsidiaries (e.g., Viator) again in the future, even if my pay is much higher.  lessExciting opportunities working at a fun, lively HQ with ""speed wins"" mentality","1,001 to 5,000",Boston,Needham,MA,2016-10-18T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/0cd64b23-2266-49fa-b5b9-d312117e2bdd?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=22,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

My job is a manager in the manufacturing facility that is being closed and to be honest, I am surprised at the amount of transparency in the closure process and the amount of services that are being provided.  They have excelled in that regard.I enjoyed my time at Biogen.  The work/life balance was great.  The people were fantastic, and, you worked with MS patients which made the job worthwhile.  You were helping people.- A typical work day was productive- Always learning new things to improve my job - Management very understanding- Coworkers willing to give advice and help when neededBiogen prides itself on working fearlessly and changing lives.

Right now they are running a skeleton crew. Need to work on being so top heavyGreat place to work excellent supervisor  family friendly allowed to learn new skills and flexible schedule.  The hardest part of the job was knowing it will end temp.Excellent company to work for. Very considerate about work life balance. This company also offers excellent benefits. This job also offers great opportunity to help people.Great environment, pay and benefits.  It was close to home at the time.  Until most of company moved to Weston which is reason I left, I was used to not having a commute and walking a mile to work.If the company did not move I probably would have stayed there.Attending various meetings. working on BRD, FRD. Attending various requirements gathering sessions with SMEs.Working on Visio diagrams and swim linesFantastic culture of caring and dedication. superior infrastructure with excellent systems and training. Many perks and great benefitsThe manufacturing environment was stressful due to the ""shift wars"".  Management did not care about the workload left over from one shift to the next. The schedules were also uneven and recognition was only given to a select few. Performance was evaluated by the amount of projects or meetings an employee participated in and not the actual work performed. Promotions were given to their "" favorites"". Management was unprofessional bad mouthing other supervisors and managers in front of employees. Bad environment to work in if you are serious about your work. Lack of accountability and various  issues that were constantly overlooked. If you weren't part of the ""click"" you were pushed aside and trampled upon. Experienced employees were not taken seriously while the"" favorites"" were compensated. Completely opposite of the supposed company values.Company truly does care about the patriots and puts them first. Company is going through some changes now and it will be an interesting year.During my time Biogen Hemophilia was a mostly separate entity that was collaborative with the R & D group in Cambridge. That system had its drawbacks but it did allow for rapid decision making and clear communication within the group. We did have a management change during my tenure and while it did lead to some staff turnover, the development of the drug candidates continued rapidly and the quality of the science continued to be excellent. In the last two years at Biogen I personally spent much of my time overseeing assay development and sample testing for both pre-clinical and clinical studies. I learned about cell line development and characterization, clotting assays, SOP writing and review as well as how to implement and execute testing in a GLP setting.The hardest part of the job was meeting deadlines and keeping up with regulatory reporting guidelines that governed our types of assays.The most enjoyable part was seeing our candidate molecules go from early pre-clinical studies into human trials and have real, positive impact on patients' conditions. My colleagues were very talented, driven scientist that worked well together and were dedicated to delivering the highest quality science to back the development of life-changing therapies.A wonderful environment filled with dedicated and caring peopleTruly dedicated to helping people. Wonderful pipeline.Awesome schedules and work from home policy along with flexible telecommute schedule. Scientists and employees work hard for lives that matter.Very work-life balance and good benefits. People show respect to each other a lot. Managers care about the team as well. A lot of team building activities going on.I enjoyed the time I had there. Working at Biogen was a good type of culture and management was decent but could be better.Complete your assignments on or before time and enjoy your working lifeRandom POC's help to learn Depth of Business and TechnologyFree to try and use technology that support Biogen businessManagement is good if you work wellCoworkers are supportive and cooprative","5,001 to 10,000",Boston,Cambridge,MA,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/a2a347f1-b6c3-4607-9d7b-ebafd39ac974?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=26,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Management tries to retain employees, nice to work forcoworkers are hard working.Hardest part of job is never knowing when you can go home.keep production line running in a efficient way that met all guidelines, help produce product fast and efficiently, as weel as package, box, and stack correctly on palletsDon't get paid enough for the work. To many hours and   Employees aren't treated equally. Don't want to pay enough money for work.askedWages were better than any job I've had in many years of nursing. Hostile and unsafe work environment. Worked sometimes 24 hours/day. Never got lunch breaks. Managers threaten your job if you tried to stand up for yourself and made you work 18-24 hours/day with no breaks. Treated like a piece of garbage.The days are long and shifts are less than ideal, but the work itself isn't too difficult.FMCNA offers excellent benefitsPay is fair, considering high school or equivalent is all that is required for most positions.Co-workers and supervisors are typically pleasant to deal with, But I have never worked for a company that upper management will sit in team meetings and blatantly tell everyone how unappreciated they are, which can be extremely discouraging.worked as consultant. Excellent work environment. Had an excellent opportunity to work and learn a lot from the team. Highly motivated people and valuable mentors.Would not recommend working here, you spend too many hours working and not enough to do your own stuff, you wake up so early and go home really late.if you want to move up this isn't necessarily the place for you but job security is for sure. some clinics are better than others but for the most part each clinic is the same.Upper management are liars, uncaring and only worry about the money and getting their bonus. Clinical managers are treated very poorly expect to treat fellow employees poorly to get them to work long hours for low pay. CCHT's are the backbone of this company but are treated so poorly and under paid. I had a Director of Operations that was two-face, played favorites and took advantage of her position. Do not expect any support of HR when you have been wronged because they stick with upper management and do nothing to support the employees.I learned alot from this place it like a school,  if you are willing to learned they will training you and show you the rope , and get you ready for the job you wantFast paced environment with many job duties. Most of time spent on electronic medical charting. Co-workers not always cooperative with each other or management. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the patients and helping them in their daily life. The hardest part of the job was balancing the amount of work with required meetings and required training. Lots of deadlines for getting work done to present at meetings. Always something new happening requiring new training. High expectations for patient results which are not in anyone's control. Great medical, dental, 401k benefits based on what you choose for your personal needs.Worst place I've ever worked mangement is horrible and they discrminate I would never recommend this job to anyone go somewhere else to work. HorribleYou will never be able to spend time with your family. Never know when you be getting off.Alot of work for one person. Tech work hard but they get the end of the rope,Poor management they have their favorites does not respect the team as a whole does not respect the RN's not enough time to safely and effectively do your job always putting other stuff on you and then want to you to get out on time poor scheduling management does not care about the employees the pay rate is poorer than any other dialysis facility around poor staff turnover always hiring new people and people always leaving does not recognize the people that are valuable to the company and that stay and do more above and beyond anybody else. Nobody gets written up no matter how many times they call in or they are not showing up for work or they are continuously late for work. So the practice continues its a circus.Corporate headquarters  in Waltham is starting to run out of space for employee offices/cubes. Meeting rooms are slowly taken away and replaced with offices for those of the directors level or higher. Employees have the largest cubes I've ever experienced and the building as a whole is beautiful.I've grown so much working with Fresenius in my posting skills and advanced to a Senior PAR cash posting. I have an amazing supervisor and team membersA job experience and very interesting ,I gained lot of things,in conferences they were very helpful and easy to understandpoor management in the clinic as well as poor compensation for employees with longevity with the company. poor management from higher-ups. overall poorly run company as of the past year.I take great pleasure in the  execution of my Phlebotomy duties. I enjoy meeting new patients on a daily basis.  Our conversations are usually very interesting, informative and motivating, this allow me to carryout my duties effectively.   However, I am required to do a lot of driving, which cause me to  incur various expenses, such as car up keep.  Sadly, I am not  reimbursed for these expenses.This place would have been ideal for me if I had better gross motor skills. They train you as a tech before they allow you to perform nursing skills. You need to be able to setup the dialysis machine in less than 5 minutes ( I couldn't) and if you are good at that kind of stuff this is the place for you. Otherwise friendly, helpful atmosphere.I love my job and wish I could clone it for all my friends. I work remotely and have never felt so well supported even in a huge corporate office environment!

My typical day is requires following up on action items, communicating to CMO of status updates and upcoming activities, as well as addressing any documentation excursion or revisionManagement and coworkers are dedicated to excellence.Very challenging timelines make work-life balance a constant struggle.The best part of this job is knowing that the world will be just a little bit better for the work that this company does.Good work colleagues. Good management in Germany and Japan.However its sad that your production is remotely controlled from Singapore. One time a mistake was made, then later in Sept this year an old Chinese witch from our Singapore office came to our office and gossiping rude things behind our backs and lecturing some of us in the office and cafeteria - making us Germans sound like we are incompetent! All because a colleague was tired and made one mistake.. like they never make mistakes themselves! Very poor morale.It's a great place to work with bad management.the money is good but there's no use in the money when your never out of work only long enough to sleep. They also go through new people all of the time because schedules are sometimes not good. You can't have a life and work this job it's not possible.The company is undergoing huge change with new US Commercial President and newer CEO.  The culture is no longer one of honesty, integrity, and fairness like its Company Values profess.  Every year I was employeed with Takeda, we had a change in organizational structure and potential layoff. In addition to the organizational flux, management in some departments are poor leaders, promoted because they 'get the job done' but with little regard or support for their team that has worked hard to contribute to their success.  I would caution anyone looking for a stable company with fair and impartial leadership to pursue Takeda at this time in their career.A typical work day consist of traveling to 10-12 accounts and engaging with doctors about different disease states such as Gout, Diabetes and Constipation. Most day I provide breakfast and lunches to offices to build rapport with office staff and doctors.	Developed detailed programs with NPLs that cover planning, initiation, execution, monitoring, and close out phases.	Use MS Project and other programs to outline specifics for program milestones, requirements, payment schedules, subcontracts definition, technical work description, staffing, integrated master schedules, and budgets 	Worked as a liaison to build coalitions among the various stakeholders and negotiated authority to move the project forward to meet the timelines	Monitoring program performance (technical, cost and schedule) through direct interaction with NPLs is a weekly routine.I was happy to dive into this position and learn.It was a great educational experience and can take this anywhere!•	Transcribe all recorded medical, educational, and legal audio and video-recorded material including medical meetings, operative reports, patient histories and examinations, discharges, x-ray reports, progress reports, legal and educational sessions.•	Thorough knowledge of medical, legal, and educational transcription guidelines and practices.•	Extensive medical and legal terminology knowledge.•	Ability to understand diverse dialects and accounts.•	Excellent communication skills necessary to perform all essential job functions.The job was fantastic in that the company gave me all the resources needed to educated physicians.  This made the job more enjoyable and opened a ton of options to be successful.Hire, develop and train 11 sales representatives to be able to effectively sell our products to their physicians.  This includes weekly field rides with my team where we review numbers, business strategies and developmental plans.  My style is as a partner who expects a lot, but never asks anyone to do anything I would not do myself.  The hardest part of the job is just being able to have a good work life balance.  Best part is seeing people develop and get promoted into future leaders of the companyDevelop and train 11 sales reps on a daily basis while managing a specific geography and all the products in that area. Develop business plans to hit company goals with the purpose of developing future leaders of TakedaAssisted with the launch Takeda’s new drug NINLARO® with Patient Advocacy and Commercial/Marketing team. Spearheaded the creation of a multicultural team to address the disparities of the African American community in the Multiple Myeloma therapeutic area. Brought in the Dream Foundation to create Dreams for Multiple Myeloma Patients to promote Dreams for adults with Multiple Myeloma.Great place to work. Great employees and great managers. Managers are real world. Takeda give responsibility and accountability at the local level, which allow individuals to determine their strategic approach.There is a great environment among the workers, act like a family all together. There was a management change(head change), which the workers were not really happy about with the new management system.Takeda offers some great benefits to its full-time employees, however, like most positions, if you are a contractor, they pile on the work with no real benefits.I owe this organization much gratitude for giving me the opportunity to work with a great sales force, develop much of my skill set over a long period of time and allowing me the appropriate education needed for continued work in the medical industry.My co-workers were great and I had a great time with them. But their human management was bad. They don't care about employees advancement.Many organization changes are currently underway. Great part of the company is that there are 1/2 day fridays to ensure work life balance.Great Company! Good Benefits and Employees. Good work life balance and overall place to work. Need more companies like this in the Lake County area.I would start the week by looking at my schedule which would tell my what materials I will be testing for the week and any other responsibilities to be carried e.g. water sampling, monitoring stock levels, waste runs. I would then get any paper work I would need issuing by a senior analyst and print of  any specifications which will be need on the day of testing. I would carry out the tests required in the most efficient timing which allows me to maximise my work day to the most. As this was my first job from graduating I have learned so much from the experience of what its like to work in a industry setting and the time lines which need to be met. I got along with everyone in my work place, the management were so understanding and very easy to approach with any problems, as well with my co-workers they would help me with any queries I had especially when I first started.The hardest part of the job was in my first few months of employment and it was referring to the pharmacopoeias as I was not familiar using them, but as time went on I became comfortable using them. The most enjoyable part of my job was the challenge of performing new more difficult techniques and tests that I had not had the opportunity to perform yet.I worked with contracts, and adverse events.I worked with some amazing hardworking coworkers.really enjoyed my time working as a Temp with Takeda.","10,000+",Boston,Cambridge,MA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/d875c90f-0d25-45f3-9ec9-cf80553f0c2c?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=29,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Until that person left and then instead of fixing issues, things were 'band-aided'. After working there 8 months I still had no permissions or local admin rights to perform any task other than helplessly assign tickets to the appropriate departments for checking. After months and months of begging and constant nagging for the required access to do my required duties, I was let go due to lack of work, when we had been wrecklessly and desperately looking for new temps for many weeks prior. Not a company for advancement at all for they are only in it for the profit and layovers and not the actual work being done. I met some VERY amazing people in there and I wouldn't change meeting those folks for the world. I learned a lot about relationships and how having certain relationships with other parts and cultures of the company helps you grow stronger as a whole professionally and personally. And that's the kind of behavior we need to grow a career and maintain doing something we are passionate about.company overall has good prospects but senior leadership doesn't communicate, support staff, or make good decisionsProgram teams are open with the expectation of all contributing. Training and team support were always there. Access to senior managers. Program and project teams always current in all functional areas and invited to help address challenges.Array provides all the tools needed to advance projects and programs, excellent access to the literature through journal subscriptions, enthusiastic library resources, sophisticated chemical search engines with many of the staff current on the latest findings in both discovery and early clinical information.Stimulating working environment with the opportunity to work with brilliant world class chemists and biologists in drug discovery. I learned a great deal about the process required to move a compound from discovery to formulation to testing thru GMP/FDA certification. Typically I processed orders from sourcing and requisition to completion including order placement, tracking and expediting to delivery. Managed suppliers and negotiated contracts.The most challenging part of my job was dealing with the work habits of one of my co-workers.The most rewarding aspect of working with the Array team was knowing that the drugs we created were produced in order to alleviate illness and improve health and well being.Strong medicinal chemistry capability and solid drug discovery capability with an established record of success.",,Boston,Cambridge,MA,2016-11-14T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/7fb54147-1c73-47fc-a56e-fcd4340a4267?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

My typical day is requires following up on action items, communicating to CMO of status updates and upcoming activities, as well as addressing any documentation excursion or revisionThe job was fantastic in that the company gave me all the resources needed to educated physicians.  This made the job more enjoyable and opened a ton of options to be successful.Management and coworkers are dedicated to excellence.Very challenging timelines make work-life balance a constant struggle.The best part of this job is knowing that the world will be just a little bit better for the work that this company does.It's a great place to work with bad management.the money is good but there's no use in the money when your never out of work only long enough to sleep. They also go through new people all of the time because schedules are sometimes not good. You can't have a life and work this job it's not possible.I would start the week by looking at my schedule which would tell my what materials I will be testing for the week and any other responsibilities to be carried e.g. water sampling, monitoring stock levels, waste runs. I would then get any paper work I would need issuing by a senior analyst and print of  any specifications which will be need on the day of testing. I would carry out the tests required in the most efficient timing which allows me to maximise my work day to the most. As this was my first job from graduating I have learned so much from the experience of what its like to work in a industry setting and the time lines which need to be met. I got along with everyone in my work place, the management were so understanding and very easy to approach with any problems, as well with my co-workers they would help me with any queries I had especially when I first started.The hardest part of the job was in my first few months of employment and it was referring to the pharmacopoeias as I was not familiar using them, but as time went on I became comfortable using them. The most enjoyable part of my job was the challenge of performing new more difficult techniques and tests that I had not had the opportunity to perform yet.Good work colleagues. Good management in Germany and Japan.However its sad that your production is remotely controlled from Singapore. One time a mistake was made, then later in Sept this year an old Chinese witch from our Singapore office came to our office and gossiping rude things behind our backs and lecturing some of us in the office and cafeteria - making us Germans sound like we are incompetent! All because a colleague was tired and made one mistake.. like they never make mistakes themselves! Very poor morale.A typical work day consist of traveling to 10-12 accounts and engaging with doctors about different disease states such as Gout, Diabetes and Constipation. Most day I provide breakfast and lunches to offices to build rapport with office staff and doctors.The company is undergoing huge change with new US Commercial President and newer CEO.  The culture is no longer one of honesty, integrity, and fairness like its Company Values profess.  Every year I was employeed with Takeda, we had a change in organizational structure and potential layoff. In addition to the organizational flux, management in some departments are poor leaders, promoted because they 'get the job done' but with little regard or support for their team that has worked hard to contribute to their success.  I would caution anyone looking for a stable company with fair and impartial leadership to pursue Takeda at this time in their career.	Developed detailed programs with NPLs that cover planning, initiation, execution, monitoring, and close out phases.	Use MS Project and other programs to outline specifics for program milestones, requirements, payment schedules, subcontracts definition, technical work description, staffing, integrated master schedules, and budgets 	Worked as a liaison to build coalitions among the various stakeholders and negotiated authority to move the project forward to meet the timelines	Monitoring program performance (technical, cost and schedule) through direct interaction with NPLs is a weekly routine.My co-workers were great and I had a great time with them. But their human management was bad. They don't care about employees advancement.I was happy to dive into this position and learn.It was a great educational experience and can take this anywhere!•	Transcribe all recorded medical, educational, and legal audio and video-recorded material including medical meetings, operative reports, patient histories and examinations, discharges, x-ray reports, progress reports, legal and educational sessions.•	Thorough knowledge of medical, legal, and educational transcription guidelines and practices.•	Extensive medical and legal terminology knowledge.•	Ability to understand diverse dialects and accounts.•	Excellent communication skills necessary to perform all essential job functions.Hire, develop and train 11 sales representatives to be able to effectively sell our products to their physicians.  This includes weekly field rides with my team where we review numbers, business strategies and developmental plans.  My style is as a partner who expects a lot, but never asks anyone to do anything I would not do myself.  The hardest part of the job is just being able to have a good work life balance.  Best part is seeing people develop and get promoted into future leaders of the companyDevelop and train 11 sales reps on a daily basis while managing a specific geography and all the products in that area. Develop business plans to hit company goals with the purpose of developing future leaders of TakedaTakeda offers some great benefits to its full-time employees, however, like most positions, if you are a contractor, they pile on the work with no real benefits.Many organization changes are currently underway.

Need more companies like this in the Lake County area.Great place to work. Great employees and great managers. Managers are real world. Takeda give responsibility and accountability at the local level, which allow individuals to determine their strategic approach.There is a great environment among the workers, act like a family all together. There was a management change(head change), which the workers were not really happy about with the new management system.I worked with contracts, and adverse events.I worked with some amazing hardworking coworkers.really enjoyed my time working as a Temp with Takeda.Assisted with the launch Takeda’s new drug NINLARO® with Patient Advocacy and Commercial/Marketing team.

The section that I work in lets engineers do what they are best at.Learning is encouraged at Raytheon especially in the electrical testing field, management practices and administration, new and innovative electronics, computer sciences, and highly specialized NAVAL equipment. Hardest part of the job is the schedule of the Government, and potentially the hours required to work. Most enjoyable part of the job is the care and support that management and upper management play int he advancement of their employees.Routine/repetition in daily tasks most of the time. Was given the opportunity to be cross trained in a publications department. My former immediate manager valued employee opinions whereas current management doesn't appear to care. Mixed, some were back stabbers to benefit themselves. The hardest part of the job was trying to work past the negatives.Raytheon has been a good place to work.  During times of growth with work to keep the staff feeling secure it can be an enjoyable place to work.  When there are reductions in head count and closing of facilities the workplace can be depressing.   There is a flex work schedule for many employees that allows the employees a daily schedule that can be better tailored to their lives.  Most employees follow a 9/80 work schedule with alternating Fridays off.  Benefits including health care, dental, vision, 401K, and IRA are industry standard and are adjusted every year to be in line with competing employers.Work environment is casual. Come in when you want: just make sure you finish your work.I learned a ton. They really trust you to be able to do the work. And there's good and bad to that: you have an amazing opportunity to grow, impress and learn but you may stumble and fail.Management is variable but overall, I haven't heard anyone complain immensely. No micromanagement or abusive behavior.Co-workers are engineers in the most traditional sense. You're amongst your own kind.Hardest part of the job is dealing with the unsexiness of the defense industry. Another other complaints comes with any software job: boring bug tracking tasks, etc.Most enjoyable is the flexibility and the freedom to prove your knowledge/intellect.Pay is average.Raytheon is a great place to work.  Many opportunities for advancement in a fast paced and demanding work environment.   If you're a hard worker and have a great attitude sky's the limit with this company!good place to work but hard to develop and move up due to the union. non stressful environment with good management. benefits and vacation/ sick time were a plus.Flex time to allow work life balance made it easier to maintain perfect attendance. Attention to respecting others while getting the job done was a strong emphasis in the working environment. I learned the importance of integrity and the impact it has on self and others.The Co-Op experience was fantastic for learning the different sides of the business at Raytheon. I only had 2 years of experience at this company, but the overall culture/job was interesting and challenging.The leadership really look out for all the employees to the best of their ability. Great benefits and the family to work ratio is great for those with families. The only downside to working with this company is the lack of job security due to the contract based employees.It was obvious early on that Raytheon wants to be one of its larger competitors. I worked at the other company and they aren't succeeding at being as good or better. For starters, the technology some people need to do their job is so outdated. Even basics like Outlook aren't rolled out. Prepare to step back on time unless you are willing to find and pay for training on your own. Lots of conflicting messages about flexibility and balance.Starting from Corporate and into the businesses, there are cultural problems. It is very hierarchical and leaders are worshipped. Leaders foster a culture of mediocrity. If you have suggestions, you may be told that you're negative or a complainer. True commitment to diversity and inclusion is lacking. So much of a person's experience at Raytheon depends on the management chain.Great work environment. Management could use some training. Hard place to keep contracts. layoffs very often. Good benefits, college reimbursement,   401k, medical and dental.Very clean shop, with new equipment to work with.workers are all easy to work withManagement always there to assist when needed.Company has great benefits.This company was a very good company to work for. They gave good benefits along with good pay. I was sorry when I got laid off when they laid off 15000 employees nationwide.I've worked for Raytheon for almost 10 years. Excellent company and benefits. Diversity and respect for others important in companyTook the job, even though I live 75 miles north of Lawton.Great people and benefits, but too many miles are on my car now. Moving isn't an option yetIIS develops very complex systems.  There is a tremendous amount of domain knowledge within the company.  The main fault with the company is that these large unwieldy programs are being strangulated with an ill fitting agile/scrum management implementation (not to be confused with an actual engineering methodology).Benefits are the best part about working for Raytheon. It's a forward thinking company and they take care of their employees.Good place to work. Good benefits and lots of work. Working on state of the art equipment and lots of different programs.Raytheon has very challenging and fulfilling work if you manage to be placed into the right team.Some of the challenges is retaining great talent because benefits have been reduced such as elimination of profit sharing and reduced annual raises.Hughes Aircraft was purchased by Raytheon all together I spent 32 years with the company. Did many different engineering tasks. Lot's of opportunity to try different technical paths. Had a great carrier there for 32 years.","10,000+",Boston,Cambridge,MA,2016-11-05T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/f41c2e14-6ef1-4a7c-9db7-a63dc02a3f14?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=5,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

My only complaint (as of 2004) was the pay.  They figured bonus and stock options as part of the package, but both were very unreliable over the 6 years I worked thereGood pay and benefits, shut down between Christmas and New Years.  Communication could be better.  Transitioning from Hittite Microwave to Analog Devices has been tough.I learned SCHEMATIC and PWORK to prepare detailed electrical and mechanical drawings for new product development.Create CAM files for a copper clipboard.Assemble boards for testing and stock and order parts for staff of 25.Analog opens room to his employees to grow within his organisation.Analog creates a channel where all employees can bring innovative ideas or thoughts.Human rights at Analog are treated fairly and equitably, and that created a very friendly work environment.1) I checked voice mail and worked on spread sheets. 2) Pretty neat tricks with their custom  spread sheets3) Very helpful.4) Didn’t have any5) Knowing it was going to end.6) Learning a job I had no experience at.  Wish I could have leaned more.Worked with a confidant IS team that assisted one another with daily activities that consisted of SOP, troubleshooting user issues and time-lined projects. Management works well with team members and co-workers meet daily for trouble case updates.It was my pleasure to have been a part of this company, but unfortunately, the company closed that is why I had to look for another job to sustain my and my family's daily needs.A typical day at work when I first started with the company was great, especially when we were Hittite, when it became Analog things changed and it wasn't as great as it was when I first started.  I got to learn new software packages and use an old one which was alright.   As far as coworkers at this company we had good ones and then coworkers that were just out for themselves and not wanting to help the people that needed help.I'd say the hardest part of the job was when people didn't communicate and a person would have to find out on their own when things were changed around and no one would say anything.  communication in any company needs to be better.I enjoyed the work at my company especially when I first started, but then when the bigger company came in and there were a lot of changes it wasn't a happy go lucky place anymore.Company provides innovative projects to work on everyday. A lot of technical knowledge is contained in senior engineers.A great company with excellent benefits. I worked in an environment where my job skills and intellect was fully utilized for the betterment of my career goals.My day started at 3 pm.  and I was always busy pushing product outand it ended at 11 pm.I leaned a lot of different thing work for Analog devices the differentproduct's that we processes through the different machines.Management was great he always would give long lunches when we mad our production was meet.My co-workers were great people.  Sometimes we would get together on our day off our when we got of work.The most hardest part of my job was always being in the clean room with full gear on.the most enjoy able part of my job was learning the different machines.Small teams working on leading-edge tech products.  Strong R&D and leaders in the areas they play in, but little commitment to fight for market share in new areas.  They are good at creating new product categories.Pro: Great company and culture for working. Management is encouraging of new ideas but slow to adopt any.Con: Projects move slow.I had a good boss and I liked the working hours. I liked working with sap. It is a very good software package. I had to figure out if the invoices needed to be taxed or not.Several significant reorganizations company-wide have taken place over the last 5 years. The latest reorg in  Oct 2014 moved directors and senior management into new roles across the company. Technology and segment groups were joined under general managers (new structure). Same reorg also resulted in significant layoffs (at least 10% of staff) and many teams have been understaffed in key areas. This paralyzed the company for at least 6 months.  According to rumors internally, requisitions are awaiting signature and hiring will start up again this fall (particularly in the product lines).First full time job where i starting in the manufacturing side putting circuit boards together.  Worked my way up not to being the shipper receiver and have been doing that for the last 2 years.It used to be a wonderful place to work. It is too bad that things have changed. Analog is now just another company with short sighted management interested only in the stock price. Employees are now just another commodity. The company has performed layoffs in spite of the fact that it had plenty of cash and was not losing money. People are routinely apprehensive about the annual layoffs in the November/December timeframe. Because of this, a vicious competitive environment has been fostered where backstabbing is the norm done by people who mistakenly feel that it will make them more secure. It does, however, still offer one of the best 401K plans available.Great wealth of technical expertise with the company.  Good work-life balance.  Upward progression limited, re-organizations occur almost yearly.I was with Analog Devices for 2 years, contracting the first contract was for 6 months, they extended the contract but never became full time. My manager was very happy with my performance, but due to financial status they had to laid off all contractors.I love working at Analog Devices,  Great and fun environment.An outstanding work atmosphere with helpful co-workers.Good company with good benefits. Every day I learn something new, which is my favorite thing at this company. Management is also good. We all get along, and work together to complete jobs on time with quality.

201,913.0,Ultimate Hoops Statistician,Life Time Fitness,3.6,771.0,"The job is very corporate and is all about the company making money and the benefits keep getting worse.  The gym is beautifulManagement is composed of a bunch of children who do not care about their employees.The turnover rate is horrible, which is a reflection of the entire company. They make you feel very undervalued and then expect you to go over the top for minimum wage. It gets too busy to perform the job at the highest satisfaction. They don't offer pay raises. Everyone is indispensable. Expect you to sip the company cool aid 24/7. There is absolutely no training, they hire you and then it's sink or swim till you figure it out. It's not ""the healthy way of life company"", rather it's just another corporate gym trying to gain profits. This job is for high schoolers and entry level persons, unless you are working in some sort of personal training, dietitian, nutritionist role. Other than that, don't waste your time with this company.My lifetime location has great management. They personally make you feel cared about. However, you can tell corporate doesn't really care about you. Minimum wage for everything expected is way too low. Also, there are really no raises and no opportunities for promotion. But you do get a free gym membership.So don't work here full time if you can help it. If you really want to work here just do it as a side job for the membership.People are ultimately promoted to manager positions based on their sales ability and not on their ability to develop or lead a sales team. I have had my best manager of any career at Life Time and 2 of my worst of all time. Movement and change keeps Life Time relatively innovative however there is often change for the sake of change making mastering certain skills difficult. You will also be expected to work weekends and minimum 50 hours a week. Work life balance is quite poor but the overall culture is good.Focus is so much on members that it takes away from day to day function of the club. Team Members are to be retained by management but everyone is replaceable and it shows through behaviours of management.  I don't believe the club should be open on Holidays especially Christmas but it is and it's terrible that people have to take away from their families to come in for the 25 members that will check in that day. The pay is terrible for the type of service we are expected to provide.  The software and hardware that is used for a 21 century club is less than desirable. It shows how much upper management cares when nothing works 100% of the time.Great company if you want to have free gym benefits. However, my department head and gym coordinator we both self centered and showed favoritism to certain employees. Very cliquish company that pretend to have high standards of quality, yea right. Plus, they deduct a $7 product service fee from each massage. It is impossible to use $7 of cream in one massage unless you're spoon feeding it to a client. Products we rarely stocked and management were inferior.I like working for the company however I prefer to work where there are advancement opportunities. This challenges me to work harder and strive for something greater. The kids and the team make it feel like a big family though.This company is great to have the benefits of a free membership and that is all.  Management there is horrible and the children that work there could care less about Lifetime's target market.  I am 46 and have never seen a sh-- show like this.  I think Lifetime needs to stop depending on executive types in their 40s for membership and solely rely on targeting the highschool and college students to meet their revenue quota.  LolThis company is extremely unprofessional with no training for team members.  The best description for Lifetime is Wal-mArt in a pretty suit.  This company is poorly managed and ran by children who have great computer skills like most kids these days.You meet a lot of amazing people working for this company and there's a lot of room for advancement if your willing to work hard. However, the work-life balance is non-existent and the management needs a lot of work. The turn-over rate is very high so a lot of people come and go.Management doesn't respect their employees. They will throw you under the bus in a minute to make themselves look better. They never offer raises even if you worked there for 2 or 3 years. Different departments are disrespectful to one another and the issues are never address by management. There is so much drama that is never properly handled. Policy is only followed when it is convenient for the department head. There are several children dropped off with mental disabilities yet none of the employees or department heads are properly trained/certified to take care of them.Aside from the free membership, the kids and some of the team members you meet are really the only pros of working there.Everything is about customer service and product knowledge.  Selling fitness is not an easy task seeing as everyone wants to join a gym but don't know why.  Our job was to find their nugget and explore the possibility of assistance to help the new members achieve their goals.  We are taught how to explore the question as to ""Why did you come in our doors"".  We learned the value of team work and what it meant to be successful not only as individuals but as a team.  Management was ok, I found my real help and inspiration from my Sales Manager, Roland Commacho.  He showed me how to take my job apart and just concentrate on one membership at a time but to also work towards a goal for the day.  Loved working with my coworkers because everyone was a piece to the puzzle as to why the new member was going to succeed.  The hardest part of my job was the very long hours.  Sometimes I would be there from Bell to Bell, putting God and my family out of the picture.  The most enjoyable part of my job was to connect with all my new members and them thanking me for getting them started today.  I have been selling memberships for a long time and there are still members there when I first started my journey with Life Time.It is impossible to have any work life balance. This isn't a builder job and even though management preaches education, if you ask for help with education chances are they will tell you they don't have time to help you and they will tell you to look it up yourself.It's incrediblyhard to have any stability in your life working at lifetime fitness.  The paychecks are up and down, and the management is constantly changing.  I believe in the products and services that we provide, but it's mentally taxing to work in this place.The role of a personal trainer within Life Time Fitness is not that of an actual trainer but that of a salesperson. Trainers began their fitness career to help people and get compensated for it. However the pressure to gain clients and provide numbers does remove the fun aspect of training. It also does create a variable income as your pay is determined by if your clients show up and sign up. This is a draw against commission job with little to no room for advancement. This is not a position for people with young children as you will always work evenings and weekends because this is the bulk of times that people who can afford your services will be able to utilize the training. The world of PT is a revolving door and I watched many good trainers disappear because of their beliefs and talents wasted.Operations is very fast paced and is not for the feign of heart, you will literally have to clean diarrhea off the ground at times... But if you can get past that it can be somewhat enjoyable. The ops crew at the Palm Valley is amazing, everyone works as a team which is essential for the job. The boss or Ops Manager is the best in the game, he actually cares for his employees and does everything he can to give raises to keep the team happy.Telephone sales, in person sales, and online sales were a major part of my day. I gave tours of our club and explained promotions, membership options, nutrition options, and personal training options with new members. The management was fair, however there was little room for error. I appreciated the structure and speed of the positionI was hired in as a supervisor and really did enjoy working there as well as the members you meet. However, I feel at times management was too laid back, and I took the job more seriously. The pay wasnt all that great being a supervisor, but the free membership was great. The facilities themselves are amazing!Will say this though. High turnover rate. Advancement in the company is hard. I wont complain about being hired in as a supervisor, but I will say there were people that had been there for years before me that probably deserved to be considered for the position.Excellent company to work for. Great benefits and very good pay for what the job requires.Excellent management and organization through the whole company.If you seek to live a healthy way of life, Life Time has great opportunities for this for their team members. If you don't, than many of the benefits will not be benefits to you. They speak often of a healthy work/life balance, however do not in turn offer this easily.The company was amazing with great structure but there was not great management transition. When we got new management it did not help the companyTypically the work environment is very lively and productive, it can potentially be chaotic if there are irritated clients. I learned a lot from this company mostly in dealing with people and my co-workers. The management at lifetime fluctuates and has its ups and downs like any other large company. My co-workers are very positive and active people, along with being helpful and supportive. The hardest part of my job at lifetime would be saying goodbye to families that have been with us for many years as they move out of state or decide to go in another direction. The best part of my job is seeing the excitement on my students face when they accomplish a long time goal or overcome a fear that has help them back long enough.",,Boston,Westwood,MA,2016-10-27T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/7383d856-f433-428c-b596-f14b02406841?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

They have a real problem keeping contracts and that's keeping them from turning a profit.Productive and a nice environment to work,A good number of people will be willing to work in Premier Research because of its diverse nature. People from different countries work together here and do blend together for a common cause.Down times proved to be slow and unproductive but the benefits and pay made up for it. Management and co-workers were great. Would have been a great company and almost got a great advancement but the site I worked at closed down just before promotion.A lot of changes need to be made and at this time seems that they are. At this point we just have to wait and see if the current changes are the right ones.  Hiring at the Senior level makes it difficult to advance into different areas within the company.For the last two years I have been working closely with Pfizer study teams to bring data from external vendors, such as ERT, in house, reconcile the data, and troubleshooting any errors that arise during the process. From this position I have become very familiar with the different types of data collected during a clinical trial, how it is stored in the clinical database, and the complex process that takes place once the data is available. While working on forty plus studies at a time it is important that I am able to multitask and give each study my best work. This position demands the utmost attention to detail, including a strong sense of accountability not only to myself but also to my respective team members. One error on my end or a missed deadline could mean months of work and delays for the rest of the study team. I have found that I strive under this work dynamic and am very proud knowing the work I put in on these studies could lead to something much bigger.Great people who try to compensate for out of dated systems. Fair management with little involvement support. The people who work there make this company and allow it survive despite out of date systems procedures.Great co-workers and manager.  During a study it was very busy and there were many opportunities to learn.  Between studies we had a lot of training and team building exercises.  I enjoyed working with patients and staff.A typical day included Phase 1/Phase 2 studies on NSAID medications, taking vital signs, starting IVs, pain assessments, documentation, knowing and keeping updated on current protocols, basic lab procedures, etc.",,Boston,Quincy,MA,2016-10-21T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/919d7643-6238-4e6e-a693-0bf8b75d3c8e?mescoid=1500153001001&jobPosition=13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

209,921.0,Sr. Biostatistician,Telligen,3.5,15.0,"Telligen is a great company, its employees in mind. Each employee is a owner after one year and this has benefits. The training I received was not sufficient to complete the job, but this is not company wide. Its complex environment with little room for error. Redundancy is the work, which if you like regime and unchanging work - this is for you. The group contract with OHCA and that part of the job is quite interesting. Overall, I loved my time there.Enjoyed every aspect of this job. Staff was great to work with and we all got on together very well.We were able to wear casual clothing 4 days a week with jeans on Fridays. Help was always available. Supervisors were very good. Felt a part of the family.great pay and benefits were great when I first started but now the benefits are not the best. Relaxed work atmosphere and team work is good depending on which team you are on. Staff turnaround is low but staff do transfer to other departments quite often.Not a good employer. Are encouraged to work harder and faster and not take breaks. Work is salaried. Work about 50-60 hrs a week for same salary. Work is contractual and can end at any time. Management is only concerned about making money, not the employees. Supervisors are secretive and there is alot of favoritism. Lots of harrassment of employs not in the ""clicks"".  I enjoyed the people I worked with while at Telligen, I knew what I was doing on a daily basis, and enjoyed working on my own, I don't like to be micro-managed as long as the work is getting doneTelligen is very in line with market norms as far as benefits and compensation. They whey heavily on market research to and adjust accordingly.Executive management is unapproachable and out of touch with employee population. Management likes to blame others.  No advancement opportunities.   Felt unappreciated from management. No work life balance.  Would not recommend.Calling patients to do their monthly phone assessment and education, charting there assessment and progress on health goals.Usually tried to get ahold of 7-10 patients a day as had a case load of 150 to 170 to complete each month either assessments or 3 attempts to reach member per month. Calling Dr offices to collaborate about patient. Sending out educational  material to the patients.I learned a lot about  health  coaching, care plans and using the computer at this job as well as Medicaid and finding resources for the patients.My direct mangers were good and very willing to help the team with  any time off needed.My co-workers for the most part were great team playersThe hardest part of this  job was the case load and deadlines at the end of the month. The most enjoyable part of this  job was the patients and my co-workers.Poor communication between management and staff. Not informed of changes until the last minute. Excellent training process. Was given one month to train with qualified staff member. Spoke with members on the phone about their current health issues, setting goals and developing a plan of care for each member.The employee owners at Telligen truly do make a difference. They are among some of the most passionate and caring individuals I have ever worked with.Telligen puts employees first.  Happy employees work hard to make their projects successful and their customers happy.I had a great manager, then I switched to a different department and was treated poorly. They expect you to do your work along with everyone else work. The HR department does not care.I was a contract employee for Telligen, but really enjoyed working there. The atmosphere was very layed back, and I had plenty of work to keep me busyGood company.  Contract work is unstable.

212,924.0,Computational Biology Scientist - Knowledge Systems Group,Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,4.1,144.0,"Fast paced environment, interaction with coworkers in this department of Revenue Control was always positive when it came time to helping one another. This was also demonstrated in other departments; Customer Service Billing and IT department. The hardest part of the job could have been the last few days before End of Month deadline, but because of the comraderie and the willingness to work as a team, the Revenue Control department was more times than not, able to meet/surpass the monthly goal.The workload is excessive, not within job descriptions and with zero compensation to take on extra responsibilities that is the responsibilities of other departments.  You enter at entry level, you are told during the interview that there is plenty of room to grow, yet when you make an attempt to climb the professional latter, you're told, ""if you want to grow, find another job"". Poor morale.Dana-Farber is a world class facility that I felt honored to be working for. The compassionate care for patients extends to it's employees and there is a real cohesive effort by all departments. While the benefits are nice the actual salaries are not particularly competitive and it can be difficult to advance within the organization without proper connections.I enjoy working at DFCI. The environment and people I work with are great. The benefits here are also very good, no complaints. I would recommend this position to everyone and anyone.Great Place to work, excellent opportunity, great management support.Daily challenges getting all priority deliveries around down town Boston and other campus locationsManagement gave me the tools necessary to deliver services.When I started at Dana I was at the front desk, after a couple of months I was promoted to the multidisciiplinary clinic.  I say the hardest part of the job was to see patients with Cancer Metastasis go into hospice and eventually they were gone.  Even though I would try not to get attached to them, it was quite impossible. Even though it was hard, I enjoyed working there knowing I was giving my best to someone who were in their lasts daysThe Institute needs change at the top and it will trickle down to the staff and employees.  So many of the senior management have been in the same position for over 20+ years and they have not kept up with the times and the typical response is "" that's how we do it here""Weekly events include seminars with various topics related research areas. and there are free snacks during the seminars.      People are very nice to work with. The public kitchen is well maintained by everyone. By the way, the coffee machine is awesome!Good Place to work, I m Dependable, conscientious, team player for operations.I considerer this position as a service to the organizaitonGreat Manager to work forI absolutely loved being part of such a care-driven team. I was thrilled working with the patients, it was incredibly rewarding to function as an asset to the doctors and nurses that provided such necessary care to patients in their toughest moments.If you're interested in pursuing a degree in healthcare this is a great experience to work in a hospital.There are long hours and a lot is expected of research coordinators. I didn't have the best training and stuff was kind of handed off to me in a mess.Great work flow  some people are great to work together with. there a lot of favoritism at Dana Farber, with coworker on section floor but over all the patients are great.Humbling and rewarding experience with patients.Great benefits and perks.Many different experiences with personnel as to be expected some good  and some that can use improvements. Overall a good place to work.Very competitive. Everyone works hard. Miss it due to the casual academic culture. Very easy to make friends. Can talk to everyone. Very smart people, with lots of hope and wonderful plans for the future.Excellent place to work. Cares for their employees and truly sees the value in the work that they do. Truly care for students as well.A normal day is very busy.  There are many difficult manual differentials to be done, and many difficult patients that must be resulted so that treatment can be given to them in a timely manner.  Working the later shift, I've gotten to know many doctors when they come to the lab to look at differential slides.  The hard part of the job is knowing how sick some of the patients are, and that they might not survive they're illness.  The best part of the job is working with really nice people where we can always find some humor even when the work day is very hectic and stressful. Plus everyday is a learning experience when new patients come in with unknown illnesses that have to be diagnosed.Dana-Farber has introduced me to some of the most impressive people I know. Both the main campus (hospital) and the development office in which I worked were inspiring places to work.• Formulate logic behind inventory analysis to understand current pricing and payment strategies• Identify gaps in inventory and sales management to reduce working capital by $10MM and improve order to cash cycle • Create client-facing workshop slide decks for natural supply chain discussions across the globeWhat can I say?  Working for DFCI was great.  They are very flexible with you especially if you have kids and go to school.  The management is wonderful and super friendly and they never make you feel inferior.  The advancement opportunities and compensation are great!  Great benefits also!  I'm sad I had to leave this place due to moving out of state.  Wish every place was like DFCI.Great first job out of Graduate School. This is not exactly what I would like do be doing with a Clinical Research Management and Regulatory Affairs masters degree. I feel like I could be doing more than just data entry. Really interested in a Regulatory position.I worked as a biostatistician for 8 years, and really learned a lot of statistics. The workload is diverse and you can deal with any type of project ranging from genomics to small mouse experiments to large-scale clinical trials. Statisticians routinely consult on anything from the design of research through publication of manuscripts.The drawback of this job, and what eventually made me leave, was the enormous workload. Meetings with department management to adjust project allocations led nowhere, and 50+ hours per week became expected. Advancement opportunity was very limited and I was only eligible for cost-of-living raises for the rest of my career. As one of my managers commented: ""No one has to work here, and anyone who doesn't like it can just leave.""I thought that the science at DF was amazing, as were some of the clinical investigators that I worked with. The major drawbacks for me were the indifference of my superiors, lack of advancement potential, and enormous work load.",,Boston,Boston,MA,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/e6b18259-6bbe-4f2a-93fc-3ac10ade262d?mescoid=1900240001001&jobPosition=21,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

214,926.0,"Quant Developer, Assistant Vice President",State Street Global Advisors,3.5,875.0,"I have worked for State Street on and off for years.  I loved being a part of their corporate and community culture - there is no typical day, inasmuch as the company is huge and each division has their thing.For the most part, employees are working almost each other in teams specific to their skills and knowledge basis. Everyone is approachable and independent work is a crucial aspect to the working culture here.Huge company with limitless potential. Made great connections. Demanding, challenging and high-paced work environment. Little support for managers. Lack of individual focus makes certain tasks difficult to complete properly.I hope you got some good manager but unfortunately the manager i am working with is very non-professional and treat you like slave because you are contractor.Management by committee can be quite frustrating. If you want to punch a clock, have a lot of flexibility, aren't frustrated by a lack of support (e.g. call the help desk for everything and rarely get on-site support OR self service for things that are not your expertise). Then this is the place for you.SSB is a  good stepping stone into the professional world. There are many opportunities there and the lots of good people to grow with. They continually promote growth and new opportunitesI only worked here for a few months, but I was able to see in that short time that State Street was a great company. I learned a lot during my internship, and it has helped me throughout my life after college.Expense cutting and under investment has led to long days at the office.  Company has been having annual layoffs for 5 plus years and don't see that changing any time soon as it chases quarterly eps.Good place to start your career, but if you stay too long, you will see that the salary raises are minimal, bonuses are not great and promotions take a long time.  Bottom line, expect to work very long hours for low pay and the compensation isn't great.Great group with opportunities for international travel and assessments of banking operations around the globe.Collaborative team and superior management.Amazing work/life balance, depending on the team.I learned the accounting skills for 18 years at State Street Bank. Many classes are on line that need to be updated every year to take and tasks are cross training. However jobs are sent to oversea for downsizing now and next 4 years so they need to fire to meet their budgets!!Fast paced and dynamic. All engineers were extremely professional. As a financial institution, the bulk of the work was done off hours. This allowed us to work unimpeded.State Street is a very nice place to work if you are looking for a serious, yet not quite overly rigid work environment. The dress code is conservative, and the culture is friendly. There is a hierarchy that must be respected at all times, but that doesn't mean you can't talk to the people above you.Management doesn't clarify job specifics to well.  I learned how to designed websites and other minimal tasks I've never had to do before.  My co-workers are great the management team needs some help.Working for SSGS has been the worst experience of my life.  Their is absolutely no sense of team cohesiveness and management fails to take any responsibility for any issues within the job.Fast-paced deadline-oriented environment. The associates in the operations groups are knowledgeable and motivated. Work/life balance can be cyclically impossible depending upon the business area. Task variety is challenging in a good way; a person can develop many useful skills.Most of the time hectic due to needed to handle multiple task every day and deal with internal and external managers, sub-custodians banks and transfer agents, domestic and abroadTypical financial services company.  Diverse environment to service client base in most of the leading investment vehicles that are currently on the market.Great Company to start the career. I was joint this company at 2015. This is the first position that I received after school. It is a good reputation in the industry. However, if you want to achieve a higher standard, I suggest you to take the CFA and move to IBD.Corporate atmosphere and people were good to work with, lots of collaboration, however company wide lay-offs occurred too frequently.Great work-life balance as well as benefits for employees. Competitive pay out of college. Work environment is clean and co workers are always friendly.

217,929.0,Cell Immunology Scientist,Aerotek,3.8,5000.0,"Overall easy to work with and very professional. Contracted at Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics.  Support users on the Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS),provide end users with assistance in using the CTMS and work on improving quality of data in database.A typical day at work consisted of clocking in at 1pm and would clock out anywhere between 2am-4am, six days a week. The work was challenging enough to keep my mind active and the constant changes kept me on my toes. I had a great supervisor who was tough, but fair. She stood behind me when I had to make on-the-spot decisions and made me feel like what I was doing was important. The hardest part of this job had to be working such long hours with only one day off a week. However, working with people from all over the globe was amazing.For my personal opinion Aerotek isn't bad at all. Its one of the better staffing companies. Got me a job through a contract and I'm now permanent with the company. Aerotek actually paid a little more than the company I work with and offered us benefits AND we got a raise through them as well while on contract. Ive been with a few temp agencies and none were even close to Aerotek overall besides BG Staffing. If you need work soon and willing to take a chance on a temp to perm its honestly a decent company. It was at times unnerving with the uncertainty of the situation and the contract but it all ended up working out in the end for most of us. Once again my personal experience in Irving, TX so of course other results may vary. But definitely worth a shot if you are un employed or looking for quick workFun company culture. They really try to do their best to compensate the hard work you put in but it is a grind. Depending on the day you could be done at 5 or 5:30 but others it could be 7:30 or 8 before you feel comfortable leaving, and you may still have not hit your expectations for the day. Great place to start out and learn but tough work-life balance.I am proud that I was able to begin my Career with Aerotek. I started without very much direction. I was trying to see what I wanted to do long term, and it introduced me to a world that I never even considered in college. It was a career that found me instead of the other way around. If I wanted to go into sales long term, I definitely would've remained there, but it just wasn't where I wanted to take my career.Sign into RF scan gun and pick product from location with correct quantity for order. Management was decentCo-workers were great people and made you feel welcomeHardest part of the job was counting large quantities of parts,Most enjoyable part was being able to listen to music and the breaks.No hourly pay for over 40+ hours of work a week, bad culture, bad management, favoritism, corporate bullying, no work life balance. This office is a very dirty environment, very poor housekeeping.This company has one of the best training and development programs I have ever been a part of.  Great culture that provides guidance, support and motivation from folks around you that truly want to see you succeed. Long hours that may require some late nights at times but the deal is you get out of it what you put into it, generally.  Even though the hours are long they are very flexible for things you need to do, such as run an important errand and leave for most any personal reason as long as it isn't being abused.  It is an extremely tough job and is quite the grind.  In recruiting and sales that are so many things that happen outside of your control.  You can make a lot of money and have a long great career here but you better have a great work ethic and the ability to persevere.I started Aerotek on February 15th, 2016. I was contracted through them to work for a company based out of Morrisville, NC. It was so exciting for me. I was completely thrilled with the new opportunity before me, because I had been looking for the opportunity they presented me for a long time. It was a short lived dream. The company they contract for has management that SHOWS way too much favoritism, and if they don't like you, well it's out the door for you. I was robbed of my dream to become permanent. Not only that, but they released me for such a ridiculous reason...Performance driven environment, but centered around a great company culture. Work hard, play hard environment where management focuses on developing the skills of young professionals.Great company to work for, compensation is great and they do take care of their employees. Work culture is professional, fair and friendly.  Management has an open door policy, they truly care about their employees.  Definitely recommend them and would work for them again.Coworkers were more than just team members, we were like family. Working for the company provided bonuses based off the work effort that was put forth. Decent salary. The call center was partitioned into divisions, e.g., Team H2O or Beast Team etc. which boosted our morale to work harder to close on homeowners loans especially priorities 1-3 in conjucntion with utilizing the isms, i.e., company ethics and or / guidelines. Very energetic atmosphere.Great culture & strong leadership, but very demanding.  Great environment with great people, solid training but you will be working a lot to achieve success and advancement.Long hours, low pay, limited opportunity for advancement for women.  The recruiters and sales resources work very long hours and play very hard in the off hours.  It's a big of a ""frat house""...balls being thrown around all day long.  A bit militant.  Very hokey atmosphere.  Appearances can be deceiving.  I learned a lot about the staffing business and managing consultants.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people find meaningful work.A typical day for me was always a learning experience in different departments, was trained in various departments in order to be able to always have someone is critical operations to full fill the demands of the company. Got along with all my co-workers no matter what position they performed. I enjoyed very much interacting with different people and different departments and being able to perform different tasks thru out my day.Great place to be. Everyone is seemingly up beat and happy.The first 10-11 months I worked there were awesome despite a few bad apples. If you are negative and can't take feedback to develop into a better recruiter you probably won't be there long.It solely a performance based job but does have awesome compensation and benefits package. Set salary plus commission.The biggest downside I felt was having to conform to their view of a corporate employee. I had two buddies that were told they probably wouldn't get promoted because they wore purple button down shirts with ties instead of the typical blue or white. One was actually denied a promotion and was told it just wasn't his time yet even though he was the top recruiter in the office. As my time neared its end there a lot of changes in structure and management were going on. Meaning a lot of the culture was being lost and they brought in a lot of new recruiters and management was being shifted into new branches and even our director was demoted and kept even though he was the main cause for the stress and lack of production. Since then they have plugged a new person into the role of the Director and I imagine its going a lot better now.Aerotek is a great job to start out at after college, with the new rates entry level people out of school will now get 60K after hitting certain numbers plus commission and bonus. You can make decent money here but it is quite a grind and you need to be prepared to work 50-60 hours a week and some weekends.I worked as an intern for Aerotek and it gave me some good insight into the recruiting world. During a typical day as a recruiter, you would make aprox. 45 calls a day to try and set up interviews for candidates to come in and meet with you.The Account Managers are often promoted from recruiting fast. This show that there is plenty of career advancement, but there have been some complaints about the management being unexperienced. Great work environment, everyone is easy to talk to and get along with. The hardest part of the job is the reliance that you put into your candidates. You must first search for the candidate, call them, bring them in for a face to face interview, call their references,  have them interview for the position, accept the job offer if it is extended, and pass a drug test. During any point of this process the candidate can become ineligible for the opportunity or loose interest and you have to start the whole process over again (which happens pretty often). Like most sales job, closing the deal is the best part of the job. Can also be a pretty lucrative opportunity if you are good at it.Very nice company to work for a lot of opportunity to grow and a lot of good benefits also management treats you nice and co-workers and staff as wellIndeed is a life changing work environment! The employees and management team are very genuine and supportive! The culture is very positive and it is a fun environment. New ideas are encouraged and implemented. Indeed, is a great employer with amazing perks. Complementary breakfast, lunches, beverages and snacks to keep the teams happy.Aerotek has great job culture. For A normal work day the work is repetitive and also through out the week.  I learned about invoicing and collections. The management could be better. My co-workers are very supportive and helpful. We put work first and fun later. the most enjoyable part of this job is the culture. Everyone is like family and I think that is important.","5,001 to 10,000",Boston,Cambridge,MA,2016-11-29T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/9a45421c-171a-4287-b9e3-314c26f6c9d9?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=26,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Basic instruction for ANSF personnel, and to mentor the local national English language instructors. However, the Afghanistan contract was cancelled in the month of December 2013, due to U.S. budget cuts and U.S. military withdraw. My contractual research and developmental studies for Raytheon continued U.S. state side with the development of instructional ELT Aviation English curriculum lessons for AMT professionals.Great technology company. IT is a great functional area in which one can thrive. I highly recommend this employer. It is a stable and highly diverse environment; truly respectful of its people.This company was a very good company to work for. They gave good benefits along with good pay. I was sorry when I got laid off when they laid off 15000 employees nationwide.Raytheon is a great place to work with a great group of employees. The work schedule was flexible and it provided a great work life balance. Unfortunately my contracted ended there but if it didn't I would have stayed for a long timeThe company was great at challenging employees to meet high paced schedule demands to get equipment back to the customer.","10,000+",Boston,Cambridge,MA,2016-11-18T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/854fcd10-a6a3-41e9-9055-223197bcb2de?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=28,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The HR department is good but slow. The location is awesome and free parking in Boston is a rarity!On a typical day as a Lead Administrative Assistant I am responsible for clerical duties for a group of 44 individuals. My group deals with safety of the National Flying Space, which includes taking phone calls for accidents, unsatisfactory conditions reports, safety risk management for all the western area and routing this calls to the appropriate specialist.I review time and attendance to ensure accuracy and compliance with government and state laws.I review travel authorizations and vouchers for all specialist and managers, so that all monetary reimbursements are per FAA travel policies.I review all memorandums and letters, routing for signatures and tracking within our filing system, also keeping with records retention laws.Demanding career with odd hours, compressed schedules and minimal hours between shifts.  This job required 100% performance 100% of the time.This job demanded a ""Type A"" personality, so one typically works with a room full of high level/performing individuals and personalities clashed with regularity.Air Traffic Controllers work in a dynamic environment which is constantly changing from special procedures, weather conditions, congested airspace, and enroute spacing.Working as an air traffic controller was extremely rewarding and exciting.  Learning to do the job was difficult and even after an assumed competency there was much more to add to one's repertoire of skills.  The subtleties necessary to become an effective controller made all the difference.Air Traffic is a wonderful career oppotunity but not for everyone. Stress is high and must be willing to work shift work/weekends and holidays. The benefits are tremendous though and the FAA provides many of career opportunities for advancement.as long as you stay part time at ups you will be just fine but if you flip to full time and they don't like you they will have you fired for sure.  PTO was good and vacation was good and free benefits but no personal life at all.The DOT job environment was satisfactory and professional. The benefits in the DOT motivates the employees to provide the best quality work. The most enjoyable part of my job was working in a all round technical work as part of my rotational assignment.This was one of the best places I have ever worked for. The management was amazing, caring, understanding. The employees who I worked with were wonderful and we were a big happy family. I miss working there so much.The people I worked with were very good people. I have a bit of  humor built in me and I was always kidding them. It seemed to strengthen the bond between workers. Also always helped out where help was needed.The hardest part of the job is the heat in the summer. They pay one of the top pay for bus drivers in Indiana, with benefits available. Co-works are like family.During my time at the Department, I was associated with the completion of roadway surveys through their S.T.A.M.P.P program. I learned a lot through this program including data entry and leadership skills. A typical day was working first shift being responsible with state-issued vehicles and navigating within the four districts we were concerned with to complete drainage, guiderail, and shoulder surveys.The work day passed quickly due to big load work. I am learning how to behave and work as a team with my co-workers. Management is very good, friendly, cooperative. Meantime, I am meeting the company requirements, codes of behavior, etc. I am feeling very good in such good working atmosphere. However, professional grows       is limited, although, I did take and passed all professional exams that are were offered to me. Besides, my salary get is stuck somewhere in the middle of its scale.These folks are fake and have a management style that only benefits the management. Employees are talked about behind their backs and are ridiculed.Good team work. Staple and good Benefits. flexible hours jobs.Paid holidays. Job Promotion opportunity. Flexible hour.Excellent work life balance environment. Management uses a  hands off approach. As a professional they trust you to do your Job well and on time. Once you learn the job it will be less challenging technically.This company have the best on the job training ever.  This company likes to work with their employees and love to see them grow and advance to another level.  This company allow you to advance to a higher level and works with you.  They also provide training and classes that will help you become better at your job or future career.The management team is unprofessional and some of the co-workers are not so friendly and open to new people/employees.A typical day is scheduled pick ups, bus inspection before starting the route. Pre-trip and a post trip, paper work for any incidents. The hardest part is dealing with customers under the influence who may harm other's or themselves,Having worked for the FAA for over 25 years, I have seen it progressively slide downward.  The professionalism that used to be a hallmark of air traffic control is gone.  The integrity of managers and too many employees is gone.  A sense of progress and vision is non-existent.  In conversations with peers around the country, the same refrain is heard again and again:  ATC needs to be contracted out to fix it.  The ATO is rotting from the inside out.  The head of the snake needs to be cut off.The hardest part of an ATC job is working within the management structure.  It's hostile both directions, and many managers refuse to take a stand out of fear of reprisal.  The only enjoyable part of the job is the pay and the benefits.  (Know anywhere besides public ""service"" where you get a pension AND Social Security AND a 401(k)?)Passing the FAA Academy is difficult, but if you can make it through it is a very awarding career. The FAA HR and hiring process was not very efficient or effective. The HR department is difficult to contact and not always the most helpful. Employees themselves were very friendly and helpful, but the training program has a very low pass rate.The bus driver deals with a lot of stressful noise from a bus load of kids on a daily bases. But because the kids don't understand what a privilege it is for them to ride to school on a bus and the parents not making kids understand the important of bus rules. Makes a bus driver day to day job very difficult. Most drivers have high stress level, high blood pressure, and are more likely to have a heart attack than any other job and get paid the worst in any job field I know. The bus driver does not like the pay or the health risk. But we do it for the kids.We know they need us even when they feel they don't appreciate us. We love our children.Hadn't I had a serious of accidents I wouldn't have retired great job great co-worker's,...good benifits.

With Baxalta/Shire being a start up company it provides challenging learning experiences.  Management is willing and eager to teach and learn along with the rest of the team.  Team members have different levels of experience, therefore we learn from each other and work very well together.Being a Manufacturing Tech I has gave me the skills, tools, and leadership roles. I was so involved in volunteering within the company. I loved it! I knew that i was able to make a difference but then again i was saving lives by packaging plasma products for any destination all over the world nationwide. My job was sufficient with many tasks so it gave me that skill to be multitasking many things at the same time in our Packaging department.Good compensation and benefits, flexible working arrangements, beautiful office spaces.  Very progressive thinking company, nod to the future allowing workers to work remotely when possible.This place needs to be gutted and restarted... The management is HORRIBLE!!!! They are like one large clique that will throw their employees and each other under the bus at a drop of a dime! The upper echelon only cares about their image to corporate and trying to advance up the corporate ladder.  Don't be an intelligent minded person that challenges the norm because you will become a target and your days will be numbered.  I honestly hope that Shire clears out and restructures the entire upper management structure, from Senior Managers on up, for the better.  Maybe then we can actually build a culture that is for the employees and not for the leadership team.Benefits are great. Advancement potential is based on who likes you and not on your merit. You get very little help from your Masters, Supervisors or Management.  You get written up based on whims. The manager at the Harrisonburg facility as well as the QA manager are misogynists. The Manager has stated that LPN's are glorified a** wipers. There is very little positive encouragement from most managers. Breaks are very limited. The Regional manager, HR manager and their respective superiors are aware of the issues that face this facility and they have done nothing to resolve those issues. You cannot trust supervisors and management.Baxalta has a great culture. Everyone is friendly and always willing to help. We work as a team. The benefits are decent, but not a lot of additional perks.The company has gone through a lot of changes these last few years such as branching off, then independent, then bought off. Along with these changes came layoffs, no pay increase, probabilities for growth have always been hard. Management and pay is not the best. Its ok. Because of layoffs, work load has increased. Co-workers are nice. Lots of schedule changes.My typical day at work involves performing a hands on physical for donors to determine their eligibility to donate plasma. I provide donors with information regarding reactive test results. Assist donors with reactions and any health related questions about donating plasma.The work is overwhelming and the management does not seem to notice. However the people make it worthwhile to work here.My typical as project manager was review construction status, scope, schedule, budget and ensure the quality assurance was exceeding expectations.  This was my first time working in bio-pharmaceutical industry I learned the manufacturing process engineering and clean-build. My colleagues brought a diverse wealth of knowledge and worked together to achieve building a multi-billion dollar manufacturing facility. The most challenging part of the job was to  manage cost since this scope creep was constantly changing due to design. My colleagues were supportive and great people that bonded and spent time outside of the work place.People are really friendly and encourages you to keep climbing. They will teach you what you need to learn and work as a team. Management is good and the work life balance is good.Biggest turn over rate I have ever known of. The hours are very very inconsistent Some days they will work you 10 hours on your feet all day and complain about giving you a water break...bc you will then have to ""go to the restroom"" ...Management goes out and parties with their favorite co workers and definitely shows favouritism. Employees steadily talking gossip about other employees and donors. Really depressing place to work. They just let whoever be phlebotomist and even when the very nee phlebotomist steadily cause hematomas in the donors arms they just keep letting them stick. They don't car at all about the donors. Very stingy company. Thankful I'm I'm not there anymore. I'm finally getting back to myself and not so depressed.UPDATE 6-16Company was recently purchased by SHIRE.  Nothing safe here!!  Over 700 staff where laid of in APRIL and culture is terrible!  Cruel and disorganized.  Steer clear of this place!!  Used to be a place for ex Amgen staff and good people to grow!Good Company to work for, learned many new skills with oracle's JD Edwards. Always good to know that what you do helps people live a more normal life.A typical day at work is as a Clinician; as a educator to teach preventive health care; as a consultant & coordinator, as a Occupational Health Nurse Case Manager.Management and coworkers have been supportive and has allowed me to be autonomous and innovative.  The hardest part of my job is being outsourced.The most enjoyable part of my job was working with all of the employees.No work and life balance.  Poor management that only cares about numbers and metrics. You can only advance if you are one of the favorites no matter how good of a worker you are.

Everyday is something different.My day begins with logging into the phone systems, answering up to 6 lines at once.  Directing the calls as requested.I handle data entry of all training documentation, reviewing these documents to assure they have met the prerequisites. Once data entry is complete I file the documents, creating new pendaflex files if needed.I upload resumes into our HRMI create badges for new employees, and reissue lost or worn out badges using our WINPAk badge system.I complete check requests as needed.As I am a team player, I will assist with what ever project needs attention.Very Challenging everyday , fun environment, you have to know to juggle work, management team are great co-workers are very nice. the hardest part of work  is waking up so early other than that I enjoy working. the most enjoyable thing at work is I got to see so many different people at work and I got to have conversation with them, it's like family like company.I have been working with Nova Biomedical for almost ten years and I have no complaints. I have been treated very fair at work.This company is privately own with a great team of people to work for. leader and innovator of the blood analyzer meters.World leader in biosensor technology.

Many employees related to each other and most employees are waiting for retirement so many tasks are not completed or even cared about. In my experience customers were frustrated with lack of support from Nova. Management is not  approachable.Excellent place to work.  Very employee-oriented, and provides great benefits and opportunities to employees.I had many different functions from customer service to administrative duties. I learned how to be patient and understanding. A typical day was always very busy. The hardest part was not being able to help customers with there complete orders when there were shipping problems. Which happened maybe once or twice a week.I find my job is very enjoyable.  I get to help implement a great product.  I love educating other nurses on new technology.  I believe technology is what is going to improve patient care.  The hardest part is the traveling.  I have a family with children.  A phone call or face time is not the same as seeing them grow in person.Not a bad company. But found better career opportunity. it was my first mechanical assembler position & learned new skills.People were great to work with.Gained a lot of experience from planning to running a machine shop and medical device manufacturing.A typical day was answering a multi line phone. Customers all around the world calling with technical problems. My hardest part was listening to complaints all day long. The most enjoyable was my co-workers and how much fun we had. I learned a lot from Nova, my patients with listening, my computer skills and how to multi task. The management allowed me to be my own manager and did not micro manage me at all. Overall I had a great 23 years at Nova and would still be there if they the pay was better.In Nova i learned many things from lasering laminating and using other machines. The management is great, awesome understanding supervisors, great teams leaders who can run a great shift. There was nothing hard about the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was almost everything, i enjoyed the work the company gave me and definitly the staff employees and coworkers were good people to work with.Although it was about a year working at this company, it was an overall good experience.

241,953.0,Associate Research Scientist,Northeastern University,4.3,201.0,"I worked as a graduate research assistant which was unpaid but helped me learn a lot along with other students. I had my mentor guide me and help me answer many inquiries which taught me a lot.I work about 20 hours a week and it has taught me organisational skills. I organize towels in the closet and make sure that appropriate individuals enter the facility and no outsiders cross the gates. The management is very supportive and very understanding. If I have to drop a shift due to some academic work they are very understanding regarding it. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I got meet undergrads from different cultural backgrounds and we have become good friends now.This was a great way to make friends who were students trying to learn more about the Video Production aspect of the Athletics Department at Northeastern. I volunteered for the experience and it gave me the necessary basic skills in order to handle camera equipment appropriately.Northeastern University has a very large campus in Boston, which offers everything students need in the way of bookstores, eateries and a beautiful library.It is very international and has an excellent standard of education. The academic staff is highly qualified and co-workers are generally very helpful. The Global Pathways, College of Professional Studies organizes meetings for instructors, which is a good opportunity for the rather large teaching staff to meet up and exchange ideas.There is little to no possibility of advancement when hired as a part-time adjunct instructor. The workload varies and is unpredictable. No benefits, no job security.1. become a better organized with daily job activities.2. communicate with others effectively.3. Process magnetic materials, including: mechanically milling of     ferrite powders, formation of green bodies, heat treatment         studies   of compacts. 4. Fabricate and test toroids as high frequency permeability and    permittivity inductor cores, mechanically alloyed permanent    magnets, magnetostrictive materials, low power loss MnZn-ferrites    and low magnetic/dielectric loss Z-type ferrite.-I learned a lot about what it means to navigate heavy administrative tasks and politics in the work place-I grew as a supervisor -A love of diversity and inclusion, and helping create environments where this was a safe space for students and staff-I learned how to give feedback to staff including supervisors, peers, and subordinatesI had the great pleasure to work as a Office Assistant,Intern at Northeastern university, for  two months. I had the opportunity to work at the Department of Physical Therapy.My responsibility was to help with administrative tasks including making photo copies of student's files; Developed and maintained positive working relationships with other; Supported staff to reach common goals.Northeastern offers great benefits but the pay is not as great. There are a lot of opportunities to move within the University, but some offices remain stagnant. Overall it is a positive place to work and there is a level of excitement as the University moves up the ranks nationally.Great flexibility and time off policy (can depend on the dept). A week off for christmas and every holiday possible off. The pay is poor in most departments until you reach the director level. Everything moves slowly through northeastern and the systems are not fit to support the growth of the university. Great retirement benefit after two years. If you are going to work here, consider your boss/ dept just as much as the job itself.School is growing fast. As a graduate student, I felt there were not many professors working on a research actively, even young professors doing only services such as department works, teaching..  Only a few professors are working on a research.Meet with professors a few times a week to discuss the field of study/research I was working on. Would be assigned deadlines and goal to accomplish tasks and present to the professor. Fairly independent but professors were open and willing to help as neededGreat teaching university for employees, wonderful team model, excelled at job duties, co-workers approachable and resourceful, great work life balanceShadowing a PhD student during experiments and then carrying out replicates. I learnt time management among other laboratory skills. I've had quite friendly co-workers and mentors.NEU is a fast-growing staple of the Seattle tech scene. The staff is awesome, very attentive and willing to help. It's a great place to work and there are always opportunities to take leadership roles since the campus is growing so quickly.Worked as a teaching assistant. Work of course relies on the professor under whom you work. I have had the privilege to work under some very good professors and the experience has been very good.Review and submit payroll for employees.Make sure all areas are staffed throughout business hoursUpdate Digital signage programsAssist with any customer service needs- i.e phone calls and general questions about the establishment.Reserve and manage west addition window advertisement requestAssist Lost and found programNortheastern University is the perfect place to learn and practice engineering. I gained a lot of academic and research experience through the course of my master's.The two top things about working for Northeastern are the students and great co-workers.  There is a lot of coming and going of students due to co-operative education jobs and studies abroad. This presents challenges but is also exciting.Lucky to be hereHave been here since 6 months.Got opportunity to be here.I was working as an research assistant where treatment with employee is excellent.Good place to work. You do have to listen to directions and do as much as you can even when not asked. Great personnel and really calm place to work!!gooood place to learn everything.  I like the nice weather and water view here.  Green is everywhere.  Nice team and teacher.

249,961.0,Human Health or Ecological Risk Assessor   (Senior Associate Scientist or Scientist) – Boston MA - (,Tetra Tech,3.5,124.0,"Very enjoyable place to work with opportunity for professional growth. Full service engineering design firm with a variety interesting large and small projects.While working directly with the DPW, I interacted with the director, the arsenal general manager and all administrative and maintenance personnel.It was a challenging but exciting opportunity to identify various conservation measures to lower operating cost on the post for the U.S. Army.Worst company I have ever worked for. I have worked hard jobs and not complained about it and I have done a lot of tough hours but nothing compares to this company and the way the lie cheat and steal hours and work from you. They tell you one thing and do another. Promise you great things and never come through. Steal workers from other companies while they still work for other companies and tell you that there is no work when they give the select few they like 100's of hours a week. I wouldn't take this job if your life depended on it. I was behind on bills due to lack of work and took this job and they enjoyed seeing me struggle. They work very unethical and only look out for themselves.This is a great way getting Documention experiece. As a Task force leader working at the Portable scales I Weighted and documented All Roll off bins, End dumps, Rocket launchers hauling off debri to land Although it is only a tempory job I have enjoyed it. If i want to continue with this company i would have to travel but i have a family i would like to see on a daily basis and unfortuanatly  i could not continue working at tetra tech after this project is over.Good place with cafetria and free gym. Global projects are good opportunity to learn from. However, project managers and senior engineers are not organized, they need to communicate more effectively and have junior engineers know their responsibilties.I don't recommend working here if you have a better job opportunity.Tetra Tech is a wonderful place to work and it provides numerous opportunities to develop a wide skillset. The work and the atmosphere are both great, the only complaint is that pay, relative to other environmental companies, is low. It also seems like the payscale isn't consistent with experience, education, etc.Engineers need to communicate with each other more to have the same out come to be able to present to client or drafter. some of the dead line were ball park and were never set or communicated to designers so it was a hurry up and get it done most of the time.Nothing bad to say about Tetra Tech over 14k employees.Several projects that I was involved in were fun and not bothersome. They are very unique with several business units.Employers have flex time, and they have to have their 40 hours in by the end of the week.  The benefits are poor same with vacation/sick time.  You get 23 days a year and 7 of them are paid holidays - New Years, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Christmas.  The job security is poor, and that comes with the job considering you have to win jobs to keep your team busy.  The people working there are great and friendly, which is the upside of working there.  Most of the work is done behind the desk and on the computer.  Great help and assistance if you need it.  Sometimes there is poor communication and certain individuals aren't available when you need them and they didn't let you know that they weren't going to be there.Sit at workstation, for ongoing auto-cad work activities, and coordinating work with co-workers. Client projects duration could be one month to one year to complete. The hardest part of the project is, receiving the client requirements.I learned a lot about chain of events in a large company and how procedures effect other departments.I learned how to effectively work with various personalities.There was no typical day at work. Depending on if there was a project ramping up, the work day could be extremely hectic and fast paced.When a project was not in the immediate future, my typical day consisted of processing expense reports and reconciling various company credit cards.I love this job except for the fact that I never know if I am going to have hours or not.  At this point in my life I need consistent work and Tetra Tech is just not providing it.Working at Tetra Tech was great overall. The people there are nice and professional. Typical workday hours and environment. Opportunities to travel/be outside exist. Great pay. Free lunches weekly.-Various projects to work on and more freedom on the design and input in the projects. Learned about writing techniques and client interaction. -Work with staff with different backgrounds and experience.Waited 90 days then was given 2 days work. This company is good to work for if more hours were available sooner. Would definitely travel with them if ever offered.This was an excellent place to work. The employees were very kind, they were very flexible, and the pay was more than reasonable.Great place for advancement, Learned a lot about manufacturing and shipping. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the CEO's predjudice against bigger people.Tetra tech is an honest and fair company.  They are diverse and believe in equality opportunity employment. From my observation this is a good company to work for.My office relies heavily on government contracts. Not a bad thing but can be at times uncertain for the future.  I do love the people that I work with.Only one to advance is same nationality. Salary does not compensate for the workload and long hours of work including some holidays. Management takes all the credit while the rest do most of the tedious tasks. Unorganized and need restructuring. HR is slow in response especially lots of mistakes from payroll recently. Payroll Supervisor was a pain to deal with and very arrogant. Job descriptions are in low key compared to what is expected and given on the job. Worked on a project onsite and you are expected yesterday when you are just in time.Learned a lot from a lot of great people. Cheery atmosphere, flexible schedule, lots of opportunities to work on different topics.","10,000+",Boston,Boston,MA,2016-09-21T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/292d16e7-6259-4a47-a531-574c8fc0ba44?mescoid=1300104001001&jobPosition=23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

251,963.0,Analytics Engineer II,Vistaprint,3.5,39.0,"Vistaprint is a great place to work. There are a lot of perks that come with working there. Free food trucks, sabbaticals, lots of time off, and a good work environment.If you are straight out of college, and want to spend all of your time at work, this is the place for you! Company has amazing benefits, but be willing to put in the time. Lexington location is easy to find, however, traffic - not so good.Very fun work place, family oriented and helps you to be a well rounded individual. Management is encouraging, wonderful colleagues we learn from each other each day.Great work place I have had extensive training in providing high customer service, email proficiency, digital marketing and website designs. We currently have a strong management team that offers support in their specified area.If you work in Marketing or Engineering, you'll love working at Vistaprint.  A fun, young and casual vibe.  People are really transparent with projects, expectations and eager to collaborate.  Very ""work hard, play hard"" mentality.  Great company overall!It is fun to work for a high growth company which leads to broadening and challenging opportunities.  Challenge is to keep the growth coming.There have been big struggles with turnover and constant changes in organization and structure.However, the majority of the people are really intelligent and a pleasure to work with.I worked at Vistaprint for one semester as graduate intern for the Learning and Development department. Here is a list of some of my achievements:• Supported strategic and tactical efforts in the design and development of learning solutionsfor the Learning and Development department.• Conducted needs assessment for the company’s Emerging Managers Development trainingprogram.• Collaborated with Human Resources in the design of learning solutions for high potentialemployees.• Created, designed, and facilitated Conversational Spanish lessons for Vistaprint staff.Vistaprint was the best experience I've ever had in IT.  I was well managed, and truly felt they cared for their employees.A typical day at work you punch in to start your shift. Ensure you have all the apps that you will need to do your job open, Check your email to get information on upcoming changes new alerts etc. Be ready to provided world class customer service to business people who works hard to ensure their businesses are successful.Sure it seems great environment at first with free snacks/coffee, occasional free food truck lunches (Lexington) and an impressive compensation package/bonus. But after the honeymoon is over, you quickly realize that everyone is in it for themselves, work/life balance doesn't exist (most employees work at night) and support from managers is fleeting. If you enjoy backbiting, gossip and unprofessional behavior, then this is the right environment for you. If not, do yourself a favor and stay away from this toxic workplace. You'll either be fired or quit within a year.The environment is attractive, but there's a great deal of work to get done.  Pressure to work late too.good work environment, but priorities and strategic goals are a moving target.Vistaprint is filled with nearly all talented, motivated people - wonderful to be around.  Each day is busy and different from the next.Vistaprint is a great place to work. The company emphasizes professional growth as well as personal growth, offering its employee both skills training and yoga classes. The company works hard to keeps it’s employee happy with food truck days and a community feeling. Everyone that works at Vistaprint seems to work hard to achieve professional growth and team work is highly welcomed.I went to Vistaprint with high hopes. I left a wonderful company and a great position for slightly higher pay here and I've regretted it terribly. Having worked here over a year, I have found it to be a very cut-throat workplace with no regard for employees' personal lives. I have been enrolled in a Masters program and have had to take two semesters off because the workload at Vistprint is relentless. It is expected that employees regularly work their full day and then jump back on the computer at night to show they are putting in the extra effort. But, the extra effort is invasive of my personal life. Its infuriating contstantly having senior managers requesting information on Saturdays and Sundays. Working here is a new form of anxiety that I have never experienced before, nor will I again. Luckily, I am getting ready to leave. Talking with former employees of Vistaprint - I can hardly wait for the sigh of relief they've noted when giving notice!Good growth Company, but Finance is a sweat shop with lack of decision making and poor leadership. In general the people are pretty good, but no one stays. Turnover is extremely high, part of the reason so many jobs are open. Plenty of room to negotiate salary and bonus, the Company will overpay. They are liberal with sign on bonuses but don't expect to be rewarded once you are in the door. Despite the claims, bonuses don't exceed 100%, so don't believe the hype that you have significant upside.Finance is a reporting function only, there is zero strategic partnership. Expect to work a significant number of hours just trying to get the basics done. Good opportunity to come in for a year or two and then jump ship for something bigger.Free lunches are nice along with free drinks, but I'd rather have a meaningful job and work normal hours than to get a couple of perks, work 80 hours and have a mind numbing job.Great culture - Management values employee base. Talented base of Technical employees. Hardest part of the job, although I didn't mind it, was the off-hours activities supporting an e-commerce site- friendly working environment- productive and smart team-members- warm company culture- hardworking individuals","1,001 to 5,000",Boston,Waltham,MA,2016-09-20T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/40964962-0938-4d7c-bbcb-07ac9fab62cd?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=25,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

It's not worth working there if you can get hired In Another hospital.This hospital has been a pleasure to work at. From the top hospital executives, leadership, day to day staff and ancillary personnel, this hospital cares about its patients and staff.Very professional staff, helpful, courteous, and knowledgeable. The care that is given is to every patient it outstanding. Patient centered care is the number one priority throughout the entire clinic, from the front desk staff to their visit with the MD/NPs.Learned more than I thought possible during my time in this lab. Right from the start the PI wanted to challenge me since he knew I was being challenged with my difficult major as a biomedical engineer. Provided me with very important projects that I had to take complete responsibility for completing with the best of my ability. Very supportive lab members that were always willing to provide assistance and even let me watch them perform their daily lab tasks so that I could learn about the many skills and steps that are required for research and drug development.i work with kids so i deal with alot of smiling people even in the  adult areas. The pay is slightly low but decent. The turnover rate is very high due to managers that dont treat their employees with upmost respect. As a starter job it would be great.I love my job.   The doctors that I work for are amazing.  My job is coming to an end, so I need to find new employment. I never would have left this job!Tufts is a fast paced hospital and not minute is wasted there.   My coworkers made it all possible.The hardest part of my job was to get everything done (especially all the managerial things).The best part was the patients, in various states of illness, I was able at times to alleviate their stress, fear and anxiety.I loved my work at Tufts, even though it was tough.I have no complaints about my job.  the experience that I am receiving will be very beneficial to me in my endeavors.  I enjoy the staff and I truly enjoy each patients that I see each is so differentI left Tufts for 10 years to try different areas of nursing. I maintained relationships with several of my coworkers. The hospital is a true ""community/family"" environment. People are kind and caring, they rally together to help each personally and professionally. I continue to learn new procedures and advancements regularly. It's very rewarding to see patients stop by to say hello on their follow up visits when they're feeling better.The most difficult part of the job is watching some patients/families come to terms with terminal diagnosis. It's emotionally draining watching people suffer when they're in denial.A typical day at work at Tufts is that I arrive at 6:00am not due in till 7am but like to uncover all the rooms and make sure things are adequately stocked for the day and ready to roll as soon as patients check in!.  Tufts is an extremely busy practice in cornea, retina,plastics and glaucoma and we all work well together keeping the flow as smooth as possible and helping each other when needed.   The most enjoyable aspect of my job is with the patients, making sure they feel safe and questions are answered.  The hardest part of the job is leaving!Tufts Medical Center is a highly respected hospital and they didn't get that reputation for nothing, the staff here are great people to work with and there is plenty of room for advancement. Currently being in school to get my Associates in Medical Information Technology, Tufts offers many opportunities for me to learn different aspects of the medical field.A typical day at Tufts Medical Center in the Internal Medicine residency training program starts off at 7 AM with inpatient rounds. As a resident, I am the main doctor in charge of running all matters regarding patient care. I am supervised in my decisions by the attending physician, however the autonomy given to residents to run our teams is amazing here. I learnt to practice evidenced based medicine independently during  my time here. Since rotations are divided by sub-specialty of Internal Medicine, I learnt to practice medicine under physicians from several different backgrounds. My co-workers are very hardworking and self motivated, and the ancillary staff in our hospital is very supportive. The hardest part of the job is having a balance between work and life, however this improves with practice and by learning essential time management skills (which I have). Because I feel I have excellent communication skills, the easiest part of the job for me is talking to patients and their families.Teaching hospital with many interesting people to meet.  Good central location in Boston.  Near South Station.  I have enjoyed the many interesting people I have met.Staff was very knowledgeable and easy to work with. Very helpful. Grew my professional skillset during my time here, and really learned a lot about myself.- I come in work and take orders from the coworkers - I learned not to work there for a while- Managers are always watching you, very demanding- Coworkers were always watching me, report to manager bad rumors, they don't like Temps- The hardest part of the job was the commute, salary, and the treatment they gave me- The most enjoyable part of the job was none",,Boston,Boston,MA,2016-09-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/d322eabd-432f-4e37-b38e-f1603925da7b?mescoid=1900257001001&jobPosition=31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

261,973.0,Research and Development - PhD - Human Safety Toxicologist,P&G,4.1,1800.0,"Proctor & Gamble has a great history of promoting within their business. I managed over 150 employees and practiced this on a daily bases. I coached employees to be hard working and improve their people skills.Procter and gamble was a good experience warehouse job. I like the people and the hands on work that I had to complete daily. The pay rate was good and the management was really good with benefits.it a nice warehouse with fast pace workers.We had to pick up material from the machines with the forklift and take them back to there assigned spots. We continually repeated the same steps till all material was cleared off the floor.duties would include: inspection of forklift that I was assigned to that day, after which I would spend the rest of the shift scanning warehouse product and then moving the product efficiently to desired location.The people of P&G are amazing. The recruiting and testing process is very rigorous and I believe it always has been.  So you have the opportunity to work with the most amazing people.  People are able to make significant contributions at every level.  Most employees are very driven to succeed so the work environment can be both challenging and inspiring. Overall P&G is a great place to work!Sign into Walmart log, scan and inventory products, designed plan-o-grams and end caps. Management was very nice but also took her job seriously in a very professional manner. I had no coworkers but was required to interact with store staff. The hardest part of the job was when store personnel would not cooperate. The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexibility.I enjoyed the place that why I stayed there for a long time and ate good food while I was at it. But to tell one the truth I would probable make this one of last place to get hired because the work is tiredsome.Great place to work. This was also an huge company so it required the workers to work in a timely manner so that the customers would be satisfied with what they would receive.Great company. P&G is very interested in training their employees and encourages their employees to be the best they can be.P&G is a great place to learn and grow. Starting out, I was given incredible responsibility and enabling latitude to solve problems and build the business. This growth experience has helped shape me into the professional I am today.I really enjoyed working proctor in gamble but it wasnt flexible with my dauthers medical appointments so my assignment was ended, but overall was a great job to work.I worked with a great group of people. My job was selling new and existing items that were authorized by various warehouses, into the grocery stores in my territory. I had fantastic people to call on, and unbelievable coworkers.P&G hires the best people, it's a great place for leadership development. You get a lot of responsibility even early in your career. Most of the people that work for P&G are very proud of it.The company is a very large company with multiple manufacturing sites around the world.  The benefits are very good, but salary is strictly determined by manufacturing sites management and years of service.Good place to work, rotating shifts is the hardest part about working there. worked with good people and your job is secure with good benefits and retirementNot guaranteed work the hours are fine. They're just really unorganized . And the co-workers are allowed to do whatever they want. Use profanity etc.P&G has state-of-the-art manufacturing processes and technologies.  A very professional and respectful place to work.  They are also committed to and invest much time and money into the training and empowering of their employees from a skills perspective.There was no typical day here. Each day brought something different, this was one of the things that made it great. I learned that working in production was great. The hardest part of leaving this company was the hardest part of this job. Management and Technicians were college graduates at this Company. the most impressed  part of this job was the skill based system. I was considered a leader and did extensive traveling for the company to up grade people systems and it is still in progress today. Had it not been for the weekly rotatating of shifts I would have never left this Global Company.  One of the most enjoyable things here was learning maintenace of equipment. Management had an open door policy.Good for some. Not good for others. Strong company. Good people  good brands.  Nice working envirmemts. Work from home option.Great company to work for and to learn from. Employees are great, very smart, and hard working. Customers are at the forefront of everything we do.I have spent many years at P&G and can only sing their praises.  I have been able to have a long and fulfilling career at the company.  The company culture and people there are wonderful, supportive and embrace everyone.","10,000+",Boston,Boston,MA,2016-07-26T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/e05cb94d-30fe-4ec0-8b51-6aacab44d035?mescoid=1900305001001&jobPosition=35,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

291,1003.0,Statistician I,Blackbaud,3.7,46.0,"Blackbaud is a company that is dedicated to helping non-profits achieve their mission by providing solutions that will keep track of how funds are raised and the relationship the non-profits have with their constituents.The company is based out of Charleston, SC, and has grown from a small company, to a large one which has become the leading provider of CRM Software for the non-profit sector.People are wonderful to work with.  Charleston is a great place to work.  It is always nice to be involved with helping companies help people.  Clients are world wideThough it is a public company, it has done a good job of maintaining its (or restablishing in some cases) its culture of fun, customer-focus, and employee appreciation.The culture and the people that work there are all very passionate, caring and fun people to be around.  The people around you are invested in helping you become better at your role.The hours required to support multiple data-centers worldwide was a challenge that met but not rewarded. The opportunity for career growth and promotion was not possible.Everyday was different. Something fun happened everyday, as well. Great team oriented atmosphere. Corporate feel but also one big family.As a Luminate Online project manager, I was dismayed that we sold customers services we could not actually provide.  Management seemed to be ok with collecting for 140 hours a month, then only delivering 120.  On the flipside, when demanding customers forced project teams to bring 160 for only 140 reserved, project managers who pushed back on customer, got zero support from upper level managementBlackbaud is an example of everything that is wrong in the tech industry, where ""services"" try to become a profit center and project managers are sacrificed by upper management, unwilling to stand behind them OR make decisions to change policies.Blackbaud is such a great company for which to work.  I've never felt so fulfilled by the work I was/am doing or so motivated to go to work.  I look forward to connecting with both my co-workers and clients each day.I generally like working at Blackbaud.  The people in other departments seem to like it a lot more than I do though.  I'm in Operations, and we're definitely expected to never stop working.  Things like work-life balance, and quality of life improvements are mentioned, but don't seem to be priorities.  The only thing we seem to accomplish is to stamp out a fire long enough to get it down to coals; then its off to the next, larger fire.That said, I really like the people I work with.  It will be a shame when I leave to not work with them anymore.Great place to work, but management / project management is all over the place. If you find the right job path, you can move up in the company.Fun place to work with a great culture team always focusing on the employees. Great location in the middle on the domain, lots of fun things to do just a few steps out the door.Blackbaud is a good company and I would recommend to others.  Fasted paced and good energy. Focus is on growth and outside sales is the place to be.Enjoyed working there.  My contract ended. Great place to work.  Managers and Employees are great to work with.  Tough environment but worth working there.  I was using my skill.A fun place with a great work and life balance, management was positive, sales goals were attainable.  Very fun job, good culture!  I really enjoyed this position and learned a lotFixed internally and externally filed bugs in software.  Great experience getting familiar with Microsoft development tools.For six year in a row, the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce, SC Biz News, and Best Companies Group have named Blackbaud as one of the top 24 Best Places to Work in South Carolina in the large employer category!My team assists internal analysts with client issues. We build and maintain virtual testing machines that analysts will use to troubleshoot critical issues with company software. We will server as a tier 2 point of contact for case resolution. We primarily work everyday with Windows administrators to make sure our database software is working properly. We troubleshoot SQL related issues that clients may have on a daily basis.Fun place too work and lots of great people but the products are old, unstable, and use very old technology. Company has spent a lot of money to acquire other companies but does very little to integrate them. Compensation is based on the job market in Charleston, which is typically lower than most other tech cities.Typical dayMonitor 40 saas database servers everydayThese systems need to be ""online"" 7/24. Downtime = no moneyPerformance tuning. I tuned average 10 queries / week. Saved hundred hours processingIntensively prototyping Hadoop to create BI from OLTPIntensive migration HP-Linux plaform with Oracle GoldenGate with terabytes of dataAny others DBA duties requiredAs a consultant, you spend a lot of time on the road and serving customers, but there is a group of consultants that are there for you to bounce ideas off of, ask for suggestions for restaurants/things to do in different cities, or even meet you out if you're in or close to their town.  With many people working remote, it's not too uncommon to find someone living in a city you are in for work. The clients are non profits, but this doesn't mean they're all amazing.  Some clients are incredibly awesome.  Some clients are incredibly difficult.  It's just the nature of consulting.  The pay isn't the highest, but you aren't expected to make the job your life, either.  Time outside of working hours is highly respected.  Weekends (with the exception of travel time) aren't two extra work days.  Personal achievements outside of work are celebrated at work.  The culture feels like a family, even if most of your coworkers are remote.They really care about the employee. They have a kitchen with free snacks and coffee all day. They are flexible when it comes to working from home depending on your job title. They are really trying to have all departments become more familiar with each other to better collaborate.","1,001 to 5,000",Boston,Cambridge,MA,2016-03-08T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/b53a6ed8-e846-4e8d-9dd2-3575b72e5d26?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=30,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

I do breeding, genotyping and section.A typical day at work started with report . Meeting with  each patient, assessments of each patient, vitals, treatments, medications, dressing changes and all patient care. From there organizing my time to make sure all tasks are completed by the end of my shift. Many times my co-workers and I would help each other to care for patients when needed. The Hardest part of the job was sometimes to give every patient the amount of time with me as I would have liked. I very much enjoy providing quality patient focused care to each and every patient I care for.Wonderful company. Friendly atmosphere.

294,1006.0,Senior Pricing Statistician - (Job Number: 992027),Staples,3.7,5600.0,"So working in the copy and print center at Staples was anything but calm, between printer problems and five hundred page orders there was always something going on in the print center. Depending on what shift you started on your day would be either more or less busy, but it was always busy.The co-workers were generally nice to talk to but ultimately uninformed as to the awesomeness of printing. The Easy Techs were really fun to talk to and be with they were actually very knowledgeable about their machines.The management of my particular store were gods of micromanagement and god was it annoying. They wouldn't actually do anything but seem busy at the same time. And on top of that any problems you had were summarily dismissed.The hardest part of the job was the time table and the machines breaking down. The most enjoyable, for me anyways, was the printing aspect which was most of it. I love dealing with paper mounting, cutting, and laminating, binding and color testing. All aspects of printing.I enjoyed my co workers and the environment at Staples, the managers were very friendly, yet still professional.  I enjoy working with customers so that was another positive.Love the people working there. Everyone works as a team. You will always learn something new working there. Its always a good time at work.While the opportunity for advancement was limited, I enjoyed the customer contact. Particularly enjoyed learning the various machines and the creativity involved in producing a quality product. The job provided the opportunity to learn new skills.It's fine. There's nothing much to say about a part time retail job. It's exactly what it promises, nothing more or less. When things are busy, they can feel overwhelming, when they're slow, it's interminable.Staples is a great starter company for someone fresh out of college.  Due to the size of the company there are opportunities for growth.it's a job. it's the same thing day in, day out. i haven't learned anything really. the manager is nice but he's quiet. nothing is really hard about the job honestly. the best part of the day is being on the floor to be honest.Overall I think it's a great place to work. The supervisors really do they're best to work with any and all schedules. They really have a pretty good plan to helping people keep their job due to schedules.  The plant manager walks around on a daily basis talking to employees making sure they are all doing good. And and you really work two weekends out of the year and its only one day.Good place to work. Plenty of different job possibilities to improve your career. good management staff that is willing to help you promote yourself if you are interested in moving up the ladder.Well a typical day would be coming in to sort through the boxes and packages first.Then we start to load the trucks with our factory paper. Next I would start to put the boxes that will be moving out on that truck in it proper place on the truck.fun and everyday there is something new as a challenge. work hard to server customer with best ability to accomplish their need. management team are really helpful when you need there help.Long days, price changes and an report to 15 different managers in one day all of them telling you something different.  The plan o grams never actually worked and the tech then was obsoleteI was employed with the company for less than a year, lack of hours lead to my leaving the company. My coworkers were fun to work with and they were all hard workers, making the job greatly enjoyable.Work hours for part time employees tend to be inconstant and fluctuate without any rhyme or reason. This makes it a challenge for the employee to plan their personal finances.A typical day of work was scanning boxes, picking the needed product from nearby aisles, placing the product into the box and then pushing it back onto the conveyor belt. Sometimes I would also make the boxes and clean up at the end of the night.Like another reviewer said, this place has a toxic work atmosphere. There is a core group of people who have worked together for years and if one of them doesn't like you- none of them like you. One of the supervisors is a textbook example of a psychopath.Never understood what I did to be on the receiving end of their BS, but I know my situation isn't unique since they have so much trouble keeping people. It's not a place where you can just do your job and go home.I showed up every day. I worked hard. They ran me off.A typical day at work. Delivering 8 to 12 hours a day.I'm delivering office supples to schools,homes and diffrent businesses.I deliver 2 two 3 new businesses each week.My general manager and all of the other managers at the store I work at have been so awesome. I left the company for school out of state and they got me a cake and gift cards to buy school supplies. When I got back for summer break they instantly re-hired me to work for the summer and were just as amazing. The upper management seems to be a little more difficult and unorganized. Our store runs great but when we have customer complaints, most of them are due to issues outside our store.This company is a joke period. Their print department, not only cant generate revenue, but they cant train their employees properly. Can't move up unless you know two team managers as in BFF's. They treat the employees like its Kindergarten.Staples tries to treat their employees reasonably well, but it is still clear that either they do not have the funds to do so or are simply unwilling. ALL employees, not just those in sales positions, are required to meet a daily quota of sales requirements, ranging from getting people to sign up for the free membership to selling a certain amount of extra product (i.e. a ""market basket"") with any technology sales.There is no commission and no incentive for reaching quotas other than keeping your job. If it were not for these quotas, I feel this would be a very reasonable and even enjoyable place to work; but as it stands, each day is very stressful. When I was being interviewed, the manager described it exactly as the title, verbatim: ""This is a high-stress sales position. Can you handle that?""This is not to say the work environment is not friendly. The managers are under pressure to reach quotas as well, so it feels like a team all working to achieve the same goal.Name recognition. Retail and outside sales presence. National Account Representatives pay is not acceptable.intially compensation was acceptable but has. Even reduced.did not enjoy working here. new tasks were introduced every month or two and pressures too. this is highlighted by the fact that they never increased pay.","10,000+",Boston,Framingham,MA,2016-11-15T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/3dc5985e-c467-4631-a2c2-37f5d9dd7e58?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Cumbersome processes across the board make it difficult to produce great work.Loved my experience working with veterans and involving in programs such helping the homeless and interacting on different levels with far strong oral &written communcation skills.I enjoyed working a at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Will miss everyone. My upcoming retirement is January 3, 2017. Looking forward to part-time employment helping others.Although I enjoy my job, the workload is extreme. Work environment is stressful, only due to workload. Supervisor is extremely helpful and understanding when it comes to home life.Government job so all of the standard good things like Job Security but this is not a good place to advance. Supervisors would rather hire from another VA for promotions so they don't get accused of favoritism by promoting within. So, even though you may work hard and excel at your position, you will be treated the same as those who do the bare minimum. Sooner or Later even the most motivated workers figure this out so you either move on or become a bad employee.Upper management did not communicate well with staff members. It is a very political job and promotions are hard to get. Paid well.The place is ever-changing from new management to new rules every other day. The constant changes can cause much chaos, but on the other hand, it is very rewarding when you know you have helped a Veteran in a positive way.The path lab is a great area to work. Management is supportive of advancement. Co-workers are considerate. I abhor filing, but enjoy typing dictation.Have enjoyed my time working here. Has great opperunities for career advancements, and working there is simply rewarding in itself.Working with the staff has taught me more about the veterans that are in need of assistance. The breadth of knowledge that i have received , as well as the varied tasks that your staff manages daily provided an environment that was both exciting and challenging.The VA obviously doesn't do their research when hiring contractors. ATP2 has Cassandra House who has made threats to employees. Austin, TX VAFSC. LackWorking with the vets in the hospital, nice coworkers how to get along the hardest part of the job getting up in the morningIt is a place where residents are well taken cared of and protected against any form of abuse. Management takes action as it happens. Good team work among staff. Good learning environment.Very supportive staff. Flexible work schedule. Learned that many tasks are ongoing, so if you need quick gratification this is not for you. Overall very nice place to work. Ability for autonomy.Organized Clinic appointments for out-patient care, and assisted with scheduling appointments for Physical Therapy and the VA MOVE Program. Management and co workers were usually nice. The most enjoyable part was helping Veterans.Difficult to progress once in if at too low a level, prior experience is does not matter as much as being at a certain pay grade for an amount of time.Steady work, no layoffs, nice people generally, serving the veterans.  So, the job can be rewarding. Personal development is not encouraged. Creative thinking is not encouraged. Cost savings are not encouraged on projects. Many functions are inefficient.enjoyed helping the veterans and all patients they need to know that there is someone here to help them with the rules of there insurenceMy experience here was good with other agencies that I worked with was good. I did not like the policy that as a case manager I would not be permitted to attend the funeral of those Veterans who were my clients, this bothered me the most. Depending on the value of the Veterans belongings families were not notified. A lot of dishonesty going around.As a work study student, I gained valuable experience working with veterans, their spouses and other members of the student body.  This position is great for gaining experience to use in future careers.I worked as a volunteer and the experience was great. I worked with a friendly staff who gave me my first work experience.

319,1031.0,Physician (Physician Scientist),Department Of Veterans Affairs,4.0,2300.0,"Excellent, top notch professionals work here. Cumbersome processes across the board make it difficult to produce great work.My experience here was good with other agencies that I worked with was good. I did not like the policy that as a case manager I would not be permitted to attend the funeral of those Veterans who were my clients, this bothered me the most. Depending on the value of the Veterans belongings families were not notified. A lot of dishonesty going around.Government job so all of the standard good things like Job Security but this is not a good place to advance. Supervisors would rather hire from another VA for promotions so they don't get accused of favoritism by promoting within. So, even though you may work hard and excel at your position, you will be treated the same as those who do the bare minimum. Sooner or Later even the most motivated workers figure this out so you either move on or become a bad employee.I love the benefits and love the Government Holidays off. I love the fact that we always get the weekends off.I learned to how to become very efficient and very organized, since I started working at the VA.Hardest part of my day is finding enough time, to call all our patients to get them scheduled for their appointments.Greet veterans as they walked in. answer multi-telephone line, took minutes for meetings, check emails and forward to appropriate counselors, ordered supplies, process veterans payments, timekeeper for the office of 30, took picture Id's for new employees, open and sorted mail. It wasn't a hard part of the job. Love to stay busy. Also assisted veterans with completing their vocational rehabilitation applicationsChallenging work day in monitoring and interacting with Veterans to provide /advocate and provide safe and  adequate services for our Nations Veterans. The learning process involves how to efficiently promote customer services. Management is often effective in promoting adequate /up to date trainings.It was a career position but the work culture was not what I expected it to be. The frustrations occur with management that are promoted when they behave badly. The organization is now going through a paradigm shift, and the hope is with younger talent the work culture will get better.A typical day at work consists of providing quality work to a diverse group of patients, I've learned to be patient understanding all the different dynamics in patient care with the role of being a leader. I have affiliated myself with Peer Positions, Group Leadership and give my employer exemplary work to receive the highest evaluation for performance and dedication to the VA 5 years in a row. The most enjoyable part of working for the VA is that I am giving care to every culture of patients and doing it gladly to those who served with their lives to give us these freedoms.A typical day at work is busy unless the unit is full, and therefore no admissions are coming. I learned what teamwork really look and feel like for once. Management was excellent and go above and beyond for the staffs request. My coworkers overall were easy to get along with, I still keep in touch with some of them. The hardest part of my job was when I would have to work in palliative watching patients expire and then performing post mortem care. I honestly can't say what was the enjoyable part because there were so many enjoyable moments. This job at the VA changed my life literally.Being a Federal civil servant is a tough job but being one at the Department of Veterans Affairs, especially in a hospital setting, serving veterans, is great.  The biggest challenge is not serving veteran patients, but rather other staff who don't believe in human freedom.  But never fear, the VA finds ways around and through these people.  It's government work.  You cannot just fire people; in fact, you cannot fire them at all.This was my first full-time job.  Although I had worked previous part time jobs in college and between full time. This gave me an appreciation for veterans and what they were entitled to.  At that time, it was easier for veterans to use their home loan benefits but some also struggled with staying in their homes.  I learned a great deal about real estate, claims and processing new home loans.The job itself is relatively demanding and requires a very intensive, months long training.  However, once you understand the job the days fly by. The people who work there are kind, you don't really come into contact with managers, and the hardest part of the job isn't that hard, you just have to buckle down and do it.I enjoying helping out veterans and this position give me and opportunity to give back.  I enjoy working to assist other people and working with the VA I feel like what I do assist numerous people.  I work 8 hours a day five days a week.  I have worked on both sides of the picture.  I have assisted active duty personnel and now I assist veterans.  I feel that communication between upper management and  supervisors could be improved.  What I do it is all about the numbers.  But I feel if we could be more detailed it would cut down on errors.I would open the day with printing the daily schedule for each provider. Check in the patient and review their insurance and take payment if need be. I would also schedule for follow up appointments. I would have a list of new consult patients I would call and schedule for future appointments. If appointment was over 30 days I would add them to a list for them to use ""Veterans Choice"" and find them a provider within the network that they could use /see before their appointment at the VA hospital. If they did, I would forward the medical information to that provider. I would print follow up appointment letters and sent them out to the patient.LPNs are instrumental in providing holistic care to all residents through accurate assessments and medication administration. I was well-mentored as a new nurse and was able to develop important nursing skills.  I was the charge unit of each individual unit as needed and it was my responsibility to coordinate and manage CNAs in the care of the residents I was accountable for.  The hardest part of my job was adapting to limitations within the state-run facility.  The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to improve quality of life for my residents and to bring peace of mind to their family members.Great employer to interact with staff and patients and families.  Majority of work performed was a combination of utilization review on charts and hands on in the field home health with assessments of patients enrolling in home health services and follow up and treatment on current patients within the program.It definitely slides downhill. Everyone has to much on there plate but if you're an LPN or below you are at the end of the slide. No breaks and 10 minute lunches are the norm....yet the RNS and providers don't know and they don't care because it's not they're problem. RNs have it''s not my job disease and will let a Vet wait for hours because it's beneath them to checkin a walk-in.  Then they lie to you about not knowing. Frustrating place to work. The Vets are OK. Some of the providers act like it's their own private practice and are very disrespectful toward non provider staff. I've never been treated with such condenscending arrogance,  and I've been an LPN for over 15 yrs..The hospital is a great place to work most people are friendly and willing to help you, great experience in the medical field learning new challenges and update in a hospital environment and great working with Americas greatest hero's OUR VETERANS!!!Very high pace environment with great compensation. However, management poorly manages people with a diverse background and acts unprofessionally at times. Management is not supportive of employees and can be harsh with deadlines. The culture is very punitive and negative.check messages often, check patients into clinic and made followup appointments. contact providers when their patients check in, or cancel appointments. I have learned different systems that the Veteran's Hospital use. Management is always there for discussions, suggestions, and family issues. My co workers are team players and get along with everyone.The hardest part of the job would be not enough time to go out for lunch. i do enjoy working with people from different background,The typical work day consisted of organizing files, scanning  and uploading them to the current server. I learned that no matter what your duty was you always had to finish what you started. My co-workers were amazing, friendly and very supportive. The hardest part of my job was locating the exact dates of a term. I really enjoyed this job and serving as a person who contributed.","10,000+",Boston,Bedford,MA,2016-10-07T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/2bfe1be1-3637-4cfb-813f-4a9823984fce?mescoid=2900470001001&jobPosition=23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

325,1037.0,Environmental Chemist,Amec Foster Wheeler,3.9,492.0,"This company allows the best work life balance by far, and great people to work with.  This is a large company so it does take some getting used to if you are coming from a smaller company (i.e. company policies/procedures etc can make it challenging.).Amec Foster Wheeler is a great company to work for.  They are competitive with salary and benefits, and they work hard to keep their employees.  The work environment is very comfortable, and the stress and pressure level is very low.every day our general forman preaches to us about ways to "" get our money"" inciting to get us fired. Our supervision wants us to do it their way and not the right way. Its honestly a poorly ran job site.Worked here for a year as front desk, awesome co workers. I was a temp therefore that is why I am no longer working there. Understanding boss and great atmosphere. Great company!I gained a great deal of experience.  Worked with many levels of management.  Relaxed but professional atmosphere.  Truly a work family at the local officeTypical work environment, you have good and just get along workers. Working doing equipment and piping is enjoyable. Making layouts work in existing plants is both interesting and challenging. Management helps to get the required items you need to do your job.great company.safety department always making sure we were all following safety rules and regulations. to keep us safe.I will go back any time if the opportunity was given.Joined a successful stormwater and water resources group.  Very good staff and solid leadership.  Large corporate structure that is impersonal.  Minimal appreciation for long hours and hard work.I enjoy working for this company, not only do they show there employees the up most respect but they follow up with there employees to see if the job expectation is able to be preformed to the best of the employees ability.Love the people.  Very team atmosphere.  Great place to growLots of opportunities  Always looking to improve and challengeVery much a work family atmosphere.Read and interpreted blueprints, plans, and drawings to ensure specifications were met.  Measured and cut iron and other materials to size specifications.  Collaborated with workers and managers to plan job requirements, timeline, and scope.  Performed flagging and signaling duties directing workers engaged in moving loads to ensure the safety of workers and materials.  Constructed, assembled, and connected structures, columns, and beams using bolts, hand and power tools.  Grinded metals to smooth and quality finishes.  Maintained work areas, tools, and equipment in a safe, orderly, and clean manner.  Followed all standards, rules, regulations, procedures, practices, policies, guidelines, directions, and codes to ensure safety, efficiency, compliance, productivity, quality service and workmanship.The company expects a lot of work,  labor, and places more expectations everyday. The worst part is you are threatened daily for not meeting goals or asking for a fair wage.After Foster Wheeler was being bought out by AMEC, changes to the employment roster was coming.  Good place to work with good insurance.Projected a position that was opened and laid someone off six months after they started.  Company is being affected by the oil/gas industry and not sustaining work for employees.This merger if Amec and Foster Wheeler was a very tough one.  Half of the company in Houston has been laid off. No one could foresee the oil and gas market having the troubles it now hasOn a typical day I provide numerous reports to various departments that include headcount, salaries, KPI, and government requirements.  It is sometimes very challenging because of the fact that my company is a Global company and has various systems that manage the HRIS and Finance for each Business Unit. My job is rewarding because I have spent many years working on all the different systems and truly understand how to manipulate the information to create the reports required of me.Some days we'd be overworked and aggrivated with management. On other occasions it would be completely different and fun. Plenty of water provided constantly through the day.All the people I worked with were very nice and friendly. I enjoyed all my tasks at this position and learned a lot about Instrumentation and engineering codes and standards.I learned a lot with working with different projects with different lead engineers! Building and designing panels and wiring diagrams. Worked in a very professional workplace setting! Hardest part of the job is when work is getting slow and lose out on bids for big projects and they have to shorten their staff!  Most enjoyable is when work is overflowing and getting overtime!! Learning and working with great people!  AMEC FOSTER AND WHEELER is a great company!Every day was a learning experience for me. What I enjoyed doing the most was working on the transformer units. Everything about them interests me. Looking forward to learning about turbines and would definitely take action if given the opportunity to attend Turbo School.Amec Foster Wheeler is a nice place to work. The atmosphere is pleasant and welcoming. Employees to mind helping employees. If the industry were better for Amec Foster Wheeler, this would be a great place to start and end your career.","10,000+",Boston,Chelmsford,MA,2016-11-17T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/40745d27-ce2e-4d11-84bd-f2a8c0878266?mescoid=1900259001001&jobPosition=29,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
326,1038.0,Semi-Volatiles Analytical Chemist,Alpha Analytical,2.7,12.0,"I was an extraction technician.I learned a lot about GPC repair and operation.Co workers were pleasant.The hardest part of the job, was gutting fish samples and mixing them with methyline chloride for extraction.Careful taking a job here - the problem with this company begins at management. They work everyone like dogs, pay low while management takes big salaries and bonuses. The workforce is pitted against each other and turnover is high.Don't waste your time here - look elsewhere.Great co-workers. under paid and over worked employees. bad company morale. However, they give bonuses and chances to win gift cards every so often. sometimes have mandatory overtime.A lot of turn over in the lab.  no room for advanecment.  long hours and very depending on time restraints.  Owners are very family oriented where management is not.Privately-owned company, 250+ employees, based in Westboro, Mass servicing many states.  Analytical lab providing air, water and soil analysis.When I was first hired I loved my job and the people I worked with.  Bonuses galore and great opportunities. I moved up very quickly and worked well with everyone. As I moved up, roles and responsibilities were increasingly unclear which often could cause problems when resolving issues. Management was different in each area. Some management was phenomenal and would work with you while other managers were unbearable and unmoving. Culture was different in one facility to the next.BAD MANAGEMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!BAD PAY unless you ARE MANAGEMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Owner should be ashamed for letting this company run as it does. Problem is he trusts MANAGEMENT.Problem of this laboratory is MANAGEMENT. Find another job. You'll be wondering why you took this job in a few months. It will be just a waste of your time.This was my first job out of college and was unaware how bad the conditions and treatment of employees. Subsequently I stayed, worked for four years, foolishly thinking that if you work had you will get reworded for it. Don’t be fooled, don’t work here unless you have to. They under pay and overwork employees. Also guilt or hold your job over your head to increase your work output. Please for anyone that reads this do yourself a favor and work anywhere else. Laboratory conditions are bad for your health management does not care how hard or effectively you work. Good luck to you if you work here and good luck trying to leave once your there. A nickname we used as inmates / employees was Alphatraz.The work and the culture of the company are quite rewarding personally and professionally. The lack of compensation in salary is what makes this company not a great one.  They seem not to mind a high turnover rate from employees.  The are a stepping stone for recent college graduates who eventually move on to better paying companies.most people are great, but be prepared to long hours.  Typical small company problems, but also the benefitssame as previously stated/reviewed. Intelligent and extremely dedicated co-workers who I thoroughly enjoyed working with and being around on a day to day basis.Despite being a company that deals with a 24 hour turn around time the atmosphere is upbeat.",,Boston,Mansfield,MA,2016-10-16T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/57d3defa-2bff-468d-9fd9-9c42349c187f?mescoid=1900259001001&jobPosition=30,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Lots of exposure to scientific techniques, and analysis of data.good place to work with advancements, depending on your position job may be boring. culture is strong and management is effective.

You also have to be there on favorite.I had a good working experience at MIT. It was a fun place to work  i had a great time at MIT The work we did was cleaning mechanical rooms. I hope I can find a similar job.MIT encourages a healthy work/life balance. Great location, great benefits, and great staff. They train you well on your job functions, and encourage you to seek further training on additional skills you may wish to acquire.It was a great experience, I learned a lot about restaurant management. Waffle House is a strong company, the pay can be great. I would go back>The management and staff you work with are some of the best people you will ever work with, hands down.  This was the best job I have ever hadWorked in a great group with a professor I worked with years ago, his team was young and brilliant.  Loved the folks there.  Just no room for advancement.  Each admin basically worked in siloI worked in Koch Institute, A Typical day here is going through emails see if any needs immediate attention. If not, then going through daily financial reviews and filing. Everyone here is friendly. Benefits are pretty good. Especially the tuition reimbursement. Not much room to grow depending on where you work.Years ago, MIT was a great place to work. Over my many years there, I watched it steadily decline as new poorly skilled and either military or corporate minded leadership was brought in. By the time I left, it had become a very dysfunctional place in which bullying, public verbal abuse, misrepresentation of data, lack of communication and transparency, and hiding behind consultant reports and buzzwords had become the norm.There are endless opportunities available. there is opportunity to be creative and innovative to achieve every goal.If you can take working weekends and are motivated to learn its a great job. Complicated plant and not enough training. Co-workers can be hard to break through to.It was good honest work, the people were professional and personable. A typical day at work for me was fast paced, repetitive, yet simple it was enjoyable and an easy learning curve. The management typically left me to my work unless there was a problem which wasn't bad but I didn't get to know my managers very well.MIT has an interesting blend of workers and researchers across its institution. It seems that departments can vary wildly in terms of culture and scope. What happens on one end of campus can be very different in comparison to the other end.At the Office of Digital Learning, I took on a role as one of the first 10 in a fledgling department. This requires me to be a bit of a jack of all trades, and each day entails something new.Worked there for many many years - loved the Institute like family. Amazing research - amazing students. I found however that the work load was a bit crazy at times and management didn't always have the staffs best interest in terms of advancement - work life balance.I was given the opportunity to work at the M.I.T. Museum for a temp position and had a great time. A job similar to this is what i would ultimately like to do fulltime.  Unfortunately i was only guaranteed work for a few months and had to take on a fulltime job elsewhere, otherwise i wouldve loved to work at M.I.T. permanently.Nice place to work. Flexible hours. Good and friendly project managers. Convenient parking locations. lunch n learn sessions. Good co-workers. thats all for now I dont recollect more points.Massachusetts Institute of Technology is a great work environment for researchers and young scientists who wish to start their career.",,Boston,Cambridge,MA,2016-10-15T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/4ebf1788-1100-48c5-b1c2-c3fc220deba1?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Any changes that was to be made, I was informed two weeks in advance.The work was challenging and interestingManagers in Business enterprise department are so helpful and they give the chance to junior engineer to express there opinion ..Co-workers are nice and helpful to each other. The company doesn't respect the employees at all. Once you are not valuable in their eyes, they will terminate you Right Away.Check out chiesebizblog.com if you want to know if you want to work for a non learning organization! I got to watch the Chinese be very Chinese outside of their home land...Eye opening adventures.At hauwei, we are like a family.different cultures, mentalities, and personalities. but when the goal is unified, we, all do our best to achieve targets.team building from time to time let the climate more funny in the company. Outside Training also help the top management to achieve more with their teams2 to 5 years is about the maximum for American employees in key manager positions. For a year prior to being ""laid off in good standing"", I was being told that I could not attend weekly meetings because only mandarin would be spoken. The loud and constant mandarin language was so deafening that sometimes I found it hard to think. I usually could not understand these people as well. It was a stressful and horrific Chinese owned company to work for.Colleagues are very niceGood work lift balance in my teamGreat training for new gradsInteresting workresponsible for the design of different parts of teleco facilitiesCheap company, cheap products, young management that's inexperienced and they expect you to work long hours. I'll give this company another year until they fold and out of the US.Controlled by China management. Nice and very hard working employees.Compensation competitive in industry. Travel required to China. Too much security hampers work.Learn new thing about Huawei technology Troubleshooting various issues on the network and resolve issue to make sure no unexpected outage occurs.troubleshooting the issue & Fault rectification done with short timeworking according to customer requirements to achieve cutomer satisfaction. Supporting customer for all the new requirments as wellOverall pretty competitive with compensation and benefits. Great 401k matching program. US top management lacks experience. Job culture is soso, not quite US style yet but definitely improving.Replacing Nortel Equipment with Huawei equipment:•	Testing T1’s with Dax and the Switch. Sweeping outdoor RF jumpers. •	Audit and Quality check for Cricket site.•	Moving T1 and Jumper cables from Pocket and Nortel equipment, making sure that they are ready for the BTS Huawei equipment’s.•	Troubleshooting T1’s and Jumper cables for any alarm related issues.•	Doing various configurations to set the BTS ready for the Cricket network.•	Doing Test calls for 911, 411 and other area codes making sure that calls are coming in and out of the network.An expat wears many hats within Huawei.  A significant component is knowledge transfer, whereby one is rewarded with great patience.  Every day offers new and different challenges.  We won a $1bn project with a large carrier to run their data centers.  However, three-months in the young national sent in to run things (often never having worked outside the country) is behind on KPI's and are to lose millions.  ""Go fly to Lagos, fix things, fall on your sword with the customer and while you are there sell them something"" about sums it up.All in all a rewarding experience, but a much greater challenge on one's family residing there.i have alot of chances of working with seniors engineers. because of them i have very strong base of  RF theory i think.working environment very friendly.it is a amazing experience.Very focused and people worked very hard. Management are details-oriented. Co-workers worked very well as a team.There are so many professionals in the user experience department, such as judge of Reddot, design manager from Moto. And many many international professors from United Kingdom, Northern Europe, America and South Korea, etc. They are so friendly and always open to answer your questions. I learnt a lot from them.Communist. Lack of concern for US government or people. Learned eastern practices in businessHardest part of job: East meets westTough culture, people work very hard.  Good pay and benefits.If you have change to work at this company, it is good, bad the culture is not goodworking with Huawei gives a good knowledge about the security and work professionalism as it is one of the biggest companies in the world.I enjoyed working at Huawei because i had an opportunity to expand my technical and people skills","10,000+",Boston,Boston,MA,2016-09-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/f85f1910-ed48-4fda-bc41-b2ac17a29faa?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

374,1086.0,Control Systems Research Scientist,FM Global,4.1,43.0,"I would come in and make sure e-mails are answered, filing is down, work on project assigned to make sure to meet dead lines.  I loved coming to work everyday enjoyed working with management and staff! working independently and  solving any problem that would come up.  I am ready for new and exciting chapter to begin.Great company with many opportunities for advancement.  Excellent benefits and competitive pay along with a great employees make this a great place to land.A typical day at work:  Arrive between 7:30 & 8:00 (my start time.)Phones would already be ringing since we are a Global company.  With the type of insurance we handled it was very confidential in nature and we made sure it was kept that way.  When not on the phone  customers would visit our private work area, or offices for an explanation of coverages.  Particularly the people from Europe since they purchase insurance differently in other countrie.. It was a very busy atmosphere.The company has excellent benefits; sick days, vacation days, flex time, 2 personal days, a gym , walking paths, excellent salary, long term disability coverage.  FMG is a big supporter of the United way.  During the fund raising time, they had various fun activThe most enjoyable part of my job was working with my client base.  That I loved. I also worked with great Account Supervisors who were  very knowledgeable of day to day operations and kept things moving.The best part of my job was interacting with people and providing assistance to those new to the U.S.  I simply loved it.The hardest part of the job me was setting objectives for the year and meeting them.  Also difficult was my initial budget exposure, getting reports  from  Finance and  becoming familiar with all the lines on the report.   What I learned:  Our CEO was the best.   Also, being a multi-cultural company I learned so much from the various people I met regarding their cultures and concerns.  I met people from London, Sweden, Australia, and every office where FMG set up location.There is so much I learned  more... it would be impossible to write it all down.But I always refer people to the Company.  lessIt was really nice working therepeople there are very friendlyI learned a lot while working thereCo-Workers are pretty freindlyI enjoy each and every moment Management is very goodThere was no typical day at workGreat place to work for anyone that's a loner and loves the open roadGreat Pay, Great BenefitsExcessive travel near zero office communityGood place to work if you have a background in Engineering and Insurance.  Very relaxed atmosphere with many, many long term employees.  People have spent their whole careers at FM Global.After coming from a larger insurance company, it's amazing to me how FM Global stays in business. The IS management has no real industry skill, and most of them only have their jobs because they've been here forever, ""Tenure over merit"" should be the company motto.There is no emphasis on career or professional development. While HR puts an emphasis on it, in practice managers just sweep it under the carpet, and ignore fundamentals like goal/objective setting, and skill advancement/training.Aside from incompetent management, and lack of career advancement opportunities, the work life balance is pretty good, and the benefits are adequate.Had I known what I was getting in to, I would have never accepted a position here at FM Global, and I would not recommend the company to any of my friends/colleagues.everyone are very supportive and has a lot of learning experience.Flexible to work.Fun to work with FM Global.The business is also really vast and a lot of free to express thought of natureHard to get to firedUnderstaffed and OverworkedManagement promoted due to tenure and not skillsgossip and backstabbing encouraged. Very political atmosphere.If you are looking to advance this is NOT the place for you.Nice vacation package, great benefits, 401k, health insuranceI worked for this company and was very unhappy with the job, the pay and especially the management - who are very sarcastic and treat the employees like overpaid idiots who can't do anything right! They even make up problems and put you in the middle just to prove their point! You try to defend yourself and that seems to make them even more determined to make you look bad! The pay is low and they didn't even give me a pay raise for the last three years that I worked there! They like to justify it by telling you how much they pay for your benefits. Come On! They treat you like a grade school kid by telling you not to be late because the CEO's window, in the Johnston headquarters, is near the entrance and he can see you! Like he even knows who you are!! SPARE ME! I worked there for ten plus years and had to work for the most agravating supervisor in the world. her name sounds like face. SHE WENT OUT OF HER WAY TO DO AND SAY EVERYTHING BAD ABOUT ME IN ORDER TO GET RID OF ME. I was glad to leave there and look for a better job with a good. That was a Big relief!A nice building to work in, but if you are applying with any experience or education it means nothing. People get moved departments due to years of work and are giving job roles with no experience.Most managers have worked their way through the ranks after years of grafting, and by pleasing the right people. The pay is below average, and they value benefits as dollar signs.If you are happy to work in a building with an average age of 40 + who have worked there for 10 - 20 years then this is the place for you.Finally they have bad management who are lacking social skills and people skills, who show presentations of themselves to their department, it is very cringe worthy.A good experience but at the same time it was comfortable but not exciting work. If you want a place to settle down this is that kind of company but if you want to be in a fast paced environment this is not it.Great benefits, nice work environment and job security.  Limited career opportunities for administrative positions.Working with professionals using cutting edge technology.Learned to support every operating system, infrastructure technologies, and client/ server supportGreat management, employee orientedco-workers are a great group of people both professional and personal.Hardest was keeping up with ever changing technologymost enjoyable is learning the latest technologyThis is a great company to work for in terms of benefits and great people, however those in management positions have worked their way up from the very bottom and although they are extremely knowledgeable in the tasks and skills required to get the job done, they fall short in effective management styles that need to be implemented for the success of a total department. Stable company, good benefits and pay, but absolutely terrible management - most managers are horribly unqualified to be in charge of people and take credit for the work of others. Also, too much nepotism and more lateral than vertical movement.I worked for six account managers doing a variety of jobs. I learned the basics of commercial insurance and always improving on my skills. Management was fair and responsive to ideas and ways to do my job more efficient, Co-workers were supportive and fun to work with. I really did not experience any difficult situations or jobs that I could not complete in a timely manner. I enjoyed going to work everyday and working for FM Global was an excellent experience.Small insurance office.  Headquarters are in Mass so little chance for advancement.  Busy work environment.Love the company, great benefits, great co workers lots to learn here at this company and they have been in business for a very long time.The organization is huge and the practices are excellent and work culture is wonderful. I have gained great knowledge from FM Global.Really nice place to workExcellent work cultureNot too big not too small in terms of work forceRelaxed work environment, not all that stressfulFair amount of independence in terms of approach to workMost managers don't micromanage","5,001 to 10,000",Boston,Norwood,MA,2016-10-18T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/e9b20a02-6f7f-4a76-a8aa-f663b562f4ee?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The nature of the business and global presence makes it difficult to have a good work life balanceThere is diversity among the ranks, however women are not equally represented in management.I learned how important is QA position for the product. I used to give feedback to the project leads which help them in development of the product.I enjoy working for AIR Worldwide. The people are great, the management is all right - there are few strange policies, but overall are pretty good.I wish the management would have little more trust in people and allow to work remotely. The company looses too many knowledge in good employees due to their migration, and not willing to keep them on staff working from their new homes.Solid company, great opportunity for advancement, but has its drawbacks as well.","1,001 to 5,000",Boston,Boston,MA,2016-11-17T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/2d480471-b8e8-4ff3-8bc7-8e4a0dbc045a?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=33,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

539,1251.0,Sr. Quantitative Developer,SunGard Financial,3.8,343.0,"People are fun and kind to work with. I've enjoyed the work place. Co-workers are intelligent and hard-working. I've learned a lot throughout the years.Sungard was  a great place to work. I ran the Telecommunications and internal infrastructure planning and implementation. In the end I wanted more experience with evolving technologies especially Cisco powered networks.Lots of room for advancement, enjoyed working there, good benefits, low salary.   Moved up quickly advanced to higher paying jobs, management was quick to recognize my automation skills and allowed me to automate numerous processes in various Trust and Investment related departments.I provided Operational Support for our customers in the Securities Finance Industry. I coordinated and set up procedures to receive and transmit files and reports for our clients using various methods of transmission and encryption. Assisted customers queries via phone and email in a timely accurate manner. Utilized schedulers to run programs at specific dates and times. Providing excellent customer service in a timely manner was always my priority. We grew from 30 clients to over 300 in the time I spent with this company. Fidelity bought the company in late 2015 and many senior employees were let go due to a reduction-in-force to cut payroll expenses. This had always been a great company to work for and truly hated losing this job.It is a good place to work and in many ways, I wish I had stayed with the University.  However, I was looking to expand my knowledge and thought that a consulting job would be interesting.  Unfortunately, the travel which was reported as 25% turned out to be 50%.Great people, young culture. Do what they can to help you grow as much as possible. Open door policy with management, I feel very comfortable if I need to speak with someone in upper management. The work is a grind and very hard, but if you are a hard worker and detailed oriented you should be fine.Extensive hands on Test Automation Coding experience for Unit, API or Functional Tests and Hands-on experience in building applications with either Maven, Grunt, Gulp, MSBuild, ANTHands on experience of automation tools (Infrastructure, Test, Build) and experience in operation and maintenance of Linux/WindowsThis is not a job for students. I started working here because it paid well, but the hours were only full-time, and the level of security didn't allow me much study time. Management was not that great, either.Typical day at work was generally putting out fires on a daily basis with people that everything was an emergency which is something I loved - never a dull moment.Co-workers became like family because you work such long hours you are with them more than your actual family.SunGard is a fast paced and innovative company with great products and solutions. While the company focuses on the financial markets, it does not slow the innovativeness of its solutions. SunGard also provides great opportunities for career advancement.Working Here started off good. But then came lies from management about promotion. the people they put in charge don't do anything all day but play on there cell phone,eat all day an complain about stupid stuff such as staplers in work, Sorry team leads they want the other workers to do there work. Pay suck!!!! keep up mess!! so call friends talk about each other behind there back. Management have there picks and chooses. bring in people off the street rather then hire in house they hire friends of friends sad how management work I would not even call that management because it's unfair and they don't care about the people that work there butt off. Fire people cause one of the managers/leads don't like them. not all departments some departments are awful.We are still going through the integration process with FIS but the transition has gone fairly well as compared to other acquisitions.   The FIS culture seems similar to SunGard.  Leadership team seems good and communications about changes have been transparent and informative.Great work experience and very happy to be associated with this company. Great place for entry-level developers and business analysis. SunGard is now FIS as they were bought in December 2014I enjoyed developing software projects and learning about retirement planning with the Securities Exchange CommissionIf you need a job that's flexible around your home life, SunGard is the place to be.  They offer great benefits compared to most although now that they're being bought out by FIS things might change.  I've never worked somewhere that you can take 4 hours off whenever you need it.  Sometimes this gets abused but they really don't care as long as you're happy.The company didn't last long.  They ended up closing down and I had to seek work at other places.  I really enjoyed working thereA great company to work; I didn't stay here very long to have an opinion one way or another. The nice thing is that you work at the company's location you're assigned to and that was pretty cool.I would most likely still be employed with SunGard EB Systems if our Charlotte office had not been closed.  I had the opportunity to relocate to FL, AL, PA, or CO but family obligations kept me in NC.I started at this job and moved my way as far up in the small company that there was room to grow. I felt I had learned and gotten promoted as far as I could so I decided to look for new opportunities.  I small company is great because you become very close with the people you work with but mobility has limitations.I have worked for this company for 30 years. It has offered many opportunities for advancement. Great co-workers.Very good co-workers , parties, no stress environment. Friendly management , lot of training sessions.

600,1312.0,"Scientist, Cancer Genetics",WuXi AppTec,2.6,26.0,"This place is great for entry level experience and no room for growth. Management is set in their ways and expect to advance only if you're Chinese or know someone in management personally. Nepotism is high within the companyWuXi AppTec is a great stepping stone job to get relevant work experience. There is a chance for advancement if you show interest and take the steps to get there. Overall it's a good company from my experience.Management has no education and no clue of daily activity, They hire friends with no experience and no clue of daily operations. You are hired for a position and then expected to work out of class. They dont respect your personal life. carry company phone with no pay while not at work and expect you to come in at all hours and call you at all times of day. and then they argue with you about call in pay. Take computer home for free with no pay for utilizing your private time. Biggest revolving door i have ever seen.Being payed hourly any time you take company property home you should be paid for your time spent after hours.People out of management are good to work with, But they are treated like puppets also with no respect.Work there is busy and can be overwhelming at times.There is great business growth but there is a lack of strong business foundation to support that growth. Co-workers are generally supportive but the employees are siloed with little business continuity between departments. Managers are not unified.  The hardest part of the job is working with other departments and pulling people in the same direction to accomplish a goal.The most enjoyable part of the job is using cutting edge science to solve some of the worst diseases. Salary and benefits are below the standards of other competitive Biotech and Pharmaceutical Companies.Work quality does not consistently achieve the standards expected.Management does not know how to communicate and does not respond to employee concerns, besides the fact that they do not follow policy by punishing employees for taking their designated breaks. Besides that, your eight hour a day shifts generally turn into twelve plus hour shifts, because you are not allowed to leave until everything is done.Always too much work and never enough people so overtime is expected.  Training is a bare minimum. Compliance is non existent so the place may be shut down after the next inspection. Management doesn't care as long as stuff gets done probably because people are getting paid off.Some days are hectic, some are relaxing; depending on the workload. I personally was working on many project simultaneously so my schedule was pretty busy. The workload is given to you is depended on your qualification and how you handle it. Overall it was fun time.It started out a fun place to work. As we became busier, turn around time became the focus. If we surpassed our goal, the got harder to reach. Management picks their favorites, if you are not one of them, sayonara. You've just become a tech with a bullseye on your back. High turnaround facility. I saw countless numbers of people quit or walked out. The benefits are fantastic and the pay is competitive. I loved the work. I miss the work, the benefits, and the pay. I wasn't a fan of the management. MANAGEMENT can MAKE or BREAK a great company. Phenomenal hard working people left because of management.WuXi is a growing company with many opportunities to learn new skills and get experience if you are willing to put in hard work.However they do tend to work people harder than you would typically see at big pharma, this is a good and a bad thing, while your experience and skills benefit, your work life balance can suffer.I worked as an Associate Sterility Laboratory Technician. The work isn't difficult it can just be cumbersome due to the extreme high turnover. I was there for a little over 6 months, and by the time I was left I was one of the most senior people. Management picks their favorites. The manager while I was there didn't care to make real improvements in the lab. Everyone is overworked and underpaid. They seem to understand and be quite ok with the fact that the people they hire don't stay long.The  technicians are fun to work with and they are good about following IACUC guidelines for animal care. However, they are very good about stringing contract employees along with ""open ended"" contracts providing no benefits and no job security.There is plenty of things to learn in different areas of the building and is located in the Twin Cities. There is a very thorough training program.For the money I made there I was happy but there was no management for my position, and the interpersonal relationships between employees was toxic. I tried to be a beacon of positive light and energy and as a result I was slandered by a coworker, which caused them to end my contract and not hire me on full time, even though I was promised on more than one occasion that I would be hired on full time. The job put too much responsibility on the staff and as a result we often had to stay longer than eight hours to do our jobs, and we did not take our paid breaks because we were too busy.  10-12 hour days were common for Animal Care staff. I was a tried and true team player who would come early, stay late and always stop what I was doing to help my coworkers, and as a result one of them went to my bosses boss and lied about me. When they fired me I called the whistle-blowers and after THREE WEEKS of waiting for a response the operator told me ""This line is for employees only, do NOT call here again."" I was not given a chance to solve any ""issues"" that had arisen, although I don't see how I caused any problems and I have wracked my brain over it. I was thrown out like a soiled diaper, not given a chance to explain. Before all this happened I told my boss that the person who later slandered me actually pulled me into the empty locker room and yelled at me until I broke down crying. Because she found out I talked to him, she decided to lie about me until I was fired. I did everything I could to show this person that I was her friend but all it got me was an inability to pay my bills.  more... I would tell people NOT to work for this company unless you enjoy working for a place where your boss is allowed to do nothing but check their facebook and ignore their crew. Working here has broken my heart and spirit.  lessA good place to learn many aspects of the pharmaceutical world from asking for batch records and documentation to manufacturing cancer cellular therapies. I was looking to get back into the pharmaceutical realm of science when I applied to this company and have learned a great deal since I have started. They are going through a large growth phase right now and have a hard time retaining employees due to a heavy workload with low pay for the industry (I took a pay cut to come here to get back into the pharmaceutical industry). Due to the large growth they are experiencing growing pains.All in all they are a good company, my experience has been extremely positive but I am ready to move on and find employment with more responsibility and regularity.I work in the Microbial Solutions division of WuXi AppTec and in a typical day, I run sterility cycles on medical devices and perform cleaning efficacy testing. I have learned much about the medical industry and microbial growth.The management at this company is poor, in my honest opinion and there is obvious favoritism show towards certain employees within my department by the department supervisor. This causes friction to build between co-workers and unfair treatment.The hardest part of the job is filing out paper work and the documentation, but the most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that, ultimately, you are saving lives.Great place to start, but not good enough to retire from. Suffers growing pains and revolving door of management and staff. Could treat employees better.A typical work day at alorica would be answering phones and enrolling people in there health , dental and visison benefits.Contract position because they did not have 2014 budget to hire full time.  Very tough communications, expectations.ok if you don't have plans after school.. Uncle sam is the way to goManagement has no plan for direction or growth other than own individual financial gainMy time at WuXi Apptec was brief (6 months) but I believe I had seen the worst it could offer. My department of 10 techs was turned over in that time, except for 2 testing techs. In other words, in a 6 month period, 8 of 10 people either left or were let go. This was due to poor management and lack of training/progression at work. Also factor in some manager's decisions to do things that enter a legal gray area, such as demanding unpaid overtime from contract techs. The only thing that made working here bearable were the other techs and some of the managers.",,Boston,Cambridge,MA,2016-05-19T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/250018d7-6978-4c77-bd7f-11a7bf17166a?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

634,1346.0,Associate Chemist II(2nd shift),UL,3.1,7.0,"Each day I visit a factory that could be of any type of industry and conduct a social compliance audit, where I tour the plant to assess the safety of the workplace, talk privately with the employees to gauge their experience, training and treatment by supervisors, and review of EHS programs as well as HR practices.I usually worked solo but occasionally partnered with another auditor from the team.  Our team is very supportive of each other and always helping each other in communication as we audit.I learned how different products are made, the OSHA regulations for health and safety, EPA regulations, and most of all, how to delegate different task items to different managers throughout the day and work with different types of people of different cultures across the country and Canada.  The most enjoyable job for me, at the same time, is working with people all day, getting to know people of different cultures and languages, and helping people learn things they didn't know and how to improve their facilities.The hardest part of the job is not being home as much, and not having a constant schedule, as I receive my travel schedule only a week in advance for each week.  It is also hard to do several audits within a week when there is residual work in the evenings to complete between audits, while having travel between audits in addition.  It is a challenge to balance work life and personal life.This company is undergoing so much change and trying to find its identity. This company has no direction at this time. They have no concern for their employees or customers. The turnover rate is extremely high and the moral is very low.This company and its management team makes many promises but doesn't keep them. I had many made to me about bonuses - pay increases - training, etc and not one was kept. As a matter of fact - I was scheduled for training and they pulled it from me but gave it to someone else who was the managers pet. And the managers show favoritism. It is not about if you can do the job and do it well - it is about if you fit their mold personality wise. You cannot and are not allowed to be your own unique self but you must conform to what they think you should be. They do not promote training, professional growth, advancement from within or anything that improves you as an employee and individual. The managers have their favorites and those favorites get all the special treatment. I highly recommend staying away from - especially the Franklin, TN location office.",,Boston,Canton,MA,2016-08-26T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/08d4a2c4-4690-41a0-ab26-1c8aa8f9fa60?mescoid=1900259001001&jobPosition=23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

640,1352.0,Research Scientist - Computer Vision / Machine Learning,Nvidia,4.2,100.0,"People are friendly.  Really organized.  I learned a lot about the systems and how everything worked at the site.  Management was great.  The only thing I really did not like was the fact that growth opportunities took a while.  I have a lot of experience in security but needed to be patient in order to grow in the company.Working is not clearly directed. Direction is being changed every moment. Management has no enough experience to work on the system product and handing the people who from various cultures previously.Nvidia was a great company to work with. Employees are smart and creative thinker. Company takes care of its employees.You would learn a lot of new technologies here.Nvidia is one of the best company. I learned lot from my team. People are very cooperative. Sometimes, work load was not manageable but over all I rate 5 out of 5.Great co-workers, fun, challenging innovative products.  Upper management tends to have unrealistic schedule expectations that leads to long hours, stress and low morale.Every GPU cycle presents new challenges, features and work. Nvidia constantly pushes the envelopes in all aspects and leads the industry with new technologies.Most of the time, I am working with multiple teams to bring new chips and features to market. I am constantly learning and am supported by capable leaders and peers.Constantly working on new features and different teams across the world means I'm working around the clock. Work/life balance is reasonable but at times can be quite challenging over long periods of time. Management has good vision and direction. CEO is always thinking years in advance and pivots the company when beneficial to the future. Nvidia is constantly pushing gross margins which can be felt at the engineering level. Intent is good but can be overly restrictive at times (e.g.: lab equipment, computer purchases, etc).Was very informative to learn about how conferences work from outside in. Worked from checkin to after party and concluded with take down of the event. Was a great learning experience working along side the Events team at Nvidia.it is good company and really friendly environment to work with. My daily responsibilities are debugging, troubleshoot and fixing all the RMA devices. Sometime i have to work with software engineer in flashing and making sure the devices have a good and functioning image. I have enjoy and love to work for this company.As with many big corporations, there's a big game being played on employees..here it was primarily using West Valley Staffing, the in house staffing agency to lure people in with potential jobs at a growing co/dept but in fact, the department has NO requisition/authority to make this contractor a permanent employee, and NO incentive to, because WV pays below market, with almost no benefits, no sick time, no holiday pay unless you've been there 6 mos, etc. Good luck going through years of being underpaid, below market, for the ""hopes"" of becoming a permanent employee.  (stories of people being contractors for 2-5 years abound)And the other game is people working cross functionally, with reporting/performance/pay managed by one manager, but actual work and projects with multiple managers who don't communicate, so no one really knows everything you're being asked to do, or should be paid to do.One thing to remember before starting a job at NVIDIA that is, you are responsible for your work. Super Cool people and super smart minds. Your every word has weight. So when you say something to management or peers you better get it done because your word stands for your commitment. You will get all the help you need but you gotta ask for it. Nobody is going to do spoon feeding for you. The best part about it is you will learn a lot in the process and you feel confident. That's my best take away from NVIDIA.fair place to work, the culture is not so good in my team, but some team is better, pretty much depend on the style of the managerManagement is off hand which provides personal growth There is a lot of room for creativity. Work here to work in a environment that promotes growth.Nvidia is a great company to work for.   It is well known for GPU products using in gaming and High Performance Computing.  It is growing in Visual Computing  and Virtual RealityThis was a volunteer experience in which I setup monitors, booths, posters, and tables for the GTC conference. In addition I help setup lan cables in each room to provide everyone with a connection to the internet. This is one of the most memorable and enjoyable volunteer work I have ever done. Talking to the executives during the conference and learning about IT and how important it is before a day of a big event opens my eyes about the men and women of the IT industry.The company is run by  business savvy engineers which is quite rare for a company of this size.  The primary focus in the mobile products is always on delivery of a quality product.The CEO has demonstrated the ability to make strategic investments without bending to shareholder fickleness.  Sometimes these investments work out, other times they do not.  This is extremely important for companies long term health.The company focuses hiring on top talent across the industry.  This results in a diverse workforce that may be overwhelmed but is generally quite technically competent.This company has no regard for you or your family.  As long as you perform you will be OK...but if you are not a culture fit.  Good bye.    It is micromanaged by a megalomanic.  And frankly there is not much upside in their product line.  Intel will eventually eat their lunch.highly talented peoplegood managementgood base packageco-workers support is very goodgood work-life balanceCompany always tries to come up with good products and has courage to enter new markets.Nvidia is a great place to work, but it's lacking when it comes to having a conducive environment for younger or start-upy kinds of employees. It's a very classic style of doing business, and many of the middle people (who've been there for less than 10 years) will tell you that you could do worse in many places, but you could also easily do a lot better.Management is pretty hands off, certain ones will micromanage, but in general the structure of power is accessible from the lower rungs. The hardest part of my position was being one of the very few people who represented the target market/audience, and so many of the people making these products wouldn't ever consume them, and that dissonance was aggravating to be around.Learning and Development team at Nvidia is fairly new and still going through growing pains. There is immense potential for great stuff here but the lack of accountability is the crux of the problem. A lot of the times we over promise and under deliver. That doesn't help matters for a young team that is still finding a place of its own. My grouse is that we are still considered a non essential function and pretty much operate like a service organization instead of being strategic!This was my first professional job. I suffered a lot but also learned a lot from my co workers and colleagues! Even though I left that industry but I still miss them!Loved working here.  I probably learned the most about being QA here than anywhere else.

660,1372.0,Chief Battery Scientist,Cabot Corporation,3.5,43.0,"Cabot is a leading specialty chemical and materials firm.  As such, it is highly dependent upon the ""value add"" proposition gaining traction to the customer.  This business model, when applied universally, translates to better margins especially in growth markets seeking more efficient product solutions.  However, in a stagnant World economy as we are currently experiencing, customer decisions shift to overweight economics compared to value.  This paradigm will over time lead to purchasing decisions being viewed as more commodity based especially in price sensitive markets such as energy.  In a Technically based Sales function, proving the efficacy of one product versus the other is difficult.  Especially when the customer views minor points of differentiation between your offered material and the competitors product as minor and has data to prove it.  It becomes a price and service competition with price being the key entry and decision point.  We struggled to compete on price as it ran counter to our business model.  Unfortunately, the market does not discriminate toward models and eventually reaches equilibrium.  This led to major conflicts internally culminating in Operational Cost cutting.  This required massive lay offs.Unless you fit in with the click or do non company things you will not work there. I worked there for almost 2 years and trust me Cabot is not all what it seems. I did not my work to the best of ability and was not enough,Cabot is a great company to work for. My skills were utilized and I felt challenged everyday.The people made the job enjoyable. All levels interact directly and there is advancement available in most departments.I learned more about Accounts Payable at Cabot which put me in a ""super users"" category using the JD Edwards finance system. With this knowledge I was able to train new employees on the system and help when needed.The hardest part of the job was the inconsistent workload.Event planning was also a job task that I enjoyed. Several times/year there were large meetings and events planned at our site that required customization and attention to details. This was the ""fun"" part of my job.Cabot has a family environment that is casual and easy to work within.  We are a small group that has overlapping duties.  It is challenging but rewarding.Overnight travel 50%  large region, 25-30% administrative work, Selling premium product in a very price competitive market.  Good customer relationships.Each day you were extremely dirty and it was unavoidable. The pay was great and some of the job duties were easy. In the end they laid off a lot of people for poor financial decisions.Managed entirely from Corporate. Lots of politics and posturing for appearances with no accountability for results at the top. Financial games lead to misleading financial results. Systems are obsolete and inadequate. Not a good place to work.Typical day involves a twelve hour rotating  shift with four crews working four days then off four day.  After four days off the day crew switches to nights with the night crew switching to days.Setting up and building new process development assemblies. Applying electronic-data collection and interpretation.I was able to improve my understanding of LabView programming, learned JMP software, executing DOE for multiple experiments.Supportive management but company having problems.  They are currently laying people off due to hard times.  They have treated me fair.A typical work day is spent chasing around what its corporate office wants---and there is no questioning them. Collaboration is non-existent in many areas, with individual skills existing in a vacuous environment. Cabot is a reactive not proactive company when it comes to investing in their people. Promotions and the limited training they have are catered to building its external image and gaining positive employer ratings. Lastly, unlike most companies today, bonuses only apply to management, especially its executive team.A typical day is either being bored out of your mind or work at a very fast pace. You could have 20 things that need to be accomplished in an hour to having 0 things to do all twelve hours. I have tried to become more proficient at time management. The management here is alright. My crew we all work as a team, so this is good. The hardest part of the job is not having enough people to do the job. This company follows the less is more style of tactics. The most enjoyable part of the job is the days off.fun place to work, group lunches, and casual business attire. paid holidays. Big company that cares about its employees and growth.Just a job, morale is low and I am told it has been for years. work schedule is long and being on call while on a long off is not a plus.Working for Cabot has allowed me to develop the skills and knowledge I possess today to be a successful Buyer. Management provides ongoing support and guidance. Overall culture is positive and nurturing.I worked at their production plant since 2008. Very busy and friendly environment when theres jobs. The company says they invest in their employees and help them grow in the company but not so much when me amd a couple other individuals that worked their as long as i have. I applied for multiple positions within the company to advance my skills but they ended up hiring someone from the outside. Would only go back if they hired me direct thru the company and up my pay rate to $40 per hour. Wasted 5 years of my life there.•Manager of a team in support of all manufacturing processes.  •Supports and trains Group Leaders/Team Members in all essential functions and skill sets as required effectively operating and continually improving their processes.  •Responsible for the work flow in their area of operation. Leads the team in safe and effective execution of production plans using a structured lean work and management system. •This includes leading effective response to abnormal conditions, leading problem-solving activities to obtain sustainable standards, and supporting continuous improvement efforts in their area.Cabot is a global manufacturer of specialty chemicals, with more than 40 manufacturing plants worldwide.  It is headquartered in Boston, in the Seaport District.  The company has been in business for approximately 130 years.The company produces carbon black, activated carbon, fumed silica, and a variety of other products.  Carbon black accounts for at least 75% of their revenues, activated carbon and silica account for almost all the rest.  These are commodity products, meaning they must product large volumes to earn profits.  They are at a fundamental disadvantage to some of their competitors, which are far larger and better capitalized.  Nevertheless, the company maintains relatively strong market positions.Cabot owes its success to a commitment to being superior to their competitors in engineering and R&D.  Unfortunately, the current management does not seem to value this nearly as much as their predecessors.  They have made a series of mistakes in acquisitions and divestments, which have put their viability in some jeopardy.Cabot is a very nice place to work in many ways, they pay well, and you can learn a great deal about business life there.  But there is a constant state of tension there.  People seem to get fired on a continuous basis.  The management is very anxious to promote their values in their words but their actions don't often match their words.The best part about Cabot were the benefits. The work was dull and a few of the people ruined the feeling of it being a good place to work. I would only recommend Cabot to people who are willing to deal with the hierarchy and really really really want to work with materials. Assist members of the Transportation Team in acquiring freight rates and booking shipments with carriers Ensure that there is a current freight rate entered in JD Edwards for all upcoming shipments Review daily Order Reports to identify new shipments and changes made to delivery times or locations of current shipments Maintain good relationships with carriers and coworkers in order to deliver excellent customer servicegreat company to work for, very flexible, works with you needs. interested in what you want to do in the future within the company.

Processing returns inspector, inspect returned packages from customers. Management is norm for a large company. Fun fast beat environment and co-workers make day go by fast. Hardest part of job learning new skills. The most enjoyable part of the day is doing a good job.Arrive at my cubicle and turn on my computers and other equipment in order to begin the workday. I( make sure I have a note pad readily available so if notes needs to be taken I can be prepared, and then I log into the phone and began  taking calls from customers and answering questions, processing orders, or making changes to customer accounts. I've learned to always be patient and considerate when assisting a customer and although they may not be right, but to give them the benefit that your are attentive to there needs. I feel Managers at Nobel needs more training in promoting and adhere to policy and procedures, and the hardest part of being an employee at Nobel is trying to grasp the entire technical aspect of there products and the most thing I enjoyed is everyone willingness to helpIt has an atmosphere where you are not micro managed and your inputs/ideas are taken into consideration and implemented if deemed fit.Nobel Biocare offered tremendous opportunities for both personal and professional growth, Their sales team was top notch and their leadership was forward thinking. The industry around Nobel appeared to be crumbling. As Nobel Biocare's primary product is Dental Implants and related components, when dentists as a whole began to struggle, premium providers did as well.Daily worked with some of the best sales people in Orange County and San Diego going on call (both cold and warm) to a variable selection of clientele; from the cream of the crop, the struggling new practitioner, and the upset log-time customer from years before.Enjoyed the pace, the camaraderie, and the holistic approached to business growth under management (most of which are no longer there).New HR department, New upper Management with no idea how to manage, has taken them years to learn the process and still have no idea what they are doing.Huge brand recognition with this company.  Great solution based consultative sales approach.Swiss Company with much of there marketing and strategies coming from Europe, not the US.Poor upper management with no comprehension of how to run a manufacturing facility. Decisions are made without input from the local management.No job security.Its a good place to work, unfortunately headquarters is in Zurich and upper management are moving all positions to Zurich and there are no opportunities to grow in US.Great company with good advancement and benefits.  Traveled extensively throughout USA and supervised a direct selling sales force of 50+I really enjoyed working at Nobel.   I learned a lot got to travel and gained alot of knowledge.I learned many aspects of different processes and equipment.embrace change and challenges; enjoyed helping customers in all walks of lifeGood company good products. Pay well.Alot of trainingGood cultureThe position of a Customer Support Representative was based in a Call Center that consistently provided 5 Star Customer Support. Co-workers always worked as a team to get orders placed in a correct and timely manner in order to gain our customers loyalty and repeat business.  As a Customer Support Rep it was our responsibility for processing orders for dentists, laboratory technicians, purchasing agents, dental auxiliaries and Nobel Biocare Sales Representatives through in-bound phone, fax, mail and e-mail.  Assured orders were correct and accurate, gave special pricing such as discounts, shipping information and documented product complaints in accordance with company guidelines per FDA and OSHA regulations. Kept abreast of current products and procedures as required by company standard operating procedures.   Hardest part of the job was sometimes making a management decision with little or no supervision. (Keeping the customer satisfied and problem solving)The most enjoyable part of this job was satisfying the customers needs and hearing how much they appreciated our help.  Worked for Nobel Biocare for 14 years started as a Government Customer Support Rep for 10 years dealing with over 200 accounts world wide. The last four years still handled Government along with civilian customer accounts.A typical day at Nobel Biocare was working with friendly people (co-workers and management included) in a very well managed, fast paced productive environment. All days were steady with the inbound receipts of product, and the processing of outbound customer orders. I learned many things while being employeed there. I was very eager and wanted to know how to do everything, which paid off over the years of being employeed there, by starting at an entry level position and working my way up to management (supervisor). Training others, writing reviews, addressing issues when they arised, coaching employees, delegating and prioritizing, assessing and evaluating operational processes while seeking ways for improvement, order pulling and inventory control are amongst some of the things that I learned. Hard time during the job were minimal. Some minor challenges that occured were just exceptions that come and go, but never made me not want to go in on a daily basis. Some of the descision making and planning of certain things could have been handled differently and would have acheived more success. I enjoyed going to work everyday due to how well the organization was being managed, having the opportunity to learn new things, as well as all of the friendly people that work there.","1,001 to 5,000",Boston,Framingham,MA,2016-10-13T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/37446b2d-20b9-460d-b128-3e3c9f7f7d94?mescoid=1900254001001&jobPosition=16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

664,1376.0,Atmospheric Remote Sensing and Radiative Transfer Scientist,Verisk Analytics,3.6,25.0,"I am an employee of this company and have been for a very long time.  Over the last five years the place has been through a tremendous shake up and as a result are basically going nowhere.   You have the old teams holding the place together and the new teams are essentially run by whoever can use the right buzz words. Lots of empty suits there.Good place to work. Management effort to anticipate needs requires Sr. Mgmt support.   People work hard and are professional although understaffed.Work life at Verisk Analytics is interesting , it has a very good work culture and environment. I have learned many things after joining Verisk Analytics technically,economically and operationally. Hardest part is to get to the place in traffic and i enjoy everyday in the work.Great place to work with exceptional management.  Flexible schedule since you make your own appointments.  Supportive company culture.Since beginning, I was so excited to work in such a good company with a lot of growth opportunity. The first months of being in Verisk spent participating in series of trainings as expected. I was so fresh and inspired to apply my knowledge and learn new things in this new work environment. However, as we moved forward and time past, I started getting less and less passionate and it became more like a dreaming instead of planning. My manager was too busy to have a good conversation and communication.A lot of overlapping and super chaotic. It is not a streamlined organization and far having processes and functionality in place. A lot of cutting corners and the company will not spend to have proper support of teams.it was amazing place to work and it has good work culture and fun loving place.there is alot to learn and my co workers were so supportive.old mentality, cant get buy in to get anything done, yet they expect changes. not good management culture, with below average management skillsLoved working there and hope to do so in the future. The people were fantastic and extremely helpful in laying some ground work for my careerProductive and pleasant company to work for. Each employee brings to the table, something different to offer the company. Management is very supportive and helpful in all aspects. This is a big and growing company, but there's lots of room to thrive as an individual.The management is very nice and they will work with you if any family issues arise. Compensation is good; some positions, too good. There is a large learning curve due to the nature of the business.You are based out of your home and receive orders of companies that have been selected for inspection. The job requires knowledge of the insurance industry which is very extensive. All the regulations, compliance codes, and safety restrictions need to be known. If you miss something in your inspections there could be serious consequences such as monetary losses for the insurance companies or even worse injury or death of people. Management says that they are always available for questions as are other employees, and for the most part this is true. However, many times no one is available to help you and it is up to you to figure it out. This can lead to wasted time to make sure you are following ISO/Verisk rules and the customers rules as well. A typical day with this job depends on if you are in the field performing inspections or at home writing up reports. The field days are the best by far because you see many things that most people will not get to see and meet lots of people. You learn a lot about different industries and how business flows with these companies. The hardest part of the job is getting appointments for inspections. Management says to get all of your inspections into 1 to 2 days, but this difficult to do as these companies are available at the time you give. When you call most people don't want to talk to you because they think you are selling them insurance.If you are a strong self starter, are knowledgeable about the insurance industry, and can handle a very fast paced high stress job you would be fine in this position. There is VERY little chance  more... for promotions and moving up. The benefits are very good and you get a nice 401k and stock options.  lessA good company to work for, just the Compensation could be a lot better. Friendly staff, good training and the location is pretty good.Some reorg recently due to company structure and acquisitions, but company is heading in the right direction. Constant innovation and opportunities to move within the company. Salary could be better.Very high turnover because they hardly promote from within. Tendency for company to hire higher-level analysts rather than promote from within.Very relaxed environment with little to no stress but you get what you don't get paid for.Verisk Analytics was a good place for me to obtain working experience and an understanding of working in the corporate culture.Good employment opportunity.  Worked at ISO/Verisk for 17 years.  Employees are helpful.  Politics are minimal.  A vast selection of technologies to learn/master.  Somewhat flexible hours.Verisk Analytics was an amazing place to intern while I was in college. They taught me valuable skills and lessons that I use everyday in the workplace. The management was extremely welcoming and knowledgable.Verisk has a very good vision within IT and is willing to do what it takes to get to that state.They are willing to give you any job related training you seek.Great company and nice place to work.  The people that you work with really make this place enjoyable.Typical day at work attend meetings,  Delegate tasks to team and assist with outages. Plan for future growth and direction of Datacenter  Operations.  Encourage the team to do better and take on more responsibility.",,Boston,Lexington,MA,2016-07-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/7b6f9847-3594-4ac6-bd7e-e49d692919d9?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=18,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
665,1377.0,Sr. Principal Research Scientist CCTR Cyber Network Defense,BAE Systems,3.9,1700.0,"BAE continues to be out of touch. Instead of being cutting-edge the motto seems to be just ""cut"". Management constantly changes incorporating their own vision without regard to the impact of employees. The job market is difficult, but this company's mentality has declined dramatically over the years. Do not expect a long-term career unless you are upper management. The most enjoyable part of the job are the co-workers. Great team-spirit and a willingness to work hard and do their part. However, this is sometimes strained because of constant layoffs and fear of job security.The company has a great legacy and terrific potential, but management needs acknowledge several of the elephants in the room and work with all the employees to address them.Long dirty hours in harsh enviroment. There was nothing enjoyable about this job. Would not recemmend for long term employment.It is an excellent company to work for. They have great benefits and the company is very large and they can place you on another contract, if the one yo are on expires in most cases.Experienced a hostile work environment with my co-worker, who felt I had ""oversold"" my skills and experience and was therefore not worth the air I was breathing in our small office. Management felt otherwise. Funny, that co-worker no longer works for BAE... karma strikes again.Great job for people who love working in an industrial environment. 8-12 hour workdays.   Multiple shifts can work basically from a typical work day to weekends only.  Beautiful new building, nice healthy lunch room.   Company has an employee fitness center.  offers overtime and its not mandatorywell it was soso when there was work i was great but when there wasnt it was pretty hard the days were average i was able to learn a little co-workers were oddIts allowed me to get rehired a couple times so I really don't have bad things to say. it was a good environment. about the only issue I had and did not agree with was on the 11/08/16 we had a meeting between HR and my head of dept. and we agreed that I was going to be allowed to return to on 11/09/16 wich I deed and at 12:30 I was called to the office and got terminated for missing days after I was told to take time for the passing of my mom who had dementia so I was somewhat disappointed for going back on what was said on the meeting other than that its a great place to workBAE is extremely fast paced with requirements changing daily.  Employees are willing to adapt and think quickly in order to reach the end objectives through the difficult periods.A typical day is great something different everyday. Work is not to hard but very satisfying knowing that you are detrimental to the whole weapon system process of ship building.I worked at the Land & Armaments group in Santa Clara, CA for 6 years.  Unfortunately, the location was closed and the capability moved to Michigan.  But while I was there it was a great place to work.  Healthy work environment - no good-ol-boy network, nepotism or discrimination - a truly enlightened management who treated people fairly and with genuine respect.  Good work/life balance, ethical business practices and friendly and supportive peers.I enjoyed working here. I performed automotive assembly work which was great. We often worked ten to twelve hour days so we made a lot of money from overtime.BAE systems was a good work environment. It was pretty organized already, so all you had to do was keep everything in order.I admit that it could be a bit tiring, but once you have the routine down, it got easier.aboeing is fun you just work a ton of hours if your a contractorthey say that there is no prejudice towards contractors or Direct hires but that is false....they will treat you like dirtA great company that values their employees. I would typically work on different projects mainly assisting other employees who need certain files from the repository. I enjoyed being able to complete the tasks assigned to me and helping other employees by keeping the entire repository database organized and accessible by anyone with access.all of us works helping each outher with no one getting hurt to get the jobs done faster and right the fist time if you get the job done right the fist time it well get to the job on timelove working for BAE, the people are great and the management is always available to help. The only downfall is that its contract work. never know when your last day .Software coding on a long term project for the Court system Good Management Had Great Benefits Learned a lot of Computer Technology from UNIX to Windows and Networking protocolsBAE Systems is big. I wish they had more ground maintenance programs like the one they had in Hawaii.  Repairing and servicing government vehicles meant work was almost guaranteed. co workers who looked forward to work (for the most part) made it a fun place to be.I had worked at BAE for many years and the experience was great. They are a Government Contractor and as the contracts end there are Lay Offs as I was caught up in.BAE Systems is an outstanding company that annually requires Ethics training.  There is a tremendous amount of online training available and multiple contract opportunities.","10,000+",Boston,Burlington,MA,2016-07-12T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/cf333202-0abc-4a5e-9922-27be1c58754f?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=19,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
