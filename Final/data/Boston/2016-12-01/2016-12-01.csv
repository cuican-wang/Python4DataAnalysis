50,762.0,LCMS Applications Scientist,Agilent,4.2,270.0,"I had the privilege of working with great people. Would recommend others to work here. I worked here for almost five years.Agilent is a good place to work and corporate management has secured a competitive edge in many of the products that are manufactured. The facilities are excellent.Good company to work for with a nice, clean, temperature controlled environment with a good work/life balance. Competitive and comparable salaries and benefits to other companies in the area.Agilent is a solid company with good prospects.  They have made some good business moves in the divestitures.  The management is experienced and and seem to be executing on a good strategy.productive and fun workplace with ping pong tableI had a great work life balanceGreat coworkers and work environmentHaving too many levels in organization, slow pace, silo culture.This job help me understand the importance of handling material and delivering chemicals in a timely need matter. A typical days job requires you to, cycle count weekly reagents, SAP transactions, working with buyers, planning weekly pick-ups with the vendor.I was fresh out of college when I started at Agilent and the team took me on with open arms.  This was a great place to learn and develop my career, as the entire company was welcoming and helpful.Though the work itself can become a little tedious, this is a wonderful place to work. The culture at agilent is amazing, and all of the employees are always ready to help with anything.I love my job my job with Agilent and look forward to many years of employment within the company. The company has a great work life balance..Not competitive in today's market, claims wants to be a leader in the life sciences arena. Has a long way to go!Agilent is a left behind branch of HP.  Its continuous struggle to modernize it's culture is plagued by the old HP residual culture which supports large unaccountable layer of bureaucracy that suppresses innovative spirit.  Having a great idea is not good enough and often innovator is intimidated by those who is not accountable for any relevant task.  This company culture reminds me of communism, job security means 100% brown-nosing your superior and learn how to hide in plane site with lessez-fair.  Agilent needs new leadership blood, same people cannot improve its old culture because they don't know what to change to.  Agilent needs to redefine itself form ""Old HP"" image, it needs at least to be ""New HP"".Agilent was a temporary position that allowed me to explore the world of technology. It allowed me to use my IT education to assist in helping customers. Coworker in particular spent 70% of time on Facebook, Facetime and talking on cellphone (no exaggeration) which was distressing to see especially when as a new worker I had to go to her when a question arose and had to wait till she finished.I thoroughly enjoyed my position and the interfacing with other division people that went along with my responsibilities.  An excellent place to seek employment.PRO'S: job security, training/furthering education, stock/benefits. Very flexible with schedules and family oriented. Most positions allow you to work from home at least part time which can be an added perk for most.CONS: not a lot of job advancement because their current upper management have been in those positions for long periods of time. (good for older generations, bad for the younger generations). I can't speak for all of the Agilent locations but at the Santa Clara location (HQ), there were very few employees under the age of 35 - culturally and socially different than many other large companies within the bay area.Great job which involves sales of chemical analysis equipment. The job entails calls and faxes to get service contracts. For the equipment that we sell and make the quota each month for total revenue.Most people are paid well and many groups are relaxed with a good work life balance.  However, there is little to no opportunity for career advancement and the recent reorganization/reinvention of the corporation appears to be killing its future.  The primary corporate focus now appears to be saving for the bottom line and not innovative product development or customer satisfaction.Acquired by Modis.  Talented and innovative technology professionals—and the companies they work for—drive today's rapidly evolving IT industry. At Modis, we help the industry continue to advance by connecting the best tech talent with the most rewarding companies—creating a win-win situation.Typical work day was taking service call from customers.  Equipment serviced was HP servers, storage units, disk arrays and network equipment.  It was a tuff job because of all the travel but a good experience over all.The variety of work assignments for this position made it an interesting and dynamic job.  There was always something new to learn and manage, whether it was information driven or technology driven.  The diversity of assignments and the opportunity to work with a global team made it a great experience.Great work/life balance, compensation/benefits, management and culture.

Organizing and keeping up with lab equipment was very important as well as carrying many medical files and placing them in alphabetical order. Great environment to work in, hardest part was carefully placing the slides in their storage area having to be extremely careful. Easiest job I would say keeping up with the records and maintaining the lab equipment and assisting others.A typical work day was pretty med range as far as stress levels go and the work loads are not to bad. You go in, wait for a delivery truck to drop off your work load and then you began your work which takes about 2 1/2 - 4 hours and you are on your feet the whole time.I learned better time management and to speak up if I had an ideal that may better the business. Nothing good to say about the Management team so I won't speak on it. Co-workers are like family. The hardest part of the job was trying to remember all of the protocols to are continently being changed every few weeks. Second half of the work day which was light and some of the positive people I worked with was the most enjoyable part of the job.The job I was hired for didn't have long to really take off.  After a few weeks, my boss learned that his new boss was transferring the project we were working on, over seas and the whole team would need to look elsewhere for a position - either within Quintiles or outside of Quintiles.A company with lots of opportunity to do different work projects, however it does not afford those opportunities to those lacking experience in specific jobs, therefore not a great place for growth.Develop recruitment strategies and an enrollment plan with the investigator and site staff to meet recruitment goals in coordination with the Global Monitoring Plan project recruitment plan and conducts evaluation, initiation, routine monitoring and close out visits at each assigned study site, as outlined in the Global Monitoring Plan.Decent pay scale, benes, and bonus opportunity in management.  The lab business unit has always been chaotic without enough applied vision.  Clients generally allowed to dictate timelines.  A lot of good people on staff, but burnout is a significant problem.  The merger with Quest Clinical Labs brings potential for significant change, but uncertainty ahead, especially for redundant resource bases.Quintiles is a great place to work.Competitive wages.Competitive insurance.Many opportunities for upward mobility.Quintiles provides a stable environment within an evolving and changing market.Quintiles is a great company to work for ten years. Excellentsalary with benefits including gas card, car allowance as thejob requires travelling to physician offices in Greater Philadelphia.Team spirit and positive environment. Leadership encouraged.Job security is a plus if you make it to permanent employee, but temps are hired and fired with reckless abandon. Very little mobility in the company that isn't predetermined. Management is toxic and underhanded, with almost no transparency and a lot of ""because I said so"" reasoning that has no place in the work environment.If one makes permanent employee, be prepared to have drastically increased responsibilities over time with little to no increase in pay as a result. Low starting pay, and doesn't even increase to stay competitive with inflation.Strong background in project management, technical training, and support.

93,805.0,Principal Data Scientist,Aetna,3.8,1800.0,"Aetna is a good company to start out a career in. It is a small, family owned company, however room for advancement is narrow and opportunities do not arise as quickly as one would expect. The typical day to day is a fast moving environment that includes quick problem solving, on the spot customer relations, and high attention to detail. Co-workers are wonderful, and everyone is willing to jump in to lend a helping hand. Management is supportive and always available to work with and talk to when/should a problem or need for help is called upon. The hardest part of the job is time management due to the ever changing day to day responsibilities. I enjoyed the daily grind and electrical side of my duties.I did not check the ""job security"" rating due top the fact that my tenure at Aetna/Coventry was a contractual position through U.S.Tech Solutions, Inc, .a New Jersey based staffing company. Atypical work day revoled around speaking to and contacting customers regarding medicare benefits using the computer to enter information into the data base.  I learned quite a lot regarding health benefits and members need for information.  Management and coworkers were excellent.  There were no real difficult aspects of the position and the most enjoyable part regarding  the position was theteam work atmosphere. Enjoyable work place because different coworkers would bring donuts and coffee and pot luck lunchesVery effective with time management to meet various deadlines.  Must communicate effectively with internal and external customers regarding billing, accounts receivable and installation of new customers and revisions of existing customers.  Must daily reconcile payments received for book of business and allocate to various benefits and confirm that the reported information falls within our edit limits. Must be aware of various differences in state legislations and how it applies to benefits.This experience has been wonderful with regard to my co-workers. Everyone is supportive of each other and we celebrate our successes. People take accountability for their actions rather than looking for a scape goat. The hardest part of the job has been that it is predominantly a work from home position. It would be nice to have the opportunity to be in the same room with the co-workers for projects etc. That being said, the most enjoyable part of the job is working at home. It is easier to be productive when working solo as there are minimal distractions.I entered into Aetna Better Health of Ohio with great expectations. My hope was to be with this company until retirement. From the start, I felt that management was very eager to just push me around into different categories and the right hand did not know what the left hand was doing. A LOT OF TURNOVER!!! Providers are constantly told we have your claims, appeal, dispute information, then they call back after 30 days, then they are told, sorry your information is lost, resubmit it again, this is done after 3 times in a row, going on 2 years now. Very unethical company. I am glad I no longer work for them. Benefits were ok, similar to what the members have....Aetna has been a great company to work for. I've had the opportunity to express different departments allowing my knowledge to expand from behind the pharmacy doors to adjudication and transcribing request. My experience expanded beyond the pharmacy area and into medical. Patient management was a different experiences  that I grew to understand and appreciate  the medical field. Leading me to get a degree in Healthcare administration.Been here 3 years and my department management is horrible. If your not a favorite of the managers forget about raises and help all together.  Cases are piled on you and then when you fail qa it is all your fault. Complaining to HR is useless.  Mangamemt will throw ypu under the bus to save themselves.  Health benefits are a joke. High deductible and premiums. Only perk is they offer work from homeI was with the company for 23 years. I worked in  Enrollment, Coordination of Benefits and Accounts Receivable. When I was the supervisor in Accounts Receivable my focus daily was to ensure the payments were processed timely. I worked well with my peers and coworkers. I enjoyed most was the people I worked with. I didn't have any experience  in Accounts Receivable in 1996 when I was hired and they gave me an opportunity. I learned everything and I enjoyed coming to work daily.Enjoyed working at Aetna.   Insurance benefits could have been better but, good enough.  Management was good and enjoyed  working with them.  Some of the mangers were better than others, as with most big companies.  Salaries were raised to meet cost of living expenses, which was great!The recent changes to the healthcare requirements as defined by ACA caused major changes to the plan administration and plan benefits.  Aetna's focus on living healthy lifestyles played a termendous role in the successful implementation of the changes and the positive results.  There were some negatives as well, such as reducing staff by transitioning some positions to offshore vendors.  One of the most difficult things to overcome was meeting customer demands with a much leaner staff.  Everyone works extremely hard every day and puts the members first.  On days when I was able to make a difference in someone's life by expediting a claim payment or providing information on plans which were critical in the member making the best decision for his/her healthcare needs is the most enjoyable part of my job.  Healthcare is very complicated and can be confusing to many people and they need guidance, especially in situations where the decision is critical healthwise and financially.I am currently with the company but seeking a position outside Aetna.  Promises made to me when negotiating for my hire were not kept, my role keeps expanding with no adjustment in salary, and an exemplary review resulted in about the same pay increase as an average employee. I believe there is significant pay disparity between myself and a male colleague with the same skills, education, and experience.Used to be the most excellent company to work for; however, much is lacking today in terms of production expectations and deliverable quality within those expectations. The ability to provide excellent customer service is hindered due to the unreasonable standards of production.Company will work you to the bone with volume that is completely unmanageable with expectations that you will meet deadlines.  No lunch breaks.  No compensation for overtime worked.  Upper management very slow to approve positions, even though employees are burning out from work stress.Job is very challenging everyday, I truly love my job just would like to be compensated for my I bring to the company. the most important part of the job is helping providers with members, providing the correct benefits and processing claims correctly. I have learned so much with Aetna, how to display good customer service values. Always putting the providers or the members needs first.salary employee ending job 10-12 hours/day X5 days/week,  Poor life balance. Not even enough time to exercise, though they advocate this. Since new manager took over in Spring she has not talked with staff, only my direct boss has team meetings weekly. Alot of required meetings are a BIG waste of time, new programs started prior to being tried on smaller scale, protocols in place and questions answered.A typical day at work consists of processing a minimum of 12 medical claims per hour, based on CMS guidelines. Over the past 2 years on this team I have learned a lot about the coding and how to make sure the claim is ok to pay. The management I honestly very good people, the co-workers are very friendly and eager to assist  with any  help that may be needed. The best part of my day is knowing I have did my job and did it correctly.Good work culture in the Portland office but very poor compensation and benefits. I would not like to work there again. The company expectations do not match the compensation. Experienced several issues with my benefits. Employees can't afford the health insurance the same company provides.I have learned so much working at Aetna.  In essence I group up there.  I learned how to file, to manage, provide great customer service and how to be on a team.The management I have encountered have always been fair, accommodating and helpful with your career choices.My co-workers are like family which is the reason I have been here for 27 years and 15 of them within the same unit.The hardest part  and most challenging part of the job would be the multi-tasking.  A lot of different balls in the air.  This is what makes the job exciting to me.The most enjoyable part of the job is the atmosphere of the workplace the interaction with the clients and the ability to work in a non-micro-managing atmosphere.Aetna was a great place to work.  The management is very supportive . A typical day was talking to the agents about their commissions and computer work to make sure they get it on time.-I learned how much a little extra effort is really appreciated here-The management was really good. Great leaders- Mixed emotions on the coworkers-hardest part of the job was dealing with computer glitches -best part of the job talking to all the agents. They are great..Don't work for Aetna if you can't deal with a lot of stress. They used to be a good company but terrible now. Benefits are bad and no job security  in the call center. They expect way too much and put tons of stress on their employees. It's not worth itprefer not to be negative great place to work if youre lucky to be in a good organization. last management team was disconnected worried only about numbers not interested in feedback or improvement suggestions.","10,000+",Boston,Boston,MA,2016-12-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/7673bcef-8c08-463c-b78a-5599df260f24?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

214,926.0,"Quant Developer, Assistant Vice President",State Street Global Advisors,3.5,875.0,"I have worked for State Street on and off for years.  I loved being a part of their corporate and community culture - there is no typical day, inasmuch as the company is huge and each division has their thing.For the most part, employees are working almost each other in teams specific to their skills and knowledge basis. Everyone is approachable and independent work is a crucial aspect to the working culture here.Huge company with limitless potential. Made great connections. Demanding, challenging and high-paced work environment. Little support for managers. Lack of individual focus makes certain tasks difficult to complete properly.I hope you got some good manager but unfortunately the manager i am working with is very non-professional and treat you like slave because you are contractor.Management by committee can be quite frustrating. If you want to punch a clock, have a lot of flexibility, aren't frustrated by a lack of support (e.g. call the help desk for everything and rarely get on-site support OR self service for things that are not your expertise). Then this is the place for you.SSB is a  good stepping stone into the professional world. There are many opportunities there and the lots of good people to grow with. They continually promote growth and new opportunitesI only worked here for a few months, but I was able to see in that short time that State Street was a great company. I learned a lot during my internship, and it has helped me throughout my life after college.Expense cutting and under investment has led to long days at the office.  Company has been having annual layoffs for 5 plus years and don't see that changing any time soon as it chases quarterly eps.Good place to start your career, but if you stay too long, you will see that the salary raises are minimal, bonuses are not great and promotions take a long time.  Bottom line, expect to work very long hours for low pay and the compensation isn't great.Great group with opportunities for international travel and assessments of banking operations around the globe.Collaborative team and superior management.Amazing work/life balance, depending on the team.I learned the accounting skills for 18 years at State Street Bank. Many classes are on line that need to be updated every year to take and tasks are cross training. However jobs are sent to oversea for downsizing now and next 4 years so they need to fire to meet their budgets!!Fast paced and dynamic. All engineers were extremely professional. As a financial institution, the bulk of the work was done off hours. This allowed us to work unimpeded.State Street is a very nice place to work if you are looking for a serious, yet not quite overly rigid work environment. The dress code is conservative, and the culture is friendly. There is a hierarchy that must be respected at all times, but that doesn't mean you can't talk to the people above you.Management doesn't clarify job specifics to well.  I learned how to designed websites and other minimal tasks I've never had to do before.  My co-workers are great the management team needs some help.Working for SSGS has been the worst experience of my life.  Their is absolutely no sense of team cohesiveness and management fails to take any responsibility for any issues within the job.Fast-paced deadline-oriented environment. The associates in the operations groups are knowledgeable and motivated. Work/life balance can be cyclically impossible depending upon the business area. Task variety is challenging in a good way; a person can develop many useful skills.Most of the time hectic due to needed to handle multiple task every day and deal with internal and external managers, sub-custodians banks and transfer agents, domestic and abroadTypical financial services company.  Diverse environment to service client base in most of the leading investment vehicles that are currently on the market.Great Company to start the career. I was joint this company at 2015. This is the first position that I received after school. It is a good reputation in the industry. However, if you want to achieve a higher standard, I suggest you to take the CFA and move to IBD.Corporate atmosphere and people were good to work with, lots of collaboration, however company wide lay-offs occurred too frequently.Great work-life balance as well as benefits for employees. Competitive pay out of college. Work environment is clean and co workers are always friendly. Passionate about giving back to the community","10,000+",Boston,Boston,MA,2016-12-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/9717c2c5-682c-45fd-a16a-5ce19b771cc6?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=23,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
