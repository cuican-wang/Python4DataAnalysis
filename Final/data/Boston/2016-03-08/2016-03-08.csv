291,1003.0,Statistician I,Blackbaud,3.7,46.0,"Blackbaud is a company that is dedicated to helping non-profits achieve their mission by providing solutions that will keep track of how funds are raised and the relationship the non-profits have with their constituents.The company is based out of Charleston, SC, and has grown from a small company, to a large one which has become the leading provider of CRM Software for the non-profit sector.People are wonderful to work with.  Charleston is a great place to work.  It is always nice to be involved with helping companies help people.  Clients are world wideThough it is a public company, it has done a good job of maintaining its (or restablishing in some cases) its culture of fun, customer-focus, and employee appreciation.The culture and the people that work there are all very passionate, caring and fun people to be around.  The people around you are invested in helping you become better at your role.The hours required to support multiple data-centers worldwide was a challenge that met but not rewarded. The opportunity for career growth and promotion was not possible.Everyday was different. Something fun happened everyday, as well. Great team oriented atmosphere. Corporate feel but also one big family.As a Luminate Online project manager, I was dismayed that we sold customers services we could not actually provide.  Management seemed to be ok with collecting for 140 hours a month, then only delivering 120.  On the flipside, when demanding customers forced project teams to bring 160 for only 140 reserved, project managers who pushed back on customer, got zero support from upper level managementBlackbaud is an example of everything that is wrong in the tech industry, where ""services"" try to become a profit center and project managers are sacrificed by upper management, unwilling to stand behind them OR make decisions to change policies.Blackbaud is such a great company for which to work.  I've never felt so fulfilled by the work I was/am doing or so motivated to go to work.  I look forward to connecting with both my co-workers and clients each day.I generally like working at Blackbaud.  The people in other departments seem to like it a lot more than I do though.  I'm in Operations, and we're definitely expected to never stop working.  Things like work-life balance, and quality of life improvements are mentioned, but don't seem to be priorities.  The only thing we seem to accomplish is to stamp out a fire long enough to get it down to coals; then its off to the next, larger fire.That said, I really like the people I work with.  It will be a shame when I leave to not work with them anymore.Great place to work, but management / project management is all over the place. If you find the right job path, you can move up in the company.Fun place to work with a great culture team always focusing on the employees. Great location in the middle on the domain, lots of fun things to do just a few steps out the door.Blackbaud is a good company and I would recommend to others.  Fasted paced and good energy. Focus is on growth and outside sales is the place to be.Enjoyed working there.  My contract ended. Great place to work.  Managers and Employees are great to work with.  Tough environment but worth working there.  I was using my skill.A fun place with a great work and life balance, management was positive, sales goals were attainable.  Very fun job, good culture!  I really enjoyed this position and learned a lotFixed internally and externally filed bugs in software.  Great experience getting familiar with Microsoft development tools.For six year in a row, the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce, SC Biz News, and Best Companies Group have named Blackbaud as one of the top 24 Best Places to Work in South Carolina in the large employer category!My team assists internal analysts with client issues. We build and maintain virtual testing machines that analysts will use to troubleshoot critical issues with company software. We will server as a tier 2 point of contact for case resolution. We primarily work everyday with Windows administrators to make sure our database software is working properly. We troubleshoot SQL related issues that clients may have on a daily basis.Fun place too work and lots of great people but the products are old, unstable, and use very old technology. Company has spent a lot of money to acquire other companies but does very little to integrate them. Compensation is based on the job market in Charleston, which is typically lower than most other tech cities.Typical dayMonitor 40 saas database servers everydayThese systems need to be ""online"" 7/24. Downtime = no moneyPerformance tuning. I tuned average 10 queries / week. Saved hundred hours processingIntensively prototyping Hadoop to create BI from OLTPIntensive migration HP-Linux plaform with Oracle GoldenGate with terabytes of dataAny others DBA duties requiredAs a consultant, you spend a lot of time on the road and serving customers, but there is a group of consultants that are there for you to bounce ideas off of, ask for suggestions for restaurants/things to do in different cities, or even meet you out if you're in or close to their town.  With many people working remote, it's not too uncommon to find someone living in a city you are in for work. The clients are non profits, but this doesn't mean they're all amazing.  Some clients are incredibly awesome.  Some clients are incredibly difficult.  It's just the nature of consulting.  The pay isn't the highest, but you aren't expected to make the job your life, either.  Time outside of working hours is highly respected.  Weekends (with the exception of travel time) aren't two extra work days.  Personal achievements outside of work are celebrated at work.  The culture feels like a family, even if most of your coworkers are remote.They really care about the employee. They have a kitchen with free snacks and coffee all day. They are flexible when it comes to working from home depending on your job title. They are really trying to have all departments become more familiar with each other to better collaborate.","1,001 to 5,000",Boston,Cambridge,MA,2016-03-08T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/b53a6ed8-e846-4e8d-9dd2-3575b72e5d26?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=30,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
