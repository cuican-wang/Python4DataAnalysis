118,830.0,Data Scientist,Analysis Group,4.4,5.0,"Great company, with great culture and great people.  A great place to learn broadly about capital markets and to learn from smart, dedicated, and motivated people. I had a great experience.Analysis Group's work relies heavily on rigorous quantitative analysis, resulting in a steep learning curve for new analysts.  However, once basic analytical skills are mastered, there is an opportunity to assume significant responsibility on case teams and gain wide industry exposure.  Managers also tend to invest in the career development of analysts.  Due to the opportunity for rapid skill development and the supportive culture, Analysis Group is a great place to begin one's career.This is a good role for undergraduates with a degree in economics, math, or statistics.lots to learn from very smart people. will develop strong analytical skills. work is often stressful and requires late nights, though.",,Boston,Boston,MA,2016-10-15T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/89bd3df3-6231-44a8-a02f-40795bce80af?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=29,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
334,1046.0,"Research Scientist, Manalis Laboratory",Massachusetts Institute of Technology,4.1,157.0,"Its MIT high stressed, demanding atmosphere.  Lots of room for movement through out institute is one plus though salary is commiserate with other higher ed institutions dont expect to break the bankThis is a highly, productive, inspirational and demanding institution. There is a good work and collaborative atmosphere.Learned a lot of new things. Co-workers were great and highly educated. Lots of exposure to scientific techniques, and analysis of data.good place to work with advancements, depending on your position job may be boring. culture is strong and management is effective. Oh and if you are so inclined, take a class or twoDynamic an fun place to work. Learning from the best professionals , the competition is hard.The people here are among the most talent scientist you can find in the world.I have work at the Obgyn the manager and staff are bully and disrespectful to new hired staff. You also have to be there on favorite.I had a good working experience at MIT. It was a fun place to work  i had a great time at MIT The work we did was cleaning mechanical rooms. I hope I can find a similar job.MIT encourages a healthy work/life balance. Great location, great benefits, and great staff. They train you well on your job functions, and encourage you to seek further training on additional skills you may wish to acquire.It was a great experience, I learned a lot about restaurant management. Waffle House is a strong company, the pay can be great. I would go back>The management and staff you work with are some of the best people you will ever work with, hands down.  This was the best job I have ever hadWorked in a great group with a professor I worked with years ago, his team was young and brilliant.  Loved the folks there.  Just no room for advancement.  Each admin basically worked in siloI worked in Koch Institute, A Typical day here is going through emails see if any needs immediate attention. If not, then going through daily financial reviews and filing. Everyone here is friendly. Benefits are pretty good. Especially the tuition reimbursement. Not much room to grow depending on where you work.Years ago, MIT was a great place to work. Over my many years there, I watched it steadily decline as new poorly skilled and either military or corporate minded leadership was brought in. By the time I left, it had become a very dysfunctional place in which bullying, public verbal abuse, misrepresentation of data, lack of communication and transparency, and hiding behind consultant reports and buzzwords had become the norm.There are endless opportunities available. there is opportunity to be creative and innovative to achieve every goal.If you can take working weekends and are motivated to learn its a great job. Complicated plant and not enough training. Co-workers can be hard to break through to.It was good honest work, the people were professional and personable. A typical day at work for me was fast paced, repetitive, yet simple it was enjoyable and an easy learning curve. The management typically left me to my work unless there was a problem which wasn't bad but I didn't get to know my managers very well.MIT has an interesting blend of workers and researchers across its institution. It seems that departments can vary wildly in terms of culture and scope. What happens on one end of campus can be very different in comparison to the other end.At the Office of Digital Learning, I took on a role as one of the first 10 in a fledgling department. This requires me to be a bit of a jack of all trades, and each day entails something new.Worked there for many many years - loved the Institute like family. Amazing research - amazing students. I found however that the work load was a bit crazy at times and management didn't always have the staffs best interest in terms of advancement - work life balance.I was given the opportunity to work at the M.I.T. Museum for a temp position and had a great time. A job similar to this is what i would ultimately like to do fulltime.  Unfortunately i was only guaranteed work for a few months and had to take on a fulltime job elsewhere, otherwise i wouldve loved to work at M.I.T. permanently.Nice place to work. Flexible hours. Good and friendly project managers. Convenient parking locations. lunch n learn sessions. Good co-workers. thats all for now I dont recollect more points.Massachusetts Institute of Technology is a great work environment for researchers and young scientists who wish to start their career.",,Boston,Cambridge,MA,2016-10-15T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/4ebf1788-1100-48c5-b1c2-c3fc220deba1?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
