128,840.0,Data Scientist,"Agero, Inc.",4.0,3.0,"I worked here as a second time through in a call center. The managers where nice but they were focused more on quantity of calls taken rather than quality of calls. I was let go because I could not meet the low average handle time (300 seconds) but had made 100% on quality the entire time I was there.I love all my co-workers, we have really good trainers there. It is really good place to work, you can earn a lot of incentives and bonuses.",,Boston,Medford,MA,2016-09-12T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/ee791094-6123-4edd-82fd-a6df08f1cf61?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
