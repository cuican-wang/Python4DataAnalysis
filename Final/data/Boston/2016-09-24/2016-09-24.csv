44,756.0,"Lead Software Engineer, Analytics",Cengage Learning,3.6,135.0,"Cengage has a great atmosphere and a lot of great people. The Tech ed product they offer really does help students excel.My job is not like most others within the company, so the experience is different than others.  There seems to be little direction for new employees and little to no training.  The on boarding process leaves much to be desired.I loved everything about this company. I worked there for seven years and only left due to health issues and to raise my child. Would go back in a heartbeat!A sales job that doesn't want you to sale and sabotages your attempts to satisfy the customer every chance they get so your efforts are doubly hard. Bonus structure changes constantly.Credit and collections for assigned territories.  Customer service and solving customer complaints.  However, the outsourced our department and many lost their jobs.In an everchanging digital environment you must be able to change with innovation. The company has gone from a traditional book publishing company to an Educational Technology company. Loved the change but wasn't fond of all of the layoffs due to price drops.I absolutely loved the customers!Had a good time and made good money. The people are very nice, also very easy to figure out what to do. Good hours alot of over time, good benefits if you work full-time.The job is a solid job and offers decent benefits.  Work-life balance is pretty manageable when outside of rush period.  When college is in-session, it can be incredibly stressful.Management is awful and needs improvement.  When I transitioned from one product group to another after nearly 5 agents left, there was little to no organization.  The only structure that was provided for this training was out of my own accord and one of the agents who was also quitting because they were expected to do too much for too little. I was ultimately targeted and forced to quit.  I was denied a position switch as well as an annual raise over a write-up through chats, which should have been handled through HR in the first place (once again, bad management). This company is engrossed in more nepotism than I had originally thought.  If you lick everyone's boots, don't have a sense of humor over chats, and don't present ideas to management then you'll be fine.  They seriously don't like you giving ideas, no matter how good they may be.  I've received responses such as ""Why did you even ask that? You should know how it works around here.""I worked at this place for a few years .As a stockpicker  u have to pick100 cases an hr if u can't then they write  you up , after so many write ups ur in the office getting getting ur butt reamed.  Managment does what its wants to do you can express your views and opinions but you're just wasting your breath . And there is also favoritism if you are buddy-buddy with the leads and supervisors then you usually get the easier jobs. If not then u get sent to returns which really sucks cause u have to process 115 cartons per hr or u get a write up . Its all about numbers . Then there's the attitudes the drama and the morale which was at an all-time low .lm  glad I got outta there. But the pay was decent and the benefits were good.The job is fine. It's not the work. Its the lack of employees who actually work.AND apparently one shift gets water cups and bottled water and other shifts don't since those shifts aren't as important. AND one of the shifts work overtime, while another shift gets credit and ice cream trucks for a great job. AND management must have a quota for those type of employees since they say nothing. AND I have never heard a floor manager be able to talk to employees the way this companies do. Unfortunately, a few good employees have to work for the team on a shift. When you need a paycheck, that's why you continue to do it. For the entitled employees that don't have to do anything except sit in bathroom for 20 min at a time, 6 times a shift...congrats at finding a job that allows it.I love working here. There are plenty of ways to establish a career and you work with hard working people who are willing to work any amount of hours needed to get the job done so there isn't any left over for tomorrow or the next shift. It is a 24 hour company with guards who stay on site even on holidays. It is a very secure building who give those of all backgrounds second chances.Honestly a horrible place to work. Most of my coworkers had some kind of mental deficiency, including 2 kids who had Downs Syndrome, which I would be blamed when they messed up. Those who didn't were people coming right out of rehab, which yes, is good of the company to hire such people, but considering there was almost no opportunities to advance, it was not a place I would like to work at long term. Also ,they had us working more so they could show off to tour groups coming through what they were doing, rather than for doing and completing the actual work.Made lots of friends, work-life balance is great, flexible hours and can work from home occasionally. Work on a ""team"" but actual tasks are done solo.My first experience working in a smaller company.  Their technology is top notch.  I did not work here for very long it was a three month contract.  I was hired to get a large project off the ground, IE. put scope together, get stakeholders onboard with the project.Lead a team of ten sales representatives to successfully sell in the higher education market.  Responsibilities include training, sales presentations, technology demonstrations, and assist with sales team development within the team.  Other responsibilities include business development and promoting institutional sales models at higher education institutions by meeting with professors, deans & administrators.   Create and market events within the IL district for college level faculty and administrators.  Events are strategically planned and executed by the Engagement Specialist in order to help drive revenue.Cengage Learning offered me the ability to work remotely and perform my job without being micro managed daily.  I loved working for them in my contract roll.Each day my coworkers and I would be led in stretches and then to our stations, which in my case was to operate a shrink wrap machine  with one other person and/or scan boxes and apply stickers appropriately. After that we would have to fulfill specific work orders- preparing packages of books ourselves, shrink wrapping them, and then boxing them up to ship. Management was pretty good. The worst part would be the combination of the work itself with the hours worked. ""Mandatory overtime"" became commonplace. Ten hour days, 5-6 days a week of just the activities described above. That would have to be the hardest part. I worked with a lot of good friends from high school over the summer. Spending time with them was the best part of the job.Great place to work to make a difference in education industry. Exciting new products are being build here. Great place for both long and short termCengage Learning is a good place to work for innovators.  It's a casual environment where teamwork is valued.  The challenge is to stand out during tough economic times, poor sales or re-structuring.Good environment, fast paced, technically challenging, remote management, which provided some challenges for communication and direction.You are the CEO of your own territory. As an outside Learning Consultant, you work from home and on college campuses year around. Using the company car provided, a typical day starts with driving to one of my college campuses and spend the day meeting with Professors about their course materials. Acting as a true consultant, I work to find the solution that answers their needs for their course and engaging their students inside the classroom. Everyone in the company is high energy and eager to help you secure adoptions and hit your sales goal. As a company, however, their biggest goal is not just about reaching a sales goal, but changing the face of Higher Education and engaging students more than ever.",,Boston,Boston,MA,2016-09-24T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/db41ff2c-bd6e-45d8-b3b3-07322653d18f?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
