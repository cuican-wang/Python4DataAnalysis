2,714.0,Data Scientist,Hollister Staffing,4.4,7.0,"The work culture is a great experience. Everyone is down to earth but yet work extremely hard. The energy and vibe is welcoming and I would recommend anyone to apply. I learned a lot of things in the first two weeks.I would usually come in, put my bag in the locker room, clock in, go to my manager ask them what they want me to do that day and go do that. The managers are really nice and outgoing, I pretty much get along with everybody. The hardest part sometime might be with a customer that won't let you do your job and them arguing with you. The best part I think is just working with my co-workers and helping out a customer that needs help with an item.Stay away from these guys Incompetent never call never get updates.Why do I waste my time with these used car salesman outfitsthis company is fun and it teaches you that you shouldn't be afraid to talk to people. Also that everyday you work that you are never doing the same thing. the people that work there are amazing people they make me work hard.There is never a dull moment and there is always a constant buzz in the atmosphere. The environment is super friendly and smiles all around. There is a lot of team work and encouragement to get the work done. Casual Fridays are great.My time working for Hollister at the Massachusetts Medical Society in Waltham, MA was wonderful. The work environment was great, and the people, and the pay were great as well. I really enjoyed this assignment!They've always found me a place to work when i needed them. They always placed me at places that i loved.",51 to 200,Boston,Boston,MA,2016-11-29T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/data-scientist-job-boston-ma-us-176847447.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
16,728.0,Speech Scientist,Amazon,3.7,10100.0,"Amazon is a fast-paced, exciting place to work. I highly recommend anyone to apply. Management was strong and colleagues were great.A typical day is a 10 hour shift where management is expected to arrive 1 hour early and leave 1 hour late - in order to prepare for the day and then report on the days results to upper managementI have learned a lot working for Amazon, i have developed my leadership skills tremendously. I have gained experience in developing a team, in performance managing hundreds of direct reports. I have gained knowledge in lean methodologies and performed a multitude of process improvement initiatives.You have to be a certain type of person to succeed in this role. It is most definitely not a 9-5 type of job. The hours are long and the expectations are high. The payoff is good when you have the right team and are in a department where you can flourish.Amazon allows its associates to advance and develop their career opportunities through different programs but the amount of work and mandatory overtime required makes it a very hard and exhausting place to work. The balance between personal and work life becomes difficult to manage due to the amount of hours required to work and the compensation and benefits are not worth it.Even though Amazon can be a fun place to work with many incentives, fun activities, holiday celebrations and more, the tasks become repetitive and boring after a few months making it difficult for the associates to stay motivated.I worked at Amazon for a few months, as well as Integrity Staffing. For one, they are very unorganized. They provide very poor training but expect high rates with little errors. I only got trained for 5 hours on my first day and the other half of the shift I worked in the MOD. I got fired for productivity, which was due to poor training. I learned how to  perform my job better while I was on my final write up and getting retrained, however it was too late. I asked managers several times to move me so I wouldn't lose my job but nobody seemed to care. I worked there for 2 months and got fired. Managers were very rude to me as well. One manager told me if I didn't speed it up I was going to get terminated. I really didn't enjoy my time at Amazon, I feel like they didn't give me a chance.Though Amazon is a growing company, upward mobility only exists for those straight out of college or former military. The pay is well below industry standard at all levels. Management is typically inexperienced and unguided. Though there are many different schedules to work, Amazon is quite rigid with transfers of shifts and departments. Mandatory overtime is commonplace and there are more than six weeks of black out annually, in which vacation time is not allowed to be used. The education program is a joke as you are only allowed to pursue a handful of career paths, all of which amazon only assists to an associates degree which is useless in almost every field. The hours are long, tedious and physically demanding. Injuries are commonplace but the onsite medical staff is extremely rude and uncaring so most people hide injuries and seek out their own medical care.10 hours spent on your feet all day and constantly moving across an incredibly large three level warehouse describes a normal day.  Half of my coworkers did not want to be there and their lack of motivation or sense of doing things correctly ultimately made the job far more difficult to accomplish.  Management seems only to care about the numbers, nothing else.  Since speed of work is everything you better hope you don't run into a problem (there were always problems) since resolving it means you need to walk to a specific station and you also need to hope you aren't 5th in line.good benefits but not a job to make a career out of, they treat their workers poorly. The management team needs some improvement and the pay is not worth the hours they are asking for.The co workers don't work together as a team and everybody is for their self.To me its a great job to start out from but not a job to stay for years.The only thing that's good about this job is the benefits one of the main reason why i still currently work their but the money doesn't support my family needs.The hardest part about this job is all the changes they make unannounced.,the relationship with the management teamand the empolyees.I do not enjoy this job so i'm currently searching for further employment.I worked there for 2 years and took the buyout. They have little events and play games sometimes that are fun but...Never have I been anywhere so micro-managed in my life. If you were breathing wrong, they dinged you for it. They set high rate goals and play favorites heavily. I was a favorite of my manager and got a lot of perks. I tried to work hard, but once they terminated that manager, I was sent back to packing from being a Lead. If you can suck up and don't mind a brown nose, you can make it there no problem. If you want a paycheck and that is it, you can do it. If you want to make a career, keep looking unless you have a MBA.Being a quality auditor for Amazon.com was a great job. Although it was sometimes repetitive warehouse work, I was always rewarded with great wages, challenging situations, and most importantly an unlimited opportunity for advancement. I was also inspired by a CEO that has a devotion for community, family, and the less fortunate. A humble man who wants to see the world improve. That simple idea provided me with motivation. This is a perfect example of a self-made man who started with a small garage operation and turned it into a huge success. The company also excels at the most important part of business, phenomenal customer service.I enjoyed  working  there, was fired  due  to not meeting  rate, which I wasn't  informed  of a rate system  being that I never worked  in wherehouse before, they should  inform new hires of the productivity  requirement,  which they don't, so they will know what to expect, they make everything sound  good at orientation, meanwhile  never telling  new hires what is expected  of them in order to keep your jobs, there  more harder on pickers than packers, that company  is not fair to all there employees, a lot of favoritism. They are a very unfair  company  to work for, I couldn't  even appeal my termination, they made a mistake  and I wasn't  employed for 90 full days, so I can't appeal there  decision, totally  unfair, so I could never work for  them again. Wow  what an incentive for being  fired  you guys suck to the fullest.The particular site I worked at was not adequately staffed since day one. This caused a lot of strain on staff with daily tasks, reports and case load. First site I worked for was great, however the last site was severely lacking in all areas. It depends which site you go to as to the individuals success. This company is very metric driven and does not put the needs or care of the customer or associates working for them ahead of the metrics. Their processes need significant improvement internally. Otherwise it was a great experience at my first site, which is how most of the sites should be run.Awesome managers who listen and work hard to resolve any issues you have. Positive work environment and feedback from co-workers all the way down to human resource.Hardest part of my job was adjusting to walking on the cement floors for 10 hours and finding smaller items quickly.Most enjoyable part of the job was the prizes we won for our efforts and meeting my co-workers.I learned how to work hard and feel proud to finish a job to completion and that hard work pays off! I also learned great time management skills and how to be attentive to detail.One of the worst places I ever worked. I hate how they treat their employees like a number, HR is the worst ever!! There is really no structure, rules changes everyday, to many kids. Coworkers are awesome, the managers, ops managers don't have degrees in their positions. Managers have to many favorites. You really have to kiss butt to move anywhere or try to learn new positions. This place is nothing but about NUMBERS....Could be so much better, if only they cared about their employees.I recently quit working with Amazon and had many reasons for leaving. I had a difficult commute which was the primary factor in my departure. During my time there, my leadership team was always vigilant in making things better for our associates and our customers. I have had the opportunity to work with some really great people and the culture and internal advancement opportunity was great. The majority of my managers were really wonderful people that worked hard to support me and help me develop in my career.Amazon is a continuous improvement environment. They stand behind their principles, one of which is dealing with ambiguity. With stock prices soaring, the prospect of receiving compensation in the form of stock, as well as competitive wages in management roles the job seems alluring. All management roles go thru a rotation of departments, times, and days. This is an effort to round out each candidate to help them rise thru the ranks. This can be tough for anyone with smaller children. The fast paced environment can also lead to meteoric rises for some and wastelands of underdevelopment from others. Conference calls are attended by yes men and eager pleasers who aren't willing to push back on the view from the top.Amazon is a difficult place to work. My job was not stable you never new if you were going to have a job then next day. The management was very poor. They would always run out of equipment and you would have to figure out how to do your job with out your tool. Co-workers were very plesant, we would all try to keep a positive attitude and be up beat.Working at Amazon I learned a lot. I have learned how work threw difficult time in a work environment and how to suck it up and work with whom ever you may have to work with. Long hours and hard work is a lot easier with a positive attitude.Everything about this place reminds of prison, from the orange vest they make you wear, to the safety line you have to walk in, to the constantly working on your feet. Your not being paid to think just work. Supervisors always on your back, similar to a Corrections Officer. Your hard work gets unnoticed so don't try and give 110%, try 65% instead. Work is extremely easy but boring. It's hard to get fired, you pretty much fire yourself by constantly being late or not showing up for workAmazon.com fulfillment Center is an okay place to work. They work you like a dog with working long hours for minimal pay. The benefits of physically working there do not outweigh the costs associated with this type of manual labor. Amazon benefits are good for healthcare, time off, and having an annual picnic. The management always is new and don't necessarily know what they are doing, thats why there is a high turnover rate with management and other employees.There is nothing but drama, drama, drama, backstabbing at this place i mean you have a CEO who is the 3rd richest man in the united states and we work for pennies! Ive been employed almost 5 years and just this week got a 75 cent raise so i make 13.75, but new employees starting are making 11.50 to 12.00 and they just started, does anyone see a problem with that? We have a very big turn over especially MANAGEMENT most of the are kids and dont have a clue! AMAZON cares about its customers, but as far as its employees they dont care how much time we are away from our familes, terrible attendance policy, try to limit our time to go on a BATHROOM BREAK! They claim they do so much for us, we work for everything we are entitled to like our stocks we are given but we have to pay the taxes on them, so basically we are paying for them twice we have to work for them then pay the taxes on them. Our HR department is a joke they are not nice and hateful! You ask a ? And you will get 20 different answers, or i dont know i will have to get back to you ( weeks later)You cannot get full time work.  Management seems disorganized. No explanation of what a PA's job actually is so they appear to be doing nothing but staring at computer screens.  Same with management. Staring at computer screens.   High turnover rate.   No promotions, no raises.   Option to become ambassador and take on more responsibility without more pay. Training was a joke.   Weird clapping and chanting at beginning of shift. All about increasing productivity without any rewards.Amazon is an amazing place to work, it's diverse culture, meeting people from all walks of life is just a blessing. Management's open door policy, where everyone is there to support you and make your work easy, fair and achievable goals are set. your opinion no matter how small is heard, makes me feel belonged and important.Priority to safety, amazing healthcare benefits, career choice plan, outstanding maternity/paternity leave, paid personal time off etc.. i could go on and on.","10,000+",Boston,Cambridge,MA,2016-11-29T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/speech-scientist-job-cambridge-ma-us-176844136.aspx?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Overall great culture and values!I had the best recruiter and they pay well. What you see is what you get with them! I just wish they had more opportunities in my area! They are professional but down to earth.Had a great experience with Yoh and would definitely work with Yoh in the future.  There are established and have good relations with the facilities the assist.Great company, terrible clients, no control over MSP. I enjoyed working virtua/remote, not all roles are this way. The major concern was the quality of our clientsA fulfilling day at work that involves challenges & accomplishments; learning from co-workers and being a team player, with a management look up to. The most enjoyable part of the day is the entire day. I learned something new every day and had a strong sense of purpose.•	Performed ELISA technique by using plates coated with contaminant proteins in toxoid preparation in order to indicate if the antibodies to contaminants were responsible for the discrepancy •	Maintained impeccable standards in chemical inventories, safely disposing of waste and accurately calibrating laboratory equipmentDuring my time with Yoh services I was able to learn the proper procedures and methods of a pc deployment project and I was also able to learn basic pc troubleshooting skills.Extensive Corporate Organizational Transition Process to provide an accurate response. The Management Team was also undergoing a major transition process which filtered to the new employees. The communication from the Executive Team to the team members was lacking and much to be desired.I was a Recruiter at Yoh for a little over 3 years.  During my tenure the company had difficulties paying contractors on time, answering contractor questions, or generally running back office operations.  There is little advancement opportunities.  It is nearly impossible to make the Incentive Trip for producers.  Yoh is unable to recruit good talent and after 3 years I know why.they have allowed me to work with benefits. It's nice to have an Human resources, information technology, payroll and all other administrative type of people/representatives available and with separate and individually listed easy to find phone nos.this job was exactly what I was hoping it was going to be, I loved this job. we were working on prototypes and conducting experimentsA typical contract company, poor management, lack of integrity, long work hours, and no raises for one whole year or Per Diem when other contract companies were providing it.They supply good income and a steady employment. If you have an issue they will help you. They also provide good benefits such as medical benefits.Good place to work. Management responds to contact with the employee. Diverse employment market. Easy to communicate with. I liked working for them.YOH is the only contract company that has ever allowed job security including benefits and vacation time.  I would highly recommend.This temporary opportunity came at a good time. It was an absolutely wonderful job which I enjoyed. There were no benefits due to the temporary nature but otherwise, I would highly recommend this company to anyone looking for a high quality job.The HR department constantly requested and then finally SENT my Social Security Number in plain text over the internet.I cannot imagine a company not knowing better then this. Have they never even seen a TV commercial?Just imagine, people from this company setting up computers for clients?As a contracting company, Yoh made the process simple and easy to navigate. The on-boarding process was flawless, and their management staff was pleasant to work with.Staffing recruiters are professional and helpful, responding via email to questions and concerns in good time. Allows for the option of a flexible work schedule.Good pay. Does not offer health insurance. Don't get aid time off until you have been there 1 year.

Support users on the Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS),provide end users with assistance in using the CTMS and work on improving quality of data in database.A typical day at work consisted of clocking in at 1pm and would clock out anywhere between 2am-4am, six days a week. The work was challenging enough to keep my mind active and the constant changes kept me on my toes. I had a great supervisor who was tough, but fair. She stood behind me when I had to make on-the-spot decisions and made me feel like what I was doing was important. The hardest part of this job had to be working such long hours with only one day off a week. However, working with people from all over the globe was amazing.For my personal opinion Aerotek isn't bad at all. Its one of the better staffing companies. Got me a job through a contract and I'm now permanent with the company. Aerotek actually paid a little more than the company I work with and offered us benefits AND we got a raise through them as well while on contract. Ive been with a few temp agencies and none were even close to Aerotek overall besides BG Staffing. If you need work soon and willing to take a chance on a temp to perm its honestly a decent company. It was at times unnerving with the uncertainty of the situation and the contract but it all ended up working out in the end for most of us. Once again my personal experience in Irving, TX so of course other results may vary. But definitely worth a shot if you are un employed or looking for quick workFun company culture. They really try to do their best to compensate the hard work you put in but it is a grind. Depending on the day you could be done at 5 or 5:30 but others it could be 7:30 or 8 before you feel comfortable leaving, and you may still have not hit your expectations for the day. Great place to start out and learn but tough work-life balance.I am proud that I was able to begin my Career with Aerotek. I started without very much direction. I was trying to see what I wanted to do long term, and it introduced me to a world that I never even considered in college. It was a career that found me instead of the other way around. If I wanted to go into sales long term, I definitely would've remained there, but it just wasn't where I wanted to take my career.Sign into RF scan gun and pick product from location with correct quantity for order. Management was decentCo-workers were great people and made you feel welcomeHardest part of the job was counting large quantities of parts,Most enjoyable part was being able to listen to music and the breaks.No hourly pay for over 40+ hours of work a week, bad culture, bad management, favoritism, corporate bullying, no work life balance. This office is a very dirty environment, very poor housekeeping.This company has one of the best training and development programs I have ever been a part of.  Great culture that provides guidance, support and motivation from folks around you that truly want to see you succeed. Long hours that may require some late nights at times but the deal is you get out of it what you put into it, generally.  Even though the hours are long they are very flexible for things you need to do, such as run an important errand and leave for most any personal reason as long as it isn't being abused.  It is an extremely tough job and is quite the grind.  In recruiting and sales that are so many things that happen outside of your control.  You can make a lot of money and have a long great career here but you better have a great work ethic and the ability to persevere.I started Aerotek on February 15th, 2016. I was contracted through them to work for a company based out of Morrisville, NC. It was so exciting for me. I was completely thrilled with the new opportunity before me, because I had been looking for the opportunity they presented me for a long time. It was a short lived dream. The company they contract for has management that SHOWS way too much favoritism, and if they don't like you, well it's out the door for you. I was robbed of my dream to become permanent. Not only that, but they released me for such a ridiculous reason...Performance driven environment, but centered around a great company culture. Work hard, play hard environment where management focuses on developing the skills of young professionals.Great company to work for, compensation is great and they do take care of their employees. Work culture is professional, fair and friendly.  Management has an open door policy, they truly care about their employees.  Definitely recommend them and would work for them again.Coworkers were more than just team members, we were like family. Working for the company provided bonuses based off the work effort that was put forth. Decent salary. The call center was partitioned into divisions, e.g., Team H2O or Beast Team etc. which boosted our morale to work harder to close on homeowners loans especially priorities 1-3 in conjucntion with utilizing the isms, i.e., company ethics and or / guidelines. Very energetic atmosphere.Great culture & strong leadership, but very demanding.  Great environment with great people, solid training but you will be working a lot to achieve success and advancement.Long hours, low pay, limited opportunity for advancement for women.  The recruiters and sales resources work very long hours and play very hard in the off hours.  It's a big of a ""frat house""...balls being thrown around all day long.  A bit militant.  Very hokey atmosphere.  Appearances can be deceiving.  I learned a lot about the staffing business and managing consultants.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people find meaningful work.A typical day for me was always a learning experience in different departments, was trained in various departments in order to be able to always have someone is critical operations to full fill the demands of the company. Got along with all my co-workers no matter what position they performed. I enjoyed very much interacting with different people and different departments and being able to perform different tasks thru out my day.Great place to be. Everyone is seemingly up beat and happy.The first 10-11 months I worked there were awesome despite a few bad apples. If you are negative and can't take feedback to develop into a better recruiter you probably won't be there long.It solely a performance based job but does have awesome compensation and benefits package. Set salary plus commission.The biggest downside I felt was having to conform to their view of a corporate employee. I had two buddies that were told they probably wouldn't get promoted because they wore purple button down shirts with ties instead of the typical blue or white. One was actually denied a promotion and was told it just wasn't his time yet even though he was the top recruiter in the office. As my time neared its end there a lot of changes in structure and management were going on. Meaning a lot of the culture was being lost and they brought in a lot of new recruiters and management was being shifted into new branches and even our director was demoted and kept even though he was the main cause for the stress and lack of production. Since then they have plugged a new person into the role of the Director and I imagine its going a lot better now.Aerotek is a great job to start out at after college, with the new rates entry level people out of school will now get 60K after hitting certain numbers plus commission and bonus. You can make decent money here but it is quite a grind and you need to be prepared to work 50-60 hours a week and some weekends.I worked as an intern for Aerotek and it gave me some good insight into the recruiting world. During a typical day as a recruiter, you would make aprox. 45 calls a day to try and set up interviews for candidates to come in and meet with you.The Account Managers are often promoted from recruiting fast. This show that there is plenty of career advancement, but there have been some complaints about the management being unexperienced. Great work environment, everyone is easy to talk to and get along with. The hardest part of the job is the reliance that you put into your candidates. You must first search for the candidate, call them, bring them in for a face to face interview, call their references,  have them interview for the position, accept the job offer if it is extended, and pass a drug test. During any point of this process the candidate can become ineligible for the opportunity or loose interest and you have to start the whole process over again (which happens pretty often). Like most sales job, closing the deal is the best part of the job. Can also be a pretty lucrative opportunity if you are good at it.Very nice company to work for a lot of opportunity to grow and a lot of good benefits also management treats you nice and co-workers and staff as wellIndeed is a life changing work environment! The employees and management team are very genuine and supportive! The culture is very positive and it is a fun environment. New ideas are encouraged and implemented. Indeed, is a great employer with amazing perks. Complementary breakfast, lunches, beverages and snacks to keep the teams happy.Aerotek has great job culture. For A normal work day the work is repetitive and also through out the week.  I learned about invoicing and collections. The management could be better. My co-workers are very supportive and helpful. We put work first and fun later. the most enjoyable part of this job is the culture. Everyone is like family and I think that is important.","5,001 to 10,000",Boston,Cambridge,MA,2016-11-29T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/9a45421c-171a-4287-b9e3-314c26f6c9d9?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=26,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
