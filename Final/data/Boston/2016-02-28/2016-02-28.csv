135,847.0,Data Scientist Intern,"EnerNOC, Inc.",3.6,30.0,"EnerNOC goes well out of its way to make the employees happy; whether that's free coffee/snacks, gym access, resources, benefits or just compensation. They pay well, come with a good reputation and the culture at OMP is great! Where they fall short is their mismanagement with company direction (i.e. we switched our corporate focus 3 times in my less than 1.5 years). I enjoyed my time there, but definitely felt there were some dodgy things happening in the background. I would definitely recommend the company, but don't get comfortable - things could change drastically, without any warning.I gave only one star for each category based on the recent massive layoffs that completely exposed the gross incompetence of senior management and their crass disregard for the adverse effects on so many who were only hired in the last two months.  There were many new employees hired since July to work within the company's EIS offering.  Unfortunately sales were slow and costs were high so they decided to cut hundreds including those who they recently lured away from other jobs and opportunities.  Those people are left with one week's notice, upon which their insurance benefits expire and truly pathetic severance packages.  These people were victimized by the company.  Was senior management so incompetent and out of touch with the numbers that they would continue a steady stream of new hires?  Or are they really that crass that they simply did not care about what they were doing to individual lives?  Take your pick because in either case, they are not to be trusted.Great people and management.  Very fast paced environment.  Lots of opportunity to learn and grow your career.  Small enough to make an impact and meet executives.In Energy management company like Enernoc Demand Response does has tough challenges due to Government interference on rulingsGreat place to work. It was definitely a meritocracy. Good ideas were put into place.I was able to have a good work/life balance while working there. I did notice other teams where work/life balance seemed to be strained.I was able to work remotely quite a bit, but this seemed to be a team-by-team decision.EnerNOC is an extremely fast paced organization, but in some regards lacks critical experience.  Most of the staff at EnerNOC are fresh college graduates which breeds a launching ground for these folks to the rest of their career (Not necessarily with EnerNOC long-term).  This type of work force also lends itself to a lack of vested interest in objectives and goals and promotions to folks that may not be completely qualified.EnerNOC provides first rate demand response, procurement and energy management software. The company has doubled in size in the last few years and had few competitors in terms of track record, focus and quality/breadth of offering.Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. This is expected to become a big company in the energy industry.EnerNOC is by far the worst company I have ever seen.. Everyone is a phony, hard charging type of clown that would push you in front of a train for a buck. Turnover is relentless, the work is mundane and management is useless. Rumor is that the idea for the company was stolen from another student at business school, like all good ideas.You will quickly be an expert in any department you work in and will be treated valuably. It is hard to maintain a work/ life balance in some departments, however in others it is cut and dry. Ultimately I have had a great experience, and have been treated great since day one. My managers respect me and are always my advocates.EnerNOC is growing fast and is not for everyone, but if you give it a try and have internal drive- you will NOT be disappointed.Interview process was very thorough but now I see why- the employees here are truly best and brightest. Many also have major accomplishments outside work- truly work hard play hard! As an Engineer was pleasantly surprised at the major investments company is making in technology!I cant say enough about the great people! I cant speak to past but it appears the company has made a tremendous investment in ensuring the employees concerns were heard and working hard to create culture of people that are not ony challengd but rewarded and given the flexibilty to have the work life balance that was previously lacking. My goup in particular has a tremendous promotional rate- the inside sales team (BDA's) - truly a feeder pool for outside sales roles.Good place to work and reccommend it to one and all. No hassles with management, and environment is very peaceful & conducive to learning while working.I took this job because of grandiose talk during the interview about how they were going to make the world a better place and were excited to create green technology. After working there for a little while, I realized they only wanted mechanics that could add. Almost all of my time was spent in machine rooms or adding up kWhs on the computer. The company was so against using computers that almost everything we did had to be printed out numerous times. Any time a new idea was presented, it was immediately shot down by management, even if it had the potential of increasing productivity by a lot. Other companies will pay better and have you do less work in the industry. Everyone generally leaves within a year of starting here.Manager didn't know processes of their own employees, and the department had very weak procedures and controls. People don't stay more than a year. The managers have no idea whats going on.I was hesitant to join after some of the reviews online- i was pleasantly surprised to see that little of that actually rang true. YES it is a challenging environment but I was actually seeking that in y next employer! You are surrounded by talented people always willing to help (in my opinion). Also it may be cliche but it really is work hard play hard- my previous employers eliminate the ""fluff"" like social events, holiday parties, employee recognition awards- EnerNOC appears to be committed to keeping the entrepreneurial environment they set out with. Engineering has Innovation days that you only task is to come up with an innovative idea- regardless of topic- for a techie like m- that's a huge plus!It was a great place to work. Had an opportunity to research new and latest technologies. The co-workers are great and very supportive. I did not like though working alone, I am more of a team player. Management is great, and encourages new ideas.EnerNOC is a great place to work if you don't have a family and don't like to sleep. Whatever you do will never be enough.An interesting place to work. Smart, younger workforce routinely being pulled in a million directions with varying results and varying levels of engagement.Culture between depts and floors can vary. Fast paced and stressful in Engineering, but outlets exist in fooball table, kayak, and paddle boards.A great collection of smart people who are motivated to contribute to a mission-driven organization and change the way the world uses energy.","501 to 1,000",Boston,Boston,MA,2016-02-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/7acfc55a-b7a8-4fa2-9441-420da4cb9bef?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=14,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
