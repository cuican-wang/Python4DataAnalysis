226,938.0,Associate Scientist - Product Development,Nova Biomedical,3.8,25.0,"Nova Biomedical is a big family company. There is a very friendly work environment where everyone talks to each other in the cafeteria. It has nice facilities but its easy to get lost in the day to day cycle as an intern.Nova Biomedical is committed to reinvesting much of its profits back into R&D to continuously push for new advancements with its products.There is no typical day.  Everyday is something different.My day begins with logging into the phone systems, answering up to 6 lines at once.  Directing the calls as requested.I handle data entry of all training documentation, reviewing these documents to assure they have met the prerequisites. Once data entry is complete I file the documents, creating new pendaflex files if needed.I upload resumes into our HRMI create badges for new employees, and reissue lost or worn out badges using our WINPAk badge system.I complete check requests as needed.As I am a team player, I will assist with what ever project needs attention.Very Challenging everyday , fun environment, you have to know to juggle work, management team are great co-workers are very nice. the hardest part of work  is waking up so early other than that I enjoy working. the most enjoyable thing at work is I got to see so many different people at work and I got to have conversation with them, it's like family like company.I have been working with Nova Biomedical for almost ten years and I have no complaints. I have been treated very fair at work.This company is privately own with a great team of people to work for. leader and innovator of the blood analyzer meters.World leader in biosensor technology.  Technology focused while maintaining the look and feel of a privately owned organization.OK. Work varies day to day. Lots of overtime and lots to learn. Management deeds improvement.Lots of traveling which I love; no micro-management; the toughest part of the job was just having to be a work at 5am; but otherwise a great job.Best work place so far,every one is frienly respectfull,profecional,you feel apreciatedManagement makes knee jerk decisions which are not well thought out. Many employees related to each other and most employees are waiting for retirement so many tasks are not completed or even cared about. In my experience customers were frustrated with lack of support from Nova. Management is not  approachable.Excellent place to work.  Very employee-oriented, and provides great benefits and opportunities to employees.I had many different functions from customer service to administrative duties. I learned how to be patient and understanding. A typical day was always very busy. The hardest part was not being able to help customers with there complete orders when there were shipping problems. Which happened maybe once or twice a week.I find my job is very enjoyable.  I get to help implement a great product.  I love educating other nurses on new technology.  I believe technology is what is going to improve patient care.  The hardest part is the traveling.  I have a family with children.  A phone call or face time is not the same as seeing them grow in person.Not a bad company. But found better career opportunity. it was my first mechanical assembler position & learned new skills.People were great to work with.Gained a lot of experience from planning to running a machine shop and medical device manufacturing.A typical day was answering a multi line phone. Customers all around the world calling with technical problems. My hardest part was listening to complaints all day long. The most enjoyable was my co-workers and how much fun we had. I learned a lot from Nova, my patients with listening, my computer skills and how to multi task. The management allowed me to be my own manager and did not micro manage me at all. Overall I had a great 23 years at Nova and would still be there if they the pay was better.In Nova i learned many things from lasering laminating and using other machines. The management is great, awesome understanding supervisors, great teams leaders who can run a great shift. There was nothing hard about the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was almost everything, i enjoyed the work the company gave me and definitly the staff employees and coworkers were good people to work with.Although it was about a year working at this company, it was an overall good experience. Enjoyed working with my colleagues/management as they were very helpful and positive at all times during my assignment there.good place to work. privately held company with a good product lineManagement was right on and efficient. Work place was clean and organized. I was a Formulation Technician and was responsible for building Biological formulations in bulk inspected and tested in Biological Analyzers. I enjoyed my job and the employees I worked with. I used scales of different sizes for measuring and used many different types of chemicals and Deionized water to mix, test and produce clean and approved agents and formulations.",,Boston,Waltham,MA,2016-10-20T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/7057b6e6-7324-4dd2-b30f-3cdf7b2eccb4?mescoid=1300092001001&jobPosition=35,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
