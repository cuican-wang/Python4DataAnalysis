600,1312.0,"Scientist, Cancer Genetics",WuXi AppTec,2.6,26.0,"This place is great for entry level experience and no room for growth. Management is set in their ways and expect to advance only if you're Chinese or know someone in management personally. Nepotism is high within the companyWuXi AppTec is a great stepping stone job to get relevant work experience. There is a chance for advancement if you show interest and take the steps to get there. Overall it's a good company from my experience.Management has no education and no clue of daily activity, They hire friends with no experience and no clue of daily operations. You are hired for a position and then expected to work out of class. They dont respect your personal life. carry company phone with no pay while not at work and expect you to come in at all hours and call you at all times of day. and then they argue with you about call in pay. Take computer home for free with no pay for utilizing your private time. Biggest revolving door i have ever seen.Being payed hourly any time you take company property home you should be paid for your time spent after hours.People out of management are good to work with, But they are treated like puppets also with no respect.Work there is busy and can be overwhelming at times.There is great business growth but there is a lack of strong business foundation to support that growth. Co-workers are generally supportive but the employees are siloed with little business continuity between departments. Managers are not unified.  The hardest part of the job is working with other departments and pulling people in the same direction to accomplish a goal.The most enjoyable part of the job is using cutting edge science to solve some of the worst diseases. Salary and benefits are below the standards of other competitive Biotech and Pharmaceutical Companies.Work quality does not consistently achieve the standards expected.Management does not know how to communicate and does not respond to employee concerns, besides the fact that they do not follow policy by punishing employees for taking their designated breaks. Besides that, your eight hour a day shifts generally turn into twelve plus hour shifts, because you are not allowed to leave until everything is done.Always too much work and never enough people so overtime is expected.  Training is a bare minimum. Compliance is non existent so the place may be shut down after the next inspection. Management doesn't care as long as stuff gets done probably because people are getting paid off.Some days are hectic, some are relaxing; depending on the workload. I personally was working on many project simultaneously so my schedule was pretty busy. The workload is given to you is depended on your qualification and how you handle it. Overall it was fun time.It started out a fun place to work. As we became busier, turn around time became the focus. If we surpassed our goal, the got harder to reach. Management picks their favorites, if you are not one of them, sayonara. You've just become a tech with a bullseye on your back. High turnaround facility. I saw countless numbers of people quit or walked out. The benefits are fantastic and the pay is competitive. I loved the work. I miss the work, the benefits, and the pay. I wasn't a fan of the management. MANAGEMENT can MAKE or BREAK a great company. Phenomenal hard working people left because of management.WuXi is a growing company with many opportunities to learn new skills and get experience if you are willing to put in hard work.However they do tend to work people harder than you would typically see at big pharma, this is a good and a bad thing, while your experience and skills benefit, your work life balance can suffer.I worked as an Associate Sterility Laboratory Technician. The work isn't difficult it can just be cumbersome due to the extreme high turnover. I was there for a little over 6 months, and by the time I was left I was one of the most senior people. Management picks their favorites. The manager while I was there didn't care to make real improvements in the lab. Everyone is overworked and underpaid. They seem to understand and be quite ok with the fact that the people they hire don't stay long.The  technicians are fun to work with and they are good about following IACUC guidelines for animal care. However, they are very good about stringing contract employees along with ""open ended"" contracts providing no benefits and no job security.There is plenty of things to learn in different areas of the building and is located in the Twin Cities. There is a very thorough training program.For the money I made there I was happy but there was no management for my position, and the interpersonal relationships between employees was toxic. I tried to be a beacon of positive light and energy and as a result I was slandered by a coworker, which caused them to end my contract and not hire me on full time, even though I was promised on more than one occasion that I would be hired on full time. The job put too much responsibility on the staff and as a result we often had to stay longer than eight hours to do our jobs, and we did not take our paid breaks because we were too busy.  10-12 hour days were common for Animal Care staff. I was a tried and true team player who would come early, stay late and always stop what I was doing to help my coworkers, and as a result one of them went to my bosses boss and lied about me. When they fired me I called the whistle-blowers and after THREE WEEKS of waiting for a response the operator told me ""This line is for employees only, do NOT call here again."" I was not given a chance to solve any ""issues"" that had arisen, although I don't see how I caused any problems and I have wracked my brain over it. I was thrown out like a soiled diaper, not given a chance to explain. Before all this happened I told my boss that the person who later slandered me actually pulled me into the empty locker room and yelled at me until I broke down crying. Because she found out I talked to him, she decided to lie about me until I was fired. I did everything I could to show this person that I was her friend but all it got me was an inability to pay my bills.  more... I would tell people NOT to work for this company unless you enjoy working for a place where your boss is allowed to do nothing but check their facebook and ignore their crew. Working here has broken my heart and spirit.  lessA good place to learn many aspects of the pharmaceutical world from asking for batch records and documentation to manufacturing cancer cellular therapies. I was looking to get back into the pharmaceutical realm of science when I applied to this company and have learned a great deal since I have started. They are going through a large growth phase right now and have a hard time retaining employees due to a heavy workload with low pay for the industry (I took a pay cut to come here to get back into the pharmaceutical industry). Due to the large growth they are experiencing growing pains.All in all they are a good company, my experience has been extremely positive but I am ready to move on and find employment with more responsibility and regularity.I work in the Microbial Solutions division of WuXi AppTec and in a typical day, I run sterility cycles on medical devices and perform cleaning efficacy testing. I have learned much about the medical industry and microbial growth.The management at this company is poor, in my honest opinion and there is obvious favoritism show towards certain employees within my department by the department supervisor. This causes friction to build between co-workers and unfair treatment.The hardest part of the job is filing out paper work and the documentation, but the most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that, ultimately, you are saving lives.Great place to start, but not good enough to retire from. Suffers growing pains and revolving door of management and staff. Could treat employees better.A typical work day at alorica would be answering phones and enrolling people in there health , dental and visison benefits.Contract position because they did not have 2014 budget to hire full time.  Very tough communications, expectations.ok if you don't have plans after school.. Uncle sam is the way to goManagement has no plan for direction or growth other than own individual financial gainMy time at WuXi Apptec was brief (6 months) but I believe I had seen the worst it could offer. My department of 10 techs was turned over in that time, except for 2 testing techs. In other words, in a 6 month period, 8 of 10 people either left or were let go. This was due to poor management and lack of training/progression at work. Also factor in some manager's decisions to do things that enter a legal gray area, such as demanding unpaid overtime from contract techs. The only thing that made working here bearable were the other techs and some of the managers.",,Boston,Cambridge,MA,2016-05-19T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/250018d7-6978-4c77-bd7f-11a7bf17166a?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
