129,841.0,"Data Scientist, Operations",The Boston Consulting Group,4.2,80.0,"Standard work environment to the typical office position. Nothing above or below typical standards. Nothing more to add.BCG provides endless opportunities to get involved in a multitude of different client experiences. The caliber of talent at this firm is second to none making it a great environment to learn and grow. Oftentimes, the client work can be a little tough making work/life balance out of reach sometimes. Overall, salary and benefits at the firm are great other than the vacation policy (15 days for employees that have worked less than 5 years)Accelerated learning platform with great benefits/ perks. Think of it as a highly paid MBA. Great culture, different from all other consulting firms; will definitely develop you as a person and position you to achieve your career goals.A compartmentalized and regementalized top-down environment leading to massive amounts of inefficient effort. Decorum wins over substance. Excellent benefits.Amazing company to work with. The co-workers are smart which helps you indirectly, as you are working in a very competitive environment.The HR people need to be more pro-active thoughThis is a repeat of the last survey. I do not understand why we have to continue to do this just to place our resume online. Nice benefits at this companythe pace is very rapid. I star by having breakfast at the cafeteria, we were really spoiled, having everything we may want for breakfast. it doesn' t take long though, but it delights our day.I start the day by going over my emails and my boss s ones, organize, archive some answer or dispatch some. I follow up very closely the calendar, which is an important task to do. organize meetings that may include dozens of people fro different countries with different time zones and try to find a suitable time for everyone which can be impossible sometimes, but we make it happen. I also organize marketing events starting by the invitations, the catering and also the venue. it s so rewarding when a marketing event meets big success. I had wonderful boss, hard working, serious organized, and knows exactly what he wants and on the top of that very human.I really enjoyed working at BCG.Ultimately I needed to leave because there wasn't enough room for me to advance when I was ready, but I miss working there.  The culture is amazing, and I love the people there.High impact client workVery intelligent and humble co-workersGreat emphasis on training and feedbackAwesome network of dedicated and smart peopleThe best and most supportive co workers I have ever worked with.Hardest part of the job was trying to impress my boss, easiest was everything that came naturally to me; ex. organizing, event planning, setting up lunches, contacting vendors, emails.Most enjoyable was getting to be creative in different things. Wrapping presents, thinking of ways to make the office feel like home, d√©cor for lunches/events, etc.Overall great company, atmosphere and  lovely co-workers. I absolutely adore working here! I couldn't imagine life without BCG. Constantly learning knew things!An Excellent top 100 company to be employed for!  This company supplies its clients with superior services and attention to their financial needs.  The work environment is superior and the professionalism is exemplary.Consultants are expected of a lot. Due to the large number of MNC clients who are operating in different time zones, client meetings can often occur at inconvenient times, resulting in long hours. Overall BCG Shanghai was a great place to intern as a start to a career due to exposure to clients, the consulting industry, and knowledgable, driven coworkersExcellent Corporate Culture, expansion plans and success rate is impressive.Management is excellent, treat consultants as employeesThis company values money over everything. Integrity and empathy are not visible within the Houston office. Next years ""best companies to work for"" will illustrate the cracks within this company.A typical day for me at BCG started with hearing about any urgent issues from my coworkers and/or checking my emails for any tickets or issues. Every day was a little different, one day I might be re-imaging laptops the next I might be doing inventory for supply orders, or providing onsite support at a meeting. Day to day varied quite a bit. Having IT support in the office, when most of the office is traveling frequently, means having to balance between office and online support. For me it was great because I enjoy fast pace work and providing customer service. A great group of people both personal and professional.  Management very supportive and fair.  I enjoyed my coworkers the most, they were the best part of my day.This company is excellent. The work was very easy to accomplish. The manager is awesome. Great working environment. I was able to come in ten minutes early so I could leave ten minutes early to go to my afternoon job.I have never worked for a company like BCG before. The expectations are high which makes you always want to go above and beyond to meet and maintain those standards.We work hard and play hard. You can't beat the benefits package. There are not many places that take care of you the way that BCG does.Great company to work for, it gives a decent push at your resume. The work environment is ideal for a productive time at BCG. The learning is based on an advanced knowledge sharing between the employees, you can clearly feel that people at BCG do not work for themselves, they strive for an excellence in business that the company represents. I'd say that is what makes BCG different than any other company you can work for, it's bigger than yourself, it's contribution to the world of tomorrow.BCG offers the opportunity to work with some of the best minds on todays most challenging business problems. The firm provides an opportunity to be on the inside track of cutting edge thought leadership. Coworkers are collegial, interesting, and driven while the management organization is very flat. However, much is expected out of employees and the hours can be quite long. The learning curve and relationships formed at BCG overshadow the long hours as a great place to cut your teeth in the strategy world or if you have the stamina, to shape the business world over a longer period of time.* Great medical benefits, lack of advancement, the hardest part of the job is separating work/life* Management is not very supportive",,Boston,Boston,MA,2016-09-09T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/68e8ffd5-da70-4691-95b8-ac42af982cc5?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=8,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
