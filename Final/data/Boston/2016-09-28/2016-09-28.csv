Outside Training also help the top management to achieve more with their teams2 to 5 years is about the maximum for American employees in key manager positions. For a year prior to being ""laid off in good standing"", I was being told that I could not attend weekly meetings because only mandarin would be spoken.

A significant component is knowledge transfer, whereby one is rewarded with great patience.  Every day offers new and different challenges.  We won a $1bn project with a large carrier to run their data centers.  However, three-months in the young national sent in to run things (often never having worked outside the country) is behind on KPI's and are to lose millions.

539,1251.0,Sr. Quantitative Developer,SunGard Financial,3.8,343.0,"People are fun and kind to work with. I've enjoyed the work place. Co-workers are intelligent and hard-working. I've learned a lot throughout the years.Sungard was  a great place to work. I ran the Telecommunications and internal infrastructure planning and implementation. In the end I wanted more experience with evolving technologies especially Cisco powered networks.Lots of room for advancement, enjoyed working there, good benefits, low salary.   Moved up quickly advanced to higher paying jobs, management was quick to recognize my automation skills and allowed me to automate numerous processes in various Trust and Investment related departments.I provided Operational Support for our customers in the Securities Finance Industry. I coordinated and set up procedures to receive and transmit files and reports for our clients using various methods of transmission and encryption. Assisted customers queries via phone and email in a timely accurate manner. Utilized schedulers to run programs at specific dates and times. Providing excellent customer service in a timely manner was always my priority. We grew from 30 clients to over 300 in the time I spent with this company. Fidelity bought the company in late 2015 and many senior employees were let go due to a reduction-in-force to cut payroll expenses. This had always been a great company to work for and truly hated losing this job.It is a good place to work and in many ways, I wish I had stayed with the University.  However, I was looking to expand my knowledge and thought that a consulting job would be interesting.  Unfortunately, the travel which was reported as 25% turned out to be 50%.Great people, young culture. Do what they can to help you grow as much as possible. Open door policy with management, I feel very comfortable if I need to speak with someone in upper management. The work is a grind and very hard, but if you are a hard worker and detailed oriented you should be fine.Extensive hands on Test Automation Coding experience for Unit, API or Functional Tests and Hands-on experience in building applications with either Maven, Grunt, Gulp, MSBuild, ANTHands on experience of automation tools (Infrastructure, Test, Build) and experience in operation and maintenance of Linux/WindowsThis is not a job for students. I started working here because it paid well, but the hours were only full-time, and the level of security didn't allow me much study time. Management was not that great, either.Typical day at work was generally putting out fires on a daily basis with people that everything was an emergency which is something I loved - never a dull moment.Co-workers became like family because you work such long hours you are with them more than your actual family.SunGard is a fast paced and innovative company with great products and solutions. While the company focuses on the financial markets, it does not slow the innovativeness of its solutions. SunGard also provides great opportunities for career advancement.Working Here started off good. But then came lies from management about promotion. the people they put in charge don't do anything all day but play on there cell phone,eat all day an complain about stupid stuff such as staplers in work, Sorry team leads they want the other workers to do there work. Pay suck!!!! keep up mess!! so call friends talk about each other behind there back. Management have there picks and chooses. bring in people off the street rather then hire in house they hire friends of friends sad how management work I would not even call that management because it's unfair and they don't care about the people that work there butt off. Fire people cause one of the managers/leads don't like them. not all departments some departments are awful.We are still going through the integration process with FIS but the transition has gone fairly well as compared to other acquisitions.   The FIS culture seems similar to SunGard.  Leadership team seems good and communications about changes have been transparent and informative.Great work experience and very happy to be associated with this company. Great place for entry-level developers and business analysis. SunGard is now FIS as they were bought in December 2014I enjoyed developing software projects and learning about retirement planning with the Securities Exchange CommissionIf you need a job that's flexible around your home life, SunGard is the place to be.  They offer great benefits compared to most although now that they're being bought out by FIS things might change.  I've never worked somewhere that you can take 4 hours off whenever you need it.  Sometimes this gets abused but they really don't care as long as you're happy.The company didn't last long.  They ended up closing down and I had to seek work at other places.  I really enjoyed working thereA great company to work; I didn't stay here very long to have an opinion one way or another. The nice thing is that you work at the company's location you're assigned to and that was pretty cool.I would most likely still be employed with SunGard EB Systems if our Charlotte office had not been closed.  I had the opportunity to relocate to FL, AL, PA, or CO but family obligations kept me in NC.I started at this job and moved my way as far up in the small company that there was room to grow. I felt I had learned and gotten promoted as far as I could so I decided to look for new opportunities.  I small company is great because you become very close with the people you work with but mobility has limitations.I have worked for this company for 30 years. It has offered many opportunities for advancement. Great co-workers.Very good co-workers , parties, no stress environment. Friendly management , lot of training sessions.
