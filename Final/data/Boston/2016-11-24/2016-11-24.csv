363,1075.0,Senior Statistical Programmers,PAREXEL,3.6,243.0,"Excellent organization with work life balance and career development.Provides good benefits in terms of health and other aspects.When you arrive in the morning, you check emails for any updates or any critical changes in the DB. You get to learn very quick how to be proactive for the good management of the DBGood work place to begin once career, the management try their best to ensure that everyone imbibe the Parexel culture. working here really gave me the opportunity to learn a lotParexel is a CRO.  My job consisted of regulatory review, submitting protocols to IRB.  I reviewed invoices for payment.  I enjoyed working with sites and co-workers to help get a protocol started in a timely manner.  We worked at a fast pace and always willing to help each to make the project successful.The people at the company are great.  co-workers are very supportive. Management is bad. Productivity is measured by numbers which is fine except management keeps changing what is important and defining goals that are loaded with buzzwords but are fundamentally useless on a day to day basis.  Learning is OJT which is fine. there is always a budget crisis.  But the people are really great and the sense of humor at non management levels is enjoyable.Company is growing rapidly and hiring many new employees. Great co-workers! Work life balance is not a priority for management.PAREXEL is a good place to work however there is limited career growth opportunities.  Also there is a decline in senior management oversight, leadership & support within Quality but overall a good starting point for experience.The job is very demanding, although you do not need to have a specific professional formation. It is a huge company so that you learn to work along with people from all over the world. The environment is very nice, and mostly young people from 20-30 years old work there.Co-workers are very helpful.  The team mindset is relatively active in most projects.  Unfortunately, transitioning to a more challenging study is very difficult.professional  coworkers, standard process. and nice place to self development.  exposure to different theraputic areas.PAREXEL has a good work and fast paced environment. Learn many aspects of Early Phase Clinical Research. Diverse work group and opportunities to travel nationally and internationally.They do offer training in new departments. It is a very educational company for new young college students. The staff is very friendly.Management of clinical category (Patient Recruitment); responsible for strategic oversight and management of supplier relationship management, spend/savings targets, MSA negotiations, score card and rate cards. Strategic Sponsor Partnership management over 3 main Partnerships - Procurement Lead.I worked there for years and decided to leave after my last review.  I was held back from promotion for not completing something that wasn't included in my goals.  There workload is heavy, it's difficult to get promoted and the department goes through frequent reorgsVery compliant and conservative work environment. Lot of trainings and focuses on quality a lot. Very detailed understanding of Regulatory affairs.Excellent company to work for. Have never had any concerns to mention.  The group I work with is excellent and work great together as a team.Global CRO with excellent personnel who strive to make a difference. Talented senior management. This company provided my first introduction to Oracle E-Business Suite and Hyperion applications.I have worked for PAREXEL for four years and have gotten good employee reviews. I have applied for over forty positions internally and have been turned down without notice or feedback. I brought it up to my manager's attention, and also HR's attention. all they had to say is keep up the good work. On the other hand people in my department with ONLY high school diploma or less than a year of relevant experience get promoted to manager or Team lead. The company mission states merit based excellence. HOWEVER, it is not merit based its who you know.Over all Parexel was by far the greatest job I have had.I would have liked to have turned it in to a career, but with the company restructuring and moving to PA. there was no other option but to seek employment else where. but on a typical day our teams focus was on customer satisfaction. Ensuring all orders are picked, pack and shipped out accurately.Overall a daily work day was full of productivity contacting sites and retrieving, and reviewing regulatory document for IRB submission, and approval. Managing my time which allowed me to stay in top of my sites to achieve patient enrollment to clinical trial. I find being a part of an industry which support improving the quality of life for patient less fortunate is very rewarding.Discrimination in the employees. Laid off people on the discrimination of likes and dislikes.The management is very biased. No projects in the company , the employees are not friendly , the managers also not very understanding.","10,000+",Boston,Waltham,MA,2016-11-24T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/cf8725dd-2591-4945-9ff0-09a4decc34ed?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=32,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
