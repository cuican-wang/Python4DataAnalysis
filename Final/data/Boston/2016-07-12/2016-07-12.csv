665,1377.0,Sr. Principal Research Scientist CCTR Cyber Network Defense,BAE Systems,3.9,1700.0,"BAE continues to be out of touch. Instead of being cutting-edge the motto seems to be just ""cut"". Management constantly changes incorporating their own vision without regard to the impact of employees. The job market is difficult, but this company's mentality has declined dramatically over the years. Do not expect a long-term career unless you are upper management. The most enjoyable part of the job are the co-workers. Great team-spirit and a willingness to work hard and do their part. However, this is sometimes strained because of constant layoffs and fear of job security.The company has a great legacy and terrific potential, but management needs acknowledge several of the elephants in the room and work with all the employees to address them.Long dirty hours in harsh enviroment. There was nothing enjoyable about this job. Would not recemmend for long term employment.It is an excellent company to work for. They have great benefits and the company is very large and they can place you on another contract, if the one yo are on expires in most cases.Experienced a hostile work environment with my co-worker, who felt I had ""oversold"" my skills and experience and was therefore not worth the air I was breathing in our small office. Management felt otherwise. Funny, that co-worker no longer works for BAE... karma strikes again.Great job for people who love working in an industrial environment. 8-12 hour workdays.   Multiple shifts can work basically from a typical work day to weekends only.  Beautiful new building, nice healthy lunch room.   Company has an employee fitness center.  offers overtime and its not mandatorywell it was soso when there was work i was great but when there wasnt it was pretty hard the days were average i was able to learn a little co-workers were oddIts allowed me to get rehired a couple times so I really don't have bad things to say. it was a good environment. about the only issue I had and did not agree with was on the 11/08/16 we had a meeting between HR and my head of dept. and we agreed that I was going to be allowed to return to on 11/09/16 wich I deed and at 12:30 I was called to the office and got terminated for missing days after I was told to take time for the passing of my mom who had dementia so I was somewhat disappointed for going back on what was said on the meeting other than that its a great place to workBAE is extremely fast paced with requirements changing daily.  Employees are willing to adapt and think quickly in order to reach the end objectives through the difficult periods.A typical day is great something different everyday. Work is not to hard but very satisfying knowing that you are detrimental to the whole weapon system process of ship building.I worked at the Land & Armaments group in Santa Clara, CA for 6 years.  Unfortunately, the location was closed and the capability moved to Michigan.  But while I was there it was a great place to work.  Healthy work environment - no good-ol-boy network, nepotism or discrimination - a truly enlightened management who treated people fairly and with genuine respect.  Good work/life balance, ethical business practices and friendly and supportive peers.I enjoyed working here. I performed automotive assembly work which was great. We often worked ten to twelve hour days so we made a lot of money from overtime.BAE systems was a good work environment. It was pretty organized already, so all you had to do was keep everything in order.I admit that it could be a bit tiring, but once you have the routine down, it got easier.aboeing is fun you just work a ton of hours if your a contractorthey say that there is no prejudice towards contractors or Direct hires but that is false....they will treat you like dirtA great company that values their employees. I would typically work on different projects mainly assisting other employees who need certain files from the repository. I enjoyed being able to complete the tasks assigned to me and helping other employees by keeping the entire repository database organized and accessible by anyone with access.all of us works helping each outher with no one getting hurt to get the jobs done faster and right the fist time if you get the job done right the fist time it well get to the job on timelove working for BAE, the people are great and the management is always available to help. The only downfall is that its contract work. never know when your last day .Software coding on a long term project for the Court system Good Management Had Great Benefits Learned a lot of Computer Technology from UNIX to Windows and Networking protocolsBAE Systems is big. I wish they had more ground maintenance programs like the one they had in Hawaii.  Repairing and servicing government vehicles meant work was almost guaranteed. co workers who looked forward to work (for the most part) made it a fun place to be.I had worked at BAE for many years and the experience was great. They are a Government Contractor and as the contracts end there are Lay Offs as I was caught up in.BAE Systems is an outstanding company that annually requires Ethics training.  There is a tremendous amount of online training available and multiple contract opportunities.","10,000+",Boston,Burlington,MA,2016-07-12T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/cf333202-0abc-4a5e-9922-27be1c58754f?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=19,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
