BioPoint places contract resources in the pharma/biotech/medical devices industry so most of your contact is directly with each client, however BioPoint management is readily available if you have an issue and need assistance.  I have worked as a Consultant/PM for them for a few years now and have only positive things to say about them.  Pay is always on time, they check on the client but also on you throughout your contract.  Most consulting companies I've worked with in the past don't bother with that.Client work is demanding, fast paced, and contractors must be in compliance with all regulations.

294,1006.0,Senior Pricing Statistician - (Job Number: 992027),Staples,3.7,5600.0,"So working in the copy and print center at Staples was anything but calm, between printer problems and five hundred page orders there was always something going on in the print center. Depending on what shift you started on your day would be either more or less busy, but it was always busy.The co-workers were generally nice to talk to but ultimately uninformed as to the awesomeness of printing. The Easy Techs were really fun to talk to and be with they were actually very knowledgeable about their machines.The management of my particular store were gods of micromanagement and god was it annoying. They wouldn't actually do anything but seem busy at the same time. And on top of that any problems you had were summarily dismissed.The hardest part of the job was the time table and the machines breaking down. The most enjoyable, for me anyways, was the printing aspect which was most of it. I love dealing with paper mounting, cutting, and laminating, binding and color testing. All aspects of printing.I enjoyed my co workers and the environment at Staples, the managers were very friendly, yet still professional.  I enjoy working with customers so that was another positive.Love the people working there. Everyone works as a team. You will always learn something new working there. Its always a good time at work.While the opportunity for advancement was limited, I enjoyed the customer contact. Particularly enjoyed learning the various machines and the creativity involved in producing a quality product. The job provided the opportunity to learn new skills.It's fine. There's nothing much to say about a part time retail job. It's exactly what it promises, nothing more or less. When things are busy, they can feel overwhelming, when they're slow, it's interminable.Staples is a great starter company for someone fresh out of college.  Due to the size of the company there are opportunities for growth.it's a job. it's the same thing day in, day out. i haven't learned anything really. the manager is nice but he's quiet. nothing is really hard about the job honestly. the best part of the day is being on the floor to be honest.Overall I think it's a great place to work. The supervisors really do they're best to work with any and all schedules. They really have a pretty good plan to helping people keep their job due to schedules.  The plant manager walks around on a daily basis talking to employees making sure they are all doing good. And and you really work two weekends out of the year and its only one day.Good place to work. Plenty of different job possibilities to improve your career. good management staff that is willing to help you promote yourself if you are interested in moving up the ladder.Well a typical day would be coming in to sort through the boxes and packages first.Then we start to load the trucks with our factory paper. Next I would start to put the boxes that will be moving out on that truck in it proper place on the truck.fun and everyday there is something new as a challenge. work hard to server customer with best ability to accomplish their need. management team are really helpful when you need there help.Long days, price changes and an report to 15 different managers in one day all of them telling you something different.  The plan o grams never actually worked and the tech then was obsoleteI was employed with the company for less than a year, lack of hours lead to my leaving the company. My coworkers were fun to work with and they were all hard workers, making the job greatly enjoyable.Work hours for part time employees tend to be inconstant and fluctuate without any rhyme or reason. This makes it a challenge for the employee to plan their personal finances.A typical day of work was scanning boxes, picking the needed product from nearby aisles, placing the product into the box and then pushing it back onto the conveyor belt. Sometimes I would also make the boxes and clean up at the end of the night.Like another reviewer said, this place has a toxic work atmosphere. There is a core group of people who have worked together for years and if one of them doesn't like you- none of them like you. One of the supervisors is a textbook example of a psychopath.Never understood what I did to be on the receiving end of their BS, but I know my situation isn't unique since they have so much trouble keeping people. It's not a place where you can just do your job and go home.I showed up every day. I worked hard. They ran me off.A typical day at work. Delivering 8 to 12 hours a day.I'm delivering office supples to schools,homes and diffrent businesses.I deliver 2 two 3 new businesses each week.My general manager and all of the other managers at the store I work at have been so awesome. I left the company for school out of state and they got me a cake and gift cards to buy school supplies. When I got back for summer break they instantly re-hired me to work for the summer and were just as amazing. The upper management seems to be a little more difficult and unorganized. Our store runs great but when we have customer complaints, most of them are due to issues outside our store.This company is a joke period. Their print department, not only cant generate revenue, but they cant train their employees properly. Can't move up unless you know two team managers as in BFF's. They treat the employees like its Kindergarten.Staples tries to treat their employees reasonably well, but it is still clear that either they do not have the funds to do so or are simply unwilling. ALL employees, not just those in sales positions, are required to meet a daily quota of sales requirements, ranging from getting people to sign up for the free membership to selling a certain amount of extra product (i.e. a ""market basket"") with any technology sales.There is no commission and no incentive for reaching quotas other than keeping your job. If it were not for these quotas, I feel this would be a very reasonable and even enjoyable place to work; but as it stands, each day is very stressful. When I was being interviewed, the manager described it exactly as the title, verbatim: ""This is a high-stress sales position. Can you handle that?""This is not to say the work environment is not friendly. The managers are under pressure to reach quotas as well, so it feels like a team all working to achieve the same goal.Name recognition. Retail and outside sales presence. National Account Representatives pay is not acceptable.intially compensation was acceptable but has. Even reduced.did not enjoy working here. new tasks were introduced every month or two and pressures too. this is highlighted by the fact that they never increased pay.","10,000+",Boston,Framingham,MA,2016-11-15T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/3dc5985e-c467-4631-a2c2-37f5d9dd7e58?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
