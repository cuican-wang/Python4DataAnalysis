141,853.0,Senior Customer Data Scientist,"The MathWorks, Inc.",4.0,40.0,"People first culture. Great orientation meetings to learn about the company. Collaborative environment. A lot of great talent.Overall, MathWorks is a good place to work.  The product has very loyal users and continues to grow and evolve.  The devotion of the customers continues to make working with MATLAB a fun place to work.  But as in all companies the company can also be directly effected by the direct manager.Great company to work for if you are a Developer Or Quality Engineer. Your performance will be reviewed in terms of what work you do otherwise it is difficult to survive.I am moving for my boyfriends new job and have to leave this amazing company because there is no location where I'm going.Warning: This company will ruin you for life. They are incredible and I highly doubt I will be able to find a company this amazing again.They are picky with who they hire so if you get an offer consider yourself lucky. CEO- amazing, managers- amazing, growth potential- amazing, benefits- amazing.Ok, I'm getting repetitive. I have worked for many large companies before and none compare. I am sad to be leaving and wish MathWorks nothing but success in the futureIt's a great company with great benefits, but lower salary than most other companies within the same industry. (This comes from many departments within the company). It's very hard to improve anything because it always goes back to ""it's the way it's always been"" situation. Managers don't notice/value the time/work hard working employees put in, which makes it very hard to move up within the company.Assisted with the creation of lesson plansLearned how to teach teenagers math and make it as enjoyable as possible. The coworkers were really involved into teaching others and helping me learn the process of teaching kids.I interned in Mathworks in Fall 2015. I learned about the MATLAB editor and compiler. Mathworks is a very cool place to work with.Even as a new intern, I was given a lot of responsibilities.Great people, great work. Lots of interesting projects going on. I enjoyed interning here. The main focus is on quality.Awesome place, awesome almost everything about it. Interesting work, great people to work with, and great benefits. Pay is more than industry average, but slightly less than inner-city Boston or Cambridge (like 10% less, since they are almost an hour outside of the city).MathWorks does everything it can to listen to the staff and make their lives easier. Happy people make for a collaborative culture and you feel like you make a difference.Awesome to be worked there.Working there gave me an immense pleasure in exploring my ideas and applying them in practical.The work culture is very serious and focused. The food is amazing. The benefits are good. Manager was a very co-operative and nice.Worked as a sales support intern, treated me extremely well.Great co-workers, friendly atmosphere, solid amount of work and opportunity.Atmosphere is fantastic.  However, not a lot of room for career growth.  Great way to gain experience.  Most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you helped make a difference for your customers.- Typical days at work involved team meetings, one-on-one meetings with team manager and reporting the progress every alternate day.- Hardest part involved researching  to develop the prototype for my project and debugging to get the desired result.- Overall, An awesome place to work with a fun-loving and high-energy team where co-workers are very supportive.Weak Middle ManagementThe hardest part of the job is managing the expectations of each level from management to end-users and coworkers.  Management micro-manages under the guise of collaboration. Had to play arbitrator between upper and middle management. Huge discrepancy between the role that was sold to me and the role that others expected. My manager explained role one way and my coworkers had completely different expectations of my role which caused enormous problems, then my manager was frequently absent and when present was largely unavailable to deal with infighting.HR is like a high school clique - unapproachable and doesn't have the time for anyone not in their crew.Recruiters will give you the rainbows and unicorns version of the company culture, but it only applies to one or two departments. Any other department is hit or miss.MathWorks has a strong corporate culture with variations for the team.  One can tell that the executives have thought through the mission/values and they actually follow that.  Most employees are very intelligent and motivated.  You need to find the group that you fit in because each one is different.  This also makes working across teams in a large projects difficult.I  learned a lot of team working skills, improved communication skills and had an hands on experience in working with cutting edge technologies.As a Master's student, Mathworks gave me a wonderful opportunity to learn and shape my career.Looking for a larger company that is a little less process oriented and more focused on gettingt the job done.The MathWorks has a good work culture and offers a lot of opportunities to demonstrate and develop your skills.","1,001 to 5,000",Boston,Natick,MA,2016-10-27T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/418950f3-3ab9-418f-b498-28d24fa808ac?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=20,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
201,913.0,Ultimate Hoops Statistician,Life Time Fitness,3.6,771.0,"The job is very corporate and is all about the company making money and the benefits keep getting worse.  The gym is beautifulManagement is composed of a bunch of children who do not care about their employees.The turnover rate is horrible, which is a reflection of the entire company. They make you feel very undervalued and then expect you to go over the top for minimum wage. It gets too busy to perform the job at the highest satisfaction. They don't offer pay raises. Everyone is indispensable. Expect you to sip the company cool aid 24/7. There is absolutely no training, they hire you and then it's sink or swim till you figure it out. It's not ""the healthy way of life company"", rather it's just another corporate gym trying to gain profits. This job is for high schoolers and entry level persons, unless you are working in some sort of personal training, dietitian, nutritionist role. Other than that, don't waste your time with this company.My lifetime location has great management. They personally make you feel cared about. However, you can tell corporate doesn't really care about you. Minimum wage for everything expected is way too low. Also, there are really no raises and no opportunities for promotion. But you do get a free gym membership.So don't work here full time if you can help it. If you really want to work here just do it as a side job for the membership.People are ultimately promoted to manager positions based on their sales ability and not on their ability to develop or lead a sales team. I have had my best manager of any career at Life Time and 2 of my worst of all time. Movement and change keeps Life Time relatively innovative however there is often change for the sake of change making mastering certain skills difficult. You will also be expected to work weekends and minimum 50 hours a week. Work life balance is quite poor but the overall culture is good.Focus is so much on members that it takes away from day to day function of the club. Team Members are to be retained by management but everyone is replaceable and it shows through behaviours of management.  I don't believe the club should be open on Holidays especially Christmas but it is and it's terrible that people have to take away from their families to come in for the 25 members that will check in that day. The pay is terrible for the type of service we are expected to provide.  The software and hardware that is used for a 21 century club is less than desirable. It shows how much upper management cares when nothing works 100% of the time.Great company if you want to have free gym benefits. However, my department head and gym coordinator we both self centered and showed favoritism to certain employees. Very cliquish company that pretend to have high standards of quality, yea right. Plus, they deduct a $7 product service fee from each massage. It is impossible to use $7 of cream in one massage unless you're spoon feeding it to a client. Products we rarely stocked and management were inferior.I like working for the company however I prefer to work where there are advancement opportunities. This challenges me to work harder and strive for something greater. The kids and the team make it feel like a big family though.This company is great to have the benefits of a free membership and that is all.  Management there is horrible and the children that work there could care less about Lifetime's target market.  I am 46 and have never seen a sh-- show like this.  I think Lifetime needs to stop depending on executive types in their 40s for membership and solely rely on targeting the highschool and college students to meet their revenue quota.  LolThis company is extremely unprofessional with no training for team members.  The best description for Lifetime is Wal-mArt in a pretty suit.  This company is poorly managed and ran by children who have great computer skills like most kids these days.You meet a lot of amazing people working for this company and there's a lot of room for advancement if your willing to work hard. However, the work-life balance is non-existent and the management needs a lot of work. The turn-over rate is very high so a lot of people come and go.Management doesn't respect their employees. They will throw you under the bus in a minute to make themselves look better. They never offer raises even if you worked there for 2 or 3 years. Different departments are disrespectful to one another and the issues are never address by management. There is so much drama that is never properly handled. Policy is only followed when it is convenient for the department head. There are several children dropped off with mental disabilities yet none of the employees or department heads are properly trained/certified to take care of them.Aside from the free membership, the kids and some of the team members you meet are really the only pros of working there.Everything is about customer service and product knowledge.  Selling fitness is not an easy task seeing as everyone wants to join a gym but don't know why.  Our job was to find their nugget and explore the possibility of assistance to help the new members achieve their goals.  We are taught how to explore the question as to ""Why did you come in our doors"".  We learned the value of team work and what it meant to be successful not only as individuals but as a team.  Management was ok, I found my real help and inspiration from my Sales Manager, Roland Commacho.  He showed me how to take my job apart and just concentrate on one membership at a time but to also work towards a goal for the day.  Loved working with my coworkers because everyone was a piece to the puzzle as to why the new member was going to succeed.  The hardest part of my job was the very long hours.  Sometimes I would be there from Bell to Bell, putting God and my family out of the picture.  The most enjoyable part of my job was to connect with all my new members and them thanking me for getting them started today.  I have been selling memberships for a long time and there are still members there when I first started my journey with Life Time.It is impossible to have any work life balance. This isn't a builder job and even though management preaches education, if you ask for help with education chances are they will tell you they don't have time to help you and they will tell you to look it up yourself.It's incrediblyhard to have any stability in your life working at lifetime fitness.  The paychecks are up and down, and the management is constantly changing.  I believe in the products and services that we provide, but it's mentally taxing to work in this place.The role of a personal trainer within Life Time Fitness is not that of an actual trainer but that of a salesperson. Trainers began their fitness career to help people and get compensated for it. However the pressure to gain clients and provide numbers does remove the fun aspect of training. It also does create a variable income as your pay is determined by if your clients show up and sign up. This is a draw against commission job with little to no room for advancement. This is not a position for people with young children as you will always work evenings and weekends because this is the bulk of times that people who can afford your services will be able to utilize the training. The world of PT is a revolving door and I watched many good trainers disappear because of their beliefs and talents wasted.Operations is very fast paced and is not for the feign of heart, you will literally have to clean diarrhea off the ground at times... But if you can get past that it can be somewhat enjoyable. The ops crew at the Palm Valley is amazing, everyone works as a team which is essential for the job. The boss or Ops Manager is the best in the game, he actually cares for his employees and does everything he can to give raises to keep the team happy.Telephone sales, in person sales, and online sales were a major part of my day. I gave tours of our club and explained promotions, membership options, nutrition options, and personal training options with new members. The management was fair, however there was little room for error. I appreciated the structure and speed of the positionI was hired in as a supervisor and really did enjoy working there as well as the members you meet. However, I feel at times management was too laid back, and I took the job more seriously. The pay wasnt all that great being a supervisor, but the free membership was great. The facilities themselves are amazing!Will say this though. High turnover rate. Advancement in the company is hard. I wont complain about being hired in as a supervisor, but I will say there were people that had been there for years before me that probably deserved to be considered for the position.Excellent company to work for. Great benefits and very good pay for what the job requires.Excellent management and organization through the whole company.If you seek to live a healthy way of life, Life Time has great opportunities for this for their team members. If you don't, than many of the benefits will not be benefits to you. They speak often of a healthy work/life balance, however do not in turn offer this easily.The company was amazing with great structure but there was not great management transition. When we got new management it did not help the companyTypically the work environment is very lively and productive, it can potentially be chaotic if there are irritated clients. I learned a lot from this company mostly in dealing with people and my co-workers. The management at lifetime fluctuates and has its ups and downs like any other large company. My co-workers are very positive and active people, along with being helpful and supportive. The hardest part of my job at lifetime would be saying goodbye to families that have been with us for many years as they move out of state or decide to go in another direction. The best part of my job is seeing the excitement on my students face when they accomplish a long time goal or overcome a fear that has help them back long enough.",,Boston,Westwood,MA,2016-10-27T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/7383d856-f433-428c-b596-f14b02406841?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

660,1372.0,Chief Battery Scientist,Cabot Corporation,3.5,43.0,"Cabot is a leading specialty chemical and materials firm.  As such, it is highly dependent upon the ""value add"" proposition gaining traction to the customer.  This business model, when applied universally, translates to better margins especially in growth markets seeking more efficient product solutions.  However, in a stagnant World economy as we are currently experiencing, customer decisions shift to overweight economics compared to value.  This paradigm will over time lead to purchasing decisions being viewed as more commodity based especially in price sensitive markets such as energy.  In a Technically based Sales function, proving the efficacy of one product versus the other is difficult.  Especially when the customer views minor points of differentiation between your offered material and the competitors product as minor and has data to prove it.  It becomes a price and service competition with price being the key entry and decision point.  We struggled to compete on price as it ran counter to our business model.  Unfortunately, the market does not discriminate toward models and eventually reaches equilibrium.  This led to major conflicts internally culminating in Operational Cost cutting.  This required massive lay offs.Unless you fit in with the click or do non company things you will not work there. I worked there for almost 2 years and trust me Cabot is not all what it seems. I did not my work to the best of ability and was not enough,Cabot is a great company to work for. My skills were utilized and I felt challenged everyday.The people made the job enjoyable. All levels interact directly and there is advancement available in most departments.I learned more about Accounts Payable at Cabot which put me in a ""super users"" category using the JD Edwards finance system. With this knowledge I was able to train new employees on the system and help when needed.The hardest part of the job was the inconsistent workload.Event planning was also a job task that I enjoyed. Several times/year there were large meetings and events planned at our site that required customization and attention to details. This was the ""fun"" part of my job.Cabot has a family environment that is casual and easy to work within.  We are a small group that has overlapping duties.  It is challenging but rewarding.Overnight travel 50%  large region, 25-30% administrative work, Selling premium product in a very price competitive market.  Good customer relationships.Each day you were extremely dirty and it was unavoidable. The pay was great and some of the job duties were easy. In the end they laid off a lot of people for poor financial decisions.Managed entirely from Corporate. Lots of politics and posturing for appearances with no accountability for results at the top. Financial games lead to misleading financial results. Systems are obsolete and inadequate. Not a good place to work.Typical day involves a twelve hour rotating  shift with four crews working four days then off four day.  After four days off the day crew switches to nights with the night crew switching to days.Setting up and building new process development assemblies. Applying electronic-data collection and interpretation.I was able to improve my understanding of LabView programming, learned JMP software, executing DOE for multiple experiments.Supportive management but company having problems.  They are currently laying people off due to hard times.  They have treated me fair.A typical work day is spent chasing around what its corporate office wants---and there is no questioning them. Collaboration is non-existent in many areas, with individual skills existing in a vacuous environment. Cabot is a reactive not proactive company when it comes to investing in their people. Promotions and the limited training they have are catered to building its external image and gaining positive employer ratings. Lastly, unlike most companies today, bonuses only apply to management, especially its executive team.A typical day is either being bored out of your mind or work at a very fast pace. You could have 20 things that need to be accomplished in an hour to having 0 things to do all twelve hours. I have tried to become more proficient at time management. The management here is alright. My crew we all work as a team, so this is good. The hardest part of the job is not having enough people to do the job. This company follows the less is more style of tactics. The most enjoyable part of the job is the days off.fun place to work, group lunches, and casual business attire. paid holidays. Big company that cares about its employees and growth.Just a job, morale is low and I am told it has been for years. work schedule is long and being on call while on a long off is not a plus.Working for Cabot has allowed me to develop the skills and knowledge I possess today to be a successful Buyer. Management provides ongoing support and guidance. Overall culture is positive and nurturing.I worked at their production plant since 2008. Very busy and friendly environment when theres jobs. The company says they invest in their employees and help them grow in the company but not so much when me amd a couple other individuals that worked their as long as i have. I applied for multiple positions within the company to advance my skills but they ended up hiring someone from the outside. Would only go back if they hired me direct thru the company and up my pay rate to $40 per hour. Wasted 5 years of my life there.•Manager of a team in support of all manufacturing processes.  •Supports and trains Group Leaders/Team Members in all essential functions and skill sets as required effectively operating and continually improving their processes.  •Responsible for the work flow in their area of operation. Leads the team in safe and effective execution of production plans using a structured lean work and management system. •This includes leading effective response to abnormal conditions, leading problem-solving activities to obtain sustainable standards, and supporting continuous improvement efforts in their area.Cabot is a global manufacturer of specialty chemicals, with more than 40 manufacturing plants worldwide.  It is headquartered in Boston, in the Seaport District.  The company has been in business for approximately 130 years.The company produces carbon black, activated carbon, fumed silica, and a variety of other products.  Carbon black accounts for at least 75% of their revenues, activated carbon and silica account for almost all the rest.  These are commodity products, meaning they must product large volumes to earn profits.  They are at a fundamental disadvantage to some of their competitors, which are far larger and better capitalized.  Nevertheless, the company maintains relatively strong market positions.Cabot owes its success to a commitment to being superior to their competitors in engineering and R&D.  Unfortunately, the current management does not seem to value this nearly as much as their predecessors.  They have made a series of mistakes in acquisitions and divestments, which have put their viability in some jeopardy.Cabot is a very nice place to work in many ways, they pay well, and you can learn a great deal about business life there.  But there is a constant state of tension there.  People seem to get fired on a continuous basis.  The management is very anxious to promote their values in their words but their actions don't often match their words.The best part about Cabot were the benefits. The work was dull and a few of the people ruined the feeling of it being a good place to work. I would only recommend Cabot to people who are willing to deal with the hierarchy and really really really want to work with materials. Assist members of the Transportation Team in acquiring freight rates and booking shipments with carriers Ensure that there is a current freight rate entered in JD Edwards for all upcoming shipments Review daily Order Reports to identify new shipments and changes made to delivery times or locations of current shipments Maintain good relationships with carriers and coworkers in order to deliver excellent customer servicegreat company to work for, very flexible, works with you needs. interested in what you want to do in the future within the company.  I have learned so much concerning controls. Everyone works as a team.  the recognize your accomplishments.","5,001 to 10,000",Boston,Billerica,MA,2016-10-27T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/2ce54f6e-9ca2-43cd-9783-e83cc8bb8af6?mescoid=1100001001001&jobPosition=14,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
