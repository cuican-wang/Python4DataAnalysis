105,817.0,Insight Studio Senior Data Scientist,Deloitte US,4.0,3600.0,"- A lot of interactive with client's finance deparment- Need to grasp new concept very quickly- Requires attention to detailsTypical day at work is managing staff and deliverables in engagement and working directly with your contacts at the client. Co-workers are almost all young, and everyone is fairly social. Management varies widely depending on project. They have time-flexibility.Good Compensation Benefits, good peers and managementSkill enhancement - There are so multiple opportunities to increase your skills and the management provides many options to exercise one's talent and grow in the company.The compensation is excellent at Deloitte. The only problem is the people they hire. Young college graduates, no experience from top tier schools who thinks they know more than someone who's been in the business for years. This creates a very poor culture, many people have that bro mentality, and the females they hire know nothing about products, but they are physically attractive. It's more than the service but an image at Deloitte. Looking to leave to a company like Oracle. Advancement is also contingent on who you know.Not the job for you if you don't like to travel. Usually you'll have to travel to no name towns. Hit or miss on the project team members, could be great could be terrible. Lot's of ambiguity. Get paid well and have great benefits. Very strict promotion schedule, not at all a meritocracy. Very hierarchical with big headed partners that think they are God's greatest gift to the world.I've had a great and diverse experience in the firm. Coming in as an MBA intern, there are few if any better options. People overall are friendly, but it is a ""Big Firm"", ""Small feel"" environment, so it will largely depend on the team/engagement that you end up in. Compensation is at par with the industry, without being above or below. Overall a good place if you want to pursue a long term career in consulting.Good people and work ethic.  Would recommend to those new graduates to consider working for Deloitte.  Great access to leadership (Partners) for all questions and guidance (mentoring program).  Excellent opportunities in advancing your career and education.Nature of consulting is not for everyone but Deloitte is the best place to be in Consulting.  Deloitte is bit more conservative than other Consulting firms.  The standards are higher and the expectations are greater than other firms.Company culture is very poor, tends to be an environment where everyone attempts to look busier than they are in actuality. Not an inclusive environment at all. Collaboration is lacking here sadly. Depending upon performance review you can be ""counseled out"".Benefits were really good, PTO, health stipend etc.This company gave me a step up immediately out of college and taught me a significant amount in a short period of time. Though the learning curve is steep, the people I worked with were very intelligent, and personable. The major issue with the company, is that you will have multiple busy seasons and a small amount of work-life balance. Many people are jaded into believing that working a 12 hour day is normal. The best part of the job for me was the people I worked with, and the amount that I learned, however, it was not worth it for me to give up years of my life for quick advancement.  I learned many things in 2 years, such as: how to manage people, running a full audit engagement from start to finish, professional etiquette while travelling and managing multiple jobs, time management in extreme situations, meeting tough deadlines, running meetings, Sarbanes Oxley 404, filings such as 10-K, 10-Q, S-3, acquisition procedures, opening balance sheet, reviewing prior auditor's workpapers, etc. I have worked with companies that make $100M to $30B on an annual basis. I am glad to have worked with this company, and appreciate all that I have learned, but am happy to be leaving.Work life balance and compensation are a big minus in deloitte. People are fired more. Work culture is the best that I have seen in the consulting firms that I have worked onGreat and fun company to work for with great compensation and benefits. Overall the management and leadership is good depending on what department you work. You definitely wake up and want to go to work and I love the diversity and Deloitte is very bit on diversity.Deloitte is a great place to start your career in terms of the exposure you get to various industries, types of roles/responsibilities and opportunities. If you can find your niche, align with the firm's strategy and build the right relationships, you can go far here. Upper management is trying to improve work/life balance with a new ""well-being"" campaign, but the micro-culture on individual teams continues to be what dominates your life.Overall good place to work, Business minded atmosphere, lot of high profile clients, I would recommend this company for anyone with intermediate to experienced skillsDeloitte as a whole is a great environment to work in. All the people (peers and upper level) that I've worked with are friendly, approachable and willing to help. I never once had an issue with anyone at the firm. Deloitte offers a great benefits package (medical, vision, dental, 401k etc.).From the moment I walked in the door in the morning there was a positive vibe that the team could achieve whatever it set out to do. We were all very heads down and would achieve our work on or before the allotted deadline with the expected level of quality. If we needed to gather as a team, we did it quickly and managed to achieve the expected outcome.The environment there really fostered a learning environment. I've learned how to deal with difficult situations and how to manage upward.The hardest part of the job was the administrative ""red tape"" surrounding having security settings changed.The thing I enjoyed most was the satisfaction that the customer had with our product that it was working as expected with the appropriate level of quality.Work pressure is more. Work-life balance is not good. salary is less compared to peer companies. Not many projects are there with the company. people get rolled -off more often.Great company with a good brand. Internal workings of firm didn't meet external reputation. It benefits the practitioner to have grown up in the firm. There's no path to success for experienced hires.There was no constant, partners were moving, colleagues were moving or leaving, a state of constant flux.  Loved my job, thought it was secure as the key administrator/researcher for a team, but politics of those higher up muddied the waters.very nice work culture.Good compensationNew opportunitiesgood team spiritGood managementJob securitygood life balancegood projectsgood benefitsDeloitte has a great culture, awesome benefits (PTO, work/life balance encouragement, flexibility, etc.), and opportunities to advance through the company.I worked for 5 years in consulting and 3 years in an internal role. All 8 years were challenging, but what I experienced in each role was very different. There is a lot of pressure to perform well, which provides stress but also a lot of opportunity to learn and grow quickly - hence the high reward. Unfortunately, with this high pressure comes a lot of unreasonable expectations that hinder work/life balance and create unnecessary stress. There are also a lot of politics that you deal with - at Deloitte and at the client. Overall, it was a good place to start my career, but my health and personal relationships would probably be better if I had only spent a few years at Deloitte and left for a less stressful company.I was a Senior Consultant in Strategy and Operations. I joined Deloitte after graduating from a full time MBA program. If you weren't at Deloitte prior to business school - don't even consider it as an option. I was let go around the 2 year mark, despite receiving top performance ratings on all of my projects (6) and being told I was 'on track' to be promoted. There is no support for new hires, and when sales go soft, non-GSAP is the first group to get cut...regardless of performance. Further, the staffing process at Deloitte is AWFUL. As a new hire, you are expected to network your way into projects.  That would be all well and good if there were enough decent projects to go around, but there aren't. By my estimate, 80% of the work that Deloitte does is one step above staff augmentation - very little executive level interaction or strategic thinking. If you don't have an existing network, you WILL end up on these projects...it's just the way it works","10,000+",Boston,Boston,MA,2016-11-09T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/8d2690e8-ac81-43ea-81cd-ceaef2e5ac8f?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
