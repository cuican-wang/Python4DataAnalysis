251,963.0,Analytics Engineer II,Vistaprint,3.5,39.0,"Vistaprint is a great place to work. There are a lot of perks that come with working there. Free food trucks, sabbaticals, lots of time off, and a good work environment.If you are straight out of college, and want to spend all of your time at work, this is the place for you! Company has amazing benefits, but be willing to put in the time. Lexington location is easy to find, however, traffic - not so good.Very fun work place, family oriented and helps you to be a well rounded individual. Management is encouraging, wonderful colleagues we learn from each other each day.Great work place I have had extensive training in providing high customer service, email proficiency, digital marketing and website designs. We currently have a strong management team that offers support in their specified area.If you work in Marketing or Engineering, you'll love working at Vistaprint.  A fun, young and casual vibe.  People are really transparent with projects, expectations and eager to collaborate.  Very ""work hard, play hard"" mentality.  Great company overall!It is fun to work for a high growth company which leads to broadening and challenging opportunities.  Challenge is to keep the growth coming.There have been big struggles with turnover and constant changes in organization and structure.However, the majority of the people are really intelligent and a pleasure to work with.I worked at Vistaprint for one semester as graduate intern for the Learning and Development department. Here is a list of some of my achievements:• Supported strategic and tactical efforts in the design and development of learning solutionsfor the Learning and Development department.• Conducted needs assessment for the company’s Emerging Managers Development trainingprogram.• Collaborated with Human Resources in the design of learning solutions for high potentialemployees.• Created, designed, and facilitated Conversational Spanish lessons for Vistaprint staff.Vistaprint was the best experience I've ever had in IT.  I was well managed, and truly felt they cared for their employees.A typical day at work you punch in to start your shift. Ensure you have all the apps that you will need to do your job open, Check your email to get information on upcoming changes new alerts etc. Be ready to provided world class customer service to business people who works hard to ensure their businesses are successful.Sure it seems great environment at first with free snacks/coffee, occasional free food truck lunches (Lexington) and an impressive compensation package/bonus. But after the honeymoon is over, you quickly realize that everyone is in it for themselves, work/life balance doesn't exist (most employees work at night) and support from managers is fleeting. If you enjoy backbiting, gossip and unprofessional behavior, then this is the right environment for you. If not, do yourself a favor and stay away from this toxic workplace. You'll either be fired or quit within a year.The environment is attractive, but there's a great deal of work to get done.  Pressure to work late too.good work environment, but priorities and strategic goals are a moving target.Vistaprint is filled with nearly all talented, motivated people - wonderful to be around.  Each day is busy and different from the next.Vistaprint is a great place to work. The company emphasizes professional growth as well as personal growth, offering its employee both skills training and yoga classes. The company works hard to keeps it’s employee happy with food truck days and a community feeling. Everyone that works at Vistaprint seems to work hard to achieve professional growth and team work is highly welcomed.I went to Vistaprint with high hopes. I left a wonderful company and a great position for slightly higher pay here and I've regretted it terribly. Having worked here over a year, I have found it to be a very cut-throat workplace with no regard for employees' personal lives. I have been enrolled in a Masters program and have had to take two semesters off because the workload at Vistprint is relentless. It is expected that employees regularly work their full day and then jump back on the computer at night to show they are putting in the extra effort. But, the extra effort is invasive of my personal life. Its infuriating contstantly having senior managers requesting information on Saturdays and Sundays. Working here is a new form of anxiety that I have never experienced before, nor will I again. Luckily, I am getting ready to leave. Talking with former employees of Vistaprint - I can hardly wait for the sigh of relief they've noted when giving notice!Good growth Company, but Finance is a sweat shop with lack of decision making and poor leadership. In general the people are pretty good, but no one stays. Turnover is extremely high, part of the reason so many jobs are open. Plenty of room to negotiate salary and bonus, the Company will overpay. They are liberal with sign on bonuses but don't expect to be rewarded once you are in the door. Despite the claims, bonuses don't exceed 100%, so don't believe the hype that you have significant upside.Finance is a reporting function only, there is zero strategic partnership. Expect to work a significant number of hours just trying to get the basics done. Good opportunity to come in for a year or two and then jump ship for something bigger.Free lunches are nice along with free drinks, but I'd rather have a meaningful job and work normal hours than to get a couple of perks, work 80 hours and have a mind numbing job.Great culture - Management values employee base. Talented base of Technical employees. Hardest part of the job, although I didn't mind it, was the off-hours activities supporting an e-commerce site- friendly working environment- productive and smart team-members- warm company culture- hardworking individuals","1,001 to 5,000",Boston,Waltham,MA,2016-09-20T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/40964962-0938-4d7c-bbcb-07ac9fab62cd?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=25,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
