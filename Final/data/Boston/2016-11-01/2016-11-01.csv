140,852.0,Data Scientist,Bose,4.2,325.0,"I had been with Bose in various positions for the past ten years.  There were a few years due to the economy that caused some anxiety, but for the most part it was a great company to work for.  Due to changes in the electronics industry, the company had to restructure and my job was affected by the changes.I used to cover resellers over three states, and really learned how to stay organized and to best make use of my time.  Relationship building and gaining advocacy in short visits was critical and with my sales background was able to get very measurable results in short time periods.It was a very sad day when I had to leave Bose, but also exciting to know that I can take the training and relationship building skills with me to another career, and start the next chapter in my life.Bose is a great place to work, but going through changes due to challenging market,  Work life balance was good, benefits are good, and most management is very good.I very much enjoyed my time with Bose. The only reason I am no longer employed with the company is my location was outbid on rent from another company so we were forced to close. I enjoyed my job, interacting with my coworkers, and the company itself. Bose truly cares about it's employees and that shows through competitive salary, great bonuses and awesome benefits. 10/10 would work for the company again!Fun place to work, true ""open door"" policy at all levels of management. Company has an employee first attutude.Great products for home theater and audio.Having the ability to meet new people as they get to experience the sound of Bose, is exhilarating. I work at a company where I get to be surrounded by music and co workers that are just as passionate about music and a stress free life with the amount of systems we have to bring out the best needs of any customer that walks into our store.Working at Bose is a very positive and well built infrastructure. All the tools and resources are provided to make it the best place you have ever worked. I was with the company for 7 years. A lot of changes took place in 2015.I have worked here for many years and I would have to find an amazing opportunity to make me want to leave.  People typically live out there career at Bose.I thoroughly enjoyed working at Bose. The benefits and work environment is absolutely amazing! The company takes care of their employees and management to the highest level!Its a great company to come and work and help customers with any concers. I get to learn a lot from each customer that comes in to the storeA typical day at work seems to be more stressful than most. The company puts a lot of pressure on you to sell products, even to people who do not wish to buy.Upper management at Bose is a mixed bag. The research and development side is brilliant, while the marketing and branding departments are stuck in the 1980's. It is for this reason that the company has been losing ground to newcomers, even when Bose products are equally priced and of superior build quality.As for the working environment I can't complain one bit. It treats its employees fairly and the benefits are substantial. However, due to immobility at the top, job security becomes an issue as the company see's its ROI drop year after year.It was a great experience, just wish there was a place for me to grow in there as a young professional.The employees make this a very nice place to work.  An excellent place to network if you are a musician.  I was given the opportunity to perform in several great musical encarnations.Working for a luxury brand is a fantastic experience. Everyone is familiar with Bose, so I don't have to spend 10 minutes explaining who we are, and what we sell.Most enjoyable has to be helping a variety of different people with finding the correct product to fit there needs. Working with my co-workers is a joy and the ability to learn from them when I first started was awesome. My Manager and Regional Managers are great team to work for just great attitudes and great energy.They respect and value employees. They have solid corporate values and bring out the best in you. Since working at Bose, I have had a deep understanding of process improvement.I enjoyed working with people in great environment. I learned a lot over the years, but I miss Dr. Bose. I hope new management will make this even better place. Only time will tell.Sales is sales no matter where you go. At least you do not have to fold clothes, right? Good management willing to help. Wish they treated there seniors staff as good as new staff.New leadership has changed company direction, lack of communication has affected my opinion of company and morale.Great place to learn new skills. Learned SAP and learned a vast amount of knowledge with excel and communicating with other DC's to rectify inventory discrepancies.I worked there for 4 years in tech support. The people you work with each day are great. It was what made the job. During that time the company's goals seem to have shifted. Moving up is very difficult unless you personally know the person making the decision.My experience here was overall good. There was, however, very little supervision and management throughout the warehouse. everyone was just kind of on their own, so if you wanted to work, you worked and stayed busy, and if you didn't, you didn't, and eventually got called out. I found it impossible to move up and worked in every single department without any sort of acknowledgment. This place would be better if their sales were better, and if they paid more attention to their employees.","5,001 to 10,000",Boston,Framingham,MA,2016-11-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/ea5fee5d-622e-4bc9-b428-44ab5c53a86e?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=19,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
152,864.0,Data Scientists,Tripadvisor LLC,4.0,27.0,"reat benefits - free HMO, on site fitness classes and paid yoga classes. Free in office snacks and drinks, breakfast catered each Friday.his place is run like a frat house - you're either in, or out. Extremely unprofessional management who run the company like a private and inappropriate club.TripAdvisor is a great company with amazing perks and benefits for employees.  People can move up quickly within the organization if they are smart and ambitious.  However, some people get promoted too rapidly up the organization.  They may be great at their jobs but do not have any people management skills.  Overall I think TripAdvisor is a great place to work if you have the right supportive manager.The culture is very collaborative. Colleagues are nice and helpful. Working hours are flexible. Hold you job accountable and get jobs done.good sight , my only problem with the sight is when a customer gives a company a bad review they can dispute it and have it removed it does not give a true evaluation of the restaurantI was so entitled to my cubicle. My job was eliminating duplicates which was a job that could excel could do in three minutes.I did not find anything challenging or to prove my skills at all at this job.Great company to get experience but there is little opportunity to grow. They have great benefits, great lunch options and snacks. The company is growing and with comes typical growing pains.Promises. Promises. Promises.   Promised me everything when I started .  It was great for the first few months!   We moved to a beautiful new building , lot's of perks/benefits... with not so many kind people. Respect level is low. The only employees that are seeing any type of financial gain are senior level management and senior level engineers.   You will  NEVER meet your goals.  They are unobtainable. The yearly review process is ridiculous. No pay raises.   The turnaround is huge.  A revolving door.  HR is useless.  They are so disorganized and uneducated on policies and procedures.  If I needed an answer to a question, no one had it, or they had the wrong answer. Wouldn't pick up phones.  It was quite frustrating. The Vacation rentals president was nasty and rude. As for the free lunches.. attractive but not worth the pain and suffering to work there. They do have a bar on site. These perks do   attract the younger culture.TripAdvisor is a great place to work. Smart people work there but less arrogance which makes the work environment easy to work in. All of the benefits also makes it worth while, but beware sometimes can be a bit overwhelming in terms on working a lot.The best thing about TripAdvisor is the people who work there. Everyone is incredibly smart and always pushing the company forward in new ways. My understanding of the industry grew incredibly during my time there. Surrounding yourself by smart people is always a great benefit. Free lunch everyday isn't bad either, especially if it's restaurant quality! Management has high expectations and people usually start packing up around 5:30.In general, I agree with one of the prior reviewers, whose ""Cons"" for TripAdvisor read: ""Unfocused and immature management, a highly enefficient [sic] workplace with minimal room for career advancement.""However, I don't agree with everything this person said - there's a lot more to it than that.Let's start with the negatives (bear in mind, this is based on my own experiences as well as those of others - but is not necessarily universal):1- Much of the middle management (including Directors) was promoted from within. This sounds good - why is it bad? Because they are high-performing, type A folks promoted for their individual contributions and tenure, NOT for their managerial skills and potential. This means that a key layer of management is, as the other person put it, ""unfocused and immature."" This leads to micro-management, squabbles, and general dissatisfaction - as well as inefficient hiring practices. Speaking of...2- The hiring process is terrible. Communication - which should be good, since there's a dedicated, internal recruiter between the candidate and the hiring manager - is often slow and tough come by, and there can be long lags in the process for no good reason. The recruiters are hit-or-miss - many are fantastic, but the better they are, the more likely they are to be saddled with far more positions than they should have to handle.3- Part of the hiring issue is that candidates interviewing for individual contributor roles are often interviewing for 2-3 roles at a time - contributor, senior contributor, and even associate (junior) contributor at the  more... same position - without being told. So if someone comes in to interview for a Senior Engineer role, but doesn't have the experience, they could be offered an Engineer position - but they didn't know that was an option until they received the offer. This is ""sand-bagging"" at its worst, and some hiring managers are more guilty of it than others, but the fact that it's allowed at all is unfortunate.4- Career advancement of direct reports doesn't seem to be at all interesting to the middle management layer. There's a general attitude of ""Show me you want to move up, show me you deserve to move up, then convince me WHY you should move up... and I'll consider it"" among the managers and directors, rather than them acting as allies and advocates and helping their team members advance. This could be because the company doesn't want people moving up the ladder too quickly, but it causes good people to leave the company too early if they're at all ambitious. Now for the good (and there's a lot):1- The people (individual contributors) are fantastic. I've never worked with a more intelligent, enjoyable group that loves to solve problems.2- The pay is competitive-plus.3- The benefits are extraordinary. From the fitness/gym/sports reimbursement to the travel benefit to free lunches five days a week in a brand-new, catered facility, it's clear that the company wants to make their employees happy... at least with superficial things.4- Chance to work on exciting products. 5- Equity in a billion-dollar (revenue) company.6- (and this is a huge one) Exciting brand with a great reputation among other companies, especially in the Boston area. If you succeed at Trip, other companies know that you can do the work they ask of you, and will come calling. So 2 years of Trip on your resume will get you plenty of interviews for a one-level bump at a number of other firms.I enjoy working for TripAdvisor, and recommend it to friends. It's not for everyone, and the cons can be dealbreakers for some people, but it's a good place to work with diverse, friendly coworkers, good pay, and a fun overall experience.  lessI love writing and photographing the reviews I deliver.  I have focused on Hotel's, restaurants, and things to do.  TripAdvisor is based on individuals who write about their experience that forms a consortium for a particular place.  Being a chef myself, and customer focused, I always will meet the manager, and get a brief story of what I am writing about to personalize it.  This is a passion of mine and am a Top Contributor of TripAdvisor with many badges and followers who read my reviews. I would love to incorporate my experience in the food, hospitality and travel that I have years of experience doing.On the good side, people are quite diverse and interesting, but management is extraordinarily immature and unfocused, with their products reflecting this mood: this is the mega-mammoth of travel services, and it just about sums it up - big, grotesquely uncultured and massively inefficient.Imagine having 10+ years of experience but reporting directly to someone who has half that... and has never shipped a new product before he/she joined the firm. Your days feel empty, scrambled and uneventful, and you are being micromanaged (that's what people do when they perceive you as a threat or when your product management role is downplayed to the level of a technical project manager, whereas your contribution to the product's roadmap is limited to writing technical documentation). Chances of career advancement? Zero to none.Shame on me - I should have known better: when you have shipped roughly 5 times more marketable products than your hiring manager, your career is going nowhere... and sadly, no one cares that the department is managed poorly.Ironically, if you do get hired into an environment like this and are good at what you do, you *will* be perceived as a threat unless you are good at playing dumb. Combine this with the fact that many of their developers are overseas and you will have to collaborate by getting on the phone at 4am or 9pm a couple of times every week, and this will not sit well with you unless you are a workaholic willing to work for a 10+ year old company that iterates products like there is no tomorrow but offers you zero equity in return for your  more... hard work.  That said, I am quite unexcited about working for TripAdvisor or for any of its subsidiaries (e.g., Viator) again in the future, even if my pay is much higher.  lessExciting opportunities working at a fun, lively HQ with ""speed wins"" mentalityIf you are into the culture of fast paced for the sake of fast-paced, then this is the place for you, and if you are an engineer you are in a good place, but unfortunately, the positives of this company do not extend to the administrative positions, where the Human Resources department is hostile, ineffective and joyless, and that extends outward. Benefits and compensation were great, but not worth the bad feeling you leave each day with.Company provides great salary, fun work environment along with health benefits. They focus on keeping you happy by catering lunch 2-3x week snacks, coffee etc. Amazing place to be part of .","1,001 to 5,000",Boston,Boston,MA,2016-11-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/22dcce74-385c-4999-a212-5fd72a3acb71?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

222,934.0,"Medical Science Liaison II, Oncology - Southeast Region",Baxalta,3.7,55.0,"Baxalta/Shire is a professional and positive environment with great culture and diversity.  With Baxalta/Shire being a start up company it provides challenging learning experiences.  Management is willing and eager to teach and learn along with the rest of the team.  Team members have different levels of experience, therefore we learn from each other and work very well together.Being a Manufacturing Tech I has gave me the skills, tools, and leadership roles. I was so involved in volunteering within the company. I loved it! I knew that i was able to make a difference but then again i was saving lives by packaging plasma products for any destination all over the world nationwide. My job was sufficient with many tasks so it gave me that skill to be multitasking many things at the same time in our Packaging department.Good compensation and benefits, flexible working arrangements, beautiful office spaces.  Very progressive thinking company, nod to the future allowing workers to work remotely when possible.This place needs to be gutted and restarted... The management is HORRIBLE!!!! They are like one large clique that will throw their employees and each other under the bus at a drop of a dime! The upper echelon only cares about their image to corporate and trying to advance up the corporate ladder.  Don't be an intelligent minded person that challenges the norm because you will become a target and your days will be numbered.  I honestly hope that Shire clears out and restructures the entire upper management structure, from Senior Managers on up, for the better.  Maybe then we can actually build a culture that is for the employees and not for the leadership team.Benefits are great. Advancement potential is based on who likes you and not on your merit. You get very little help from your Masters, Supervisors or Management.  You get written up based on whims. The manager at the Harrisonburg facility as well as the QA manager are misogynists. The Manager has stated that LPN's are glorified a** wipers. There is very little positive encouragement from most managers. Breaks are very limited. The Regional manager, HR manager and their respective superiors are aware of the issues that face this facility and they have done nothing to resolve those issues. You cannot trust supervisors and management.Baxalta has a great culture. Everyone is friendly and always willing to help. We work as a team. The benefits are decent, but not a lot of additional perks.The company has gone through a lot of changes these last few years such as branching off, then independent, then bought off. Along with these changes came layoffs, no pay increase, probabilities for growth have always been hard. Management and pay is not the best. Its ok. Because of layoffs, work load has increased. Co-workers are nice. Lots of schedule changes.My typical day at work involves performing a hands on physical for donors to determine their eligibility to donate plasma. I provide donors with information regarding reactive test results. Assist donors with reactions and any health related questions about donating plasma.The work is overwhelming and the management does not seem to notice. However the people make it worthwhile to work here.My typical as project manager was review construction status, scope, schedule, budget and ensure the quality assurance was exceeding expectations.  This was my first time working in bio-pharmaceutical industry I learned the manufacturing process engineering and clean-build. My colleagues brought a diverse wealth of knowledge and worked together to achieve building a multi-billion dollar manufacturing facility. The most challenging part of the job was to  manage cost since this scope creep was constantly changing due to design. My colleagues were supportive and great people that bonded and spent time outside of the work place.People are really friendly and encourages you to keep climbing. They will teach you what you need to learn and work as a team. Management is good and the work life balance is good.Biggest turn over rate I have ever known of. The hours are very very inconsistent Some days they will work you 10 hours on your feet all day and complain about giving you a water break...bc you will then have to ""go to the restroom"" ...Management goes out and parties with their favorite co workers and definitely shows favouritism. Employees steadily talking gossip about other employees and donors. Really depressing place to work. They just let whoever be phlebotomist and even when the very nee phlebotomist steadily cause hematomas in the donors arms they just keep letting them stick. They don't car at all about the donors. Very stingy company. Thankful I'm I'm not there anymore. I'm finally getting back to myself and not so depressed.UPDATE 6-16Company was recently purchased by SHIRE.  Nothing safe here!!  Over 700 staff where laid of in APRIL and culture is terrible!  Cruel and disorganized.  Steer clear of this place!!  Used to be a place for ex Amgen staff and good people to grow!Good Company to work for, learned many new skills with oracle's JD Edwards. Always good to know that what you do helps people live a more normal life.A typical day at work is as a Clinician; as a educator to teach preventive health care; as a consultant & coordinator, as a Occupational Health Nurse Case Manager.Management and coworkers have been supportive and has allowed me to be autonomous and innovative.  The hardest part of my job is being outsourced.The most enjoyable part of my job was working with all of the employees.No work and life balance.  Poor management that only cares about numbers and metrics. You can only advance if you are one of the favorites no matter how good of a worker you are. The company pays for lots of training and traveling. Could be a great company when ran by the right people.Career ladder opportunities!

I've learned that management is helpful and available when ideas or concerns come up. I'm part of a department that wants its team members to be successful. They have helped me multiple times to advance my ideas and get recognition for my work.
