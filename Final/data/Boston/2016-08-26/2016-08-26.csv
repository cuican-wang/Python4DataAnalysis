634,1346.0,Associate Chemist II(2nd shift),UL,3.1,7.0,"Each day I visit a factory that could be of any type of industry and conduct a social compliance audit, where I tour the plant to assess the safety of the workplace, talk privately with the employees to gauge their experience, training and treatment by supervisors, and review of EHS programs as well as HR practices.I usually worked solo but occasionally partnered with another auditor from the team.  Our team is very supportive of each other and always helping each other in communication as we audit.I learned how different products are made, the OSHA regulations for health and safety, EPA regulations, and most of all, how to delegate different task items to different managers throughout the day and work with different types of people of different cultures across the country and Canada.  The most enjoyable job for me, at the same time, is working with people all day, getting to know people of different cultures and languages, and helping people learn things they didn't know and how to improve their facilities.The hardest part of the job is not being home as much, and not having a constant schedule, as I receive my travel schedule only a week in advance for each week.  It is also hard to do several audits within a week when there is residual work in the evenings to complete between audits, while having travel between audits in addition.  It is a challenge to balance work life and personal life.This company is undergoing so much change and trying to find its identity. This company has no direction at this time. They have no concern for their employees or customers. The turnover rate is extremely high and the moral is very low.This company and its management team makes many promises but doesn't keep them. I had many made to me about bonuses - pay increases - training, etc and not one was kept. As a matter of fact - I was scheduled for training and they pulled it from me but gave it to someone else who was the managers pet. And the managers show favoritism. It is not about if you can do the job and do it well - it is about if you fit their mold personality wise. You cannot and are not allowed to be your own unique self but you must conform to what they think you should be. They do not promote training, professional growth, advancement from within or anything that improves you as an employee and individual. The managers have their favorites and those favorites get all the special treatment. I highly recommend staying away from - especially the Franklin, TN location office.",,Boston,Canton,MA,2016-08-26T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/08d4a2c4-4690-41a0-ab26-1c8aa8f9fa60?mescoid=1900259001001&jobPosition=23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
