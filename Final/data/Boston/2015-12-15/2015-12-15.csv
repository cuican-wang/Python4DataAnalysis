136,848.0,Principal Data Scientist,Millennial Media,4.1,11.0,"The company is great and the environment even better. Surrounded by people who are driven and amazing at their jobs. Given the volatility of the market and industry there is uncertainty on where the company where go and thus career advancement is not the easiest.I worked as a consultant, writer and video producer on a contract basis for six months. This is a vibrant, exploding and dyadic company run by the best technology and creative professionals in the business. People are valued for what they bring to the company and rewarded for excellent work. The culture is collaborative, entrepreneurial and positive. It is one of the most exciting places I have ever worked.I've had the pleasure of working at Millennial Media from the time it was about 50 employees to the joint Millennial/Jumptap company of 650 employees. In all that time I've had fantastic mentors, opportunities to advance quickly and a great work/life balance. The culture at Millennial fostered the relationships that made the employees my second family. The attitude is work hard when you need to but then take time for yourself when your work is finished. I would recommend the company to anyone.Fun workplace, but bigger Data Science focus is needed.  Also, some upper management changes would be nice in some offices outside Baltimore.Millennial Media is a great place to work, the culture is a true start up feel with energetic and intelligent co-workers.Fun atmosphere to work in, company is growing at a rapid rate, good location, causal dress.Locations are great, the industry segment is growing exponentially, and there are opportunities to grow, but it's all second place to the people.This was probably the best job I've ever had or will have. The people there are all concerned about working together, rather than worrying about only their jobs. They are committed to the people around them, and to the job at hand.I loved working at Millennial.  Since I have left, there has been a shift in leadership - this was needed all along and I am optimistic that the changes will help move the company to the next level.I built up the QA Team from 1 to 8 team members.  Went from waterfall to agile in 2 years.  The experience was invaluable and has enlightened me as to how to do it right and be successful.  Millennial Media is taking the mobile industry by storm and will they take no prisoners.",,Boston,Boston,MA,2015-12-15T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/99319875-4efe-432e-a2d2-efcbf9909964?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
