117,829.0,"Sr. Data Scientist, CORA",Biogen Idec,4.2,245.0,"Biogen is undergoing some changes.  Senior management is being replaced up to and including the CEO, a new company is being spun out of existing products, one manufacturing site is being built while another one is being closed.   My job is a manager in the manufacturing facility that is being closed and to be honest, I am surprised at the amount of transparency in the closure process and the amount of services that are being provided.  They have excelled in that regard.I enjoyed my time at Biogen.  The work/life balance was great.  The people were fantastic, and, you worked with MS patients which made the job worthwhile.  You were helping people.- A typical work day was productive- Always learning new things to improve my job - Management very understanding- Coworkers willing to give advice and help when neededBiogen prides itself on working fearlessly and changing lives.

Right now they are running a skeleton crew. Need to work on being so top heavyGreat place to work excellent supervisor  family friendly allowed to learn new skills and flexible schedule.  The hardest part of the job was knowing it will end temp.Excellent company to work for. Very considerate about work life balance. This company also offers excellent benefits. This job also offers great opportunity to help people.Great environment, pay and benefits.  It was close to home at the time.  Until most of company moved to Weston which is reason I left, I was used to not having a commute and walking a mile to work.If the company did not move I probably would have stayed there.Attending various meetings. working on BRD, FRD. Attending various requirements gathering sessions with SMEs.Working on Visio diagrams and swim linesFantastic culture of caring and dedication. superior infrastructure with excellent systems and training. Many perks and great benefitsThe manufacturing environment was stressful due to the ""shift wars"".  Management did not care about the workload left over from one shift to the next. The schedules were also uneven and recognition was only given to a select few. Performance was evaluated by the amount of projects or meetings an employee participated in and not the actual work performed. Promotions were given to their "" favorites"". Management was unprofessional bad mouthing other supervisors and managers in front of employees. Bad environment to work in if you are serious about your work. Lack of accountability and various  issues that were constantly overlooked. If you weren't part of the ""click"" you were pushed aside and trampled upon. Experienced employees were not taken seriously while the"" favorites"" were compensated. Completely opposite of the supposed company values.Company truly does care about the patriots and puts them first. Company is going through some changes now and it will be an interesting year.During my time Biogen Hemophilia was a mostly separate entity that was collaborative with the R & D group in Cambridge. That system had its drawbacks but it did allow for rapid decision making and clear communication within the group. We did have a management change during my tenure and while it did lead to some staff turnover, the development of the drug candidates continued rapidly and the quality of the science continued to be excellent. In the last two years at Biogen I personally spent much of my time overseeing assay development and sample testing for both pre-clinical and clinical studies. I learned about cell line development and characterization, clotting assays, SOP writing and review as well as how to implement and execute testing in a GLP setting.The hardest part of the job was meeting deadlines and keeping up with regulatory reporting guidelines that governed our types of assays.The most enjoyable part was seeing our candidate molecules go from early pre-clinical studies into human trials and have real, positive impact on patients' conditions. My colleagues were very talented, driven scientist that worked well together and were dedicated to delivering the highest quality science to back the development of life-changing therapies.A wonderful environment filled with dedicated and caring peopleTruly dedicated to helping people. Wonderful pipeline.Awesome schedules and work from home policy along with flexible telecommute schedule. Scientists and employees work hard for lives that matter.Very work-life balance and good benefits. People show respect to each other a lot. Managers care about the team as well. A lot of team building activities going on.I enjoyed the time I had there. Working at Biogen was a good type of culture and management was decent but could be better.Complete your assignments on or before time and enjoy your working lifeRandom POC's help to learn Depth of Business and TechnologyFree to try and use technology that support Biogen businessManagement is good if you work wellCoworkers are supportive and cooprative","5,001 to 10,000",Boston,Cambridge,MA,2016-10-19T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/93702090-4b5e-466c-9a10-4260449478db?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=28,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
