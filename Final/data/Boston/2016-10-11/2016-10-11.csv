209,921.0,Sr. Biostatistician,Telligen,3.5,15.0,"Telligen is a great company, its employees in mind. Each employee is a owner after one year and this has benefits. The training I received was not sufficient to complete the job, but this is not company wide. Its complex environment with little room for error. Redundancy is the work, which if you like regime and unchanging work - this is for you. The group contract with OHCA and that part of the job is quite interesting. Overall, I loved my time there.Enjoyed every aspect of this job. Staff was great to work with and we all got on together very well.We were able to wear casual clothing 4 days a week with jeans on Fridays. Help was always available. Supervisors were very good. Felt a part of the family.great pay and benefits were great when I first started but now the benefits are not the best. Relaxed work atmosphere and team work is good depending on which team you are on. Staff turnaround is low but staff do transfer to other departments quite often.Not a good employer. Are encouraged to work harder and faster and not take breaks. Work is salaried. Work about 50-60 hrs a week for same salary. Work is contractual and can end at any time. Management is only concerned about making money, not the employees. Supervisors are secretive and there is alot of favoritism. Lots of harrassment of employs not in the ""clicks"".  I enjoyed the people I worked with while at Telligen, I knew what I was doing on a daily basis, and enjoyed working on my own, I don't like to be micro-managed as long as the work is getting doneTelligen is very in line with market norms as far as benefits and compensation. They whey heavily on market research to and adjust accordingly.Executive management is unapproachable and out of touch with employee population. Management likes to blame others.  No advancement opportunities.   Felt unappreciated from management. No work life balance.  Would not recommend.Calling patients to do their monthly phone assessment and education, charting there assessment and progress on health goals.Usually tried to get ahold of 7-10 patients a day as had a case load of 150 to 170 to complete each month either assessments or 3 attempts to reach member per month. Calling Dr offices to collaborate about patient. Sending out educational  material to the patients.I learned a lot about  health  coaching, care plans and using the computer at this job as well as Medicaid and finding resources for the patients.My direct mangers were good and very willing to help the team with  any time off needed.My co-workers for the most part were great team playersThe hardest part of this  job was the case load and deadlines at the end of the month. The most enjoyable part of this  job was the patients and my co-workers.Poor communication between management and staff. Not informed of changes until the last minute. Excellent training process. Was given one month to train with qualified staff member. Spoke with members on the phone about their current health issues, setting goals and developing a plan of care for each member.The employee owners at Telligen truly do make a difference. They are among some of the most passionate and caring individuals I have ever worked with.Telligen puts employees first.  Happy employees work hard to make their projects successful and their customers happy.I had a great manager, then I switched to a different department and was treated poorly. They expect you to do your work along with everyone else work. The HR department does not care.I was a contract employee for Telligen, but really enjoyed working there. The atmosphere was very layed back, and I had plenty of work to keep me busyGood company.  Contract work is unstable. People are great, but the work and job descriptions are not clear.All in all a good place to work, if you reside in West DesMoines","501 to 1,000",Boston,Waltham,MA,2016-10-11T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/13494a9c-7bc9-46c1-83d1-80729cc9be76?mescoid=1500153001001&jobPosition=18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
