95,807.0,Data Scientist Internship,American Student Assistance,4.1,19.0,"The work was challenging - which i love; and the rewards were amazing. Seeing how your work assisted with the growth of the company was rewarding. The company also values their employees (employee appreciation events, amazing benefit, great management).I expect this company to go out of business within the next five years. Leadership is lacking and everyone is more interested in holding on to what little they have rather than trying to make things better.The job was to gather missing information for the processing of student loan applications. No real interactions between co workers. You are always on the telephonesI don't forward to going to work like I use to.  Their use to be a lot more opportunities.  Management shows favoritism, speaking up will get you fired.Very busy, fast-paced environment that advocated a high importance of culture and teamwork.  Positive mission that supported a balance between loan payment and a personal understanding of student, post-graduate responsibility.If you like to sit around and do nothing this is the job for you. A bunch of zombies walking around.Friendly working environment. Benefits are great and many different training's offered to help us enhance our skills. The hardest part of the job,particularly in my department is it's repetitive nature. the repetitive aspect can become tiresome and directly affect how well you perform on a daily basis. I do however, enjoy my co-workers and most of my management team.As an intern, I was glad to be accepted as a valued member of a fast paced production team. They treated me as an equal and entrusted me with crucial tasks on a biweekly basis. The tasks required of me ranged from quite simple, such as making slight visual tweaks to the site, to creating the entire front end of one of their web apps from scratch. I learned quite a bit about web development and its best practices during my time at ASA and made some great connections. My co-workers were generally very helpful and fun to work with. My favorite aspect of the job was that I was able to influence the direction of the final product to some extent. As the website is targeted at college kids close to my age, I was asked to give my own thoughts on how to more effectively advertise ASA's services as well as make the site more intuitive and enjoyable to use. They took notice of every one of my suggestions and were very grateful for my input.On a everyday day basis the job involves a high level of calls incoming and outgoing where those incoming were priority over outgoing ones. Each of my co-workers work as a unit to minimize the high level of calls waiting to be serviced and with the support staff we were able to control that level. The hardest part of the job was not having enough data to serviced our customers more efficiently, while the most enjoyable part of the same job was getting the job done when customers are satisfied with their counseling.There was never a typical day. The diversity in my responsibilities, the energy of my team and the culture made being a work fun.I especially appreciated the autonomy I had in my role. My manager was available when needed, but trusted my judgment.  ASA's commitment to community allows employees to participate in events and programs outside of ASA. The people are amazing!Awesome place, mission and people.. it just need to find a way to make money and wish them the best in that.Very friendly atmosphere, as well as professional environment.Great place to work. Love my coworkers and management is great.Good company with great people.  Looking to  drive revenue through sponsorship.  Company is very profitable and is looking to create an additional revenue source.- 8 hr work per day- Front end development, includes html CSS, javaScript, JQuery and some framework like dust, foundation.- Co-works are nice- The Company has a casual atmosphere but the employees are business professionals.- Management is well informed with an open door policy.- The staff are friendly and knowledgable.- It was always enjoyable to come to work each day. Great location with a lot of public transportation options.Worked among very intelligent product management team that drove technical enhancements on a number of platforms. Enhancements created enormous growth of partner clients and overall loan volume.Nice place to work, but department don't work well together.I thought ASA was a great place to work. However, advancement was pretty much non-existent. When they decided to develop an extensive web development team, there was hiring from outside... not letting, for the most part, internal engineers gain experience. That was the biggest issue that I had. The tech experience I had when I started was what I had when I left.","501 to 1,000",Boston,Boston,MA,2016-11-30T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/d420768f-166d-4a21-a7ea-7657a54f2754?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

While all testers (over 100,000) are all remote from around the world, we can all come together to work on various projects for desktop apps to mobile applications and everything in between.As everyone works remotely and you have no direct contact with the customer, you must rely upon your prior experience as a tester and the information that is presented to you in the overview of the project.The hours devoted to testing are based upon whatever the tester has designated within their profile.For a seasoned tester, not being able to have direct contact with the customer means that the tester needs to be diligent about asking questions for clarification.",,Boston,Framingham,MA,2016-11-30T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/f5290163-ea60-4be1-ab9a-e68aa46ca495?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
