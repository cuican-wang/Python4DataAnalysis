196,908.0,"Network Scientist Intern - Undergrad Intern, Summer 2017",Raytheon,4.0,1300.0,"Challenging Engineering problems all day everyday:  Just the way I like it.  The section that I work in lets engineers do what they are best at.Learning is encouraged at Raytheon especially in the electrical testing field, management practices and administration, new and innovative electronics, computer sciences, and highly specialized NAVAL equipment. Hardest part of the job is the schedule of the Government, and potentially the hours required to work. Most enjoyable part of the job is the care and support that management and upper management play int he advancement of their employees.Routine/repetition in daily tasks most of the time. Was given the opportunity to be cross trained in a publications department. My former immediate manager valued employee opinions whereas current management doesn't appear to care. Mixed, some were back stabbers to benefit themselves. The hardest part of the job was trying to work past the negatives.Raytheon has been a good place to work.  During times of growth with work to keep the staff feeling secure it can be an enjoyable place to work.  When there are reductions in head count and closing of facilities the workplace can be depressing.   There is a flex work schedule for many employees that allows the employees a daily schedule that can be better tailored to their lives.  Most employees follow a 9/80 work schedule with alternating Fridays off.  Benefits including health care, dental, vision, 401K, and IRA are industry standard and are adjusted every year to be in line with competing employers.Work environment is casual. Come in when you want: just make sure you finish your work.I learned a ton. They really trust you to be able to do the work. And there's good and bad to that: you have an amazing opportunity to grow, impress and learn but you may stumble and fail.Management is variable but overall, I haven't heard anyone complain immensely. No micromanagement or abusive behavior.Co-workers are engineers in the most traditional sense. You're amongst your own kind.Hardest part of the job is dealing with the unsexiness of the defense industry. Another other complaints comes with any software job: boring bug tracking tasks, etc.Most enjoyable is the flexibility and the freedom to prove your knowledge/intellect.Pay is average.Raytheon is a great place to work.  Many opportunities for advancement in a fast paced and demanding work environment.   If you're a hard worker and have a great attitude sky's the limit with this company!good place to work but hard to develop and move up due to the union. non stressful environment with good management. benefits and vacation/ sick time were a plus.Flex time to allow work life balance made it easier to maintain perfect attendance. Attention to respecting others while getting the job done was a strong emphasis in the working environment. I learned the importance of integrity and the impact it has on self and others.The Co-Op experience was fantastic for learning the different sides of the business at Raytheon. I only had 2 years of experience at this company, but the overall culture/job was interesting and challenging.The leadership really look out for all the employees to the best of their ability. Great benefits and the family to work ratio is great for those with families. The only downside to working with this company is the lack of job security due to the contract based employees.It was obvious early on that Raytheon wants to be one of its larger competitors. I worked at the other company and they aren't succeeding at being as good or better. For starters, the technology some people need to do their job is so outdated. Even basics like Outlook aren't rolled out. Prepare to step back on time unless you are willing to find and pay for training on your own. Lots of conflicting messages about flexibility and balance.Starting from Corporate and into the businesses, there are cultural problems. It is very hierarchical and leaders are worshipped. Leaders foster a culture of mediocrity. If you have suggestions, you may be told that you're negative or a complainer. True commitment to diversity and inclusion is lacking. So much of a person's experience at Raytheon depends on the management chain.Great work environment. Management could use some training. Hard place to keep contracts. layoffs very often. Good benefits, college reimbursement,   401k, medical and dental.Very clean shop, with new equipment to work with.workers are all easy to work withManagement always there to assist when needed.Company has great benefits.This company was a very good company to work for. They gave good benefits along with good pay. I was sorry when I got laid off when they laid off 15000 employees nationwide.I've worked for Raytheon for almost 10 years. Excellent company and benefits. Diversity and respect for others important in companyTook the job, even though I live 75 miles north of Lawton.Great people and benefits, but too many miles are on my car now. Moving isn't an option yetIIS develops very complex systems.  There is a tremendous amount of domain knowledge within the company.  The main fault with the company is that these large unwieldy programs are being strangulated with an ill fitting agile/scrum management implementation (not to be confused with an actual engineering methodology).Benefits are the best part about working for Raytheon. It's a forward thinking company and they take care of their employees.Good place to work. Good benefits and lots of work. Working on state of the art equipment and lots of different programs.Raytheon has very challenging and fulfilling work if you manage to be placed into the right team.Some of the challenges is retaining great talent because benefits have been reduced such as elimination of profit sharing and reduced annual raises.Hughes Aircraft was purchased by Raytheon all together I spent 32 years with the company. Did many different engineering tasks. Lot's of opportunity to try different technical paths. Had a great carrier there for 32 years.","10,000+",Boston,Cambridge,MA,2016-11-05T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/f41c2e14-6ef1-4a7c-9db7-a63dc02a3f14?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=5,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
