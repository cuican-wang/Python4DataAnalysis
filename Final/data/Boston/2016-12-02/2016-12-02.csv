182,894.0,"Associate Scientist I, Strategic Analytical Group",Biogen Idec Inc,4.2,245.0,"Biogen is undergoing some changes.  Senior management is being replaced up to and including the CEO, a new company is being spun out of existing products, one manufacturing site is being built while another one is being closed.   My job is a manager in the manufacturing facility that is being closed and to be honest, I am surprised at the amount of transparency in the closure process and the amount of services that are being provided.  They have excelled in that regard.I enjoyed my time at Biogen.  The work/life balance was great.  The people were fantastic, and, you worked with MS patients which made the job worthwhile.  You were helping people.- A typical work day was productive- Always learning new things to improve my job - Management very understanding- Coworkers willing to give advice and help when neededBiogen prides itself on working fearlessly and changing lives. The bonds between employees and the culture here is like no other. I have learned a great deal about teamwork and the industry as a whole working here.Biogen is a results driven, innovative place to work. They are very big on work/life balance and provide great compensation and benefits. There are many opportunities for advancement, depending on your career path.•	Research on Development and Characterization of Mouth Dissolving Tablet formulation.•	Extraction of the anti-cancer agent from broccoli seeds.•	Develop models and analyzes data for formulation and process optimization using design of experiment methodologies.•	Has a good working knowledge of polymer chemistry, use of excipients in solid oral dosage forms and film coating systems. •	Operating experience with equipment including, but not limited to, weighing, blending, mixing, compression and coating of solid dosage formulations. •	Perform analytical testing to evaluate material and formulation performance, including, but not limited to, suspension pH, viscosity and solids content, color measurements,disintegration, dissolution and tablet testing.•	Perform routine stability testing in accordance with ICH guidelines and written stability protocols to assess product shelf-life and stability.•	Assisted in analysis of raw materials, in-process and finished products using HPLC, Dissolution and bench Chemistry tests such as LOD, Residue on Ignition, Id tests such as NMR and FTIR, Heavy metal tests, Karl fisher Titration and other tests. •	Assisted in maintenance and calibration of instruments such as UV Spectrophotometer and HPLC.•	Recognized for having strong organization skills and for being highly efficient with minimal supervision.Normal typical day would start with intake and triage assessment followed by case processing.Learned the new ways in signal detection and time frame management in Periodic reportings.Timeframe management was the toughest part in my work.RMP's was a part where I enjoyed a lot when compared to my regular routine work.I would go back and work there if given the opportunity. Right now they are running a skeleton crew. Need to work on being so top heavyGreat place to work excellent supervisor  family friendly allowed to learn new skills and flexible schedule.  The hardest part of the job was knowing it will end temp.Excellent company to work for. Very considerate about work life balance. This company also offers excellent benefits. This job also offers great opportunity to help people.Great environment, pay and benefits.  It was close to home at the time.  Until most of company moved to Weston which is reason I left, I was used to not having a commute and walking a mile to work.If the company did not move I probably would have stayed there.Attending various meetings. working on BRD, FRD. Attending various requirements gathering sessions with SMEs.Working on Visio diagrams and swim linesFantastic culture of caring and dedication. superior infrastructure with excellent systems and training. Many perks and great benefitsThe manufacturing environment was stressful due to the ""shift wars"".  Management did not care about the workload left over from one shift to the next. The schedules were also uneven and recognition was only given to a select few. Performance was evaluated by the amount of projects or meetings an employee participated in and not the actual work performed. Promotions were given to their "" favorites"". Management was unprofessional bad mouthing other supervisors and managers in front of employees. Bad environment to work in if you are serious about your work. Lack of accountability and various  issues that were constantly overlooked. If you weren't part of the ""click"" you were pushed aside and trampled upon. Experienced employees were not taken seriously while the"" favorites"" were compensated. Completely opposite of the supposed company values.Company truly does care about the patriots and puts them first. Company is going through some changes now and it will be an interesting year.During my time Biogen Hemophilia was a mostly separate entity that was collaborative with the R & D group in Cambridge. That system had its drawbacks but it did allow for rapid decision making and clear communication within the group. We did have a management change during my tenure and while it did lead to some staff turnover, the development of the drug candidates continued rapidly and the quality of the science continued to be excellent. In the last two years at Biogen I personally spent much of my time overseeing assay development and sample testing for both pre-clinical and clinical studies. I learned about cell line development and characterization, clotting assays, SOP writing and review as well as how to implement and execute testing in a GLP setting.The hardest part of the job was meeting deadlines and keeping up with regulatory reporting guidelines that governed our types of assays.The most enjoyable part was seeing our candidate molecules go from early pre-clinical studies into human trials and have real, positive impact on patients' conditions. My colleagues were very talented, driven scientist that worked well together and were dedicated to delivering the highest quality science to back the development of life-changing therapies.A wonderful environment filled with dedicated and caring peopleTruly dedicated to helping people. Wonderful pipeline.Awesome schedules and work from home policy along with flexible telecommute schedule. Scientists and employees work hard for lives that matter.Very work-life balance and good benefits. People show respect to each other a lot. Managers care about the team as well. A lot of team building activities going on.I enjoyed the time I had there. Working at Biogen was a good type of culture and management was decent but could be better.Complete your assignments on or before time and enjoy your working lifeRandom POC's help to learn Depth of Business and TechnologyFree to try and use technology that support Biogen businessManagement is good if you work wellCoworkers are supportive and cooprative","5,001 to 10,000",Boston,Cambridge,MA,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/a2a347f1-b6c3-4607-9d7b-ebafd39ac974?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=26,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
183,895.0,Submission for the position: Principal Statistician - (Job Number: 16000VOV),Fresenius Medical Care,3.6,1800.0,"Busy from the beginning to end of the day administering HD.Typical day at work begins at 630 am, you never know when you will leave. Management tries to retain employees, nice to work forcoworkers are hard working.Hardest part of job is never knowing when you can go home.keep production line running in a efficient way that met all guidelines, help produce product fast and efficiently, as weel as package, box, and stack correctly on palletsDon't get paid enough for the work. To many hours and   Employees aren't treated equally. Don't want to pay enough money for work.askedWages were better than any job I've had in many years of nursing. Hostile and unsafe work environment. Worked sometimes 24 hours/day. Never got lunch breaks. Managers threaten your job if you tried to stand up for yourself and made you work 18-24 hours/day with no breaks. Treated like a piece of garbage.The days are long and shifts are less than ideal, but the work itself isn't too difficult.FMCNA offers excellent benefitsPay is fair, considering high school or equivalent is all that is required for most positions.Co-workers and supervisors are typically pleasant to deal with, But I have never worked for a company that upper management will sit in team meetings and blatantly tell everyone how unappreciated they are, which can be extremely discouraging.worked as consultant. Excellent work environment. Had an excellent opportunity to work and learn a lot from the team. Highly motivated people and valuable mentors.Would not recommend working here, you spend too many hours working and not enough to do your own stuff, you wake up so early and go home really late.if you want to move up this isn't necessarily the place for you but job security is for sure. some clinics are better than others but for the most part each clinic is the same.Upper management are liars, uncaring and only worry about the money and getting their bonus. Clinical managers are treated very poorly expect to treat fellow employees poorly to get them to work long hours for low pay. CCHT's are the backbone of this company but are treated so poorly and under paid. I had a Director of Operations that was two-face, played favorites and took advantage of her position. Do not expect any support of HR when you have been wronged because they stick with upper management and do nothing to support the employees.I learned alot from this place it like a school,  if you are willing to learned they will training you and show you the rope , and get you ready for the job you wantFast paced environment with many job duties. Most of time spent on electronic medical charting. Co-workers not always cooperative with each other or management. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the patients and helping them in their daily life. The hardest part of the job was balancing the amount of work with required meetings and required training. Lots of deadlines for getting work done to present at meetings. Always something new happening requiring new training. High expectations for patient results which are not in anyone's control. Great medical, dental, 401k benefits based on what you choose for your personal needs.Worst place I've ever worked mangement is horrible and they discrminate I would never recommend this job to anyone go somewhere else to work. HorribleYou will never be able to spend time with your family. Never know when you be getting off.Alot of work for one person. Tech work hard but they get the end of the rope,Poor management they have their favorites does not respect the team as a whole does not respect the RN's not enough time to safely and effectively do your job always putting other stuff on you and then want to you to get out on time poor scheduling management does not care about the employees the pay rate is poorer than any other dialysis facility around poor staff turnover always hiring new people and people always leaving does not recognize the people that are valuable to the company and that stay and do more above and beyond anybody else. Nobody gets written up no matter how many times they call in or they are not showing up for work or they are continuously late for work. So the practice continues its a circus.Corporate headquarters  in Waltham is starting to run out of space for employee offices/cubes. Meeting rooms are slowly taken away and replaced with offices for those of the directors level or higher. Employees have the largest cubes I've ever experienced and the building as a whole is beautiful.I've grown so much working with Fresenius in my posting skills and advanced to a Senior PAR cash posting. I have an amazing supervisor and team membersA job experience and very interesting ,I gained lot of things,in conferences they were very helpful and easy to understandpoor management in the clinic as well as poor compensation for employees with longevity with the company. poor management from higher-ups. overall poorly run company as of the past year.I take great pleasure in the  execution of my Phlebotomy duties. I enjoy meeting new patients on a daily basis.  Our conversations are usually very interesting, informative and motivating, this allow me to carryout my duties effectively.   However, I am required to do a lot of driving, which cause me to  incur various expenses, such as car up keep.  Sadly, I am not  reimbursed for these expenses.This place would have been ideal for me if I had better gross motor skills. They train you as a tech before they allow you to perform nursing skills. You need to be able to setup the dialysis machine in less than 5 minutes ( I couldn't) and if you are good at that kind of stuff this is the place for you. Otherwise friendly, helpful atmosphere.I love my job and wish I could clone it for all my friends. I work remotely and have never felt so well supported even in a huge corporate office environment! I am valued and appreciated for my ideas and contributions.","10,000+",Boston,Waltham,MA,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/6f0c7821-59de-4025-baa2-6d8be911c5e6?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=27,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
212,924.0,Computational Biology Scientist - Knowledge Systems Group,Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,4.1,144.0,"Fast paced environment, interaction with coworkers in this department of Revenue Control was always positive when it came time to helping one another. This was also demonstrated in other departments; Customer Service Billing and IT department. The hardest part of the job could have been the last few days before End of Month deadline, but because of the comraderie and the willingness to work as a team, the Revenue Control department was more times than not, able to meet/surpass the monthly goal.The workload is excessive, not within job descriptions and with zero compensation to take on extra responsibilities that is the responsibilities of other departments.  You enter at entry level, you are told during the interview that there is plenty of room to grow, yet when you make an attempt to climb the professional latter, you're told, ""if you want to grow, find another job"". Poor morale.Dana-Farber is a world class facility that I felt honored to be working for. The compassionate care for patients extends to it's employees and there is a real cohesive effort by all departments. While the benefits are nice the actual salaries are not particularly competitive and it can be difficult to advance within the organization without proper connections.I enjoy working at DFCI. The environment and people I work with are great. The benefits here are also very good, no complaints. I would recommend this position to everyone and anyone.Great Place to work, excellent opportunity, great management support.Daily challenges getting all priority deliveries around down town Boston and other campus locationsManagement gave me the tools necessary to deliver services.When I started at Dana I was at the front desk, after a couple of months I was promoted to the multidisciiplinary clinic.  I say the hardest part of the job was to see patients with Cancer Metastasis go into hospice and eventually they were gone.  Even though I would try not to get attached to them, it was quite impossible. Even though it was hard, I enjoyed working there knowing I was giving my best to someone who were in their lasts daysThe Institute needs change at the top and it will trickle down to the staff and employees.  So many of the senior management have been in the same position for over 20+ years and they have not kept up with the times and the typical response is "" that's how we do it here""Weekly events include seminars with various topics related research areas. and there are free snacks during the seminars.      People are very nice to work with. The public kitchen is well maintained by everyone. By the way, the coffee machine is awesome!Good Place to work, I m Dependable, conscientious, team player for operations.I considerer this position as a service to the organizaitonGreat Manager to work forI absolutely loved being part of such a care-driven team. I was thrilled working with the patients, it was incredibly rewarding to function as an asset to the doctors and nurses that provided such necessary care to patients in their toughest moments.If you're interested in pursuing a degree in healthcare this is a great experience to work in a hospital.There are long hours and a lot is expected of research coordinators. I didn't have the best training and stuff was kind of handed off to me in a mess.Great work flow  some people are great to work together with. there a lot of favoritism at Dana Farber, with coworker on section floor but over all the patients are great.Humbling and rewarding experience with patients.Great benefits and perks.Many different experiences with personnel as to be expected some good  and some that can use improvements. Overall a good place to work.Very competitive. Everyone works hard. Miss it due to the casual academic culture. Very easy to make friends. Can talk to everyone. Very smart people, with lots of hope and wonderful plans for the future.Excellent place to work. Cares for their employees and truly sees the value in the work that they do. Truly care for students as well.A normal day is very busy.  There are many difficult manual differentials to be done, and many difficult patients that must be resulted so that treatment can be given to them in a timely manner.  Working the later shift, I've gotten to know many doctors when they come to the lab to look at differential slides.  The hard part of the job is knowing how sick some of the patients are, and that they might not survive they're illness.  The best part of the job is working with really nice people where we can always find some humor even when the work day is very hectic and stressful. Plus everyday is a learning experience when new patients come in with unknown illnesses that have to be diagnosed.Dana-Farber has introduced me to some of the most impressive people I know. Both the main campus (hospital) and the development office in which I worked were inspiring places to work.• Formulate logic behind inventory analysis to understand current pricing and payment strategies• Identify gaps in inventory and sales management to reduce working capital by $10MM and improve order to cash cycle • Create client-facing workshop slide decks for natural supply chain discussions across the globeWhat can I say?  Working for DFCI was great.  They are very flexible with you especially if you have kids and go to school.  The management is wonderful and super friendly and they never make you feel inferior.  The advancement opportunities and compensation are great!  Great benefits also!  I'm sad I had to leave this place due to moving out of state.  Wish every place was like DFCI.Great first job out of Graduate School. This is not exactly what I would like do be doing with a Clinical Research Management and Regulatory Affairs masters degree. I feel like I could be doing more than just data entry. Really interested in a Regulatory position.I worked as a biostatistician for 8 years, and really learned a lot of statistics. The workload is diverse and you can deal with any type of project ranging from genomics to small mouse experiments to large-scale clinical trials. Statisticians routinely consult on anything from the design of research through publication of manuscripts.The drawback of this job, and what eventually made me leave, was the enormous workload. Meetings with department management to adjust project allocations led nowhere, and 50+ hours per week became expected. Advancement opportunity was very limited and I was only eligible for cost-of-living raises for the rest of my career. As one of my managers commented: ""No one has to work here, and anyone who doesn't like it can just leave.""I thought that the science at DF was amazing, as were some of the clinical investigators that I worked with. The major drawbacks for me were the indifference of my superiors, lack of advancement potential, and enormous work load.",,Boston,Boston,MA,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/e6b18259-6bbe-4f2a-93fc-3ac10ade262d?mescoid=1900240001001&jobPosition=21,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
