145,857.0,Data Scientist,United Technologies Corporation,3.9,352.0,"When we were selling product, there were several challenging projects to work on that made each day a satisfying experience.  Today, this company has extensive business issues with no viable product offerings and no new products on the horizon.   The original workplace culture placed a large emphasis on empowering the employee, but that culture has deteriorated significantly since being acquired by UTC.UTC is a gigantic corporation.  Being so large, there would appear to be ample opportunity for career advancement within and outside of its various business units.  However, there appears to be favoritism at work, especially when considering UTC has grown as large as it has by buying other smaller corporations.  Depending on where you started in the business, your career might be limited if you were a part of one of those acquired business units (see Goodrich).The work environment was good with an emphasis on safety procedures and safe guards on equipment. I learned many manufacturing skills and what it takes to succeed. The plant employees are very friendly and helpful. The management however is not very helpful when it comes to advancement opportunities.I had an exceptional career with United Technologies.  I traveled and had experiences only one could dream of.  I was laid off in December of 2008.  I understand  being a Financial Analyst why they laid off 7,500 salaried employees.  Many had 25+ years.  They could hire younger people pay them have the wage I was making and save the company a considerable amount of money.  It's been a challenge finding suitable employment in this field.  Unfortunately, I understand this happens with many individuals after working at UTC.I worked in the manufacture and technology department building circuit boards and working the AOI machine.  We made circuit boards for a lot of technology systems.The company suffers from severe nepotism and unfortunately hires supervisors who do not really understand the aspects of their area of responsibility. Apparently quality procedures are not mandatory but merely a suggestion to some. Management is overly obsessed with charts and graphs that do not reflect actual workflow. The mindset is severely ""pro production"" and supervision will try to find ways to side step quality processes to meet master schedule.I worked at this facility prior to UTC owning it, it went through many changes started out as Gulton Data Systems, Goodrich acquired it then UTC. Management was constantly changing which I feel did not help the business at all. The business has had no failures for 45 years in space, which I attribute to the actual workers not the management. The environment could be be very stressful but we all worked well under pressure.The most enjoyable part were my coworkers...This was  wonderful company to work for and the job responsibilities were challenging.    I enjoyed all of the projects - senior management conferences, developing and help design in conjunction with an outside contractor floor plans, product displays, exhibitry and graphics within corporate specifications for our trade show booth.Typically day to day I work monitoring and supporting with issues reported by customers, suppliers and customer service. I learned EDIHQ perfectly and JDE. Co-workers helped a lot. The hardest part of job is we got an issue with JDE server side, for that I worked day and night to resolve the issue. Mapping and attending team meeting is the most enjoyable part.Work was 8 hours a day without any overtime potential.Watch out for the bait and switch of the job you agreed to start with responsibilities and  area/work type once you start at the plant. Some direct work employees are great, some had very opinionated of contract employees as dead beats and emphasized it several times.Most enjoyable part was to  correct and complete all the manufacturing process revisions 4 months earlier than what was forecasted. Documented assembly processes that weren't corrected for 4 years.Salary is good.  However, health benefits are THE WORST I've seen.  Borderline illegal.  Management is inefficient and is more focused on multiple international meetings rather than getting anything accomplished.  This is definitely not a place for someone in the Software world.  Be warned.I can't give a good review. I mostly worked in a different building than most of my co-workers. But the time I did spend with them was a very professional experience.I have learned a lot about Excel and PowerPoint as we work extensively on both of them. Though some processes need overhauling.Most employees are extremely unhappy with the culture, but stay due to financial obligations. Management does not keep employees informed on changes in the organization.Excellent introduction into the Aerospace world. Hands on experience on manufacturing of Printed Wired Boards is essential to achieve unsurpassed knowledge in the Aerospace Industry.A typical day for me is to come in, check which machinery or equipment have maintenance checks due. I perform those as a first priority given there are no technical difficulties with the machines on the production lines. When a machine goes down and isn't running that is my first priority is troubleshooting and repair. I order and submit requests for any spare parts that are needed for approval. I also complete side projects assigned to me such as researching equipment models to develop operator PM's or adjusting work spaces to make room for new equipment, etc. The hardest part of my day would be the amount of work that can drop on me all at once. It is only myself and one other technician that covers the shift so if either of us is out and multiple issues come up at once, we can become overwhelmed fairly quickly. For me, the most enjoyable part would have to be all of the nice coworkers and people I have met. Also, I feel accomplished when I repair electronics and get them up and running smoothly.At one time, UTC was a company that encouraged employees to grow opportunities and become more versatile and valuable to the company.  Over the last few years, the company has taken the focus off employee growth and  training. It is a decent place for young people to get a start, but it is not a company to stay with for the long term. Get some experience and get out.Besides what you hear in the news about Carrier and 1500 production positions being off-shored. This is a well established company in the community and is continuing to grow.This is a good company to work for with steady work and great employees to work with.  Like any company it has its ups and downs  but overall I would give it a positive rating for sure.Working as a contractor is a good foot in the door. Although there is minimum opportunity for employment directly through the company, the environment is great and the people are very helpful.Makes good engine nacelles.Management weak.Engineering weak.Co-workers are excellent.I worked on the inner fixed structure.  Engineering tools are Nastran/Patran which is excellent.","10,000+",Boston,Westford,MA,2016-10-17T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/31730755-596b-4412-81d9-94c9c1b2070d?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=24,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
