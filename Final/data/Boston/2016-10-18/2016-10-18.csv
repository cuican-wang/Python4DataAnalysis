178,890.0,Machine Learning Software Engineer/Data Scientist,TripAdvisor,4.0,27.0,"reat benefits - free HMO, on site fitness classes and paid yoga classes. Free in office snacks and drinks, breakfast catered each Friday.his place is run like a frat house - you're either in, or out. Extremely unprofessional management who run the company like a private and inappropriate club.TripAdvisor is a great company with amazing perks and benefits for employees.  People can move up quickly within the organization if they are smart and ambitious.  However, some people get promoted too rapidly up the organization.  They may be great at their jobs but do not have any people management skills.  Overall I think TripAdvisor is a great place to work if you have the right supportive manager.Promises. Promises. Promises.   Promised me everything when I started .  It was great for the first few months!   We moved to a beautiful new building , lot's of perks/benefits... with not so many kind people. Respect level is low. The only employees that are seeing any type of financial gain are senior level management and senior level engineers.   You will  NEVER meet your goals.  They are unobtainable. The yearly review process is ridiculous. No pay raises.   The turnaround is huge.  A revolving door.  HR is useless.  They are so disorganized and uneducated on policies and procedures.  If I needed an answer to a question, no one had it, or they had the wrong answer. Wouldn't pick up phones.  It was quite frustrating. The Vacation rentals president was nasty and rude. As for the free lunches.. attractive but not worth the pain and suffering to work there. They do have a bar on site. These perks do   attract the younger culture.Great company to get experience but there is little opportunity to grow. They have great benefits, great lunch options and snacks. The company is growing and with comes typical growing pains.TripAdvisor is a great place to work. Smart people work there but less arrogance which makes the work environment easy to work in. All of the benefits also makes it worth while, but beware sometimes can be a bit overwhelming in terms on working a lot.The culture is very collaborative. Colleagues are nice and helpful. Working hours are flexible. Hold you job accountable and get jobs done.good sight , my only problem with the sight is when a customer gives a company a bad review they can dispute it and have it removed it does not give a true evaluation of the restaurantIf you are into the culture of fast paced for the sake of fast-paced, then this is the place for you, and if you are an engineer you are in a good place, but unfortunately, the positives of this company do not extend to the administrative positions, where the Human Resources department is hostile, ineffective and joyless, and that extends outward. Benefits and compensation were great, but not worth the bad feeling you leave each day with.I was so entitled to my cubicle. My job was eliminating duplicates which was a job that could excel could do in three minutes.I did not find anything challenging or to prove my skills at all at this job.In general, I agree with one of the prior reviewers, whose ""Cons"" for TripAdvisor read: ""Unfocused and immature management, a highly enefficient [sic] workplace with minimal room for career advancement.""However, I don't agree with everything this person said - there's a lot more to it than that.Let's start with the negatives (bear in mind, this is based on my own experiences as well as those of others - but is not necessarily universal):1- Much of the middle management (including Directors) was promoted from within. This sounds good - why is it bad? Because they are high-performing, type A folks promoted for their individual contributions and tenure, NOT for their managerial skills and potential. This means that a key layer of management is, as the other person put it, ""unfocused and immature."" This leads to micro-management, squabbles, and general dissatisfaction - as well as inefficient hiring practices. Speaking of...2- The hiring process is terrible. Communication - which should be good, since there's a dedicated, internal recruiter between the candidate and the hiring manager - is often slow and tough come by, and there can be long lags in the process for no good reason. The recruiters are hit-or-miss - many are fantastic, but the better they are, the more likely they are to be saddled with far more positions than they should have to handle.3- Part of the hiring issue is that candidates interviewing for individual contributor roles are often interviewing for 2-3 roles at a time - contributor, senior contributor, and even associate (junior) contributor at the  more... same position - without being told. So if someone comes in to interview for a Senior Engineer role, but doesn't have the experience, they could be offered an Engineer position - but they didn't know that was an option until they received the offer. This is ""sand-bagging"" at its worst, and some hiring managers are more guilty of it than others, but the fact that it's allowed at all is unfortunate.4- Career advancement of direct reports doesn't seem to be at all interesting to the middle management layer. There's a general attitude of ""Show me you want to move up, show me you deserve to move up, then convince me WHY you should move up... and I'll consider it"" among the managers and directors, rather than them acting as allies and advocates and helping their team members advance. This could be because the company doesn't want people moving up the ladder too quickly, but it causes good people to leave the company too early if they're at all ambitious. Now for the good (and there's a lot):1- The people (individual contributors) are fantastic. I've never worked with a more intelligent, enjoyable group that loves to solve problems.2- The pay is competitive-plus.3- The benefits are extraordinary. From the fitness/gym/sports reimbursement to the travel benefit to free lunches five days a week in a brand-new, catered facility, it's clear that the company wants to make their employees happy... at least with superficial things.4- Chance to work on exciting products. 5- Equity in a billion-dollar (revenue) company.6- (and this is a huge one) Exciting brand with a great reputation among other companies, especially in the Boston area. If you succeed at Trip, other companies know that you can do the work they ask of you, and will come calling. So 2 years of Trip on your resume will get you plenty of interviews for a one-level bump at a number of other firms.I enjoy working for TripAdvisor, and recommend it to friends. It's not for everyone, and the cons can be dealbreakers for some people, but it's a good place to work with diverse, friendly coworkers, good pay, and a fun overall experience.  lessCompany provides great salary, fun work environment along with health benefits. They focus on keeping you happy by catering lunch 2-3x week snacks, coffee etc. Amazing place to be part of .The best thing about TripAdvisor is the people who work there. Everyone is incredibly smart and always pushing the company forward in new ways. My understanding of the industry grew incredibly during my time there. Surrounding yourself by smart people is always a great benefit. Free lunch everyday isn't bad either, especially if it's restaurant quality! Management has high expectations and people usually start packing up around 5:30.I love writing and photographing the reviews I deliver.  I have focused on Hotel's, restaurants, and things to do.  TripAdvisor is based on individuals who write about their experience that forms a consortium for a particular place.  Being a chef myself, and customer focused, I always will meet the manager, and get a brief story of what I am writing about to personalize it.  This is a passion of mine and am a Top Contributor of TripAdvisor with many badges and followers who read my reviews. I would love to incorporate my experience in the food, hospitality and travel that I have years of experience doing.On the good side, people are quite diverse and interesting, but management is extraordinarily immature and unfocused, with their products reflecting this mood: this is the mega-mammoth of travel services, and it just about sums it up - big, grotesquely uncultured and massively inefficient.Imagine having 10+ years of experience but reporting directly to someone who has half that... and has never shipped a new product before he/she joined the firm. Your days feel empty, scrambled and uneventful, and you are being micromanaged (that's what people do when they perceive you as a threat or when your product management role is downplayed to the level of a technical project manager, whereas your contribution to the product's roadmap is limited to writing technical documentation). Chances of career advancement? Zero to none.Shame on me - I should have known better: when you have shipped roughly 5 times more marketable products than your hiring manager, your career is going nowhere... and sadly, no one cares that the department is managed poorly.Ironically, if you do get hired into an environment like this and are good at what you do, you *will* be perceived as a threat unless you are good at playing dumb. Combine this with the fact that many of their developers are overseas and you will have to collaborate by getting on the phone at 4am or 9pm a couple of times every week, and this will not sit well with you unless you are a workaholic willing to work for a 10+ year old company that iterates products like there is no tomorrow but offers you zero equity in return for your  more... hard work.  That said, I am quite unexcited about working for TripAdvisor or for any of its subsidiaries (e.g., Viator) again in the future, even if my pay is much higher.  lessExciting opportunities working at a fun, lively HQ with ""speed wins"" mentality","1,001 to 5,000",Boston,Needham,MA,2016-10-18T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/0cd64b23-2266-49fa-b5b9-d312117e2bdd?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=22,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

I loved coming to work everyday enjoyed working with management and staff! working independently and  solving any problem that would come up.  I am ready for new and exciting chapter to begin.Great company with many opportunities for advancement.  Excellent benefits and competitive pay along with a great employees make this a great place to land.A typical day at work:  Arrive between 7:30 & 8:00 (my start time.)Phones would already be ringing since we are a Global company.  With the type of insurance we handled it was very confidential in nature and we made sure it was kept that way.  When not on the phone  customers would visit our private work area, or offices for an explanation of coverages.  Particularly the people from Europe since they purchase insurance differently in other countrie.. It was a very busy atmosphere.The company has excellent benefits; sick days, vacation days, flex time, 2 personal days, a gym , walking paths, excellent salary, long term disability coverage.  FMG is a big supporter of the United way.  During the fund raising time, they had various fun activThe most enjoyable part of my job was working with my client base.  That I loved. I also worked with great Account Supervisors who were  very knowledgeable of day to day operations and kept things moving.The best part of my job was interacting with people and providing assistance to those new to the U.S.  I simply loved it.The hardest part of the job me was setting objectives for the year and meeting them.  Also difficult was my initial budget exposure, getting reports  from  Finance and  becoming familiar with all the lines on the report.   What I learned:  Our CEO was the best.   Also, being a multi-cultural company I learned so much from the various people I met regarding their cultures and concerns.  I met people from London, Sweden, Australia, and every office where FMG set up location.There is so much I learned  more... it would be impossible to write it all down.But I always refer people to the Company.  lessIt was really nice working therepeople there are very friendlyI learned a lot while working thereCo-Workers are pretty freindlyI enjoy each and every moment Management is very goodThere was no typical day at workGreat place to work for anyone that's a loner and loves the open roadGreat Pay, Great BenefitsExcessive travel near zero office communityGood place to work if you have a background in Engineering and Insurance.  Very relaxed atmosphere with many, many long term employees.  People have spent their whole careers at FM Global.After coming from a larger insurance company, it's amazing to me how FM Global stays in business. The IS management has no real industry skill, and most of them only have their jobs because they've been here forever, ""Tenure over merit"" should be the company motto.There is no emphasis on career or professional development. While HR puts an emphasis on it, in practice managers just sweep it under the carpet, and ignore fundamentals like goal/objective setting, and skill advancement/training.Aside from incompetent management, and lack of career advancement opportunities, the work life balance is pretty good, and the benefits are adequate.Had I known what I was getting in to, I would have never accepted a position here at FM Global, and I would not recommend the company to any of my friends/colleagues.everyone are very supportive and has a lot of learning experience.Flexible to work.Fun to work with FM Global.The business is also really vast and a lot of free to express thought of natureHard to get to firedUnderstaffed and OverworkedManagement promoted due to tenure and not skillsgossip and backstabbing encouraged. Very political atmosphere.If you are looking to advance this is NOT the place for you.Nice vacation package, great benefits, 401k, health insuranceI worked for this company and was very unhappy with the job, the pay and especially the management - who are very sarcastic and treat the employees like overpaid idiots who can't do anything right! They even make up problems and put you in the middle just to prove their point! You try to defend yourself and that seems to make them even more determined to make you look bad! The pay is low and they didn't even give me a pay raise for the last three years that I worked there! They like to justify it by telling you how much they pay for your benefits. Come On! They treat you like a grade school kid by telling you not to be late because the CEO's window, in the Johnston headquarters, is near the entrance and he can see you! Like he even knows who you are!! SPARE ME! I worked there for ten plus years and had to work for the most agravating supervisor in the world. her name sounds like face. SHE WENT OUT OF HER WAY TO DO AND SAY EVERYTHING BAD ABOUT ME IN ORDER TO GET RID OF ME. I was glad to leave there and look for a better job with a good. That was a Big relief!A nice building to work in, but if you are applying with any experience or education it means nothing. People get moved departments due to years of work and are giving job roles with no experience.Most managers have worked their way through the ranks after years of grafting, and by pleasing the right people. The pay is below average, and they value benefits as dollar signs.If you are happy to work in a building with an average age of 40 + who have worked there for 10 - 20 years then this is the place for you.Finally they have bad management who are lacking social skills and people skills, who show presentations of themselves to their department, it is very cringe worthy.A good experience but at the same time it was comfortable but not exciting work. If you want a place to settle down this is that kind of company but if you want to be in a fast paced environment this is not it.Great benefits, nice work environment and job security.  Limited career opportunities for administrative positions.Working with professionals using cutting edge technology.Learned to support every operating system, infrastructure technologies, and client/ server supportGreat management, employee orientedco-workers are a great group of people both professional and personal.Hardest was keeping up with ever changing technologymost enjoyable is learning the latest technologyThis is a great company to work for in terms of benefits and great people, however those in management positions have worked their way up from the very bottom and although they are extremely knowledgeable in the tasks and skills required to get the job done, they fall short in effective management styles that need to be implemented for the success of a total department. Stable company, good benefits and pay, but absolutely terrible management - most managers are horribly unqualified to be in charge of people and take credit for the work of others. Also, too much nepotism and more lateral than vertical movement.I worked for six account managers doing a variety of jobs. I learned the basics of commercial insurance and always improving on my skills. Management was fair and responsive to ideas and ways to do my job more efficient, Co-workers were supportive and fun to work with. I really did not experience any difficult situations or jobs that I could not complete in a timely manner. I enjoyed going to work everyday and working for FM Global was an excellent experience.Small insurance office.  Headquarters are in Mass so little chance for advancement.  Busy work environment.Love the company, great benefits, great co workers lots to learn here at this company and they have been in business for a very long time.The organization is huge and the practices are excellent and work culture is wonderful.
