4,716.0,"Senior Data Scientist - Twin Cities, MN or Boston, MA",UnitedHealth Group,3.7,4300.0,"Work with a great team and manager. Love working autonomously, but can get lonely. Compensation is ok. Do not make near the median income for the metro area I live in.  Health benefits are not great .The job is virtual/work from home and I have found it a good place to work.  However, since it is work from home, they are strict about you always being at your computer unless you're on a break.I have been working at UHG for some time. The work environment is excellent.  It is a big company and not all departments have the same culture. The salary and benefits leave you wanting.The pay is minimal. The over time is manadatry.The company is very large. Over last 5 years the company has gone to a work at home platform. Very hard to find a manager unless you are being corrected.Would love to work for them again but of course under new management. Loved what I did. Loved all my previous supervisors, team lead and managers.It is an ok place to work.  There is nothing spectacular to say, you log on the computer, you work, you go to lunch, you log back in, you work some more, you log out and go home. You come back the next day and you do the same thing. The end.no cell phones on the floor you have to lock away your purses and cell phones in a locker and you can not use paper at all on the call center floor. it is like you are in jail. however it pays the bills.Answer anywhere from 60-80 inbound calls on a daily basis assisting health care providers for claims, pre-certification, and benefits.Most enjoyable part of my job is learning something new each day.Good culture of people, the training for the position was really bad.  Did not cover anything that we actually do; so not prepared once we got started.  Very punitive in nature regarding these issues.  Employee accumulates ""defects"" for items they were not trained on; they call it a ""coaching opportunity"".Fun eventful work days. They gave free food for lunch of your from any stand in the stadium. great team work. i learned a lot i didn't know about basebal.lDuring my current project, I've met with many employees from many different backgrounds. Everyone I met was great to work with and passionate about the work they do.UHC Oldsmar is all about your call numbers not about its' employees.Management at best is very young with no experience. It's a good old boy network and if they like you your are not written up with below standard numbers or the days you miss don't count toward your attendance. If you like being a robot this JOB is for you.... If you don't kiss a** you will not be in the click!I love the culture within the company,there is room for advancement as well as competitive pay. I have acquired many skills within the company and the continuous innovation.This job was the stepping stone into my bookkeeping background. I worked directly for the accounting supervisor and the CFO.Very positive company, with a great benefit package.I loved my job with this company. I had a great support system and excellent work/family balance. I had a family illness and was able to work through all my crises.Could be a great place too work.  Not a clear focus on the marketplace direction. Hard to accomplish goals with monthly management changes.  good coworkers.  Ability to work from home, which limited the amount of commute time.seems difficult at first but as you start to understand it becomes easier. great place for advancement if you can make it thru the first year.the job itself is a great career, it is a fantastic feeling knowing i made a difference in someones life.  I enjoy helping families in need and doing everything i can to solve their issue.Worked as a Hadoop developer in United Health Group for nearly 2 years as a fulltime employee in offshore Hyderabad, India location. It is indeed a wonderful experience and team is well managed.It was a professional work environment, where they do take the best care of you possible. Individuals were always friendly and welcoming.Great Company! Always working to improve and implement better Service for the Customer. Compassion is very big in this company. Very diverse environment. Everyone knows how to have fun while keeping production the number one priority !","10,000+",Boston,Boston,MA,2016-11-23T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/senior-data-scientist-twin-cities-mn-or-boston-ma-job-boston-ma-us-176649279.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
