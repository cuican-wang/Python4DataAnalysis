107,819.0,Data Scientist,Infor,3.6,62.0,"I interned as a student consultant for Infor while doing my graduate studies. The internship was challenging and was one of the best experiences as a graduate student. As part of the internship, I was fortunate to work with the chief medical information officer.Was contracted for an assignment in the AR department.  At the time, the department was not very organized but the staff are pleasant to work with.At Infor Manila, they try their best to keep their employees from leaving by keeping them engaged and interested while at work. Every month, there are activities that you can join, from sportsfests to hackathons.Depending on which team hires you, it could either be a blessing or a curse. In my case, I was part of a team with twenty members. During my tenure at Infor, people have come and go from the team but all left without burning bridges. My team loved to have fun and is the loudest of all the teams in the department but when it comes to work, we delivered. And I am proud to have been part of that team.specialize in enterprise software ranging from financial systems and resource planning (ERP) to supply chain and customer relationships Work pace changes from day to day, can be fast paced at times. Large company means resources and there are plenty. Opportunity for growth and advancement. Professional atmosphere.The ability to work with teams both from inshore and offshore with a variety of backgrounds and experiences is very rewarding. The companyâ€™s culture is based on  best practice processes thus providing the prefect ground to continue individual learning, improvement and growthThere were both negatives and positives of working at Infor.  I do miss some of my coworkers and enjoyed the work that was involved in the requirements gathering.  I feel that the BAs need to really be development / IT folks.Infor Manufacturing is a purpose-built solution suite that manages the complete manufacturing operation, from financials and scheduling to shop floor management, quality control, and analytics.It is a fun place to work. People are very collaborative here and work/life balance is the key component here for resources retentionNot micro managed, always work to do.  Wide variety of projects to get involved in.  Team effort atmosphere.  Lots of longevity with current employees, so it is hard to get promotions etc.Fun workplace with supportive management. High learning curve and honor to work with some distinguished experience team members.I worked for this company for 3 years.  Averaged 60 hours a week and never received a raise, extra time off or pay for over time.  At the annual Christmas parties we heard how well the company was doing but that never turned into anything for the employees.  Management is very disconnected from the workers.I was very satisfied.working here as a Technical Consultant.  Great benefits and great management.  Drawbacks included over 80% travel and international engagements.Infor has very good products, but management is not in alignment with projects and the PMO office does nothing to support project teams, only look for weaknesses and then does nothing about them when reported to senior managementI worked for Lawson Software that was acquired by Infor.  The 2 companies are night and day.  Lawson was a great company to work for, work and life balance.  Infor is  only interested in achieving results.  You are on 24 X 7Typical day at work includes gathering requirements from the project manager to evaluate scope. We then have meetings with the development and quailty team to dish out the requirements. At times these requirements are very easy, but hard ones are also there. We have a release party every year which is good.Acquisition is their middle name.  Not a people company.  Only true positive was ability to work from home.  Little to no change of advancement.Team building was a big part of my role. Infor was a great company to work at for three years. My colleagues and I made great team membersVery pleased to show up here each day.  Excellent environ, pleasant atmosphere, knowledgeable staff, courtesy abounds, primary aim is to ensure the clientele is satisfied beyond expectations.They had a huge translation department but have decided to not to have in house translators.Fun people to work with, great manager, sorry that they decided to extinguish the translation department.It was also a wonderful experience. That's were I learned everything about localization and translation, that's where I started my career. Have great memories of that place.Corporate environment setting. Not a lot of socializing although after work events are provide every so often. You are at your cube all day and simply focused on completing your tasks.",,Boston,Cambridge,MA,2016-11-03T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/78e5c27d-6410-4d4d-ad0a-26d2214a4895?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

The HR department is good but slow. The location is awesome and free parking in Boston is a rarity!On a typical day as a Lead Administrative Assistant I am responsible for clerical duties for a group of 44 individuals. My group deals with safety of the National Flying Space, which includes taking phone calls for accidents, unsatisfactory conditions reports, safety risk management for all the western area and routing this calls to the appropriate specialist.I review time and attendance to ensure accuracy and compliance with government and state laws.I review travel authorizations and vouchers for all specialist and managers, so that all monetary reimbursements are per FAA travel policies.I review all memorandums and letters, routing for signatures and tracking within our filing system, also keeping with records retention laws.Demanding career with odd hours, compressed schedules and minimal hours between shifts.  This job required 100% performance 100% of the time.This job demanded a ""Type A"" personality, so one typically works with a room full of high level/performing individuals and personalities clashed with regularity.Air Traffic Controllers work in a dynamic environment which is constantly changing from special procedures, weather conditions, congested airspace, and enroute spacing.Working as an air traffic controller was extremely rewarding and exciting.  Learning to do the job was difficult and even after an assumed competency there was much more to add to one's repertoire of skills.  The subtleties necessary to become an effective controller made all the difference.Air Traffic is a wonderful career oppotunity but not for everyone. Stress is high and must be willing to work shift work/weekends and holidays. The benefits are tremendous though and the FAA provides many of career opportunities for advancement.as long as you stay part time at ups you will be just fine but if you flip to full time and they don't like you they will have you fired for sure.  PTO was good and vacation was good and free benefits but no personal life at all.The DOT job environment was satisfactory and professional. The benefits in the DOT motivates the employees to provide the best quality work. The most enjoyable part of my job was working in a all round technical work as part of my rotational assignment.This was one of the best places I have ever worked for. The management was amazing, caring, understanding. The employees who I worked with were wonderful and we were a big happy family. I miss working there so much.The people I worked with were very good people. I have a bit of  humor built in me and I was always kidding them. It seemed to strengthen the bond between workers. Also always helped out where help was needed.The hardest part of the job is the heat in the summer. They pay one of the top pay for bus drivers in Indiana, with benefits available. Co-works are like family.During my time at the Department, I was associated with the completion of roadway surveys through their S.T.A.M.P.P program. I learned a lot through this program including data entry and leadership skills. A typical day was working first shift being responsible with state-issued vehicles and navigating within the four districts we were concerned with to complete drainage, guiderail, and shoulder surveys.The work day passed quickly due to big load work. I am learning how to behave and work as a team with my co-workers. Management is very good, friendly, cooperative. Meantime, I am meeting the company requirements, codes of behavior, etc. I am feeling very good in such good working atmosphere. However, professional grows       is limited, although, I did take and passed all professional exams that are were offered to me. Besides, my salary get is stuck somewhere in the middle of its scale.These folks are fake and have a management style that only benefits the management. Employees are talked about behind their backs and are ridiculed.Good team work. Staple and good Benefits. flexible hours jobs.Paid holidays. Job Promotion opportunity. Flexible hour.Excellent work life balance environment. Management uses a  hands off approach. As a professional they trust you to do your Job well and on time. Once you learn the job it will be less challenging technically.This company have the best on the job training ever.  This company likes to work with their employees and love to see them grow and advance to another level.  This company allow you to advance to a higher level and works with you.  They also provide training and classes that will help you become better at your job or future career.The management team is unprofessional and some of the co-workers are not so friendly and open to new people/employees.A typical day is scheduled pick ups, bus inspection before starting the route. Pre-trip and a post trip, paper work for any incidents. The hardest part is dealing with customers under the influence who may harm other's or themselves,Having worked for the FAA for over 25 years, I have seen it progressively slide downward.  The professionalism that used to be a hallmark of air traffic control is gone.  The integrity of managers and too many employees is gone.  A sense of progress and vision is non-existent.  In conversations with peers around the country, the same refrain is heard again and again:  ATC needs to be contracted out to fix it.  The ATO is rotting from the inside out.  The head of the snake needs to be cut off.The hardest part of an ATC job is working within the management structure.  It's hostile both directions, and many managers refuse to take a stand out of fear of reprisal.  The only enjoyable part of the job is the pay and the benefits.  (Know anywhere besides public ""service"" where you get a pension AND Social Security AND a 401(k)?)Passing the FAA Academy is difficult, but if you can make it through it is a very awarding career. The FAA HR and hiring process was not very efficient or effective. The HR department is difficult to contact and not always the most helpful. Employees themselves were very friendly and helpful, but the training program has a very low pass rate.The bus driver deals with a lot of stressful noise from a bus load of kids on a daily bases. But because the kids don't understand what a privilege it is for them to ride to school on a bus and the parents not making kids understand the important of bus rules. Makes a bus driver day to day job very difficult. Most drivers have high stress level, high blood pressure, and are more likely to have a heart attack than any other job and get paid the worst in any job field I know. The bus driver does not like the pay or the health risk. But we do it for the kids.We know they need us even when they feel they don't appreciate us. We love our children.Hadn't I had a serious of accidents I wouldn't have retired great job great co-worker's,...good benifits. I love the atomomy and versatilty of it.",,Boston,Cambridge,MA,2016-11-03T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/66d81372-4595-4f62-9279-0a21dd9a7e6c?mescoid=1900261001001&jobPosition=29,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
