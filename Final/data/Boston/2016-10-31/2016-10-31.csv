Every piece of equipment in the lab is purchased used and never fits the needs of the company so it's all half-assed. The office area is over crowed and made of pieces of furniture that were bought used so nothing matches! There is inadequate storage space in the lab as well as the office areas. Additionally they have very poor insurance benefits and very limited number of paid holidays.
