146,858.0,Information Systems Senior Analyst Analytics - Data Scientist,"Nissan North America, Inc",3.9,705.0,"Overall a great environment. Friendly and helpful staff. Learned how to work in teams. Good experience for any future jobs I may get. Typical work day would move fastNeed to not have a family. Great income but you will not want to start a family working here. Great for someone who is a bachelor and has alot of time on their hands.This is an awesome place to work. great company.Great people. something new everyday is a rewarding challenge. Awesome MGT team.pay was great for this area.unless you are a full-time employee (not contract) then the benefits are non-existent. no job security. they let me go one day without notice after coming back from vacation. my termination sheet said one reason but the reason to the unemployment office was different. nissan corporate does appreciate their employees, the managers that I worked for only appreciated certain people.Great company to grow and move up in your career.  Employees were great to work with.  Management was fair. The work load was heavy and a lot is put on your plate.My review of Nissan North America is that the company continuously strives to compete with other auto makers to ensure that its customers receive the highest quality vehicles possible.Great place to work no bad reviews. Plenty of hours. Just spend more time there than home. They are a production company so you will be working at a fast pace but always be safe.Typical day here is very easy. i Park cars and greet customers who need their car serviced. From time to time i would give customers shuttle rides to their destination. One of the hardest part of this job for me was saying something silly to the customers while talking lol. Its a very comfortable environment.I work overnight on the truck frame line, and iv'e been there over 2 years. Its a challenge but I am looking to advance and move up to a better position. I have been very appreciative of the opportunity and look forward to playing a bigger role as part of the Nissan community.Very easy to work forSimple work pathsEasy to work with ManagementFamily atmosphereWarranty was hardest part of jobKnowing the Company was growingI usually start my day off around 12:30pm with a 15 minute meeting and then jump into work immediately. In the position I work in, I receive orders, and search for the parts in our warehouse. I have learned through my job, how to process orders and have come to understand the importance of time management. Also, how to properly prioritize my work day.The hardest part of job is just the remedial part of it.The job was pretty descent. It had it pros and it cons. I really think that they need a Union. They are professional but managers will fire people about the points when they had doctors excuse.Nissan provided me with opportunities that I've never experienced in any other work environment. They gave me tools and information to take with me everywhere in life making me overall a better employee.Not to much to say you will have to find out for yourself everybody experience is different. you just might leave without a headache and a car. I hope this info was usefulVery fast paced work environment. Difficult to move upward in management unless part of the Good Ole Boy Nissan club. Upper Management consists lifetime Nissan Employees and are reluctant to promote outsiders regardless of experience or performance. Excellent compensation for Supervisors and Managers. Work/Life balance is non-existent. All work and room/time for family affairs.Do not apply, they rant and rave how the ferman family takes care of their own yet treat their employees like dirt. Nissan expects you to get a rating score minimum of 965 out of 1000 or else you are failing. The surveys are based off the entire process and not just your experience with the guest so any step of the process outside of your control can fail you and potentially put your job in jeopardyManagement is great, but lots of mandatory overtime. Nissan's meaning of mandatory definitely means mandatory. Nissan benefits offer paid sick time off, but they don't expect you to use it.This is the best cilvilan job I ever had. The starting pay is great, and the opportunity to advance within the company is great. during my time there the company thrive and everybody was happy with their job. I really enjoyed the annual bonuses that Nissan provided to all there employees. The bonuses make you really feel appreciated.Great company to work for with excellent benefits 401k and retirement plan. It is very hard to get vacation time due to people having seniority have priority and can take a day at a time killing a week for everyone else.Everyday I went to work I gained knowledge. I learned the difference in ways of assembling a vehicle. The hardest part of my job was trying to make the plant more productive, meaning I might be required to request certain things moved, more hours given to employees, getting rid of unnecessary scrap or defects on the assembly line. I really enjoy the interactions with my fellow co workers.No family life, No  integrity within upper management. Hard to get your vacation time off if more than one other person is off in your zone.  Your family life will suffer from all the overwhelming overtime.","10,000+",Boston,Franklin,MA,2016-10-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/6afa70d0-ed43-44e2-9b4b-48a61fd3bd76?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
