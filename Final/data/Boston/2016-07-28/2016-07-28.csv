664,1376.0,Atmospheric Remote Sensing and Radiative Transfer Scientist,Verisk Analytics,3.6,25.0,"I am an employee of this company and have been for a very long time.  Over the last five years the place has been through a tremendous shake up and as a result are basically going nowhere.   You have the old teams holding the place together and the new teams are essentially run by whoever can use the right buzz words. Lots of empty suits there.Good place to work. Management effort to anticipate needs requires Sr. Mgmt support.   People work hard and are professional although understaffed.Work life at Verisk Analytics is interesting , it has a very good work culture and environment. I have learned many things after joining Verisk Analytics technically,economically and operationally. Hardest part is to get to the place in traffic and i enjoy everyday in the work.Great place to work with exceptional management.  Flexible schedule since you make your own appointments.  Supportive company culture.Since beginning, I was so excited to work in such a good company with a lot of growth opportunity. The first months of being in Verisk spent participating in series of trainings as expected. I was so fresh and inspired to apply my knowledge and learn new things in this new work environment. However, as we moved forward and time past, I started getting less and less passionate and it became more like a dreaming instead of planning. My manager was too busy to have a good conversation and communication.A lot of overlapping and super chaotic. It is not a streamlined organization and far having processes and functionality in place. A lot of cutting corners and the company will not spend to have proper support of teams.it was amazing place to work and it has good work culture and fun loving place.there is alot to learn and my co workers were so supportive.old mentality, cant get buy in to get anything done, yet they expect changes. not good management culture, with below average management skillsLoved working there and hope to do so in the future. The people were fantastic and extremely helpful in laying some ground work for my careerProductive and pleasant company to work for. Each employee brings to the table, something different to offer the company. Management is very supportive and helpful in all aspects. This is a big and growing company, but there's lots of room to thrive as an individual.The management is very nice and they will work with you if any family issues arise. Compensation is good; some positions, too good. There is a large learning curve due to the nature of the business.You are based out of your home and receive orders of companies that have been selected for inspection. The job requires knowledge of the insurance industry which is very extensive. All the regulations, compliance codes, and safety restrictions need to be known. If you miss something in your inspections there could be serious consequences such as monetary losses for the insurance companies or even worse injury or death of people. Management says that they are always available for questions as are other employees, and for the most part this is true. However, many times no one is available to help you and it is up to you to figure it out. This can lead to wasted time to make sure you are following ISO/Verisk rules and the customers rules as well. A typical day with this job depends on if you are in the field performing inspections or at home writing up reports. The field days are the best by far because you see many things that most people will not get to see and meet lots of people. You learn a lot about different industries and how business flows with these companies. The hardest part of the job is getting appointments for inspections. Management says to get all of your inspections into 1 to 2 days, but this difficult to do as these companies are available at the time you give. When you call most people don't want to talk to you because they think you are selling them insurance.If you are a strong self starter, are knowledgeable about the insurance industry, and can handle a very fast paced high stress job you would be fine in this position. There is VERY little chance  more... for promotions and moving up. The benefits are very good and you get a nice 401k and stock options.  lessA good company to work for, just the Compensation could be a lot better. Friendly staff, good training and the location is pretty good.Some reorg recently due to company structure and acquisitions, but company is heading in the right direction. Constant innovation and opportunities to move within the company. Salary could be better.Very high turnover because they hardly promote from within. Tendency for company to hire higher-level analysts rather than promote from within.Very relaxed environment with little to no stress but you get what you don't get paid for.Verisk Analytics was a good place for me to obtain working experience and an understanding of working in the corporate culture.Good employment opportunity.  Worked at ISO/Verisk for 17 years.  Employees are helpful.  Politics are minimal.  A vast selection of technologies to learn/master.  Somewhat flexible hours.Verisk Analytics was an amazing place to intern while I was in college. They taught me valuable skills and lessons that I use everyday in the workplace. The management was extremely welcoming and knowledgable.Verisk has a very good vision within IT and is willing to do what it takes to get to that state.They are willing to give you any job related training you seek.Great company and nice place to work.  The people that you work with really make this place enjoyable.Typical day at work attend meetings,  Delegate tasks to team and assist with outages. Plan for future growth and direction of Datacenter  Operations.  Encourage the team to do better and take on more responsibility.",,Boston,Lexington,MA,2016-07-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/7b6f9847-3594-4ac6-bd7e-e49d692919d9?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=18,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
