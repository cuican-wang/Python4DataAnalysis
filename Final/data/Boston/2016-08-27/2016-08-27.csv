153,865.0,Analytics Data Engineer,The Travelers Companies,3.8,731.0,"Marketing, policy issue/verification, business developmentCoordinated efforts with other business units for productionI trained employees on computer system, handled medical only claims and made decisions whether claim was payable or denied and processed accordingly.  I later handled up to 6 week loss which involved making payments to patient, followed up on reports from doctors care and processed accordingly.  My management staff encouraged us to advance if we proved ourselves.  The hardest part of the job was handling injured patients that wanted more or thought they needed the benefits if their claim was denied.  The most enjoyable part was knowing i accomplished goals set by myself and management team and moving ahead with career.The company is up to date and ok with colored hair, tattoos, body modifications, and self expression to generate a very relaxed culture. Unfortunately, even though certain choices are ok with dress code or the ethics guidelines, there are team members, both front line service and sales and higher ups, that will judge you and formulate a very snarky opinion and not be afraid to show it. Favoritism runs rampant in the Traveler's office, and the work is monotonous. The pay, benefits, and close friends that you get from working there can be worth it.. but its ultimately if you can handle getting paid good money to work in a high school environment.Great company, well diverse group, offer inhouse training and classes, flexible hours, great vacation, good benefits, offer 401lk, job posting available, opportunity, equal treatment, good locationsThe job has good benefits. Company is full of middle management that micro manages and focuses on outcomes that benefit the company rather than individual customers. Steady presence of '2-faced' employees. Toxic corporate culture.Great opportunities for advancement for employees if mobile. Above average compensation with bonus potential. High expectations that are measurable and achievable. Work/Life balance has been a focus in recent years but still needs balance.There is NO Work/ Life Balance. They requirements and expectations are HIGH to ""Meet"" in order to stay a float and or ""Exceed"" in your job you can't have a LIFE outside of work. Although the Benefits are great, Insurance, PTO, etc. The Compensation is minimum is any! A raise is minimum and not something that would be expected every year. There is NO incentives for accounts bound/ issued, Audits exceeding goal, and or business growth at the end of the year. This was not what I was expecting as I came from Mortgage, in that field/ procession there was incentives all the time. It would push everyone to close more accounts, follow up on the customer surveys etc. Management is also ""by the book"" there is no ""Flexibility"" We are all adults working for a ""Living"" dealing with a micromanaging manager for me is defiantly an adjustment for me. I come from a manager and team that knows what needs to be done at the end of every day. If my job is being done, goals are being met or exceeded I don't feel it's necessary to pay for a ""Baby sitter"".You are well trained in your job expectations but there are many requirements you are expected to meet. If you preform well, the compensation is generous, but if your performance is average, so is your compensation. Also, there is a clear separation of powers between upper management and employees which make management intimidating and unapproachable.Understaffed for amount of work that expected. Management does not have a clue and was unresponsive to requests for changes. High amount of turnover in our department.A typical day at work consists of communication between myself and coworkers and managers. I learn everyday that there are creative and innovative solutions to solve problems. I manage a team of appraisers in efforts to coordinate their daily workloads. The hardest part of my job would be outages in the field, however this is where I get to exercise my strategic mind set. The most enjoyable part of job is know that at the end of the day I've helped our customers!You get out what you put in. Work hard, stay away from typical office drama, be present, and be vocal about your ambitions and you will succeed.  Remember, you are there to work and put your best foot forward and it will be noticed. The management is great and always have time to help.  Bonuses are good and not hard to obtain.  You're not micromanaged as you're an adult and capable of adhering to your schedule, plus your bonus is dependent on it. There is a really great family type of atmosphere here and you will become part of the group in no time!typical day at work was going thru your case load, and figuring out which formulas or programs were needed to prove/disprove numbers that people(clients , other areas in Pru) said were not correct.  Lots of computer work.- learned that anything can be figures out and that there is an answe for everything.-Management was great.-Co-workers were always there for each other.  Great Team!-I can not think of any hard part, but being part of that team was the best!Great benefits, decent corporate culture and family first. Flexible with scheduling and communication with management.Travelers is an excellent company for new in the insurance industry and seasoned veterans of the business  The company is global and offers opportunities for its employees to grow and develop within the organization.  Employees are encouraged to move within the company to grow professional and personally.  The work environment is very friendly and collaborative.Everything was ok. Learned a lot but not a career. Employees were helpful when needed help. The management seemed to be fair. It was great knowing I was able to help ppl get back on track with their lives after going catastrophes or accidents.Excellent company to work for.  Promotional opportunities are somewhat limiting.  Excellent work life balance and the culture is fantastic to be working in.Good pay job with benefits but no job security since consistently every year many different department are closing and outsourcingI interned at Travelers and it's a great company. The work culture is really amazing with great focus on work-life balance. Everyone working at Travelers takes great pride in the fact that they work there which I found very inspiring. Plenty of opportunities to grow at the firm and learn from senior leaders.No work life balance. Upper Management is defiantly the boys club. You are forced out if you don't agree with them. 90 hour work week for minimum pay. Coworkers were fantastic. When I had my own personal loss I was told I could not take time off and was put on a performance plan.In reference to working within this department, you can expect to be provided unrealistic output requirements. Being paid on a salary basis, expect to spend your nights and weekends as well as any FTO time working to meet the monthly expectations. And if you do not achieve them, you will be placed on warning. Miss them again, and the verbal warning turns to written and so on until you are terminated. There is no support for newly hired employees in the profession, but who are held to the same guidelines. There has been a large amount of mid-level management turnover as well. They're jumping off like fleas off of a dog.Avoid at all costs.good place to work, good culture, stable company, great people, work life balance also very good. opportunity for progress","10,000+",Boston,Boston,MA,2016-08-27T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/2aff07f7-1f8b-4344-a747-2a0b3eb5363f?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=32,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
