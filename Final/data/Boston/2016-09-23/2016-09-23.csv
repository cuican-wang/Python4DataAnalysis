124,836.0,Sr. Data Scientist,Aetna Inc.,3.8,1800.0,"Aetna is a good company to start out a career in. It is a small, family owned company, however room for advancement is narrow and opportunities do not arise as quickly as one would expect. The typical day to day is a fast moving environment that includes quick problem solving, on the spot customer relations, and high attention to detail. Co-workers are wonderful, and everyone is willing to jump in to lend a helping hand. Management is supportive and always available to work with and talk to when/should a problem or need for help is called upon. The hardest part of the job is time management due to the ever changing day to day responsibilities. I enjoyed the daily grind and electrical side of my duties.I did not check the ""job security"" rating due top the fact that my tenure at Aetna/Coventry was a contractual position through U.S.Tech Solutions, Inc, .a New Jersey based staffing company. Atypical work day revoled around speaking to and contacting customers regarding medicare benefits using the computer to enter information into the data base.  I learned quite a lot regarding health benefits and members need for information.  Management and coworkers were excellent.  There were no real difficult aspects of the position and the most enjoyable part regarding  the position was theteam work atmosphere. Enjoyable work place because different coworkers would bring donuts and coffee and pot luck lunchesBeen here 3 years and my department management is horrible. If your not a favorite of the managers forget about raises and help all together.  Cases are piled on you and then when you fail qa it is all your fault. Complaining to HR is useless.  Mangamemt will throw ypu under the bus to save themselves.  Health benefits are a joke. High deductible and premiums. Only perk is they offer work from homeEnjoyed working at Aetna.   Insurance benefits could have been better but, good enough.  Management was good and enjoyed  working with them.  Some of the mangers were better than others, as with most big companies.  Salaries were raised to meet cost of living expenses, which was great!Very effective with time management to meet various deadlines.  Must communicate effectively with internal and external customers regarding billing, accounts receivable and installation of new customers and revisions of existing customers.  Must daily reconcile payments received for book of business and allocate to various benefits and confirm that the reported information falls within our edit limits. Must be aware of various differences in state legislations and how it applies to benefits.Company will work you to the bone with volume that is completely unmanageable with expectations that you will meet deadlines.  No lunch breaks.  No compensation for overtime worked.  Upper management very slow to approve positions, even though employees are burning out from work stress.Aetna has been a great company to work for. I've had the opportunity to express different departments allowing my knowledge to expand from behind the pharmacy doors to adjudication and transcribing request. My experience expanded beyond the pharmacy area and into medical. Patient management was a different experiences  that I grew to understand and appreciate  the medical field. Leading me to get a degree in Healthcare administration.A typical day at work consists of processing a minimum of 12 medical claims per hour, based on CMS guidelines. Over the past 2 years on this team I have learned a lot about the coding and how to make sure the claim is ok to pay. The management I honestly very good people, the co-workers are very friendly and eager to assist  with any  help that may be needed. The best part of my day is knowing I have did my job and did it correctly.I entered into Aetna Better Health of Ohio with great expectations. My hope was to be with this company until retirement. From the start, I felt that management was very eager to just push me around into different categories and the right hand did not know what the left hand was doing. A LOT OF TURNOVER!!! Providers are constantly told we have your claims, appeal, dispute information, then they call back after 30 days, then they are told, sorry your information is lost, resubmit it again, this is done after 3 times in a row, going on 2 years now. Very unethical company. I am glad I no longer work for them. Benefits were ok, similar to what the members have....I have learned so much working at Aetna.  In essence I group up there.  I learned how to file, to manage, provide great customer service and how to be on a team.The management I have encountered have always been fair, accommodating and helpful with your career choices.My co-workers are like family which is the reason I have been here for 27 years and 15 of them within the same unit.The hardest part  and most challenging part of the job would be the multi-tasking.  A lot of different balls in the air.  This is what makes the job exciting to me.The most enjoyable part of the job is the atmosphere of the workplace the interaction with the clients and the ability to work in a non-micro-managing atmosphere.When I took the position I was excited in the advancement opportunity I was told about, however, as time has gone one, because of department structure and the high turnover rate it is not possible to advance in the company as I expected. I have goals for my career and am not complacent at an entry level position for long term, so that is why I'm looking for other options to pursue my career.**My direct supervisor is amazing, the rest of the management team is so driven by numbers that they take little time to invest in their employees.I worked as a for Aetna/Coventry in Richmond VA. This is the worst place to work. They base performance on how team leads and supervisors like  you. They also choose poor Team Leads to train new hires. If you are not liked you will not be properly trained. `I would not recommend working for this company unless they change Manager Supervisors, Senior Techs base any advancement on who likes you.A great place to work. Great management. Good team mates. Nice enviorment. Great building. Good cafe. Bad system issues. Good place over allAetna is a great company with strong leadership.  There is a strong culture for Work/Life balance and there is always continued education opportunities.  Co-workers are dedicated and great team members.this is a good place to get really experienced in customer service, they teach you dedication, and discipline, and bonus high volume great room for advancementgood compensationgreat trainingPoor management, they don't give raises and they don't promote from within. I've worked for them for 2 years and still haven't got a raise.Good work culture in the Portland office but very poor compensation and benefits. I would not like to work there again. The company expectations do not match the compensation. Experienced several issues with my benefits. Employees can't afford the health insurance the same company provides.Management is terrible at the Southfield,MI location. In adequate training. No room for growth or career advancement. Everyone typically does their own thing. Very unfriendly and unhelpful. A lot of favoritism is shown at this location. The pay is great, but it's a stressful job at times.Aetna was a great place to work.  The management is very supportive . A typical day was talking to the agents about their commissions and computer work to make sure they get it on time.-I learned how much a little extra effort is really appreciated here-The management was really good. Great leaders- Mixed emotions on the coworkers-hardest part of the job was dealing with computer glitches -best part of the job talking to all the agents. They are great..Aetna is a good company. You would go in and know what you would need done and be able to work on your own with a supervisor/manager handy when needing assistance. Management was good to work with schedules and time off. Upper management was always changing and wanting vague information at times. Aetna has acquired many smaller companies and is always trying to convert the staff to their systems.  this is an extra burden to anyone who was bought out and leaves a lot of uncertainty in the direction the companies take.The culture at Aetna seems very member focused and company is views the job as more than just a job. Aetna is very driven in reshaping healthcare and focusing on the needs of its members. I enjoy working here because it also supports employee work/life balance. The employees feel valued and that they are contributing to the company.","10,000+",Boston,Boston,MA,2016-09-23T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/28b2b604-17b4-4bb9-a353-948fb2e14587?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=3,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

Aprendi que tem sem planejamento o trabalho não evolui.Pouco contato com a direção.Uma equipe unida18 cidades para conciliar.Conhecer pessoas que mesmo distante faz parte do seu dia a diaVisita diaria a clientes pré-definidos, todos os dias aprendo ou renovo novos jeitos de contato e negociação com os clientes, os contatos com a direção e gerencia é só em momentos especificos, bastante querido pela supervisão e colegas de equipe, o mais chato no trabalho é só a falta de comprometimento da nossa logistica, o melhor de tudo é no final do dia atingir metas e objetivos.Na profissão de vendedor voce tem que ser o melhor, superar metas desafios e dificuldades, e leva uma grande vantagem fazendo seu próprio salario.Cumprindo sua parte, nao tem dia típico,todos os dias voce aprende algo, gerencia, sorria enquanto colegas e descobre o respeito. A parte dificil, fica agradavel.Como a meta realizada,cateira de cobrança limpa e o bom salario claro.Um dia típico de trabalhoFuncionava da seguinte maneira: visita aos cliente pré-selecionados visando uma avaliação dos itens faltosos que a empresa trabalhava, e em poder dessas informações realizar a cap´tação de vendas dos produtos a ser implantado pela empresa. Feito isto, acompanhar o pós venda: entrega, prestação de serviso dos colaboradores, etc.Fácil adaptação, ajuda quando o funcionário precisa, todos que trabalharam comigo excelentes, a parte mais difícil foi a distancia  e a mais fácil que o produto tem qualidade.
