219,931.0,Sensor Systems Staff Scientist II,Raytheon Corporation,4.0,1300.0,"Challenging Engineering problems all day everyday:  Just the way I like it.  The section that I work in lets engineers do what they are best at.I worked in a reproduction department with 2 shifts. We made blue prints and secret and top secret documentation for the military and DOD (Department Of Defense)Family situation changed and I had to leave the job. Otherwise, Raytheon was an excellent company. The 9/80 schedule makes for an awesome work life balance. Management was great and encouraged training and growth.IIS develops very complex systems.  There is a tremendous amount of domain knowledge within the company.  The main fault with the company is that these large unwieldy programs are being strangulated with an ill fitting agile/scrum management implementation (not to be confused with an actual engineering methodology).Employees were always team players and as such, worked as a team along with management.I management these great teams of employees and honored to have been able to train them to be team players.Excellent leadership. Strong emphasis on training, professionalism, integrity, and safety. Opportunities to promote from within. Excellent company to work for.Career opportunity is abundant. Excellent work life balance. Ideal scenario for professionals. Highly skilled employees. Commitment to individual success is apparent. The people are truly committed.Started as an expeditor, worked my way up to Program Manager. Finished my degree in Computer Science while working here. Eventually wound up in the IT department until I left to pursue working for myself.I train soldiers how to maintain unmanned aircraft. Its a fun job that i look forward to every morning. The people i work with are primarily veterans, so the work environment is exactly what i was hoping for in a job outside the military.Excellent place to work. High tech people and very professional to work with. Great work place and very upbeat. Work doing different tasks everyday and constantly discovering new resolutions.Job was exciting and satisfying; leadership was in Ivory Tower, very bureaucratic and hierarchical at headquarters.Routine/repetition in daily tasks most of the time. Was given the opportunity to be cross trained in a publications department. My former immediate manager valued employee opinions whereas current management doesn't appear to care. Mixed, some were back stabbers to benefit themselves. The hardest part of the job was trying to work past the negatives.This is a very typical defense industry environment.  There is a lot of emphasis on getting the job done well and on time.   Management was very well versed in the defense area and worked very hard to accomplish its mission.The work environment was a bit crowded with tight seating arrangements.Most of the people were nice and friendly.Good place to work. Good benefits and lots of work. Working on state of the art equipment and lots of different programs.I've worked for Raytheon for almost 10 years. Excellent company and benefits. Diversity and respect for others important in companygood place to work but hard to develop and move up due to the union. non stressful environment with good management. benefits and vacation/ sick time were a plus.Excellent orientation program as well as staff management. Vision goals and projects.Senior English Language Training (ELT) Aviation and Development SpecialistThe contract assignment was to function as an English Language Senior Training Aviation and Development Specialist. Basic instruction for ANSF personnel, and to mentor the local national English language instructors. However, the Afghanistan contract was cancelled in the month of December 2013, due to U.S. budget cuts and U.S. military withdraw. My contractual research and developmental studies for Raytheon continued U.S. state side with the development of instructional ELT Aviation English curriculum lessons for AMT professionals.Great technology company. IT is a great functional area in which one can thrive. I highly recommend this employer. It is a stable and highly diverse environment; truly respectful of its people.This company was a very good company to work for. They gave good benefits along with good pay. I was sorry when I got laid off when they laid off 15000 employees nationwide.Raytheon is a great place to work with a great group of employees. The work schedule was flexible and it provided a great work life balance. Unfortunately my contracted ended there but if it didn't I would have stayed for a long timeThe company was great at challenging employees to meet high paced schedule demands to get equipment back to the customer.","10,000+",Boston,Cambridge,MA,2016-11-18T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/854fcd10-a6a3-41e9-9055-223197bcb2de?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=28,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
