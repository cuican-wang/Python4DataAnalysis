10,722.0,"Scientist, Cell Line Development",Sanofi Genzyme,4.1,1400.0,"Fast paced environment with quickly changing priorities. Most employees are friendly an contribute to a comfortable work culture.Management has poor understanding of what goes on.  Workers are treated very poorly and there is a cover up ""mentality"" when it comes to compliance.Great place to work because of the people. The culture has changed over the years but is hopefully on its way back to a positive place.A good french company with lot of esay-to-work employees.As many big companies, it's sometimes difficult to make the project going forward.Very productive and relaxed workplace. Managers held open door policy and interacted with employees. Worked on a team and did individual work as well. Involved standing and sitting for periods of times.Checking emails for urgent matters was the first thing I did every morning. I learned to prioritize and what it means to work as a team.  Working along side management help me to grow professionally and it gave me the confidence that I needed to push myself to levels I did not think I could achieve. The people I worked with not only were my partners at work but we became a family.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the reorganization of the company.  A lot of changes came very quickly and we had to adjust to new faces and new responsibilities.  Our strength was how we all came together and embraced the changes.  The work, changes and obstacles will always be there but when you have a group of people that are willing to work as a team it makes coming to work enjoyable.Sanofi is a solid company with great products. I had a great time working in Sanofi and my learning experience took me to a higher level in the business. My colleagues were awesome people very focus and dedicated to the business. The most enjoyable part of the job was developing people and the dedication that the company have for the benefit of the patients.Fantastic benefits and extremely flexible work/life balance.  Overall great company to work for. Financial forecast process can be painful dealing with French corporate office.This was a great place to work. The people were friendly, caring, and helpful. The pay was a little low but there was a very good balance of family life.Sanofi is a great pharmaceutical company that takes pride in the concern for their employees, in patient care, and development and marketing of cutting-edge drugs. Overall, Sanofi is a great place to work with many benefits and continued educational possibilities.Definitely learned a lot and given the opportunity to implement the acquired skills. If asked, I would definitely refer individuals to this employer. I'm sure they'd appreciate the experienceBeautiful company, safety is extremely important Everyone's experience is differentAt the end of the day you are there to work so just do it and go home.Job was great. Co-workers were awesome. In general contractors were treated as a different class of people and let go based on length of stay rather than performanceUnrealistic expectations. Poor employee morale due to poor leaders. High employee turnover due to poor management. The company owns you due 24/7 365 and runs lean. Too many projects which takes away from running the operation efficiently. HR is no better.Love what the company does for the world. However, it's hard to move ahead at times. Great benefits, and vacation time, etc.-Nice people to work with-Workload is manageable-There is always work to be done-Strict compliance-Promotions are not easily given in many positionsGood challenging work. Ability to work remotely. Always pushing the cutting edge of technology. Nice to work in an environment that is focused on improving the quality of an individual's life.The Sanofi Oncology department in Malvern, PA included a talented group of trial managers, data managers, project managers and senior managers who delivered challenging studies within timelines and budget. The closing of the Malvern,PA facility in June 2011 resulted in the loss of a many great team members and clinical research experts.A work day begins by finding out what lines need to be filled and where you will be placed.  By working at Sanofi i've learned Aseptic techniques, and other processes.The organization as a whole has been quite enjoyable to work for over the years. Too bad the location is closing and moving operations oversees, most likely to France.I was reasonable for building and  sterilizing equipment for the other departments in my building, as well as training other coworkers.",,Boston,Framingham,MA,2016-11-21T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/scientist-cell-line-development-job-framingham-ma-us-176481237.aspx?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Tough training but prepared you for position.  Good company culture.  Enjoyed the people I worked with as well as management.Enjoyed working for this company. They treated their worker fairly and with respected. They made employees feel needed,I loved going to work.  I had the same manager for over 11 years which seems to be unheard of in the industry.  I learned the value of respect - ""catching people doing something right"" - which was one of my manager's sayings.  I also learned when participating in a workshop with co-workers always give the positive feedback then ""what you may which to try next time"" and then end on a positive note.The hardest part about the job was when someone in an office was dismissive before they knew my expertise or even me as a person.The most enjoyable part of the job was the people and knowing when I was helping and was a real resource for their caregiver.Great benefits.  Very generous pay and benefits.  Learned a lot of MS Office products there.  Family feel to the company at times.I worked 8 hours and walked to plant to plant. I learned many task as troubleshooting. There were a very nice organization and good relation with the head-plant. The more hardest were use the safety uniform. The most enjoyable part it was the relation with the others employees.Merck has three major sites in Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.   Boston site is the smallest of the three sites.Productive fan place to work and culturally diverse. Coworkers are helpful and cooperative. When it comes to team projects or cross-functional team projects, members seem to have open minds for different kinds of views and to resolve issues. Team members work hard to meet deadlines.Good company-I was there for a long time.  Many opportunities to grow and develop. I was promoted often. last job in oncology.Fun place to work and always a challenge. Good work culture and good co-workers. Good management. Always improving on production methods, Grate recognition program.Very competitive energetic environment to provide products to HCP's  in very important therapeutic catagories. Co workers most always have the highest level of integrity and passion.An excellent work experience and an excellent Company. In all aspect they offer: training, incentives, excellent products, etc. Unfortunately the Company Plan in which I work will be closing in December and I have to move.This is a wonderful place to work. They have a great work/life balance program and they even offer a shuttle program for a low cost to individuals to ensure they have transportation to and from work.Safe place to work, nice co-worker and a great place to make friends. Don't know about benefits because I was a temporary employee.Merck has great history, surround talent people, advanced techniques, excellent research environment, good benefit; I pretty much enjoy working at Merck.A typical day would be to check all pending correspondence that required follow-up and perform those tasks, move on to new work as needed and keep an eye on needed changes.I have learned the importance of understanding different communication styles.I take full responsibility and bring issues to closure either through my own skills or tapping into more experienced management.My co-workers have always bee over a wide range of diversity.The hardest part of any job is identifying priorities and watch for shifting priorities to address them in a timely manner.I love interaction with people and tending to their needs.Durham VBF, could use more restructuring. Need managers that have experience and people skills. The culture needs to be restructured also. Work-life balance in nonexistent. Pay is not all that good.Very good company. typical day includes making the production of vaccines and cleaning aseptic clean rooms. also dealing with paper work and log books.This company has great benefit packages and good work/life balance and all of the advantages a workplace can have. It was a great working experience and you can learn a lot from upper management.Great Opportunities!
