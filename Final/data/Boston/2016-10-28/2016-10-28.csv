You learn an incredible amount in IT, but it is not without the downside of having to apply that knowledge in time compressed schedules. Most of your coworkers are in the same boat, so there is little offloading of tasks. The most enjoyable part of the position is knowing a project has completed leading to a sense of accomplishment.great culture, great company, doing excellent science.
