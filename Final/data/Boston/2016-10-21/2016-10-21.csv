116,828.0,Data Scientist (Product)- Boston,Spotify,4.6,18.0,"Put up flyers and send out play-list cards. Learned about marketing and social media marketing.The hardest part is to interact with real people and no enough training process.The most enjoyable part is that it is a very flexible job.Great experience for a college student looking to network or get experience in that kind of position. We got students pumped about Spotify and had a blast doing it.Such a great company to work for! The work life balance is phenomenal and there are plenty of perks. Such as free catered lunches, free concerts and company events.I made sure that the guards that were on the shift with me were moving around and making sure no one entered into the work space of spotify.I learned a lotSpotify is very laid back, fun people, free food.Free concerts and other events.There are no hard part to the job. Everyone do what they are suppose to.Managers are very helpful.overall the people are great!Sold Spotify premium packages to different college students.Held different marketing events on Campus. Influencing college students to pay for subscriptions was difficult, but I made it easy by being sociable and making the process fun.I loved temping at spotify, it was the best job I've ever had so far! Unfortunately it was a temporary assignment and I was not able to stay.Spotify was such a wonderful place to work! There was an ongoing sense of community between co-workers and departments, a consistent flow of information keeping us updating on the latest digital trends, and the open opportunity to showcase new ideas to peers that could further the overall advancement of the company.Spotify created many wonderful incentives for the Campus Influencers.  However, the management and organization of the position was not done efficiently.It's a great place with great culture and perks.  Employees all enjoy hanging out together and are all friends outside of work.  Mostly everyone on the ground are open minded about meeting new people and trying new things which creates a great lunch environment.  (People often eat together during lunch time and sit with different people)However because it's managed by leads in a different country, Sweden, it's often times hard to align interests between the different cultures.  Poor managers are allow to remain in senior positions because there hasn't been enough documented cases to see a trend in the poor management.  Communication about changes in the organization from Sweden to the US is often lacking and unclear.Everyone at the company works super hard but that doesn't mean there isn't room to have fun. There was countless video games, ping pong tables, couches, pool tables, snacks and so much more all over the office. I was part of the office management team and we catered to all of the employee needs. It was a wonderful job, and I met some pretty amazing people who do pretty amazing things.Learned a lot about marketing and enhanced my future. Learned to properly utilize mouth-to-mouth marketing. Was an interm basis.One of the Two on campus that organized events sponsored by Spotify","1,001 to 5,000",Boston,Boston,MA,2016-10-21T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/5de869a9-869b-4f6a-8a48-b653794328d4?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
204,916.0,Senior Biostatistician,Premier Research Group,4.0,8.0,"This isn't a great place to work because its management is so clueless.  They have a real problem keeping contracts and that's keeping them from turning a profit.Productive and a nice environment to work,A good number of people will be willing to work in Premier Research because of its diverse nature. People from different countries work together here and do blend together for a common cause.Down times proved to be slow and unproductive but the benefits and pay made up for it. Management and co-workers were great. Would have been a great company and almost got a great advancement but the site I worked at closed down just before promotion.A lot of changes need to be made and at this time seems that they are. At this point we just have to wait and see if the current changes are the right ones.  Hiring at the Senior level makes it difficult to advance into different areas within the company.For the last two years I have been working closely with Pfizer study teams to bring data from external vendors, such as ERT, in house, reconcile the data, and troubleshooting any errors that arise during the process. From this position I have become very familiar with the different types of data collected during a clinical trial, how it is stored in the clinical database, and the complex process that takes place once the data is available. While working on forty plus studies at a time it is important that I am able to multitask and give each study my best work. This position demands the utmost attention to detail, including a strong sense of accountability not only to myself but also to my respective team members. One error on my end or a missed deadline could mean months of work and delays for the rest of the study team. I have found that I strive under this work dynamic and am very proud knowing the work I put in on these studies could lead to something much bigger.Great people who try to compensate for out of dated systems. Fair management with little involvement support. The people who work there make this company and allow it survive despite out of date systems procedures.Great co-workers and manager.  During a study it was very busy and there were many opportunities to learn.  Between studies we had a lot of training and team building exercises.  I enjoyed working with patients and staff.A typical day included Phase 1/Phase 2 studies on NSAID medications, taking vital signs, starting IVs, pain assessments, documentation, knowing and keeping updated on current protocols, basic lab procedures, etc.",,Boston,Quincy,MA,2016-10-21T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/919d7643-6238-4e6e-a693-0bf8b75d3c8e?mescoid=1500153001001&jobPosition=13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
