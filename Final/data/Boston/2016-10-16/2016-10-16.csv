326,1038.0,Semi-Volatiles Analytical Chemist,Alpha Analytical,2.7,12.0,"I was an extraction technician.I learned a lot about GPC repair and operation.Co workers were pleasant.The hardest part of the job, was gutting fish samples and mixing them with methyline chloride for extraction.Careful taking a job here - the problem with this company begins at management. They work everyone like dogs, pay low while management takes big salaries and bonuses. The workforce is pitted against each other and turnover is high.Don't waste your time here - look elsewhere.Great co-workers. under paid and over worked employees. bad company morale. However, they give bonuses and chances to win gift cards every so often. sometimes have mandatory overtime.A lot of turn over in the lab.  no room for advanecment.  long hours and very depending on time restraints.  Owners are very family oriented where management is not.Privately-owned company, 250+ employees, based in Westboro, Mass servicing many states.  Analytical lab providing air, water and soil analysis.When I was first hired I loved my job and the people I worked with.  Bonuses galore and great opportunities. I moved up very quickly and worked well with everyone. As I moved up, roles and responsibilities were increasingly unclear which often could cause problems when resolving issues. Management was different in each area. Some management was phenomenal and would work with you while other managers were unbearable and unmoving. Culture was different in one facility to the next.BAD MANAGEMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!BAD PAY unless you ARE MANAGEMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Owner should be ashamed for letting this company run as it does. Problem is he trusts MANAGEMENT.Problem of this laboratory is MANAGEMENT. Find another job. You'll be wondering why you took this job in a few months. It will be just a waste of your time.This was my first job out of college and was unaware how bad the conditions and treatment of employees. Subsequently I stayed, worked for four years, foolishly thinking that if you work had you will get reworded for it. Don’t be fooled, don’t work here unless you have to. They under pay and overwork employees. Also guilt or hold your job over your head to increase your work output. Please for anyone that reads this do yourself a favor and work anywhere else. Laboratory conditions are bad for your health management does not care how hard or effectively you work. Good luck to you if you work here and good luck trying to leave once your there. A nickname we used as inmates / employees was Alphatraz.The work and the culture of the company are quite rewarding personally and professionally. The lack of compensation in salary is what makes this company not a great one.  They seem not to mind a high turnover rate from employees.  The are a stepping stone for recent college graduates who eventually move on to better paying companies.most people are great, but be prepared to long hours.  Typical small company problems, but also the benefitssame as previously stated/reviewed. Intelligent and extremely dedicated co-workers who I thoroughly enjoyed working with and being around on a day to day basis.Despite being a company that deals with a 24 hour turn around time the atmosphere is upbeat.",,Boston,Mansfield,MA,2016-10-16T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/57d3defa-2bff-468d-9fd9-9c42349c187f?mescoid=1900259001001&jobPosition=30,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
