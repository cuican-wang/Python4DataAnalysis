45,5069.0,"Staff Environmental Geologist (Houston, TX)",ERM,3.1,30.0,"ERM is a great place to work if you are a technical person (i.e, consultant, geologist, etc) - if you are in an administrative role there is virtually no opportunity for advancement.  Co-workers are absolutely the best.This was a nice company to work for, but the management has made decisions that have been driving good employees away in droves. After a few rounds of knee jerk layoffs of some of their best employees, other employees are getting out at an astonishing rate. Your work life will be about nothing other than maintaining the highest billability possible so the company can meet unrealistic profit expectations. While trying to find your own work to maintain that elusive billable goal, your rates will be inflated so project managers will cut your hours while still expecting you to do the same amount of work...thus lowering your billability through no fault of your own.  Sick days will also lower your billability, as will the umpteen pointless meetings they will make you attend every week.  Unless you are a field person, don't expect to meet your billability goals with our working at least 50 hours a week.  Also expect to work late into the night and over the weekends on projects for senior people who waited until the last minute to meet a deadline. Your personal life means nothing to them...also, they ate up all the budget for themselves so you can't bill all your time to the project.I used to work for this company. This is the WORST company to work for, the management is two face, they tell you all the great things FALSELY FABRICATED which will in a few months turn out to be a bunch of lies. There is NO JOB SECURITY, they will hire you for a specific project or role and once the project ends they will make up an excuse and fire you on the spot. The management has too many politics and issues among themselves. I WILL NEVER WORK FOR ERM AGAIN AND WILL NEVER RECOMMEND ANYONE TO WORK HERE.Field work was fun and challenging.  The work provided me with good experience and I was able to learn from qualified people.Leadership is nonexistent. Some departments desperately need a management change.Partners seem to promote people who are incompetent and arrogant. Most PM's are not very knowledgable in the their field of 'expertise' and play the blame game when review time comes around. Limited chance for advancement with current management. The only performance metrics that ERM seem to care about is sales targets, face to face meetings, and billing percentage. Those are hard to achieve if you are not writing proposals and denied direct contact with clients. Forget about proper training and mentoring. These important development activities are essentially nonexistent and when you can help, it's unappreciated.Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them.Laid off due to cut backs, I did full cycle Accounts Payable. Three check runs per week, coding invoices, as well as entering them.Personable, deadline-driven and self-starter Office Administrator/Executive Assistant experienced in working in a fast-paced environment.  Solid team player who offers a positive and cooperative attitude.For the most part, I enjoy working at ERM, however, I would like to pursue a career in my field of study. At this facility, being in the admin position, I am not granted the opportunity to advance into the field that I would like. Job advancement is there for those who have degrees in this line of work. My bachelors is in Psychology and I am pursuing my masters in Legal Studies. My coworkers are the sweetest and most lovely bunch of individuals I have ever met. From the first day I started, they have all been equally nice, helping, and full of support. The hardest part of my job is watching everyone around me work in their career while I am working a job and waiting on my opportunity to advance into my career. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I am in a very friendly environment and I love the people that I work with. I have learned ample skills that will help me in future endeavors.Great co-workers caught in a changing culture resulting in a very high turn over rate.The company is a very good one to work for.  The Information Solutions groups is basically a separate company from the Environmental Consulting side, which is unfortunate. There seems to be a lot less internal competition and insecurity in the Environmental side.  A lot of opportunity if you have SAP experience.A the location I worked, the company seems to tolerate if not condone less than professional work - doing more to curry to clients than to meet regulatory obligations or professional ethics. Disjointed managment, lack of cohensive values. The company has a reputation of hiring then firing personnel once they are done with them. Cyclical nature of consulting does not help either.I worked at ERM for 7 years,  I gained great experience during my time there.  I was able to develop my technical and problem solving skills in the field and reporting.   My co-workers were always enthusiastic to perform the work and ready to get their hands dirty.A very high-pressure project (ALCOA Chatham/Cap-de-Ville ESIA) executed with personable superiors and great work team.",,Houston,Houston,TX,2016-11-17T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/7335bbff-3536-427c-81cd-4f6c14fb57b3?mescoid=1900265001001&jobPosition=13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
66,5090.0,"Staff Environmental Geologist (Houston, TX)","ERM Group, Inc.",3.4,53.0,"Partner oriented organization with a strong emphasis on billable hours, certifications and advancement. Very challenging and interesting work requiring a lot of international travel.This job was never meant to be a salaried position.  Work weeks would range from 40 hours a week to 90 hours a week, all while getting paid the same weekly rate.  The travel ranged from 50% to 80% based on the month.Working hard and doing the right thing isn't enough, you have to be willing to play the game.  Do not underestimate the power of politics.The management tries to addresss the low morale however, actions and words don't match.good experience. some work very interesting, other work not as interesting. no additional comments at this time. the experience likely outweighed the negativesMany projects with interesting work.  Opportunities abound with work. If you like to work and have no life outside of work, this is the place for you.  There was a tremendous variety of projects to work on.  Colleagues were there to help and share techniques to complete high quality jobs.  The hardest part of the job was working for a poor manager whose reputation was well known as someone who would make your life difficult if not miserable.  The best part of the job was when I was released from the position and no longer had to deal with the individual in question.Overall a fine place to work if you are a robot, lacking feelings and desire to do anything but work.  Additionally, since annual growth targets were unrealistic, firings and layoffs have become the norm.  Expect no understanding, mercy, or pity from this bunch of wolves.Tetra Tech was a great company to work for.  Work life balance was great.  Compensation was good and benefits as well.  Definitely miss the people and environment.  Always looked forward to going to the office.ERM was a great company to work for.  The people and overall culture was positive and a great atmosphere.  Great benefits and a great work life balance.The work day id between 8 am and 5 pm. One knows exactly what and how to do the work assigned. little room for creativity. Can be monotonous.The company has a set way of doing things and there is not verring from that.The hardest part is meeting the expectation of the different project managers.Used to be a fun place until Obama's war on coal. Smart workers but hard climate to work in. Co-workers are fun to work with.I really didn't enjoy my time at this company. The employees made me a little uncomfortable. There employees weren't too friendlyThis is a company that is trying to transition from a mid-sized company into a large one.  They really don't care much about anything other than what the spreadsheets say.  To that end, they have zero interest in employee development.  There is zero training and zero opportunities for advancement.  They hire outside the company for very nearly every position and don't even tell us they're looking for positions senior to our current level.  While I was there, they assigned EVERYBODY an ""employee level"" that basically just puts you in a specific box.  It's nearly impossible to climb out of that box and advance.I was there nearly 10 years and found that as time went on, they were doing everything possible to get rid of the long term employees and replace us with cheaper, disposable people who would stay for a couple years and then move on.""Leadership"" if you want to call it that, came from England.  They wanted no input from us colonists whatsoever and if we offered any, we were silenced almost immediately.Great company to work for and provides out of the box thinking to handle any size project. Use all the current up to date computer programs to maximize the design and turn around time to satisfy any client.ERM will remain the worst company I have worked for during my 20 years in the work force. I joined in 2007 and realized within a month that the office I belonged to had some serious issues. It was back in the ""Opco"" days when one ERM office would actually compete against another ERM office for profits and sometimes ignore common sense when delivering services to a client.Aside from the competitive nature of sales and MY client attitude, I joined a team who's leader told me ""you are in a different Opco"", I cannot help you..."". Needless to say, I did not speak to him ever after unless required to. in 2008-2009, ERM, globally, decided to ""address"" this counter productive issue and ""deployed"" a new strategy around ""collaboration""... Wow! What a giant step forward in recognizing this rotten environment! I thought the company would turn this around and work on getting new blood with a different mentality to offset the bad vibes often encountered within the office. It did not happen, 5 years later... Ended in the ""me, myself and I"" mode for over 7 years... As for the ""strategy"", ERM put all its eggs in the Oil and Gas and mining basket (recruiting, etc.). Fast forward to 2014/ 15, such markets have stalled and ERM is now leaking its wounds and looking at growth elsewhere... Maybe a diversified sector growth portfolio would have been wiser? Bottom line, stay away : poor strategy, poor leadership, poor knowledge sharing/ management, rotten work environment...Very typical corporate environment. Globally minded, empowering a revolving door of post graduate, energetic, youth. If travelling lifestyle is desirable to you, this is a great place to work.Very laid back friendly company to be a part of. There are many opportunities to volunteer on environmental projects as well as opportunities to interact with other employees out of the office.Fun workplace environment with great people, but the work was not as sustainability focused as I initially had hoped. Also, poor management and little to no mentorship. Easy to get ""pigeon-holed"" into work.It was a pleasure going to work everyday as my coworkers became good friends.  I developed a good relationship with my clients and even though the job was hard, I loved it because I like to be busy all the time. The hardest part of the job was working crazy hours during the end of the month closing.  The most enjoyable part was making new friends that until today we communicate.No good things to say about the Atlanta office with the exception of the presence of a hard working crew of staff scientistsLack of diversityUnethical practicesLow moraleDemoralizing business practices (requires billability exceeding 100%)Several of the best staff left due to poor people managementHuman resources lead at Atlanta office lacked integrityThey were understanding when things could not get done and they never expected too much from you. Great company, very humane.I would get in at 8 and be done no later than 5:30 (with an hour commute on each end).  I learned that ERM talks a good family game but refuses to consider that 5 day in the office meant 50+ hour work weeks.  Profit is the only motivator, and training was something that would be sacrificed for the almighty dollar.   The majority of the people that I worked with were dedicated professionals committed to their work.One caution:  if you thought that your experience and talents would provide you with an office or at least a cubicle, you are wrong.  ERM believes in an alienating model of open workspaces where there is no privacy or the ability to relax at your workstation, because you are in a situation to be surveilled at your workstation.  I have spoken to people leaving and turning down positions with ERM and that has been one of the largest issues working with this company.Some very nice people and the my coworkers are fantastic.  Chance for promotion and career development somewhat limited.",,Houston,Houston,TX,2016-11-17T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/ff3a16b5-a1f6-4165-a20e-1c82609b254f?mescoid=1900265001001&jobPosition=34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
