40,5064.0,GIS Technician I - No Longer Accepting Applications - Posted Until Filled,City of Missouri City,4.5,4.0,"I enjoyed working with the government people here. They always appreciated the outcome of work. Got to communicate with different departments and understand the functioning of city to update the city website.The City of Missouri City is a wonderful place to begin a career, however the is not enough revenue to pay for more experienced employees, and their is little room for advancement or additional compensation. Many employees perform multiple job positions which decreases their effectiveness. Some of the upper management personnel seem disinterested in the work being implement by ground level employees and as such are not as aware of the actual work being performed or why the work is being performed. The hardest part of the job is knowing the budgetary situation and its impacts on compensation and career advancement which has a devastating affect on employee morale.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction I receive when a new residential or commercial development project I have been project manager for is completed and the customer(s) and all internal and external stakeholders are satisfied with the results.  I also enjoyed working with the elected and appointed city officials.•Conducts normal and preventative maintenance, installation, inspection and repair to the City's traffic signal systems to ensure proper operations at all times.•Responds promptly to all call-outs, including after hours and holidays; troubleshoots, diagnose, and/or take corrective action to restore the City's traffic signal systems to full and optimal operation.•Requisitions and installs parts to repair the City's traffic signal system.•Evaluates signal timing, adjusts signal timing, and makes recommendations for signal timing changes.•Performs recordkeeping activities pertaining to traffic signal timing plans, inventories, maintenance activities, and construction plan sheets.•Develops schedules and coordinates preventative maintenance activities to ensure proper and efficient operations of the City's traffic signal systems.•Coordinates all activities relating to traffic signal intersection pavement markings and signing.•May direct activities of Signal Technician I.•Performs other related duties as assigned.•Subject to 24-hour recall..I really enjoyed working for the city.
