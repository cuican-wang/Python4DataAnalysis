29,5053.0,Scientist I,PROS,3.8,16.0,"worked with a very good teamThe environment was easy to understandthe culture was amazingthe management was greatprojects were really not managed wellI enjoy each an every day I came to workI worked as an idependent contract employee.  i was able to set my own hours and schedule.Management was very supportive of my projects - help was there when I asked for it.Very small staff - always able to communicate together.The client was not as supportive as the team was.Great place to learn all aspects of backhouse to corporate relationsGreat place to learn all lab skills/quality skillsGreat bosses plenty room for advancementMany knowledge opportunitiesIt Is A Great Place To Work I Do My Service Work Here And Cant Wait To Start Working Here More In The Future It Will Be Cool To Help Out More People Just Like MeWork here if you like being underpaid and unappreciated. They do not take care of their employees. This company is a joke.PROS Software Company was good to me for my whole entire senior year when I was in high school. I was an intern there and I learned a lot about the IT and the Office Services part of PROS. Everyone is really friendly there and the company is very laid back and fun. I loved my experience there and wish I can do it all over again.I currently work for this company it is a good place to work, but oil field work is slow so theres limited hours and limited pay at this timethe job is great despise all of the micro management good company over all, the company has great safety really caring owner.No work/life balanceFast employees turn aroundHire inexperience employees for cheap salaryTry to catch up with technology with no expertise to implement or manage the technologyOur boss was very helpful and cares about his employees and team members. He usually doesn't pressure anyone to finish a job too early, and always encourages us to take our time to make sure we do it right the first time. Tries get to know everyone personally, but never discriminates anyone. Everyday I could expect something different on the job, such as new faces, and different situations. It was a job that was very difficult at first, but everyone there was more than willing to help educate and share their knowledge and experience.PROS has many good aspects to it. You have contact with a wide range of people and have an opportunity to impact positively on their lives.Very intelligent population of employees; great culture and employees sincerely care about one another.  Executive leadership needs to be more strategic.  Most executives have only worked for PROS, so they don't offer a broad viewpoint.  Lack of processes makes accomplishing tasks challenging.  Senior leadership takes too long to make a decision.This is a good company full of very smart people.  The professional services departments is a sink or swim department.  If you ask for help you will get it, but you have to be willing to do the work.  If you are then you can be very successful, If not then no one will be there asking you how to help, or holding your hand.  You are responsible for your own success at this organization, and will be rewarded for it.Great Place to work but the distance was to far to travel. Hours were very long and I was salary.we get the labor done anything our customer wants we get done fast and easy, you have to pay attention to what your partner is done so y'all done try to do the same thing. if u need help always ask.",,Houston,Houston,TX,2016-10-14T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/f77aade6-7085-418a-9111-93859d22cb9d?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=23,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
