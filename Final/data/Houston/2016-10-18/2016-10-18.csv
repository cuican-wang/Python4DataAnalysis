48,5072.0,Reporting and Analytics Developer,Apache,4.2,40.0,"If everyday is the same then we are doing our jobs right.  Very knowledgeable co-workers along with a safety orientated work environment....................A Decent Company with manageable work. Poor planing/workflow causing major overtime as materials get lost/misordered. Problems stem from under staffing for periods of over a year but the company pushing overgrowth despite lack of personel. The company prides itself on its employee owners and for the most part everyone is treated well and with respect.My beginning at this job was not at all unpleasant.  I learned a lot about logistics and the overall process of shipping and receiving.  The only downside to working here was the hiring of a few hard drug users that would conduct drug deals in the parking lot during company time.  Concerns about this were repeatedly ignored.I like the half day work on Fridays. Friendly colleagues. I get to work closely with application/ DB team folks and learn a lot.Immediate management and staff are demanding and supportive of IT staff - learned much about the inner workings of ONG corporations and had a tremendous IT staff that are extremely knowledgeable and  work well as a team. I've enjoyed the camaraderie and pacing despite being a small team.An excellent company to work for. Great benefits package and pay structure. This company is heavily tied to the oil and gas market. As such its activity level is based on oil prices. Some of the best people I have ever worked with.Excellent place to work, good compensation, Typical day included troubleshooting day to day issues while working on long term projects. Management is fair and coworker is fun to work with.I have had the opportunity to work with some of the most interesting people in the work force.  Room for advancment was limited and the selection process is unfair.All the people that I worked with was very professional and a pleasure to work with. There was never a time that if I had any questions about anything or needed help that I was not able to just call. All the management in the Midland office are very enjoyable to work for. I look forward to being able to work with them and Apache again.a little one dimensional as far as duties go. some people are nice, but a lot tend to come off as snobby. I have not learned anything new in the 10 months I have been here. the best part of job is the building itself, very nice, and the schedule is good because you leave early on Fridays.A typical day is busy, work is steady even in the downturn. Training could be improved on. There is no official training program and documentation is space, outdated or incomplete. Coworkers are great, cafe and benefits are great.I loved working for Apache, I hated that they closed the Tulsa office. Employees were friendly, the work environment was comfortable. Apache offered flex time, They supported volunteering for Meals on Wheels once a week.I enjoyed working for Apache. They gave me maximum exposure to both field and office experience. Typical day in the office involves constant production analyses of my fields. Identification of low performing wells and writing AFEs to stimulate them.It started off a very good environment but it got out of hand with no real leadership. I dislike not having organization in a work place.Well I was contracted by Apache through Genesys Works and when I began I was shy since it was my first day at work. But I made friends quickly and when i needed help with any problems on pipelines I would ask my coworker for some help. The employees at Apache are really nice I enjoyed my time there and it was a fun experience.The jail was getting too crowded and we did not have the available work force to keep everyone safe. Management did not care and neglected to do anything about it, and due to my disagreement with the way things were being run, I resigned from Detention CorporalApache was a good company while it lasted. Great benefits and a lot of good people there. Just like everyone else got caught up in the reduction.Apache is a great organization to work for and a great group of people to learn from.  The leadership is excellent and are willing to assist you when needed.A good typical day at work is wen it is not raining.the new thing that i learn wuzz how to bristle blast.The management wuzz very good.All of the co-workers were good people the work with they teach you different things.the most enjoyable part of the job is wen we get to go home to our families.- Typical day at work involves resolving trouble tickets, taking phone calls, building and configuring computers and IT equipment, troubleshooting, working with peers and other departments to resolve issues- I gained a large breadth of knowledge working with Dell, Apple, and HP products, from small mobile devices all the way to high end geophysicist workstations. I also got to work with video teleconference design and implementation department for enterprise solutions- The IT dept. is small in the regional office, so less management overhead as a corporation makes it exceptional to get things done- A small team of multi-talented co-workers makes it a great place to work and learn from each other's areas of expertise in IT- Hardest part of the job is keeping up with technology in a growing corporation in the oil field, and traveling to support multiple field offices.- Most enjoyable part of the job is working with a great team, getting hands on everything IT based, and helping our clients with any IT issuesPlanned wells, confirm targets, reviewed drilling hazards, integrated geology, geophysics, drilling, production teams to plan and improve production.  This was the hardest part of the job as well as the most rewarding.","5,001 to 10,000",Houston,Houston,TX,2016-10-18T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/680b52e6-9bdc-4fa2-ba67-0f1da183773b?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

76,5100.0,Reporting and Analytics Developer,Apache Corp,3.8,95.0,"I am very thankful to have had the opportunity to be a part of this corporation. I was a paid intern and I was very well treated by both co-workers and supervisors. Since I was an intern, I did have to do some of the heavy lifting, but I was more than happy to help as much as I could.I loved everything about my job with Apache! I would not have gotten this job if it were't for my dad knowing the main boss. Learned a lot about how the oilfield works.I gained very valuable and necessary knowledge as a new land professional. I was eager to come to work and apply myself in anyway that I could; eager to help or work for any division. The management was incredible and wanted to see each employee excel in their professional careers.Easy work daysHeavy Data EntryEasy TrainingGreat Upper ManagementGreat LocationGreat Job OpportunitiesCreated oil spreadsheets to help back up data systemGreat day bonus not enough training time, but they keep their family members employed and will let go of outsiders. Great pay, but not worth the amount of time you spend away from homeWork 40 hours a week assisting both remote sites and corporate headquarters with managing their records.Learned how to manage databases, manage records and design computing systems.Commuting to work.Being allowed to contribute in the determination of a technical solution to complex data issues.It was good while it lasted. Apache had great benefits and good people. Just like everyone else right now, reductions are going on.I loved working for Apache Corporation, they offered competitive salary with even better benefits! They offer flexible work schedule working 9 hour days Monday - Thursday and 4 hours on Friday, no weekends with very little overtime and traveling. I hate that Apache closed their Tulsa office.They made you feel like it was a family, everyone was important to the end game.  No matter if you were bottom or top the company gave the impression of carringApache Oil and Gas is an excellent company that appreciates a contrarian spirit and hardworking employees.  The employees are a wide range of ages with excellent communication and teamwork skills.Hold Meeting with the crews to inform them of activities the night crew was doing.  Learned how to lead crews with a positive attitude.Management backed me with the decisions I made.  Learning to lead a crew without having to yell and scream.  Teaching people the right way to perform a job task.Allowed me to grow my career in the oil and gas industry, put a lot of trust in my skills and sent me to training as needed. Very good place to workIn my first 18 months I had 6 different managers to which I had to report. They constantly pushed for more work while handing out minimal compensation.Was only there short time but all in all very good place and environment to work. I was transferred before I got started. Others I know love it.Tulsa office was closed after being an active and viable part of the community for 60 years.  I worked for Apache Corporation for 32 plus years and loved my tenure there.  The workplace was like an extended family, including employees, and vendors we dealt with.  The office closure was like a death.They are very friendly to their employees and the contractors who support them. The management team is laid back. Nothing else to add about them, please ask if you want more information.90% of the co-workers are easy to get along with and communicate to.  The hardest part of the job was to get the operators to send you monthly or even daily platform reports.  over all a good company to work for.Great people and good atmosphere to be around. Each job presents its own challenge. Get to work along beside some great folks who have great knowledge in what they do. I get to share what I know with them while training them on how to troubleshoot problems with controls for water systems and teach them what to look for when problems arise.overall a great place to work,compensation and benefits are awesome. work environment varies by office but overall is pretty positiveI was a contractor while at Mariner.  Apache hired me as a full time employee and provided me many opportunities for advancement.My day usually started with a safety meeting. Afterwards i would walk around the refinery and make sure all JSA's were filled out and signed by every employee. The hardest part of my day was firing people for working unsafe and dealing with unexpected injuries.","1,001 to 5,000",Houston,Houston,TX,2016-10-18T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/587a2ac4-aa0e-4242-b846-a2cc9e50b3fd?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
