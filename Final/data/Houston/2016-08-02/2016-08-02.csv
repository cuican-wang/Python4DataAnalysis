36,5060.0,Geophysicist - Houston,Range Resources,4.2,23.0,"Loved the job and the people.  Laid off due to the gas market downturn.  Flexible hours and some times work from home.  Paid dues for associations.  Lunches provided during bad weather.  Security provided .Some management needs to be replaced, most people were good to work for, salary was good, overall good company to work for.Bad Upper Management, Working in the gas field is good. For the most part you get to be your on boss and there is no hectic schedule.Range is a great place to work.  Industry is hard right now.  Lots of opportunities to excel.  Management is great.  Pay and advancement are ky components.Very friendly work environment where team work is essential to success. Bid's were done months in advance of new year. Hardest part of job was getting everyone to buy in to change.Had the pleasure of doing different jobs within the company that was productive under lacked supervision. Had the respect of upper management.Range Resources is a promising company in a country that does not yet have the necessary infrastructure for it to thrive. Overall, Range Resources provides its employees with good wages and rewarding work. Unfortunately, the supply of natural gas currently exceeds the demand for it, and the company's profits have plummeted, causing excessive downsizing.Range Resources is a great company. The Oklahoma City office had amazing people that truly cared about your success. They had great opportunity for advancement.Before the home office opened had to travel to Kittanning for one month for training.  Typically when I applied for the job it was for the Executive Assistant but that position got filled so they offered me the Drilling Assistant Job and I accepted.Contracted work through them from my broker at the time. Its your typical suit and tie place, with strict rules and not a friendly environment.Range Resources is a top notch company to work for which offered their employees a lot of incentives, benefits and advancement opportunities within the company.  Due to budget cutting many positions were severed - which was mine.Range was a wonderful place to work.  The company is excellent, with great leadership at the helm.  The people were exceptional, and we were well supported by our management.I enjoyed my 3 years with Range Resources.  Excellent people.  All the co-workers were good to work with.  The office was always helpful in any situation.My time at this company was very enjoyable. I appreciated working with a lot of very smart people who were willing to share information and teach others. I learned a lot more about Prizm and Zone Manager than I knew before. The work atmosphere was very pleasant and everyone showed respect for each other. Management had an open-door policy and you didn't have to hesitate to approach your manager with any concern.A typical workday for me at Range Resources involved creating and updating reporting programs for the accounting and operations departments. In addition to this I updated technical documentation for any reports that were worked on. I learned how to prioritize tasks and that productivity and output are far more important than perfection. My coworkers were hard workers who collaborated well on various projects. Each of my coworkers had a wealth of knowledge in their respective expertises and I enjoyed picking their brains. I was in charge of reporting, one coworker was in charge of developing the database for our BI system, another coworker was the on-site AS/400 developer, and there were three analysts who served as the go-between for the developers and the end-users. Management had a tremendous amount of experience in the oil and gas industry and were a valuable resource for various assignments I worked on. I reported to one manager who oversaw the three developers and he reported to the manager who was in charge of IT-support (which had 8 employees). The hardest part of my job was managing end-user expectations. The most enjoyable part of my job was struggling to keep up with end-user requests when I was the only report developer.Same as last review for EOG Resources. Maintain and grow production!Management is severely out-of-touch with staff and it shows in every possible way! Extreme lack of communication inhibits career growth and development!Range Resources is a good company. Management was very easy to get along with. I had flexible work hours. I had the opportunity learn a lot about the gas and oil industry.It was very enjoyable working at BP, and the people were great.Well defined process' and proceedures. Workers help each other and are team oriented.I learned a lot while working here and worked with some great people. The work schedule was nice with every other Friday off with the 9/80 schedule.",,Houston,Houston,TX,2016-08-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/ece0d8db-23d2-409e-ae60-4b961aab2916?mescoid=1900265001001&jobPosition=4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
