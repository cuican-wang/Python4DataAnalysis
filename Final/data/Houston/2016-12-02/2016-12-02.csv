13,5037.0,IRC21750 Data Scientist,"Noble Energy, INC.",4.1,86.0,"Great place, incredible people. It is a true school for anything related to business. Came in as a new employee, learned and left there as a veteran in oil and gas.There are two distinct classes - contractors and employees. It seems that who you know gets you more job recognition and opportunity than what you know. Social connections count more than job skills and experience do, so if you're on the ""inside"" and fit in with the social culture, you'll do ok. If you don't, you'll be discounted, no matter what you do. Hiring and promotions that I saw were based on social connections instead of quality of the person's work. It may be different in other departments, but that was my experience working there.Overall the company is a pleasure to work for. Great company culture and transparent management.Working in the oil and gas industry at this point leads to less stability in the work environment, but if you can make it through to a rebound it'll be worth it.Good place to work if you have job security. Management lacks involvement with your daily activities. Work is delegated and ignored unless you're in a critical position. I received very little to do.Terrible place to work for.  The culture is toxic.  The management goes out of their way to try and get people to quit by excluding people from meetings, making information deliberately concealing information and neglecting to answer emails.I was hired as a temp for basic clerical duties and record keeping for their accounting department while the corporation was in the process of digitizing it's files. Despite my temporary status I was able to work for the company for 2 years and they tried to give me an advancement opportunity by turning me over to data entry.   I enjoyed working for them and they gave holiday bonuses as well as year end bonuses even to a temp.Working for Noble Energy was probably one of the best working experiences I have had. The culture in IT was fantastic, the people I had the opportunity work with were excellent at their jobs. If the price of Oil hadn't plummeted I would have loved an opportunity to work there.Very nice people and environment with many different people, in many different departments. Makes working here very interesting but useful.  Job duties are basic to the needs at hand for what ever project your working on and of course, making that project successful.  And again - my co-workers become family friends that i will maintain these relationships inside and out.It was great starting out, when it was a small company.  As the years went by, they went ""public"" and got a little too ""top-heavy"".  Politics started to come into play.  Started growing a little too fast. Most managers do not know what they are doing.  It's all in who you know.Easy to get lost in the system, hard work is not rewarded at this big company.  Lots of management, too much big corporate culture.A quality organization that works hard to work in an ethical manner.  Great workplace environment.  They take great care of their employees.Good working environment, smart and friendly co-workers. Results oriented, however due to rapid growth of the company, planning of projects suffered.they well train new hires.  make all employees feel appreciated. fair and reasonable compunction. works well with matters of family/children.  Organized clean friendly. wonderful customer serviceOver-staffed land department plagued with overlapping responsibilities and poor management from middle managers. Very political company culture that was strongly evident in April 2015 layoffs. High turnover rate among 20-something's in the land department as a result of how the land department was structured and managed. Nothing more than a pay check and resume builder.good work load balancemanager goodsome lack of communicationgood co workershardest part, getting timely decisionsNoble's culture is built around engineers. Zero professional development is given to administrative employees (non-engineers) while the company is ripe with opportunity for such.Management is lacking in more ways than I can list. There is a very egoistic and secretive approach to all decision making. The most valued employees are the ones who take the least amount of effort to manage.Good environment.Upper management takes too risky decisions that leads towards work force reduction.They are very open to offering training to employeesManagers are very open to hear youThey invest in training and you are always considered as part of the teamThe have community work which was fun there.Excellent place to work. Management very helpful in daily operations. Safety was number one on our daily work schedule. Great locations.All management needs to be more involved with the day to day on-goings of the organization. There also needs to be transparency when the company is not performing to minimum goal requirements.For people working in Engineering this is a great company. They can explore,drill,complete and produce petroleum as well as any. If you work in a supporting role, IT, Fin, SCM, Audit, Etc. the jobs are fairly easy. The performance bar is set pretty low but so are the chances of advancement and pay raises. The company hires externally over internally. Internally HR and IT are seen as the weakest links in the chain because of their upper management and performance. It is a mid-size and growing company that still thinks it is small. They tout tuition reimbursement as a benefit but deny it to most. You can easily spend 10 years in a position as an average performer and if you over-perform you will be assigned more work. A lot of people would leave if it weren't for the easy job and great benefits.This job was different everyday, I loved that challenge it gave the everyday experience. The laid back atmosphere, and how they were flexible with life and job was appreciated.","1,001 to 5,000",Houston,Houston,TX,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/d8555cb3-d786-4a1b-bd40-0364499f0bc7?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=7,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

53,5077.0,GIS Developer,Rice University,4.5,84.0,"Very collaborative and a great place to learn and expand one's knowledge base. Located at the heart of Houston - it is one of the few schools that dictates the best possible jobs across all industries ranging from big management consulting firms to core engineering and sciences jobs.The people are great but the pay is lacking. The work can be interesting and the benefits are strong. Lots of opportunity to branch out and work with other departments. Free class per semester.As a student, working a job on campus has many benefits, and work is very flexible if you have test or something. Your job depends on your positions, and can be anything from managing a library to filing papers or staring at a computer.Fun research environment, beautiful campus, good salary, good location, vast parking lots, awful health services, good recreational center, good nanofabrication facilities.First off, I notice most of these wonderful reviews are written by students or student workers, not by regular employees. Honestly I'm not that impressed. The best thing about working here is probably the benefits, mainly the health insurance offers very good coverage. But, in my opinion it's pretty expensive, more expensive than average if you're covering more than just yourself.The work environment itself in non-campus office positions is extremely dull and boring. You're typically glued to your desk and the offices are set up in a very isolated manner, to the point it gets depressing. You may meet a lot of nice people here, but there are also a lot of people that are in lower positions that are stuck up and on their ""high horse"" because they think working for Rice is such a big deal, even though they're actually at the bottom of the barrel in the lowest positions. My experience has been that the people higher up are actually the nicer people.Time off is ok, but they're very strict about how much time you can use and when and also you're expected to take NO time off for the first 6 months except for University holidays. In most departments you'll get 1 week off in December for a holiday break (but some departments work through the break) and 3 weeks of PTO (vacation, sick, etc all included as one). Even though this sounds good, the time can run out quickly because many holidays that other schools and colleges are closed, Rice is not. You don't get Good Friday, President's day, or even Christmas Eve and there's no spring break for staff. So if you want those days off,  more... you'll have to use your PTO, which will take almost a week of your time away just on holidays.Traffic in this area is horrific. I live about 15 miles away and it takes about 45 mins to 1 hour to get there in the morning and 1 hour - 1 and 1/2 hours to get home in the evening. If there's an accident, close to 2 hours. They frown upon working from home and flexible schedules even if your job is not people oriented. So, there's no option of working from home.My biggest gripe is that the work is SO boring and slow paced and dealing with the attitudes of some of management that don't communicate with each other, then take it out on the employees and try to blame us when something goes wrong. Overall if I could go back (I had 2 jobs offers when I took this job) I'd have taken the other job I was offered).  lessI work contract and assisted the Director of the Provost Office, where I focused on Rice Purchase Card reconciliations, file organization and management for the faculty where I handled documents such as CV's, sabbatical leaves and faculty promotions; worked closely with the Dean's of the different schools/departments.Overall it is a very good place to work. I have found that most everyone on campus is incredibly supportive, no matter what department they are in. I have never called someone for help and been told they did not have the time for me. I have learned that we are all in this as a team. My co-workers are wonderful, caring and talented individuals, who again see the department as a team and not as a group of individuals.What I find difficult about the job is the lack of advancement. The job is, what the job is, no matter how good you may be at it, you will never be awarded with a raise or a promotion. You must leave  where you are happy and comfortable in order to secure more money and a promotion of any sort.The most enjoyable part of the job is the access to all forms educational lectures, visiting artists and performers. We have an incredible window to the world within our hedges!Go in and log onto your computer and check you emails respond to them and help customers.I excelled in my customer service skills.Management were great and flexible.Outgoing and nice.Being asked to work 4 extra before going home but was done.Working in such a prestigious University.Had the best time of my life in the department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. Developed expertise in Dynamics and Process Control and ended up teaching a course to senior engineers at the end of my PhDTypical name submitting purchase orders and paying invoices. What I learned working for Rice University is that the University is on a budget and if new federal funds are not received this will impacted your merit raise at the end of the year. Management sought highly qualified employees that could assist them to change their current process to a faster updated system of records. Co-Workers worked and assisted others during vacation schedules or during down time. The hardest part of my job is processing over 5,000 invoices from begining to end by fiscal close while maintaining vendor files and the equipment folders for large purchases with proper documentations. The most enjoyable part of the job is assisting the faculty and coworkers with purchase orders and ensuring accounting principles and accounting budgets or in line with the grant proposal.I like to start the day off by letting the team know or finding out for myself what are the priorities of the day.  We generally work together to accomplish goals.  I am a leader, yet, I also know how to join the team and work together.I worked with students, staff, and parents daily while analyzing their needs and meeting them with federal and institutional financial service options. This university consistently ranks among the best places to work for many reasons. Primarily, I loved working there because of the great benefits, amazing job security, family oriented co-workers and brilliant students. The top notch theater arts, guest speakers and athletic competitions further connected me with the student body. Wonderful place to work!Very good university, very good environment. The professors are all friendly, and you will learn much from them. Strongly recommend it.A typical day was hard work and getting the job done.  Enjoyed working with undergraduate and graduate students to assist them in adding and/or dropping classes.  Enjoyed assisting faculty with events and conferences. For the employee were always encouraged to take classes to learn new systems.  The hardest part of the job was making the student aware that the Examinations and Standing committee denied their case.This work is a  research based work. I have learned different aspects in robotics and artificial intelligence..The most challenging part is implementing algorithms on real robotic system.I enjoyed building intelligent systems and working with robotsI work in a research lab. The work is good, resources are top of the line, and people are always helpful. I would recommend it.Nice platform for pursuing career in Academia. Exceptional institute for higher education. Relative small number of students so the faculty:student ratio is high.Rice was a pleasure to work for.  The benefits and compensation are nice (for a post-doctoral position), and the staff in the Physics department were helpful and responsive.If you love outstanding scientific research, Rice University is the perfect place. The city of Houston is great and the campus is just minutes away from its cultural district. The library is the best I've ever been to. The laboratories are amazing!Rice University is an amazing place to work. It does carry about the employees. It does have amazing lectures given by famous people in their field. Health benefits are great and Rice university takes care of everything so one can focus on doing job well.Rice University is an awesome place to work.  I have enjoyed my years of service here but am ready learn other work environments which will enhance my skills and challenge my experience.","1,001 to 5,000",Houston,Houston,TX,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/8ebeaa12-b7c0-400d-86c4-e3b59d9ff7de?mescoid=1500140001001&jobPosition=21,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
