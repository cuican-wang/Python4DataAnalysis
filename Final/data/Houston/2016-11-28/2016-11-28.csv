19,5043.0,Senior Data Scientist,Spokeo,2.8,5.0,"If you are cool with checking your brain at the door this is the place for you. They hire people that are waaay more book smart or talented than they need, then micromanage the dickens out of you. If you've been working for more than 5 years, I suggest you look elsewhere.Yes! they provide you with catered lunch everyday . But I think that's only to make up for HORRIBLE management that expects you to do a lot more than what you're getting payed for. They continue to make changes after changes that makes the job more complicated & you feel stressed out more than half of the time trying to keep up with the changes. All the customers that call are always upset because of the unsatisfactory service provided, you get lucky if you speak to a happy one in your 8 hour shift. If you're ready to put up with angry people all day, go for it!Pros:- Great startup and resume builder career- People are fun and work atmosphere is hip- Flexible schedules- Free catering for lunch- Lots of fun perks (Video game area, Fitness reimbursement, Monthly Events)Cons:- Customer Service Dept is still in development, lots of constant changes regarding policy- Entry-level Pay (12.00 per hour)- Not enough advancement opportunity- Management could use work regarding workload distribution and evaluations should be based on work performance- Wage is not up to negotiationThe Spokeo atmosphere is definitely fun, but it is run by a few very young Stanford alumni who have big egos and have difficulty being told new, better ways to do things. Although they tout a relaxed setting, communication there is very poor, and they do not allow for working remotely whatsoever, which can be hard if you have to balance family and work.Love the company and what they stand for. They really take care of you and make sure you enjoy working there- catered lunches everyday, ping pong table, pool table, nerf gun armory, stocked kitchen, etc.",51 to 200,Houston,Pasadena,TX,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/39757130-0896-4001-af1c-3a6f0a4a0d87?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
24,5048.0,Staff Scientist,Baylor College of Medicine,4.0,184.0,"I was taught hands on about reading slides through the eyes of 3 pathologists.Learning the various stains to be used to record a diagnosis.  Publishing manuscripts online with strict deadlines. Obtaining various signatures for publication.  Updating CV and licenses.  One of the hardest aspects of this job was there 3 different pathologists who constantly needed slides ordered from the lab. Stats were almost normal.Travel arrangements needed to be done in timely fashion to receive standard rates authorized through the college.Enjoyed making 3 highly recognized doctors happy daily.Very fast paced work environment. Numbers/Productivity driven over quality Care. Baylor providers are very professional. Atypical work day would include management of Acute exacerbation of a chronic condition average 16 to 20 patients daily for the mid levels and a higher number for physicians. Health maintenance provided.Fields in the Life Sciences expand at an accelerated pace and can be quite challenging, stimulating and rewarding.  The essence of discovery science is very enjoyable. Flexible schedules allow for work-life balance.  Political battles in academia are the most difficult challenges faced.This is a good company to work for. They have to better with selecting Management. It was a bit messy when I was there and people did a lot of things to get others fired. Management and Human Resource was so insecure and unorganized.BCM could be the ultimate place to work and offers many good things, including medical/insurance benefits, but they don't reward hard work and accomplishments. Rather, they reward mediocre work by people who have no personality rather than outstanding work by outspoken people. No one ever seems to be promoted, and even though I did a really good job, accomplishing things that others couldn't seem to get done, I was not rewarded by either promotion or wages. It seems to be more important to be boring and not make waves than to actually accomplish anything on a daily or weekly basis. I've worked for BCM on three separate occasions, and this last time was the closest I ever came to my 'dream job' in research, but in the end, it became more about personality than progress. Other minor problems are parking problems (true for almost all institutions in the Texas Medical Center) and inflexibility among some management.Great research environment, positive and encouraging management, pleasant coworkers and workspace. Very good benefits, good vacation and holiday plans.Great benefits - work with a great group of critical care physiciansOverall management issues with the critical care team (physicians) and the APP manager (does not allow site specific director to do their job without micro-managing)Have learned so many things - great learning opportunitiesYour experience will depend on what part of the department you fall into.  IT selects the best sales person for the CIO position and has little control on what this person does once they get in.  Last CIO was horrible and cost the College tons of Money on sales pitches that never happened. The College overall is excellent with some of the best doctors from around the nation.The Ancillary support for these group is poorly managed and is costing the college a lot of money since they more tune to the sales pitch than the actual work.  They are over inflated in staff and are getting false data from their director.Management is poor very unorganized don't care about employee concerned with customers they can verbal abuse employee cos they are always right no team work and unacceptable pay rate no raisesAssisting patient's to exam room, obtain vital signs, collect lab specimen if needed. Assist physician with exam or procedures if needed. I learned that all patient's are special and they are #1. My clinical manager was a great. She taught us to work hard to achieve our goals in clinic and in life. My co-workers we were a team that worked hard to get the job done. I did not like that we could not give more time to help some of the patient's as they needed. I loved seeing my patients and my patients loved seeing me.I enjoy my working experience in Baylor College of medicine. In the past years, I got the chance to improve my career skills and learned new technologiesWork life balance wasn't all that great once budget season came around due to working very late hours. Compensation is much below than TCH and other hospitals in the area for the same positions. The health benefits are great and the 401k is too. Most of the employees have been there for a long time and plan to retire there. There's room for advancement and movement to other departments. Management does not micromanage and are always willing to listen to what you have to say and they will back if you something arises. The job culture is to do your job and go home!no organization, lazy people, high turnover rate of employees. there is no manager in charge, management has favoritesJob is not paying adequately for the responsibility that I had.  Management was not well executed and fair either.  There were unequal distribution of work duties as well.Great place to work if you're willing to work hard.  It can be overwhelming at first since it is situated in the Texas Medical Centerlearned so much there and had fun working there. management was good .only thing lacking was the duration of job ...it was a short period of time but had great experience .This is a great place to work if you want a career in a stable industry with great benefits.  It is an academic environment, therefore you will need to be patient with academic driven initiatives rather than familiar corporate management driven initiatives.  Many long term employees resistant to change.Typical day is your working alone.Registationpulling Demographicsweekly meetingsmanagement is very interested in keeping you up to date on how to process clean claimsEncourages you to sit with other employees to grasp more conceptsI was unable to join the labs that I wanted to because of funding difficulties, and was placed in one that I didn't have much experience in. There is a strong feeling that everyone wants you to succeed and plenty of people to look to for help. Only real disadvantage is that they expect a serious chunk of your life and it's easy to begin to expect too much of yourself.Baylor College of Medicine is one of the leading Cardiovascular Clinics in Houston.  It is well known not only the state or country but all over the world. I have had the pleasure of working with some of the finest cardiologist. It was a great experience working with the support staff and nurses as well.Loved working at Baylor my co-workers were the best. My boss was really nice and my two supervisor were great. I was in the Oncology , Breast Clinic, General Surgery, Chemotherapy and Mammogram department department's. It was a very busy Suite we saw about 220 patient's a day.","5,001 to 10,000",Houston,Houston,TX,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/5ec92f72-9410-4123-beaf-dbe1a376b665?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
