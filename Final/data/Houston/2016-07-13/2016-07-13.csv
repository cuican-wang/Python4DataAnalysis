37,5061.0,GIS Technician,New Century Software,2.4,5.0,"Good Place to work. Small teams and lots of work load.Good 401K, Wellness programs, Insurance, work experience.Fantastic company on the leading edge of their market.   A company driven to grow first by quality and only then by size.  The IT department and products are second to none in the industry and always forward looking.   An incredible culture of family and work, guided by hands down one of the best people you could ever hope to meet.   He hasn't lost track of humility and family while still stoking the fires of improvement, growth and competitiveness.   If you want a place that will challenge you in many regards, you are hungry to be a part of team, and desire a really caring and usually focused team look to NCS.The management at this company is horrible. They micro manage and treat people like children. They don't know how to market the company properly and are constantly hiring and laying off people. There are better GIS jobs out there.Updated maps, queried and QCed data. Good office atmosphere.During my tenure working for this company, a typical day consisted of analyzing and capturing information from maps and drawings. At this job, I learned how important it was to accurately capture information to provide a final product to the client. Management was helpful and would answer questions regarding new and unknown features on maps and drawings. Most co-workers were very helpful answering my questions. The hardest part of this job was to continuously capturing data without any other task to break its monotony. The most enjoyable part of this job was to listen to music while capturing data.",,Houston,Houston,TX,2016-07-13T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/e5cb5bd4-3db5-4835-95c2-15ca601884eb?mescoid=1500141001001&jobPosition=5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
