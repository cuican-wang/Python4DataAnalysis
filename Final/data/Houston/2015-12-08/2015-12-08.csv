63,5087.0,Institute Assoc Scientist III,MD Anderson Cancer Center,4.1,259.0,"There really isn't a typical day in dining services, each day brings new opportunities to improve and learned new techniques. I really enjoy interacting with my co-workers to find new ways to be more cost effective.Currently working here now for the past 3 and a half years and I hate coming to work. The leadership is terrible, which trickles down to the employees. Its very hard to transfer to other areas, so Im basically stuck. I've been trying to move to other areas for 3 years, and cant even get an interview for positions I'm over qualified for.  Promotion from within is almost impossible...There is extreme favoritism. If your  not one of the ""teachers pets"" your days will be very challenging.  Whatever you do, dont go anywhere near the PBS dept. I really like the purpose and mission behind the work, but I just hate the environment. Unless your a doctor or scientist, I'd choose somewhere else to work.Management really does play favorites,and will go off hearsay, not actual facts.. They will go as far as making up things about you to find a reason to give you a hard time.They will deduct 100-200 dollars from your check for parking every month on top of the retirement they take from your check, that you cannot adjust. On top of that you will still end up walking a couple of blocks to get to work. Alot of backstabbing and untrustworthy people there. I wouldn't want to come back.A relatively fast paced work environment with many opportunities for connection and advancement. I learned much about cancer and the medical field in general. Management was decent but could be frustrating to communicate with at times - sometimes not seeming very receptive or accepting of feedback. Coworkers were good - worked with many caring people. The hardest part of the job was balancing the many many different tasks required at any given time within the constraints of an 8 hour day. Many days it felt like there simply are not enough hours in the day. Most enjoyable was helping patients.Great place to work and advance your career. Several opportunities to learn, gain new skills, and interact with experts in cancer.Managers show favortism and never hire African American  men. They will hire the women but never the men. They also give poor raises and they will barely advance from withinThe experience of working here for the past eight years has been rewarding. But financially I feel that I can do better elsewhere. Advancement wise I think that I can do better elsewhere. Supervisory staff falls a little short of being professional.LOVED THE WORK I DID HERE BUT THE MANAGEMENT WAS HORRIBLE. The most unprofessional group I've ever met. The played favoritism and i wasnt into that tupe of culture. I hated going to work with these people. E.V.E.R.Y.D.A.Y. The one  reason I lasted a year was because I felt the job I did made a difference in people's look lives.MD Anderson is a great company to start a career and retire from there too.  The benefits will make you want to stay with the company.  They have a good reimbursement program and the managers will work with your schedule if you're pursuing higher learning.The company is awesome but it lacked in leadership in some areas and resource skills that would drive the needs of the employee and organization to where it needed to go.The only thing about MD Anderson that is great is the benefits because you are working for the state.  The big issue is that if you are not a member of one of the races that are considered a minority (African American, Hispanic, Asian etc) you cannot get ahead in your career.  To be white at MD Anderson is a bad thing.  Also the management tends to play favorites, not being fair across the board with all employees.my 11 months working at md Anderson was horrible I dreaded coming in for work I would never have a assigned area and that was even after I made my 90 days. they where so unorganized they would have you doing stuff that wasn't even in the job description . I would never recommend anyone for this job nor any job at md Anderson. it was so racist and so divided pcps would get attitudes  as well as the nurse's  with the housekeepersPoor communication and no proper training program for new employees. Very poor management system. Would not listen or help me be successful. Group had terrible manners and did not try to include me. Group conversation was demeaning and negative. Employees made multiple mistakes but they were judged differently because they were already part of the group. No possible thought of ever being promoted.If you apply and get a position at MD Anderson it is a difficult place to get into first of all. Once you are in you would probably wish you hadn't. The co-workers are not very nice and the management plays favorites. I was there for 14 years and they worked hard to get rid of me. Watch your back and don't believe it when someone says they like you.MD Anderson is a great place to learn and grow as a nurse. The benefits and schedule are incomparable. The actual job of caring for cancer patients can be physically and emotionally exhausting, but is worth it if you truly enjoy what you do.MD Anderson was my very first job, that came with benefits, overtime and other career based amenities. It was the first time I was able to get a taste of the ""real world"" and its politics. MD Anderson motivated to return to school and finish my degree.I really enjoyed working here, this to is also very easy, and good money, plus they have really good benefits for you and your loved ones, its a great way to work.A typical day a work is cleaning office and clinic areas after closing time.  While working I learned how to properly clean a clinical facility.  The few months that I worked as a Building Attendant I. The job position and requirement were good I have no complaints. During the short stay on the job I experience 3 supervisors which gave me the notion that there is some unsteadiness in the management area. Why so many new supervisors in less than 3 months.  Co-workers no problems go along well with all co-workers.  The hardest part of the job to many changes of upper management.The most enjoyable part of the job lunch.This company is great to work for. Paid benefits, beautiful facilities including a fitness center, always providing continuing education.I found MD Anderson to be a thriving atmosphere where I was able to learn from coworkers, faculty and management. It's a place that cultivates its employees and encourages them to find their niche within the institution and work toward promotion. If it wasn't for the awful commute from Katy to the Med Center, I'd still be an employee there.The health care benefits are great. They offer tuition reimbursement which is important when trying to further your education. In general, a great place to work.","10,000+",Houston,Houston,TX,2015-12-08T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/ec983371-4b5d-4e2c-8220-eaeff9168c63?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=31,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
