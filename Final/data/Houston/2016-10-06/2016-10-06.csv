I also ran the lottery machine, counted cigarettes, and account for closing the cashier. Managers worked well with staff and were accommodating.I really enjoyed with full respect to any job done.  responsibility is a key for successful and awesome part at the work places. I learned any jobs can be done on time if you love your job and each day you will learn more than you expected.  Fair with employees, equal opportunity, payroll on time, safety. respect and love for your co- workers. the hardest part of the job is when you haven't done your job yet. Enjoyable part of the job when working as one team.ExxonMobil is a company that expects it's employees to conduct their business with integrity and the highest degree of ethical consideration. It's policies underline the importance of these values and management is supportive in how these are implemented on a daily basis. As an event planner I had the opportunity to work with a wide range of people, and found working with such smart, considerate, driven people to be very rewarding.Assessed customer needs and responded to questions. Cleaned and 			straightened work area. Issued receipts for purchases and gifts. 				Worked with customer service to resolve issues. Weighed food to 			determine correct pricing. Operated cash register with proficiency. 			Worked overtime shifts during busy periods.Conducted daily pre-shift 			and weekly departmental meetings to ensure organizational efficiency.Receive and process payments by cash, checks, credit card or automatic debit.I have realize that over time, both your or your job can change in terms of the the life cycles of products, natural turnover of people, personal life changes and what not else.It’s essential that you have a decent relationship with your co-workers since you see them so often, and often work side-by-side on daily work duties. The hardest thing about my job is knowing when to stop. I don't think I ever felt there is one recurring part of my job that is the hardest.Its a morning job from 9am-11am, Monday - Friday, I will always instruct you on daily task as long as you are willing to learn fast, and also there'll be short break and we also have health care center for our worker which the bills will be taken care by usVery good compensation and benefits.

Have not met a person who doesn't know the exact date they can retire with full pension.Enjoyed my co-workers. Always given high priority and challenging jobs. I worked all over the world and had a chance to teach others, sometimes with an interpreter.Always given high remarks on my job performance, daily and yearly.I retired which maybe was a mistake as the company was moving to the Woodlands and I did not want to make the long drive everyday. i learned to get along from people which came from other cultures.I was responsible for planning and prioritizing my work. I learned how to self manage my days work. I felt that management supported me not only in my daily duties, but also when I was designing various tools to assist fellow employees in their jobs. I enjoyed the people that I worked with and still stay in contact with many of them. The hardest part of the job was seeing it move to Texas. The best part of the job was feeling appreciated for the many things that I did.•	Lead carpenter, oversaw day to day operations of the repair facility.•	Preformed repairs, in building and fill all orders for must need services •	Inspected and tested equipment in order to locate damage and worn parts and diagnosed malfunctions •	Read work orders to determine required repairs.•	Monitor process indicators, instruments , gauges, and meters to detect and report any possible problemsI learned and furthered my knowledge of company PNL and how the pricing could effect profit along with how to balance the two as to not lose customers. A typical day involved opening the store by 5:30 in the morning and taking care of news paper inventory, doing daily paper work and balancing of books and product inventory, ensuring cash deposits were properly counted and logged. This company has a wonderful management team and team work between managers of other stores. It is an enjoyable place to work but due to relocation being necessary for our family due to my fiances job it is necessary for a new job to be acquired for me.ExxonMobil is a very strong and well disciplined company. However, it can be political, robotic, slow moving, and stuck in its ways. I was exposed to many different sections, divisions, organizations, and business-lines while I was at ExxonMobil. One of the primary things I noticed was the culture, happiness, and well being of the employees ranged dramatically section to section. Some areas of the company were very good while others were terrible.Another major take away is the ranking system is very political. Your ranking depends more so on how well you are liked by your knowledgeable-others than your technical abilities.The world's largest publicly traded international oil and gas company, providing energy that helps underpin growing economies and improve living standards around the world. The company operates facilities or markets products in most of the world’s countries and explores for oil and natural gas on six continents.I loved working for ExxonMobil. Everyone was driven to succeed. Company was very well structured vertically, change of command was very responsive and listened to employee needs. Not very much red tape due to the leanness of the organization.  Hardest part was the work-life-balance. I was away from home over 75% of the year.ExxonMobil has very detailed plans on how job functions should be performed. The management teams are very well structured and always seem to include people of professional mentality as well as generally good people. Regular internal audits are used to confirm adherence to reporting requirements. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interactions with team members on a daily basis.Majority of the Exxon's are owned by cheap Indians who don't care about their employees safety. They're are no benefits. The customers take their frustration out on employees because of the poor functioning equipment.A typical day at work was enjoying preparing meals for customers.I learned about different blend s of spices different foods and ways to cook.Managers was good.team players.not/any hard part about the job.satisfying the customers making sure there food was prepared properly.I have been with Exxon for over three years, in that time I have worked for two owners and a handful of managers, all have been  great people. We went from super busy to super slow, due to highway construction and and area expansion. I maintained my position that the store could be awesome again, and this week my faith was proven, with the opening of Fuzzys Taco and Golden Chick restaurants in the store.The hardest part of this job, consistent customer service.Some people are great at this job and some don't last two days.Customers are my joy on the job, knowing their families and going through tough times with them.I have been loyal with this company for a year, i have never been late, always clean, stock and aware of store maintenance, I have accepted inventory, learned how to properly file paperwork into the computer and was receiving 38 hours, After months went buy I am the only white, female person working I do not feel comfortable working in this atmosphere. I was also forced shorter hours not even making part-time hours. I live and pay all my own responsibilities and need to find a more stable company to work with.the work environment was a 5 out of 10.  no one took responsibility for their own actions and people were blamed without any cause.  highly uneducated management staff which produced a poor reflection of the Exxon companyFair Management.
