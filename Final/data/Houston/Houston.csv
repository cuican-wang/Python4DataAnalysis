Management offers lots of support, tons of training and terrific mentoring program program.inconsistant hours. highly stressful.as an order selector, had to maintain high level of speed of processing orders.as an forklift operator more comfortableA good place to work. Good pay. Great work environment. Great work hours. Good management. Great co-workers. Hardest part of job is some of the places you have to deliver. Most enjoyable part is the pay.Month-end is busy and can be stressful.   Sysco does offer growth personally and professionally, to contribute to the success of a dynamic organization.great company to work for. they take care of their employees, they appreciate hard work and compensate you for it. I worked in the warehouse and it is very clean and organized.they have excellent benefits and plenty of opportunity to move around within the company. they have plenty of perks and extras you can get with just a little bit of extra effort , theres always free stuff being handed out, the people are cool  It really is a good one to work for unfortunately I found it while I was in the back stretch of getting my welding certificates so I decided against staying but I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get into warehousing.There was very little communication, hardly any credible organization of the tasks at hand and most of the drivers were ignorant idiots.I was a night picker, got paid decent money, but was required to work long hours. if you are young and maybe not sure what you want to do in life this might be a good job for youWas a temp for 2 months.  Was trained for 1 day. Busted my butt for the time I was there.  Worked 10 hour days.  The first two weeks were great.  Co-Workers super friendly then week three hit and the cattyness began.  Micro managed by fellow employee who was not a supervisor.  They stood over me while waiting for me to finish my tasks.  Would go through my desk and just take stuff without letting me know or leaving a note so I wasted time looking for work that I thought I had misplaced.  Was ultimately let go do to not completing a function of my job that I was never trained on.It's hard work but you make real good money as long as you don't mind working for it. You get home most the time unless they stick u on a over night. So if you have young kids you want be with them every night.not possible to balance work life.     Great potential to much is asked fwith a poor manager to lead.   my experince with the company is poor but due to my manager and not the over all companyYou will make lots of money as a driver for sysco working 50-60 hours a week 12-14 hours a day. It is extremely hard and stressful so you will need thick skin to succeed. It can be done but its certainly not for everyone.Terrible place to work,15 yrs and got absolutely no respect.Nothing but a pack mule.Brown nose management did not stand behind drivers,did not properly maintain equipment,constantly cutting pay,hours,benefits while expecting more and more from drivers everyday.This place will destroy your body because of the amount of unnecessary work you have to do because of the totally fouled up way they do things.Do yourself a favor and RUN as fast as you can away from this company!Good old boys club, It's all about who you are in bed with. Sysco's size is a blessing and a curse. Large broker community at your finger tip, however products are price above market which ca be problematic in competitive situationReally one of the worst places i have every worked in my career.  The management is not strong and caters to larger pieces of business, and does appear to care about the small business owner in the industry.Working Mon-Friday      Monday & Thursday pulling doubles & delivered to West Virginia   Tuesday Paducah & Tennessee & Illinois Area than Friday in Lexington KyI didn't care for this job because of the stress that it puts on a person!My co workers weren't happy do to the job demand!Which I felt made my job harder! I enjoy hard work but the people I'm surrounded. by need to be happy !!!Great people to work with and for. Customers are great and I enjoy interacting with them every day. They all bring light in to the day. Long running company that is well liked by allExcellent environment to foster strong teamwork and support of the overall goals. Quick to adopt new ideas in an ever-changing landscape of customer needs. I very much enjoy working with the organization and its ability to deliver .Long hours interfere with personal life. It will distance you from your family and friends. But you will have an opportunity to make a lot of money if you don't over work yourself.A great place to work while you are in school, or a second job.  Has a great work life balance, works around school schedules.Every house will vary in regards to loads, routes, treatment of drivers.  Work is physical and requires patience when dealing with customers and with the load itself.","10,000+",Houston,Houston,TX,2016-10-21T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/6c901b14-eb22-4073-bd23-07edc5b1c55f?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Very enjoyable job!It was such a great experience to work for RBC Wealth Management. I learned to work in fast pace environment and to managed competitive priorities. I was helping a team of two financial advisors with all the administrative tasks, calendars, communication and financial transactions. The managers and supervisors were great allies to help me grows within the company. The team I worked with were mainly reactive rather than proactive and it made it very hard to learn a structure and organization. However, I always felt appreciated by them. I was able to remain myself and still belong to the team.Enjoyed working with my clients and prospects.Reasonable commission schedule.Nice office and location.Office closed due to lack of recruiting on part off management.Royal Bank of Canada offered a professional and comfortable work atmosphere. Salary and compensation levels were competitive. Personal were very Team orientated.Very comparable in terms of compensation and work-life balance with the bulge bracket banks, but still lacks top exit opps. Culture and management varies widely between different groups. Great place to learn a lot.RBC was a great company to work for that allow for growth and personal development.  I worked my way up from middle office to front officeRoyal Bank of Canada is a very sound financial institution. I worked for the Bank for 10 years in the Futures division located in Chicago. They are very responsible to there employees and create a comfortable work environment.It's fun and rewarding to work for RBC. The culture is open and inclusive.  Senior management communicates and keep employees informed about the direction and strategies of the firm.RBC is a good company to work for.  The benefits are good, the pay is competitive.  You do want to make sure that if you pick a career path (operations over business line) that you stick with it however.  Once you get too high up in one or the other it is hard to switch over.I worked within the trade support team for just over 7 months on a contract role. The role support the equity sales traders. I was located in London..I have worked here for 14 years and have found that the culture has increasingly become very toxic. That being said the benefits are good and there is a decent amount of job security.RBC works hard to provide affordable competitive benefits.  However, they determine employee salary by analyzing industry averages and meeting, not exceeding, the average.RBC is a terrific company to work for and love that there are options for growth if you are willing to make changes.  Just like any company there are differences in opinion and management but overall this company is good to work for long term.Excellent leadership.Learned about banking.Excellent training.One of the best companies that  I have worked for.They give you all the tools to be sucessfulMy day begins with updating reports, checking for errors and preparing for closing calls. The rest of my day is all about making sure all deadlines are met. Towards the end of the day we make sure  that all account are balanced and if we have to  assist each other to  get issue that demand urgent solutions.Lots of hours for little outcome. Depending on the group you could work on some M&A deals but mostly you will be pitching a lotThis company is a small but nice place to work at, They show appreciation. The contribute to your success. You really work as a team to in a good way.Support 40+ executives with a variety of requests including travel, creating presentations/org charts, answering phones, faxing/copying,Enjoyed coming to work.  I like to keep busy and help other employees if need be.  I enjoy talking to client on the phone and developing a personal relationship with them.Great intern projects and responsibilities. Company and people really care about your professional growth. Good work/life balance is actually something that is stressed on employees, depending which department you are in but overall it's the company's culture. Really great people to work with especially within the Project Delivery Office (PDO). I would love to come back and work here full time.like working here because the days seem to go by fast.

I would answer phones for the pathologists and do clerical work as well as some transcription when the full time transcriptionist was not available or needed help.  My co-workers were very supportive and helpful. It felt like we were a family, including management.  The hardest part of the job was learning all the different things I had to do and adapting to the changes in policy that would occasionally happen.Contacting the doctor to inform him of hospital call and checking with interns on stats.Learning all the various aspects of psychological problems that individual could have. Learning that prominent figures were actually being treated for psychological problems.  Actually management is this position was the best hands on experience I had. The doctor was very interested in making sure I understood this aspect of medicine and each client needed special care. I was taught to take every phone call seriously because the clients were very fragile.I appreciated every aspect of this position.I enjoy my job everyday I came to work I wish I still work for this company Great management Good co-workers  Family/friendly place to workVery well organized and handled the best way it wants to be handled. ICARE is the main thing to always think as you are with patients.The benefits and pay are great, but the work/life balance is terrible. Also management is awful and everything done there through them is based on politics and who they like and don't like. They make your life and job difficult if you're not favored by leadership. HR is not to be trusted either nor half the people that work in the radiology department. Typical day is usually always busy with the occasional slow day, hardest part is dealing with management and their expectations. Most enjoyable part is the some of the people that you get to work with and having a starbucks on site.The charge nurse would make sure we got breaks. Floor manager very in tune with what was going on, on the floor. I learned to work on committees in working toward a solution to a specific problem. My co-workers were mostly independent in working by themselves. The hardest part of my job was seeing patients in pain that could not be controlled. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing patients come in debilitated and able to walk out on their own at discharge.Amazing work environment. ON the job training is very effective and employees are considered family. I learned the importance of hand hygiene and patient safety.A typical day for me begins a 6:30a.m. meeting and greeting patients and family members assisting demographic part of their clinic visit. .Over the last 3 years I have learned so much about the transplant process.The hardest part about my job was working under staffed for a fast expending transplant clinic.The most enjoyable part was seeing the faces on patients faces that come out of the transplant process healthy with their new organs.Very different get to know different people.like doctors nurses physical therapists people.Getting to know what they jobs duties are overall great place to work for love the bonus we get every 3 months love the environment friendly people,patients meeting patients family member overall love working for Houston MethodistStart with 4 to 5 acute/chronic patients. Perform full assessment on my assigned patients. Perform all physicians orders for patients. Update daily care plans with patients participation. Work in collaboration with charge nurse to meet patient's needs. Most enjoyable part of my job is when positive results or a life is saved from given out best nursing care and acting promptly to any changes in patients' condition.The hardest part of my job is when i am not able to get immediate response to further provide care for my patientsVery good rate of pay. Can be fast pace but great work helps a lot.Easy to pick up shifts and easy work with call policy only use it very need to call off. Union employeeI enjoyed working at J C Penny in the childrens dept... I was well acquainted with the customers and was always recognized for my amazing customer service skills by the leadership team.* Face to face interaction with patients and family* Handles charts of patients* Schedules appointments* Assistance to nurses, physicians, patients and family, visitors, and otherThis job can be overwhelming at times and frustrating. Little to no team work. The supervisors have no respect and dont really want to work with you unless they like you. Its a lot of drama even with the supervisors.I have a bachelor degree but was stuck in an entry level job. The director of my department seemed paranoid and very accusatory. I was thankful that she didn't come around often.Over the years at Houston Methodist I enjoyed the people that I had a pleasure of working with on a day to day basis. We worked as a ""TEAM"" to get the job done day in and out. Management stayed on top of us to make sure that our job was being done in the best and most safe way possible. The hardest part of my job was leaving. I had no real complaints because I worked with people who knew what there job was and did it as such. If ever a problem we could all talk to each other fix the issue and continue with our daily work with no problems. The most enjoyable part of my job was that we communicated very well with each other and made everyday a fun day.Did not like working there. .no yeam work..system is not fair dealing with co workers and supervisor..i am looking for another job that better suits me.Intense environment. High patient load, Good team, but high turnover. Stressful but it is what you make it. Nice community hospital that typically getting slammed.Good place to work; you can learn a lot working here. Good work life balance. Coworkers are kind. Pretty solid benefits working for a hospital. Ranked the best hospital in Texas.Enjoy working with team.  Assignments to medical or surgical units.Management available for support and assistance, always positive.Co-workers a joy to be with.Hardest part  of job would be coordinating multiple physician groups to accomplish best outcomes for patients.Working with teams on units, nurses, respiratory therapists, social workers, physical and occupational therapyGood culture and they take care of their employees.

Came in as a new employee, learned and left there as a veteran in oil and gas.There are two distinct classes - contractors and employees. It seems that who you know gets you more job recognition and opportunity than what you know. Social connections count more than job skills and experience do, so if you're on the ""inside"" and fit in with the social culture, you'll do ok. If you don't, you'll be discounted, no matter what you do. Hiring and promotions that I saw were based on social connections instead of quality of the person's work. It may be different in other departments, but that was my experience working there.Overall the company is a pleasure to work for. Great company culture and transparent management.Working in the oil and gas industry at this point leads to less stability in the work environment, but if you can make it through to a rebound it'll be worth it.Good place to work if you have job security. Management lacks involvement with your daily activities. Work is delegated and ignored unless you're in a critical position. I received very little to do.Terrible place to work for.  The culture is toxic.  The management goes out of their way to try and get people to quit by excluding people from meetings, making information deliberately concealing information and neglecting to answer emails.I was hired as a temp for basic clerical duties and record keeping for their accounting department while the corporation was in the process of digitizing it's files. Despite my temporary status I was able to work for the company for 2 years and they tried to give me an advancement opportunity by turning me over to data entry.   I enjoyed working for them and they gave holiday bonuses as well as year end bonuses even to a temp.Working for Noble Energy was probably one of the best working experiences I have had. The culture in IT was fantastic, the people I had the opportunity work with were excellent at their jobs. If the price of Oil hadn't plummeted I would have loved an opportunity to work there.Very nice people and environment with many different people, in many different departments. Makes working here very interesting but useful.  Job duties are basic to the needs at hand for what ever project your working on and of course, making that project successful.  And again - my co-workers become family friends that i will maintain these relationships inside and out.It was great starting out, when it was a small company.  As the years went by, they went ""public"" and got a little too ""top-heavy"".  Politics started to come into play.  Started growing a little too fast. Most managers do not know what they are doing.  It's all in who you know.Easy to get lost in the system, hard work is not rewarded at this big company.  Lots of management, too much big corporate culture.A quality organization that works hard to work in an ethical manner.  Great workplace environment.  They take great care of their employees.Good working environment, smart and friendly co-workers. Results oriented, however due to rapid growth of the company, planning of projects suffered.they well train new hires.  make all employees feel appreciated. fair and reasonable compunction. works well with matters of family/children.  Organized clean friendly. wonderful customer serviceOver-staffed land department plagued with overlapping responsibilities and poor management from middle managers. Very political company culture that was strongly evident in April 2015 layoffs. High turnover rate among 20-something's in the land department as a result of how the land department was structured and managed. Nothing more than a pay check and resume builder.good work load balancemanager goodsome lack of communicationgood co workershardest part, getting timely decisionsNoble's culture is built around engineers. Zero professional development is given to administrative employees (non-engineers) while the company is ripe with opportunity for such.Management is lacking in more ways than I can list. There is a very egoistic and secretive approach to all decision making. The most valued employees are the ones who take the least amount of effort to manage.Good environment.Upper management takes too risky decisions that leads towards work force reduction.They are very open to offering training to employeesManagers are very open to hear youThey invest in training and you are always considered as part of the teamThe have community work which was fun there.Excellent place to work. Management very helpful in daily operations. Safety was number one on our daily work schedule. Great locations.All management needs to be more involved with the day to day on-goings of the organization. There also needs to be transparency when the company is not performing to minimum goal requirements.For people working in Engineering this is a great company. They can explore,drill,complete and produce petroleum as well as any. If you work in a supporting role, IT, Fin, SCM, Audit, Etc. the jobs are fairly easy. The performance bar is set pretty low but so are the chances of advancement and pay raises. The company hires externally over internally. Internally HR and IT are seen as the weakest links in the chain because of their upper management and performance. It is a mid-size and growing company that still thinks it is small. They tout tuition reimbursement as a benefit but deny it to most. You can easily spend 10 years in a position as an average performer and if you over-perform you will be assigned more work. A lot of people would leave if it weren't for the easy job and great benefits.This job was different everyday, I loved that challenge it gave the everyday experience. The laid back atmosphere, and how they were flexible with life and job was appreciated.","1,001 to 5,000",Houston,Houston,TX,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/d8555cb3-d786-4a1b-bd40-0364499f0bc7?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=7,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

16,5040.0,Data Scientist,Exxon Mobil Corporation,4.0,1000.0,"Exxon Mobile was a fun place to work where my job was to manage the store and register all purchases. I also ran the lottery machine, counted cigarettes, and account for closing the cashier. Managers worked well with staff and were accommodating.I really enjoyed with full respect to any job done.  responsibility is a key for successful and awesome part at the work places. I learned any jobs can be done on time if you love your job and each day you will learn more than you expected.  Fair with employees, equal opportunity, payroll on time, safety. respect and love for your co- workers. the hardest part of the job is when you haven't done your job yet. Enjoyable part of the job when working as one team.ExxonMobil is a company that expects it's employees to conduct their business with integrity and the highest degree of ethical consideration. It's policies underline the importance of these values and management is supportive in how these are implemented on a daily basis. As an event planner I had the opportunity to work with a wide range of people, and found working with such smart, considerate, driven people to be very rewarding.Assessed customer needs and responded to questions. Cleaned and 			straightened work area. Issued receipts for purchases and gifts. 				Worked with customer service to resolve issues. Weighed food to 			determine correct pricing. Operated cash register with proficiency. 			Worked overtime shifts during busy periods.Conducted daily pre-shift 			and weekly departmental meetings to ensure organizational efficiency.Receive and process payments by cash, checks, credit card or automatic debit.I have realize that over time, both your or your job can change in terms of the the life cycles of products, natural turnover of people, personal life changes and what not else.It’s essential that you have a decent relationship with your co-workers since you see them so often, and often work side-by-side on daily work duties. The hardest thing about my job is knowing when to stop. I don't think I ever felt there is one recurring part of my job that is the hardest.Its a morning job from 9am-11am, Monday - Friday, I will always instruct you on daily task as long as you are willing to learn fast, and also there'll be short break and we also have health care center for our worker which the bills will be taken care by usVery good compensation and benefits. Culture is cut throat and competitive. Politics is critical to succeed  for all levels of the hierarchy. Backstabbing is a norm. Have not met a person who doesn't know the exact date they can retire with full pension.Enjoyed my co-workers. Always given high priority and challenging jobs. I worked all over the world and had a chance to teach others, sometimes with an interpreter.Always given high remarks on my job performance, daily and yearly.I retired which maybe was a mistake as the company was moving to the Woodlands and I did not want to make the long drive everyday. i learned to get along from people which came from other cultures.I was responsible for planning and prioritizing my work. I learned how to self manage my days work. I felt that management supported me not only in my daily duties, but also when I was designing various tools to assist fellow employees in their jobs. I enjoyed the people that I worked with and still stay in contact with many of them. The hardest part of the job was seeing it move to Texas. The best part of the job was feeling appreciated for the many things that I did.•	Lead carpenter, oversaw day to day operations of the repair facility.•	Preformed repairs, in building and fill all orders for must need services •	Inspected and tested equipment in order to locate damage and worn parts and diagnosed malfunctions •	Read work orders to determine required repairs.•	Monitor process indicators, instruments , gauges, and meters to detect and report any possible problemsI learned and furthered my knowledge of company PNL and how the pricing could effect profit along with how to balance the two as to not lose customers. A typical day involved opening the store by 5:30 in the morning and taking care of news paper inventory, doing daily paper work and balancing of books and product inventory, ensuring cash deposits were properly counted and logged. This company has a wonderful management team and team work between managers of other stores. It is an enjoyable place to work but due to relocation being necessary for our family due to my fiances job it is necessary for a new job to be acquired for me.ExxonMobil is a very strong and well disciplined company. However, it can be political, robotic, slow moving, and stuck in its ways. I was exposed to many different sections, divisions, organizations, and business-lines while I was at ExxonMobil. One of the primary things I noticed was the culture, happiness, and well being of the employees ranged dramatically section to section. Some areas of the company were very good while others were terrible.Another major take away is the ranking system is very political. Your ranking depends more so on how well you are liked by your knowledgeable-others than your technical abilities.The world's largest publicly traded international oil and gas company, providing energy that helps underpin growing economies and improve living standards around the world. The company operates facilities or markets products in most of the world’s countries and explores for oil and natural gas on six continents.I loved working for ExxonMobil. Everyone was driven to succeed. Company was very well structured vertically, change of command was very responsive and listened to employee needs. Not very much red tape due to the leanness of the organization.  Hardest part was the work-life-balance. I was away from home over 75% of the year.ExxonMobil has very detailed plans on how job functions should be performed. The management teams are very well structured and always seem to include people of professional mentality as well as generally good people. Regular internal audits are used to confirm adherence to reporting requirements. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interactions with team members on a daily basis.Majority of the Exxon's are owned by cheap Indians who don't care about their employees safety. They're are no benefits. The customers take their frustration out on employees because of the poor functioning equipment.A typical day at work was enjoying preparing meals for customers.I learned about different blend s of spices different foods and ways to cook.Managers was good.team players.not/any hard part about the job.satisfying the customers making sure there food was prepared properly.I have been with Exxon for over three years, in that time I have worked for two owners and a handful of managers, all have been  great people. We went from super busy to super slow, due to highway construction and and area expansion. I maintained my position that the store could be awesome again, and this week my faith was proven, with the opening of Fuzzys Taco and Golden Chick restaurants in the store.The hardest part of this job, consistent customer service.Some people are great at this job and some don't last two days.Customers are my joy on the job, knowing their families and going through tough times with them.I have been loyal with this company for a year, i have never been late, always clean, stock and aware of store maintenance, I have accepted inventory, learned how to properly file paperwork into the computer and was receiving 38 hours, After months went buy I am the only white, female person working I do not feel comfortable working in this atmosphere. I was also forced shorter hours not even making part-time hours. I live and pay all my own responsibilities and need to find a more stable company to work with.the work environment was a 5 out of 10.  no one took responsibility for their own actions and people were blamed without any cause.  highly uneducated management staff which produced a poor reflection of the Exxon companyFair Management. A lot of hours. Paid overtime. Closed on Holidays.Generally work 8 hours per shift. Only one Co worker. Responsible for customer service, also daily, weekly and monthly paperwork. Weekly inventory.

Houston management is very removed from what the company actually does.This was my first offshore job was very interesting and fun to learn new skills. i have many certifications and got to fly in helicopters pretty often best part of the job was the flights for freeGreat benefits and plenty of room for advancement. There are many jobs all over the world. They are fair and willing to train for any job and transfer to any location.Halliburton is a good way to start a career in the oilfield.  They helped me get my CDL with Hazmat and payed for it all.  I would recommend Halliburton if you are wanting to go into the oilfield.The job is challenging and there is a lot to offer. but there is no room for family they are your family, so if one is married like i am it strains ones marriage and  alone kids time. but the money is good. so one must learn to balance work with family.  hard to do!Halliburton as always been a great company to work for.  The people are great and the management is great.  There are several classes Halliburton offers and really help with the changing of the oil and gas industry.I learned the jig plant and how to operate the loader I was a leadman It could have been more better managementworking in the snow was the hardest part of this job100+ hour work weeks. Outdoors. The hardest part of the job was staying awake for so long. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new and interesting people.I really enjoyed working for Halliburton, learned a lot and had many opportunities that I took advantage of.  On the job travel to Africa and Brazil.  I was laid off May, 2016.learned a lot about oilfield procedures and values. grew as a person and learned a lot about myself and how far I could push myself.Job was pretty easy just a lot of time away from my family.  A lot of travel time and never home for the holidays.  Pay rate was one of the lowest in the area but you made a good living due to the fact that the average work week was about 85 hours or moreIs relaxed environment.Most people speak and are kind.I am looking because I need more of a challenge. The campus is beautifulI've learned many things but am looking to learn more.good work place always on the move working and being productive big on safety and always advancing towards safe and productive workOverall a good company to work for. The people where great and helped me transition to civilian life it made it easier for me because I still had a brother hood and we all worked together as one team just like the Marine corps.Erratic work schedule. Never knew when i was leaving or coming back. The actual job was easy just not knowing when i was leaving made it very hardThe work is hard and is a long hours, on land had to stay up 30 hours multiple times, offshore had to stay up 54 hours, and get little sleep at both. The people you work with make it all worth while because they help each other on the crew. Halliburton is mostly about the company and not your life style, what I mean by this is that you hardly have a life while working for this company. The money is good but running and maintaining the multi million dollar equipment makes the job a little better. As with any other job as long as you work and don't hide you can improve your position and move up in the company.They had a very good culture and great learning experience. Made a lot of friends and worked in a good environment. Most of the skills that I know today have come from the hard work that I have done learning and this company.Halliburton is a great place to learn about the oil and gas industry. There are many opportunities available at Halliburton locations around the world.I liked the company goals and culture. A change in pay and facility(management)  prompted me to seek other means of employment. Enjoyed my time at the company and would work there again.Overall the company was good to work at.  It has a very good life center and cafeteria.  They are big on safety at the workplace.The job itself was good u get to work on new and old cars that came through the shop.

If you've been working for more than 5 years, I suggest you look elsewhere.Yes! they provide you with catered lunch everyday . But I think that's only to make up for HORRIBLE management that expects you to do a lot more than what you're getting payed for. They continue to make changes after changes that makes the job more complicated & you feel stressed out more than half of the time trying to keep up with the changes. All the customers that call are always upset because of the unsatisfactory service provided, you get lucky if you speak to a happy one in your 8 hour shift.

Although they tout a relaxed setting, communication there is very poor, and they do not allow for working remotely whatsoever, which can be hard if you have to balance family and work.Love the company and what they stand for.

23,5047.0,Toxicologist III,Harris County,3.8,74.0,"I liked working with the public. Never had any problems with management. No problems with coworkers pretty enjoyable job over all.If I could return to work here, I would! The ONLY reason why I did not maintain employment here was out of both my and their hands.I learned a great deal, and it was an incredible experience. Everyone was really knowledgeable and efficient in their day to day. I would recommend anyone work here if given the opportunity.A typical day at work came with long lines, upset customers, screaming babies, and continuously having to explain to customers why their paperwork couldn't be processed. I learned not to buy a vehicle from just any car dealership. The hardest part of the job was the short breaks and even shorter lunches.Every day is something new, and there's no way you can prepare for it. Management has been there for years and they play play favoritism. The pay is not that great .You can do what ever you want at this job. Once you re hired on it is very hard to get fired from here. A lot of people trying to get ahead and will do anything to get aheadThis place is extremely unprofessional! Management is a joke. It's impossible for you to grow here. They have a flexible work schedule but most of my time here has been spent surfing the Internet. NO WORK TO DO. Didn't learn anything here. The pay is ok. Vacation and sick days or comp time must be used for natural disasters or building closure issues. No short or long term disability. THEY DO NOT PAY FOR EMPLOYEE PARKING EVEN THOUGH THEY OWN MOST OF THE PARKING GARAGES IN DOWNTOWN. I've been on a wait list for a parking spot for two years now. You must provide your own forks, knives, spoons, plates, napkins AND water!Filing mail, answering phone calls/emails. Seeing client's, making home visits, and frequent court visits to discuss client's status while on supervision.If you're a multi-tasker, this is a great job for you, which was a great job for me.  I enjoyed being the bookkeeper and also working as retention of volunteers.  The folks in the office are hard working , dedicated people who do not work for the $$ but for the best interest of the volunteers.a typical day at work was to be able to make my customers as comfortable as possible. Being that they were at the tax office bothered a lot of individuals, and was always making sure they left with a smile on their face.i'd rather not comment on management.My co workers were somewhat great, the hardest part of my job was rejecting customers because they didn't have the correct documents for their transactions.Over worked, and made to do double shift at the last minute. Some coworkers think they are the  Captain. People are constantly in your personal life. The pay is not is not good, but you may never have a life outside of the agency. Too many cases. May not get home until 9:00 or ten at night. Run!A typical job as a Forensic Investigator Assistant or Forensic Investigator III would vary from day to shift, now day is the same. Some days you might be in the office answering phones, but 99.9% of the times the job requires you to go either alone or with another coworker to pick up bodies at hospital, scenes like highways, freeways, houses, under bridges, under trains, automobile accidents, bayous, airports, plane crashes, boats, lakes, you name it!! The ones no many people like are decomposing bodies, specially if it is inside a hoarder's house in the summer, children, and floaters or drawing etc... The difficulty of the job is when the deceased is heavy and you have to carry the body down the stairs, from attics, roof, so many weird places. It's difficult to explain everything in a short paragraph. The position for Assistants are pretty much picking bodies, triage calls and other morgue related duties. FI III take photos of certain scenes and have to do what Assistants do. Assistant's make around (14+/HR), Fi III around (16+/HR). Fi II are the ones that go to scenes with Assistants and Fi III, but Fi II only take photos and write the reports and make around ($18+/HR). If you are skinny, you might not want to apply for Assistant or Fi III, they are usually big people that do the job because of the amount of lifting required, like some said: this is a muscle job.Benefits? Aetna provides health insurance and it's free for you, no overtime is paid, instead they accumulate that, and if you ever resign, you receive a big check if you have a lot of comp. Time. Raises are very  more... bad, pretty much pennies a year. PD: make sure before you apply that you will stand seeing dead people in many different ways, decomposing, hanging, dawning, chopped into pieces, and so many unthinkable ways to die. Be prepare to stand odors, the heat, the cold, the rain, etc.. Don't think you're going to be working under the rain with an umbrella. It's a dirty position, but rewarding for some.  lessHarris County is a nice place to work if you are attempting to get your foot in the door with gaining work experience. The culture of the department is very family-oriented. The sense of family makes the fast paced work and deadline driven obligations of the job bearable.Great county, but lacks affordable housing, has good schools and great people. However, county commission reluctant to take on hard issues and pay employees,  Certain commissioners micro manage and harass employees.Work consist of having a good understanding of HUD rules and regulation. Must be able to multi-task and have a good working relationship with grant recipients.Great place to work at while in school. Awesome work environment. It is always fun and time goes by fast. Great food, competitive pay. hardest part is working holidays and too many customers to deal with at the same time.Working have Harris County has been some of the worst experience ever. Management is extremely inconsistent always making up policy as they see fit, they don't care about their employees it's impossible to try to move up or to another department without having the ""politics"" in the way. Working in detention it's like of the employees are the real criminals because they're out they aren't looking at the residents/inmates, they're constantly looking at us to see what type of errors we make and not trying to tell us to rectify it more like trying to find a way to fire us. Morale is completely blow upper management and administration can do stuff like call in or what have you and when lower employees to do the same we get penalized and have consequences to face. Just like when they were recently on the news none of upper adman had consequences to face only lower workers which is completely unfair.This job requires someone who can work in a fast paced environment and able to complete tasks with minimal supervision. Attention to detail and whereabouts. As a Screen Technician you are required to go through training and being on time is a requirement. It requires attention to detail and ability to maintain total security of information obtained. You work alongside law enforcement and other government agencies and officials. Co workers are there to complete the same job you are, therefore don't expect training to be something just taught. All senses will be used in this field.Low morale within office.. Petty arguements cause larger issues. Employee Over sensitivity causes workplace uncomfortableness.First employee to become Lead Clerk 3 months after training. Quick learnerGreat customer serviceGreat way to meet attorneyGreat people and excellent benefits virtually no job growth this place is perfect for people at a latter stage in life that desire no promotions or increase in salary.

24,5048.0,Staff Scientist,Baylor College of Medicine,4.0,184.0,"I was taught hands on about reading slides through the eyes of 3 pathologists.Learning the various stains to be used to record a diagnosis.  Publishing manuscripts online with strict deadlines. Obtaining various signatures for publication.  Updating CV and licenses.  One of the hardest aspects of this job was there 3 different pathologists who constantly needed slides ordered from the lab. Stats were almost normal.Travel arrangements needed to be done in timely fashion to receive standard rates authorized through the college.Enjoyed making 3 highly recognized doctors happy daily.Very fast paced work environment. Numbers/Productivity driven over quality Care. Baylor providers are very professional. Atypical work day would include management of Acute exacerbation of a chronic condition average 16 to 20 patients daily for the mid levels and a higher number for physicians. Health maintenance provided.Fields in the Life Sciences expand at an accelerated pace and can be quite challenging, stimulating and rewarding.  The essence of discovery science is very enjoyable. Flexible schedules allow for work-life balance.  Political battles in academia are the most difficult challenges faced.This is a good company to work for. They have to better with selecting Management. It was a bit messy when I was there and people did a lot of things to get others fired. Management and Human Resource was so insecure and unorganized.BCM could be the ultimate place to work and offers many good things, including medical/insurance benefits, but they don't reward hard work and accomplishments. Rather, they reward mediocre work by people who have no personality rather than outstanding work by outspoken people. No one ever seems to be promoted, and even though I did a really good job, accomplishing things that others couldn't seem to get done, I was not rewarded by either promotion or wages. It seems to be more important to be boring and not make waves than to actually accomplish anything on a daily or weekly basis. I've worked for BCM on three separate occasions, and this last time was the closest I ever came to my 'dream job' in research, but in the end, it became more about personality than progress. Other minor problems are parking problems (true for almost all institutions in the Texas Medical Center) and inflexibility among some management.Great research environment, positive and encouraging management, pleasant coworkers and workspace. Very good benefits, good vacation and holiday plans.Great benefits - work with a great group of critical care physiciansOverall management issues with the critical care team (physicians) and the APP manager (does not allow site specific director to do their job without micro-managing)Have learned so many things - great learning opportunitiesYour experience will depend on what part of the department you fall into.  IT selects the best sales person for the CIO position and has little control on what this person does once they get in.  Last CIO was horrible and cost the College tons of Money on sales pitches that never happened. The College overall is excellent with some of the best doctors from around the nation.The Ancillary support for these group is poorly managed and is costing the college a lot of money since they more tune to the sales pitch than the actual work.  They are over inflated in staff and are getting false data from their director.Management is poor very unorganized don't care about employee concerned with customers they can verbal abuse employee cos they are always right no team work and unacceptable pay rate no raisesAssisting patient's to exam room, obtain vital signs, collect lab specimen if needed. Assist physician with exam or procedures if needed. I learned that all patient's are special and they are #1. My clinical manager was a great. She taught us to work hard to achieve our goals in clinic and in life. My co-workers we were a team that worked hard to get the job done. I did not like that we could not give more time to help some of the patient's as they needed. I loved seeing my patients and my patients loved seeing me.I enjoy my working experience in Baylor College of medicine. In the past years, I got the chance to improve my career skills and learned new technologiesWork life balance wasn't all that great once budget season came around due to working very late hours. Compensation is much below than TCH and other hospitals in the area for the same positions. The health benefits are great and the 401k is too. Most of the employees have been there for a long time and plan to retire there. There's room for advancement and movement to other departments. Management does not micromanage and are always willing to listen to what you have to say and they will back if you something arises. The job culture is to do your job and go home!no organization, lazy people, high turnover rate of employees. there is no manager in charge, management has favoritesJob is not paying adequately for the responsibility that I had.  Management was not well executed and fair either.  There were unequal distribution of work duties as well.Great place to work if you're willing to work hard.  It can be overwhelming at first since it is situated in the Texas Medical Centerlearned so much there and had fun working there. management was good .only thing lacking was the duration of job ...it was a short period of time but had great experience .This is a great place to work if you want a career in a stable industry with great benefits.  It is an academic environment, therefore you will need to be patient with academic driven initiatives rather than familiar corporate management driven initiatives.  Many long term employees resistant to change.Typical day is your working alone.Registationpulling Demographicsweekly meetingsmanagement is very interested in keeping you up to date on how to process clean claimsEncourages you to sit with other employees to grasp more conceptsI was unable to join the labs that I wanted to because of funding difficulties, and was placed in one that I didn't have much experience in. There is a strong feeling that everyone wants you to succeed and plenty of people to look to for help. Only real disadvantage is that they expect a serious chunk of your life and it's easy to begin to expect too much of yourself.Baylor College of Medicine is one of the leading Cardiovascular Clinics in Houston.  It is well known not only the state or country but all over the world. I have had the pleasure of working with some of the finest cardiologist. It was a great experience working with the support staff and nurses as well.Loved working at Baylor my co-workers were the best. My boss was really nice and my two supervisor were great. I was in the Oncology , Breast Clinic, General Surgery, Chemotherapy and Mammogram department department's. It was a very busy Suite we saw about 220 patient's a day.","5,001 to 10,000",Houston,Houston,TX,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/5ec92f72-9410-4123-beaf-dbe1a376b665?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

They do not take care of their employees. This company is a joke.PROS Software Company was good to me for my whole entire senior year when I was in high school. I was an intern there and I learned a lot about the IT and the Office Services part of PROS. Everyone is really friendly there and the company is very laid back and fun. I loved my experience there and wish I can do it all over again.I currently work for this company it is a good place to work, but oil field work is slow so theres limited hours and limited pay at this timethe job is great despise all of the micro management good company over all, the company has great safety really caring owner.No work/life balanceFast employees turn aroundHire inexperience employees for cheap salaryTry to catch up with technology with no expertise to implement or manage the technologyOur boss was very helpful and cares about his employees and team members. He usually doesn't pressure anyone to finish a job too early, and always encourages us to take our time to make sure we do it right the first time. Tries get to know everyone personally, but never discriminates anyone. Everyday I could expect something different on the job, such as new faces, and different situations. It was a job that was very difficult at first, but everyone there was more than willing to help educate and share their knowledge and experience.PROS has many good aspects to it. You have contact with a wide range of people and have an opportunity to impact positively on their lives.Very intelligent population of employees; great culture and employees sincerely care about one another.  Executive leadership needs to be more strategic.  Most executives have only worked for PROS, so they don't offer a broad viewpoint.  Lack of processes makes accomplishing tasks challenging.  Senior leadership takes too long to make a decision.This is a good company full of very smart people.  The professional services departments is a sink or swim department.  If you ask for help you will get it, but you have to be willing to do the work.  If you are then you can be very successful, If not then no one will be there asking you how to help, or holding your hand.  You are responsible for your own success at this organization, and will be rewarded for it.Great Place to work but the distance was to far to travel.

The management was very disappointing but I got to work on big projects and was compensated well.I felt like the stress of the job was largely artificial. I didn't work very hard but definitely harder than my peers and was able to get 2 ratings and one 1 rating.Managers dont care about employees anymore. it was a struggle for everyone cutting throats for their jobs. Used to be a great place to work. since the oil price dropped, thats all in the past.Benefits are horrible but the management in the southeastern New Mexico is wonderful. Company as a whole has some issues.  It doesn't pay very well they start out out at the very bottom and it's very hard to get a raise and very hard to promote. They need to promote people who have ambition to move up and learn more don't hold someone down.There are a lot of great people to work with here but the bureaucracy makes it difficult to push big projects to completion and have a big impact.There is not always great interaction between the different business functions and groups try to make themselves look good instead of looking for what is best for the company.Traffic control - Logging in/out scale traffic - Inspect of all cars/trucks.As for management - Their skill and experience are not strong. ..........Past tense..it was a good company. Senior management will not run it like a large independent oil and gas corporation, that it is. Its not Exxon...don't try to run it like it is, quit comparing the company to Exxon, Chevron, BP & shell...Great co-workers. Great benefits. The company is pretty large for an independent, so I would expect more layoffs in the near future until the company is more in line with the size of peer companies.The management team is great and they are doing their best to keep open communication as the industry is in its downturn.  The co-workers bring this pace to life and are a joy to be around.Like any major in the O&G space, they are working hard to manage the downturn in the industry.  Given the right job in the right management team, COP is a good place to work.ConocoPhillips gave me the opportunity to expand my experience as a Cost Control Specialist. I had the opportunity to travel and work with people from different countries and cultures and was able to support them gaining the recognized expertise in multicultural relations.The managers have an open door policy and are willing to listen and assist if possible. The people are also great! I came in with a learning curve having been in Higher Education and the help I received was great!Oil and gas prices required continued workforce reductions.Obtained extensive knowledge of managing employees, budgets and projects.Obtained extensive knowledge of Land, both surface and mineral.Long hours/dangerous work in the Oil Field/not for everyone/work outdoors in extreme heat and or cold. Not much family time/can be called on to work weekends as well/pays reasonably wellIf market is good all is fine - downturn mens layoffs which happened in '15 & '16. I retired before that happened in June 2016during layoff period office environment became toxic - ""throwing people under the Bus"" - Blame game - heavy office politicsGreat support from coworkers.  I learned a lot about the economics in the oil and gas industry.  Management seemed to take a great interest in employees.Great company if you want to develop yourself professionally as a new hire, but unfortunately the company has not been managed well since the spin-off from PSX in 2012. The company mismanaged their costs and their capital discipline during the lead up to the crash in prices in 2015, which has resulted in massive layoffs and earning losses. The company retains a few good assets that are competitive and will enable them to keep their doors open for a long time. The company touts itself as an independent (nimble) E&P company, but it's unfortunately held back by the top-down management and gridlock bureaucracy.I enjoyed my tenure at ConocoPhillips. The folks I work for and with were largely top-notch individuals with solid skill sets. My Business Unit was unique in that it seemed to always attract quality team players who enjoyed the basin we worked and the results we achieved. It is unfortunate that market volitility had such a deleterious affect on the industry as a whole. In the end, the bonus outcome is that many of us get an opportunity to re-invent ourselves (in my case, again).ConocoPhillips is a good place to work if the price of Oil is high. They have a difficult time forecasting and managing the business If the oil price is low.Work there for 19 years and really have nothing good to say about the company other than meeting some really good people. I lost my job to some low life that never came to work and spent the last 11 months doing his job out in the field.our work is hard but we enjoy it my team work is goodand everybody work together management is oksupervisor stay on top of everything and work with us on any issuesOverall people are nice and pay is good but going through a down cycle due to low energy commodity prices.... maybe a good time to join if you are a contrarian.As a college student they market their ""Engineering Academy"" as a great training program, however it's just virtual training classes and computer based learning. It is helpful, but definitely not what I would call a great training program. Also, the company needs to make up its mind if it is going to be an independent or a major.","10,000+",Houston,Houston,TX,2016-08-24T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/dc1deff9-d43a-41ce-9717-ec766e53c898?mescoid=1500140001001&jobPosition=2,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

36,5060.0,Geophysicist - Houston,Range Resources,4.2,23.0,"Loved the job and the people.  Laid off due to the gas market downturn.  Flexible hours and some times work from home.  Paid dues for associations.  Lunches provided during bad weather.  Security provided .Some management needs to be replaced, most people were good to work for, salary was good, overall good company to work for.Bad Upper Management, Working in the gas field is good. For the most part you get to be your on boss and there is no hectic schedule.Range is a great place to work.  Industry is hard right now.  Lots of opportunities to excel.  Management is great.  Pay and advancement are ky components.Very friendly work environment where team work is essential to success. Bid's were done months in advance of new year. Hardest part of job was getting everyone to buy in to change.Had the pleasure of doing different jobs within the company that was productive under lacked supervision. Had the respect of upper management.Range Resources is a promising company in a country that does not yet have the necessary infrastructure for it to thrive. Overall, Range Resources provides its employees with good wages and rewarding work. Unfortunately, the supply of natural gas currently exceeds the demand for it, and the company's profits have plummeted, causing excessive downsizing.Range Resources is a great company. The Oklahoma City office had amazing people that truly cared about your success. They had great opportunity for advancement.Before the home office opened had to travel to Kittanning for one month for training.  Typically when I applied for the job it was for the Executive Assistant but that position got filled so they offered me the Drilling Assistant Job and I accepted.Contracted work through them from my broker at the time. Its your typical suit and tie place, with strict rules and not a friendly environment.Range Resources is a top notch company to work for which offered their employees a lot of incentives, benefits and advancement opportunities within the company.  Due to budget cutting many positions were severed - which was mine.Range was a wonderful place to work.  The company is excellent, with great leadership at the helm.  The people were exceptional, and we were well supported by our management.I enjoyed my 3 years with Range Resources.  Excellent people.  All the co-workers were good to work with.  The office was always helpful in any situation.My time at this company was very enjoyable. I appreciated working with a lot of very smart people who were willing to share information and teach others. I learned a lot more about Prizm and Zone Manager than I knew before. The work atmosphere was very pleasant and everyone showed respect for each other. Management had an open-door policy and you didn't have to hesitate to approach your manager with any concern.A typical workday for me at Range Resources involved creating and updating reporting programs for the accounting and operations departments. In addition to this I updated technical documentation for any reports that were worked on. I learned how to prioritize tasks and that productivity and output are far more important than perfection. My coworkers were hard workers who collaborated well on various projects. Each of my coworkers had a wealth of knowledge in their respective expertises and I enjoyed picking their brains. I was in charge of reporting, one coworker was in charge of developing the database for our BI system, another coworker was the on-site AS/400 developer, and there were three analysts who served as the go-between for the developers and the end-users. Management had a tremendous amount of experience in the oil and gas industry and were a valuable resource for various assignments I worked on. I reported to one manager who oversaw the three developers and he reported to the manager who was in charge of IT-support (which had 8 employees). The hardest part of my job was managing end-user expectations. The most enjoyable part of my job was struggling to keep up with end-user requests when I was the only report developer.Same as last review for EOG Resources. Maintain and grow production!Management is severely out-of-touch with staff and it shows in every possible way! Extreme lack of communication inhibits career growth and development!Range Resources is a good company. Management was very easy to get along with. I had flexible work hours. I had the opportunity learn a lot about the gas and oil industry.It was very enjoyable working at BP, and the people were great.Well defined process' and proceedures. Workers help each other and are team oriented.I learned a lot while working here and worked with some great people.

Small teams and lots of work load.Good 401K, Wellness programs, Insurance, work experience.Fantastic company on the leading edge of their market.   A company driven to grow first by quality and only then by size.  The IT department and products are second to none in the industry and always forward looking.   An incredible culture of family and work, guided by hands down one of the best people you could ever hope to meet.   He hasn't lost track of humility and family while still stoking the fires of improvement, growth and competitiveness.   If you want a place that will challenge you in many regards, you are hungry to be a part of team, and desire a really caring and usually focused team look to NCS.The management at this company is horrible. They micro manage and treat people like children. They don't know how to market the company properly and are constantly hiring and laying off people. There are better GIS jobs out there.Updated maps, queried and QCed data. Good office atmosphere.During my tenure working for this company, a typical day consisted of analyzing and capturing information from maps and drawings. At this job, I learned how important it was to accurately capture information to provide a final product to the client. Management was helpful and would answer questions regarding new and unknown features on maps and drawings. Most co-workers were very helpful answering my questions. The hardest part of this job was to continuously capturing data without any other task to break its monotony.

40,5064.0,GIS Technician I - No Longer Accepting Applications - Posted Until Filled,City of Missouri City,4.5,4.0,"I enjoyed working with the government people here. They always appreciated the outcome of work. Got to communicate with different departments and understand the functioning of city to update the city website.The City of Missouri City is a wonderful place to begin a career, however the is not enough revenue to pay for more experienced employees, and their is little room for advancement or additional compensation. Many employees perform multiple job positions which decreases their effectiveness. Some of the upper management personnel seem disinterested in the work being implement by ground level employees and as such are not as aware of the actual work being performed or why the work is being performed. The hardest part of the job is knowing the budgetary situation and its impacts on compensation and career advancement which has a devastating affect on employee morale.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction I receive when a new residential or commercial development project I have been project manager for is completed and the customer(s) and all internal and external stakeholders are satisfied with the results.  I also enjoyed working with the elected and appointed city officials.•Conducts normal and preventative maintenance, installation, inspection and repair to the City's traffic signal systems to ensure proper operations at all times.•Responds promptly to all call-outs, including after hours and holidays; troubleshoots, diagnose, and/or take corrective action to restore the City's traffic signal systems to full and optimal operation.•Requisitions and installs parts to repair the City's traffic signal system.•Evaluates signal timing, adjusts signal timing, and makes recommendations for signal timing changes.•Performs recordkeeping activities pertaining to traffic signal timing plans, inventories, maintenance activities, and construction plan sheets.•Develops schedules and coordinates preventative maintenance activities to ensure proper and efficient operations of the City's traffic signal systems.•Coordinates all activities relating to traffic signal intersection pavement markings and signing.•May direct activities of Signal Technician I.•Performs other related duties as assigned.•Subject to 24-hour recall..I really enjoyed working for the city.

42,5066.0,Research Scientist,"Limited Brands, Inc.",3.9,336.0,"Working in sales for Limited Brands, Victoria's Secret has had many pro's and cons, unfortunately it is very difficult to soley rely on this job as a source of income, and with the daily pressures applied and goals that are set for each employee, they do not neccisarly give you the pay / oppurtunities / hours you would expect.In the time I worked for the company they pushed there company values on you since day one. These are values the company doesn't really stuck by. There is a lot of favoritism and workplace harassment in Saftey Services and I'm sure other departments. For a supervisor to be able to hit a employee is unacceptable and joking or not do it on two separate occasions. The company then punishes you for reporting the supervisor because they stick with management. When ever is this behavior ever acceptable in corporate america?Managers played favorites which led to high attrition rates; co-workers were great though. Customers were difficult to please and a lot of them, even after recommendations, wouldn't buy anything which reflects negatively on you as an associate(Even if they aren't based on commissions). One manager specifically said I was going to be working register and then decided I would be better at 'loss prevention' and decided to cancel a shift because I didnt have enough cashier experience for it.(I wonder why)I have loved working for Victoria's Secret. They want their associates to be happy where they are at and gives chances to really grow your career with the company. They're always up and changing (while doing so, they're always keeping you up to date and making sure you've done the training that you may need) so you learn so many different skills while working there.The management is great and supportive of their associates. They take opinions and concerns and usually act on them. Everyone that I've worked with has always been positive and caring for one another.A typical day at work is  problem solving, meetings, project management, finance meeting.  I manage projects from beginning phase to material arriving on-site. I have learned so much in position, but the overall arching skill set  that I have obtained is problem solving.  I have learned how to not only recognize problems but how to proactively seek them out!  As well as understand all parties that affected by the problem and bring 3 solutions to assist in resolving these problems.My management is very strong and supportiveThe hardest part of my job,  is that there are not enough hours in the day to get everything completed that I want to get completedThe most enjoyable part of my job is the completion of my projects and seeing actual stores that I have worked on opennice warehouse job, the hardest thing about the job is standing for 10 hours at a time. The other workers stay to their selves allowing you to work and focus on your assigned task.I learned great sales experience while working for the company L Brands in their Victoria's Secret store! Management is very motivating to reach sales goals.I have learned a lot working in a small Ecommerce team at La Senza. I have experienced great leadership, whom has taught me how to grow within my position. I love working on photo shoot sets for the Ecommerce team and help produce great product for our site.management needs to have more interaction with employees instead of having all decisions made by the employees in dc who look to them for guidance not wait until it goes wrong then place blame.A great place to work! As a long time employee, it was a great place to grow as well. A typical day could be non-stop meetings....I learned a lot about ITIL, Disaster Recovery and many more of the skills I consider to be some of my strongest  while at LimitedbrandsEvery employees, co-workers as well as team leaders and supervisors were nice and friendly. I would recommend all to give a try at this company. Pay rate is good, company benefit are also good.A good paying job that has many different roles one may apply for. Sometimes a bit tedious, but you are rewarded for hard work and a willingness to learn.I love being a part of the LBrands family and am proud to work there.  It's an exciting and creative place to work.  Love how involved they are with giving back to the communities.Wish they had a gym though.They mainly hire seasonal but if you get hired on, the pay and benefits are really good. Very clean facility and management takes care of the issues if found.A good Place to work on your people skills. Always work to be done on the floor or in the back. Employees compete to raise there own personal SPA (your sales).In general L Brands is a wonderful and exciting place to work.  Unfortunately leadership varies through out the company, you just have to hope you have good leadership in whichever department you work for.I submitted my resume with a degree and they placed me in a department where my job is to fold dirty laundry to be sold back to the customerJob functions vary from day-to-day, and there is never a dull moment.  Depending on location, managers can be accountable for anywhere from 10-50 employees.I would recommend LBrands to most anyone.  The company values and fundamentals are prevalent.  Leadership development is a focus.Been working with L Brands for a few years, some parts of the business are great, others not so much. Layoffs have now happened 2 times in 3 years.I enjoyed my contract with LB, the culture was very friendly and within a few weeks, I was completely used to the decor of the place (rather non-conservative)","10,000+",Houston,Houston,TX,2016-12-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/3f7c6f27-29cd-4dc3-a211-10b4ffefe5bb?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Co-workers are absolutely the best.This was a nice company to work for, but the management has made decisions that have been driving good employees away in droves. After a few rounds of knee jerk layoffs of some of their best employees, other employees are getting out at an astonishing rate. Your work life will be about nothing other than maintaining the highest billability possible so the company can meet unrealistic profit expectations. While trying to find your own work to maintain that elusive billable goal, your rates will be inflated so project managers will cut your hours while still expecting you to do the same amount of work...thus lowering your billability through no fault of your own.  Sick days will also lower your billability, as will the umpteen pointless meetings they will make you attend every week.  Unless you are a field person, don't expect to meet your billability goals with our working at least 50 hours a week.  Also expect to work late into the night and over the weekends on projects for senior people who waited until the last minute to meet a deadline. Your personal life means nothing to them...also, they ate up all the budget for themselves so you can't bill all your time to the project.I used to work for this company. This is the WORST company to work for, the management is two face, they tell you all the great things FALSELY FABRICATED which will in a few months turn out to be a bunch of lies. There is NO JOB SECURITY, they will hire you for a specific project or role and once the project ends they will make up an excuse and fire you on the spot. The management has too many politics and issues among themselves. I WILL NEVER WORK FOR ERM AGAIN AND WILL NEVER RECOMMEND ANYONE TO WORK HERE.Field work was fun and challenging.  The work provided me with good experience and I was able to learn from qualified people.Leadership is nonexistent. Some departments desperately need a management change.Partners seem to promote people who are incompetent and arrogant. Most PM's are not very knowledgable in the their field of 'expertise' and play the blame game when review time comes around. Limited chance for advancement with current management. The only performance metrics that ERM seem to care about is sales targets, face to face meetings, and billing percentage. Those are hard to achieve if you are not writing proposals and denied direct contact with clients. Forget about proper training and mentoring. These important development activities are essentially nonexistent and when you can help, it's unappreciated.Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them.Laid off due to cut backs, I did full cycle Accounts Payable. Three check runs per week, coding invoices, as well as entering them.Personable, deadline-driven and self-starter Office Administrator/Executive Assistant experienced in working in a fast-paced environment.  Solid team player who offers a positive and cooperative attitude.For the most part, I enjoy working at ERM, however, I would like to pursue a career in my field of study. At this facility, being in the admin position, I am not granted the opportunity to advance into the field that I would like. Job advancement is there for those who have degrees in this line of work. My bachelors is in Psychology and I am pursuing my masters in Legal Studies. My coworkers are the sweetest and most lovely bunch of individuals I have ever met. From the first day I started, they have all been equally nice, helping, and full of support. The hardest part of my job is watching everyone around me work in their career while I am working a job and waiting on my opportunity to advance into my career. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I am in a very friendly environment and I love the people that I work with. I have learned ample skills that will help me in future endeavors.Great co-workers caught in a changing culture resulting in a very high turn over rate.The company is a very good one to work for.  The Information Solutions groups is basically a separate company from the Environmental Consulting side, which is unfortunate. There seems to be a lot less internal competition and insecurity in the Environmental side.  A lot of opportunity if you have SAP experience.A the location I worked, the company seems to tolerate if not condone less than professional work - doing more to curry to clients than to meet regulatory obligations or professional ethics. Disjointed managment, lack of cohensive values. The company has a reputation of hiring then firing personnel once they are done with them. Cyclical nature of consulting does not help either.I worked at ERM for 7 years,  I gained great experience during my time there.  I was able to develop my technical and problem solving skills in the field and reporting.   My co-workers were always enthusiastic to perform the work and ready to get their hands dirty.A very high-pressure project (ALCOA Chatham/Cap-de-Ville ESIA) executed with personable superiors and great work team.",,Houston,Houston,TX,2016-11-17T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/7335bbff-3536-427c-81cd-4f6c14fb57b3?mescoid=1900265001001&jobPosition=13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Very knowledgeable co-workers along with a safety orientated work environment....................A Decent Company with manageable work. Poor planing/workflow causing major overtime as materials get lost/misordered. Problems stem from under staffing for periods of over a year but the company pushing overgrowth despite lack of personel. The company prides itself on its employee owners and for the most part everyone is treated well and with respect.My beginning at this job was not at all unpleasant.  I learned a lot about logistics and the overall process of shipping and receiving.  The only downside to working here was the hiring of a few hard drug users that would conduct drug deals in the parking lot during company time.  Concerns about this were repeatedly ignored.I like the half day work on Fridays. Friendly colleagues. I get to work closely with application/ DB team folks and learn a lot.Immediate management and staff are demanding and supportive of IT staff - learned much about the inner workings of ONG corporations and had a tremendous IT staff that are extremely knowledgeable and  work well as a team. I've enjoyed the camaraderie and pacing despite being a small team.An excellent company to work for. Great benefits package and pay structure. This company is heavily tied to the oil and gas market. As such its activity level is based on oil prices. Some of the best people I have ever worked with.Excellent place to work, good compensation, Typical day included troubleshooting day to day issues while working on long term projects. Management is fair and coworker is fun to work with.I have had the opportunity to work with some of the most interesting people in the work force.  Room for advancment was limited and the selection process is unfair.All the people that I worked with was very professional and a pleasure to work with. There was never a time that if I had any questions about anything or needed help that I was not able to just call. All the management in the Midland office are very enjoyable to work for. I look forward to being able to work with them and Apache again.a little one dimensional as far as duties go. some people are nice, but a lot tend to come off as snobby. I have not learned anything new in the 10 months I have been here. the best part of job is the building itself, very nice, and the schedule is good because you leave early on Fridays.A typical day is busy, work is steady even in the downturn. Training could be improved on. There is no official training program and documentation is space, outdated or incomplete. Coworkers are great, cafe and benefits are great.I loved working for Apache, I hated that they closed the Tulsa office. Employees were friendly, the work environment was comfortable. Apache offered flex time, They supported volunteering for Meals on Wheels once a week.I enjoyed working for Apache. They gave me maximum exposure to both field and office experience. Typical day in the office involves constant production analyses of my fields. Identification of low performing wells and writing AFEs to stimulate them.It started off a very good environment but it got out of hand with no real leadership. I dislike not having organization in a work place.Well I was contracted by Apache through Genesys Works and when I began I was shy since it was my first day at work. But I made friends quickly and when i needed help with any problems on pipelines I would ask my coworker for some help. The employees at Apache are really nice I enjoyed my time there and it was a fun experience.The jail was getting too crowded and we did not have the available work force to keep everyone safe. Management did not care and neglected to do anything about it, and due to my disagreement with the way things were being run, I resigned from Detention CorporalApache was a good company while it lasted. Great benefits and a lot of good people there. Just like everyone else got caught up in the reduction.Apache is a great organization to work for and a great group of people to learn from.  The leadership is excellent and are willing to assist you when needed.A good typical day at work is wen it is not raining.the new thing that i learn wuzz how to bristle blast.The management wuzz very good.All of the co-workers were good people the work with they teach you different things.the most enjoyable part of the job is wen we get to go home to our families.- Typical day at work involves resolving trouble tickets, taking phone calls, building and configuring computers and IT equipment, troubleshooting, working with peers and other departments to resolve issues- I gained a large breadth of knowledge working with Dell, Apple, and HP products, from small mobile devices all the way to high end geophysicist workstations. I also got to work with video teleconference design and implementation department for enterprise solutions- The IT dept. is small in the regional office, so less management overhead as a corporation makes it exceptional to get things done- A small team of multi-talented co-workers makes it a great place to work and learn from each other's areas of expertise in IT- Hardest part of the job is keeping up with technology in a growing corporation in the oil field, and traveling to support multiple field offices.- Most enjoyable part of the job is working with a great team, getting hands on everything IT based, and helping our clients with any IT issuesPlanned wells, confirm targets, reviewed drilling hazards, integrated geology, geophysics, drilling, production teams to plan and improve production.

I understand and can work in every facet of the oil and gas industry.I loved my job at EOG, despite some of the frustrations. Their corporate policy of using mostly contractors being the main issue. I learned a ton about the material management and logistics involved in running an oil and gas operation.Working and maintaining development with automation and controls in the oil/gas industry. Managing techs in the specific area. Daily checks on the network and data sent to Cygnet. keeping contact and communication up up Engineers and Lease Operators. Ordering parts for each specific job and making sure correct parts and devices arrive to location on time. Programming end devices and setting up communications. Training new techs on the automation with software and weekly meetings.I worked as a contract Buyer.  They do not treat contract employees well.  Some of the actual employees will treat contract people as second class.   Contract people are not paid as good as many other companies.To many buddies hiring buddies without experience.  Company management lacks safety culture and is not being held accountable for their actions.On the other side, the field personnel are in experienced but shows ability to advance and learn.Learned a lot about inventory management and co workers are awesome to work with hardest part of the job was the drive to work.Learned something new every day. The work I did on a daily basis gave me a challenge, that is what I enjoyed most. They gave me the tools I needed to get my job done.Very enjoyable work environment, All of the lease operators were very helpful with sharing any experience they had about route and what to look for problem areas and information pertaining to the job. always answered any questions that they could.Monitored the meters in the field via computer and learned to build and create alarms and messages through the SCADA system. Management teams were very helpful.Everyone appeared to get along very well with each other.The hardest part of the job was actually being laid off due to the downturn in the gas and oil industry.A typical day consists of coordination of work flow for our 4 field offices with 6 Field Superintendents, 10 Production Foreman and 12 Administrative Assistants.  Liaison between them and our Field Production Manager for everything from organizing training and meetings, documenting compliance with requirements, addressing issues and working together to cut cost and maintain productivity and safety.  I also coordinate interdepartmentally to establish a division wide schedule to communicate when which wells will go to production. I also oversee logistics in utilizing and the tracking of 66 pieces of company owned production equipment.  Generation of cost analysis reports, equipment/trucking report and regulatory report for the Texas Railroad Commission.I have worked with a great group of diverse people during my almost 9 years with EOG and have made many friends that I will have for the rest of my life.  EOG is a great company to work for and has a family atmosphere.  My current Bosses are very thankful and appreciative of my work and let me know often that I am very appreciated.  The hardest part is not knowing the fate of the oil industry in it's current downturn, which is why I accepted an 'early retirement' package that was too good to pass up.Culture/atmosphere at EOG was mostly satisfactory. The environment was fast-paced and challenging. I had a great experience and I learned a great deal more about the oil & gas industry. I hope to take the skills I acquired and apply them to future job opportunities.Enjoyed my time there. Met some great people. Great work environment. Learned a lot about the process involved in day to day well activities with vendors and clients.EOG is big on professional development, which is a wonderful benefit. My initial team and boss were wonderful. However, another manager was not and several people left just because of this person.Able to work self paced as well as team member usually a variety of tasks to complete, such must be multi-taskeropportunity to get educational assistanceopportunity to get health assistance (gyms, support)good payGood place to work and enjoy the co-workers.  You try to help out when needed or at least when asked to help or just give a little bit of encouragement which goes a long way sometimes.EOG is an excellent company to work for. My co-workers were the best part about my job. The hardest part of my job with EOG was the logistical challenges I faced. The amount of area that I had to cover was great.My work at EOG involved supervision of a team of accountants and clerks tasked with revenue accounting duties for a large E&P company.  Over the course of my career with EOG, my duties were expanded in accordance with my increased experience.  Management training was provided along the way.  In addition the performance review process provided excellent feedback to allow job growth and improvement.  The pace of work at EOG is very fast.  I relied very heavily on my team to get all their work done and to help make decisions for the group regarding job assignments and deadlines.  I provided the expertise on division of interest maintenance, which documents the ownership of oil and gas wells from an accounting point of view.  This allowed me to interact with the other departments such as Land Administration, Legal, Marketing, and Division Land and Administration. The management team at EOG have been working together for a long time and were very knowledgeable about their departments.  The hardest part of the job was balancing the demands from upper management while providing supervisory support for the accountants who reported to me.  I enjoyed the relationships I formed with all my co-workers and the rewards systems in place at EOG which acknowledged hard work and special effort.Respectable professional atmosphere that is fast pace. Job is detail oriented.  Management keeps you well informed where you're at as well as the company.Typical work day included all aspects of well construction. I learned ways to be more efficient and effective through the use of new technology and forward thinking. Management was effective and efficient. I worked with many co-workers from across the U.S. Drilling in N.Dakota included working during harsh winter weather. I enjoyed the N. Dakota climate changes and being able to travel to see and learn new things.Worked as a safety consultant for EOG conducted safety inspection of maintenance work and new construction of well sites. Also conducted monthly inspection of H2S monitors and fire extinguisher along with monthly checks of cascade systems at each of the well sites. Managed confine space entries.

This division of the Transportation industry afforded more of an opportunity to understand what is truly meant by door-to-door service as opposed to a particular set route that the professional bus operators have and this position gave an opportunity to learn more about how to get around Baltimore.Regular day at work, pre-trip my bus making sure it's safe for on the road driving and for my passengers SAFETY FIRST!!!!!!!!!. As the day goes on it is a great day when I have safely drove passengers across the city of Greensboro.Picking up garbage on route and transporting materials to disposal site. Also i assist the helper with lifting materials up to 75 lbs.This is a safety driven work place.  Some days were very busy and long hours and other days were not as busy and 8 hour days.  This was decided depending on the customers request.training intense but overall with good work ethic and hard work, good place to work.    Hired for day shift.  A shift change occurred.  I suppose when hiring individuals, these could be addressed as a possibility of occurring during employment.The communication between upper management and the first line employees is very poor. More proper training is needed, especially when it is in reference to dealing with irate customers. Employees shouldn't be rushed out of training until all necessary information has been presented.The job depends greatly on the yard a driver is based out of. No one yard is ever the same.  Some yards in the state of Wisconsin do more industrial cleaning and hazmat jobs. The yard I am based out of, is mainly hauling waste and by products for our customers. It can be and is often hectic and poorly planned. The strong lack of communication from dispatchers, and the customers is almost non-existent. Its a guess and go situation half of the time. It is based off of a mon-fri schedule, but some contracts run 7 days a week irregardless. That means youre getting at least a 34 hour reset over the weekend, and thats it.The hours add up fast, and there is serious money to be made, but there's little to no free time to enjoy the extra money. 70 hour weeks are common here. It may be a local job, but you have no more free time than you would otr. The equipment is rough. All well used equipment. Other yards definitely see better equipment then others. Everything comes in used, and is well abused with constant starting and stopping, idling, etc. Yet, it is barely maintained or ran until repaired. The organization is last second in maintenance as well. Never had I drove for someone, who told someone to run oos equipment, but fix minor things and get after them about it like its our fault.The pay program is also out of date. Once a 90 day probation period is up, you get paid by the load. If theres downtime, or non billable work, you still get hourly, but being paid by the load encourages speeding, shortcuts, and lack of progessive driving.They tell the less than or the bare minimum  more... on what your job is, and half of the time, thats not even what happens. When you get hired, they tell you one thing, and it changes ince you actually start working. They need to make some serious changes here.  lessOk company to work for management, is ok coworkers are awesome,  work is fun there's nothing more to say about the companyVeolia was a good company to work for when they were Yellow Van service . But since they become more of a corporate environment . They don't care about the older drivers whom have been there for 13 plus years. All they care about is montoring the dash cam and looking for reasons to fire drivers.I enjoy working there, a lot of hands on offered and showed how to do something, great place to move up, management is respectful and easy to get along with.Highly reactive to meet customer needs. Systems are generally followed, but their is room for improvement. Decisions are made at the highest level of the organization. There is no delegation.There was no career path in terms of advancement. A typical workday is a 12 hour shift inside petrochemical refineries, chemical refineries, power plants, and industrial plants. I learned a lot about safety, health and environmental, project management including planning and scheduling. Management was inconsistent, and my co-workers were manageable. The hardest part of the job is working in the elements for longer periods of time. The most enjoyable part of the job is completing scheduled projects ahead of schedule.I began with Crown Solutions and a short time after we were acquired by Veolia N.A.. The work was exciting onsite but the headaches of running large projects, heavy travel and senior management that could get their act together by the time I left pushed me to go out on my own.The Rialto Water Project, has some of the best people brought on to make this project a positive project. The hardest part of the project is to get all parties involved on the same pageMy impression of Veolia is that they couldn't care less about individual employees.  They just need enough bodies to complete projects and keep making a profit.  Lately the equipment has not been maintained very well which makes each job harder than it needs to be,Great company to work for with great benefits. Learned a lot about power plants, refineries and various other industries. Working for this company also entailed extensive travel to various locations but this provided a way to network with other employees and customers.It's a good company,for some. For other's your success in the company is solely based on who you know and not your work performance.Upper management is pretty out of touch with workings of field guys. You will work a ton of variable hours throughout the week so any balance between work and home is difficult to maintain.Informative and helpful superiors, good work environment. Numerous opportunities to grow. Conveniently located therefor easy to travel to work.

53,5077.0,GIS Developer,Rice University,4.5,84.0,"Very collaborative and a great place to learn and expand one's knowledge base. Located at the heart of Houston - it is one of the few schools that dictates the best possible jobs across all industries ranging from big management consulting firms to core engineering and sciences jobs.The people are great but the pay is lacking. The work can be interesting and the benefits are strong. Lots of opportunity to branch out and work with other departments. Free class per semester.As a student, working a job on campus has many benefits, and work is very flexible if you have test or something. Your job depends on your positions, and can be anything from managing a library to filing papers or staring at a computer.Fun research environment, beautiful campus, good salary, good location, vast parking lots, awful health services, good recreational center, good nanofabrication facilities.First off, I notice most of these wonderful reviews are written by students or student workers, not by regular employees. Honestly I'm not that impressed. The best thing about working here is probably the benefits, mainly the health insurance offers very good coverage. But, in my opinion it's pretty expensive, more expensive than average if you're covering more than just yourself.The work environment itself in non-campus office positions is extremely dull and boring. You're typically glued to your desk and the offices are set up in a very isolated manner, to the point it gets depressing. You may meet a lot of nice people here, but there are also a lot of people that are in lower positions that are stuck up and on their ""high horse"" because they think working for Rice is such a big deal, even though they're actually at the bottom of the barrel in the lowest positions. My experience has been that the people higher up are actually the nicer people.Time off is ok, but they're very strict about how much time you can use and when and also you're expected to take NO time off for the first 6 months except for University holidays. In most departments you'll get 1 week off in December for a holiday break (but some departments work through the break) and 3 weeks of PTO (vacation, sick, etc all included as one). Even though this sounds good, the time can run out quickly because many holidays that other schools and colleges are closed, Rice is not. You don't get Good Friday, President's day, or even Christmas Eve and there's no spring break for staff. So if you want those days off,  more... you'll have to use your PTO, which will take almost a week of your time away just on holidays.Traffic in this area is horrific. I live about 15 miles away and it takes about 45 mins to 1 hour to get there in the morning and 1 hour - 1 and 1/2 hours to get home in the evening. If there's an accident, close to 2 hours. They frown upon working from home and flexible schedules even if your job is not people oriented. So, there's no option of working from home.My biggest gripe is that the work is SO boring and slow paced and dealing with the attitudes of some of management that don't communicate with each other, then take it out on the employees and try to blame us when something goes wrong. Overall if I could go back (I had 2 jobs offers when I took this job) I'd have taken the other job I was offered).  lessI work contract and assisted the Director of the Provost Office, where I focused on Rice Purchase Card reconciliations, file organization and management for the faculty where I handled documents such as CV's, sabbatical leaves and faculty promotions; worked closely with the Dean's of the different schools/departments.Overall it is a very good place to work. I have found that most everyone on campus is incredibly supportive, no matter what department they are in. I have never called someone for help and been told they did not have the time for me. I have learned that we are all in this as a team. My co-workers are wonderful, caring and talented individuals, who again see the department as a team and not as a group of individuals.What I find difficult about the job is the lack of advancement. The job is, what the job is, no matter how good you may be at it, you will never be awarded with a raise or a promotion. You must leave  where you are happy and comfortable in order to secure more money and a promotion of any sort.The most enjoyable part of the job is the access to all forms educational lectures, visiting artists and performers. We have an incredible window to the world within our hedges!Go in and log onto your computer and check you emails respond to them and help customers.I excelled in my customer service skills.Management were great and flexible.Outgoing and nice.Being asked to work 4 extra before going home but was done.Working in such a prestigious University.Had the best time of my life in the department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. Developed expertise in Dynamics and Process Control and ended up teaching a course to senior engineers at the end of my PhDTypical name submitting purchase orders and paying invoices. What I learned working for Rice University is that the University is on a budget and if new federal funds are not received this will impacted your merit raise at the end of the year. Management sought highly qualified employees that could assist them to change their current process to a faster updated system of records. Co-Workers worked and assisted others during vacation schedules or during down time. The hardest part of my job is processing over 5,000 invoices from begining to end by fiscal close while maintaining vendor files and the equipment folders for large purchases with proper documentations. The most enjoyable part of the job is assisting the faculty and coworkers with purchase orders and ensuring accounting principles and accounting budgets or in line with the grant proposal.I like to start the day off by letting the team know or finding out for myself what are the priorities of the day.  We generally work together to accomplish goals.  I am a leader, yet, I also know how to join the team and work together.I worked with students, staff, and parents daily while analyzing their needs and meeting them with federal and institutional financial service options. This university consistently ranks among the best places to work for many reasons. Primarily, I loved working there because of the great benefits, amazing job security, family oriented co-workers and brilliant students. The top notch theater arts, guest speakers and athletic competitions further connected me with the student body. Wonderful place to work!Very good university, very good environment. The professors are all friendly, and you will learn much from them. Strongly recommend it.A typical day was hard work and getting the job done.  Enjoyed working with undergraduate and graduate students to assist them in adding and/or dropping classes.  Enjoyed assisting faculty with events and conferences. For the employee were always encouraged to take classes to learn new systems.  The hardest part of the job was making the student aware that the Examinations and Standing committee denied their case.This work is a  research based work. I have learned different aspects in robotics and artificial intelligence..The most challenging part is implementing algorithms on real robotic system.I enjoyed building intelligent systems and working with robotsI work in a research lab. The work is good, resources are top of the line, and people are always helpful. I would recommend it.Nice platform for pursuing career in Academia. Exceptional institute for higher education. Relative small number of students so the faculty:student ratio is high.Rice was a pleasure to work for.  The benefits and compensation are nice (for a post-doctoral position), and the staff in the Physics department were helpful and responsive.If you love outstanding scientific research, Rice University is the perfect place. The city of Houston is great and the campus is just minutes away from its cultural district. The library is the best I've ever been to. The laboratories are amazing!Rice University is an amazing place to work. It does carry about the employees. It does have amazing lectures given by famous people in their field. Health benefits are great and Rice university takes care of everything so one can focus on doing job well.Rice University is an awesome place to work.  I have enjoyed my years of service here but am ready learn other work environments which will enhance my skills and challenge my experience.","1,001 to 5,000",Houston,Houston,TX,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/8ebeaa12-b7c0-400d-86c4-e3b59d9ff7de?mescoid=1500140001001&jobPosition=21,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

55,5079.0,Senior Biostatistician,Cyberonics,2.8,19.0,"As Cyberonics, it was an excellent place to work.  Since becoming LivaNova, not so much.  New management structure and style significantly hurting morale.  Could impact success of the company over time.Totally dysfunctional management.  Total management management by intimidation.  Company does not recognize sales as the work horse.  Cut commissions to make a numberIn the past, this company was a fun place to work with a lot of ability to grow within your position.  In the past 5 or so years, the politics have really ruined a great place to work.  It was disappointing to see such a great company be overpowered by a few individuals who have too much control.  People fear for their jobs daily as they can be let go on the word of one person without the proper amount of research into the situation from the HR department.  In the past I would have highly recommended this company.There is a disconnect between the employees and management. Requirements were often not passed down or talked about between departments.Great Health Benefits and nice coworkers - super busy environment - great team building and training - an atmosphere driven by patient care and concernAttend clinics at my neurologists office and assist with diagnostic testing on the VNS devices in patients, as well as offer different dosing strategies to optimize efficacy with these patients. While in clinic, I must sell VNS to the neurologists and all the office staff in order to obtain patients that VNS will help. I then call the patients and schedule appointments with them. I educate/sell them on VNS therapy. Once I receive patient approval, I proceed to a surgeon's office and assist in setting up consults/OR dates for these patients. Once I set these dates, I proceed to the hospital and have the purchaser buy the necessary product at the price I have negotiated with them. I attend the surgery in order to run diagnostic testing to ensure the device was properly implanted, after which I contact the patients neurologist and schedule a 2 week follow up in order to have the device turned on.I took a quality job and relocated out of state. Things to watch-out for. Thier Quality organization has high turn over rate; either people quit or get fired. My predessor was fired after 10 years of service for poor performance, da! another fellow who was relocated from CA was fired after 1.5 years of service for poor performance. When they relocate you, they would get you to sign a contract that if you quit in 24 months, you owe them the relcoation money; unfair proposition, they sort of pass on all the risk to you. Thier style of management is micro type- top down; for 12 months, I averaged 12hours/day of work and when I expressed concern, I was told they were paying me more so they expect more. There is lack of medical device professionals in the area and so they mostly fill thier positions by relocating people out of the area or get H visa workers by promising them green card.Great organization allowing you to be creative, yourself and fun.  The product is amazing and ultimately we all get the opportunity to help improve the lives of our patients every day in the role we play with Cyberonics. The people are diverse, kind and helpful and I believe this is truly a great place to begin, grow or continue your career.A typical day at work is spent looking for a new job!I am learning nothing new while here.Lack of quality leadership/management at all levels of engineering.Most managers lead from behind--never making any decisions or providing guidance. Management moves you from project to project with no warning making it difficult to focus.Many good co-workers. Too few experienced people. Too many Ph.D's with no industry experience and a chip on their shoulder. Too many contractors with no ""skin in the game"".The hardest part of the job is to stay focused and positive in a backwards environment with too many meetings and distractions.The most enjoyable part of the job: For me, there is not one.Company as a whole does not know how to develop new products. They do not have the right mindset as they have never done it before as current product is over 10 years old. They are growing too fast with inexperienced leaders in too many key positions.Low tech electronics designs. Low tech manufacturing.""Meet the dates we'll fix it later"" mentality.Poor career choice for me, but I needed a pay check.I am a professional with 20 years experience who took a job with Cyberonics over a year ago. I am being passed on for promotions while being used as target practice by management for juniors to advance thier career. I have seen this happening to a few others around here as well. If you are 45 and over, kiss your career bye if you take a job in there.A typical day at work: is spent in planning meetings, filling out redundant documentation, and training on how to fill out this documentation.What I learned: I learned no new skills while employed at Cyberonics. It is a very boring job and my role and  responsibilities did not match the job description that I was hired for!Management: Young and inexperienced--to the point of being ineffective. No people skills--not a good people manager.Your co-workers: A lot of good people but a very cliquey atmosphere and culture. It's hard to fit in unless you already know someone that works there. Group to group interaction is poor. Too much ""us against them"" mentality. No sense of team work, even in your immediate group. The hardest part of the job: Figuring out what you are responsible to do. There are too many overlapping and undefined responsibilities group to group. I worked for a group manager and with several project managers. Each have a different idea of what my responsibilities are. The group manager never managed--too busy working on his own projects.The most enjoyable part of the job: None for me so I left. As an engineer there is just too much documentation and not enough engineering work. Things move at a VERY slow pace due to poor culture, lack of experienced people, and lack of resources. I simply did not research the company enough before I joined. The location is in the SE Houston I-45 Corridor. It's a VERY hard commute unless you live in the immediate area. Housing  costs in the immediate area are relatively high. Turn over is high depending  more... on the group. Departments do not work well together. It is a reactive organization which means poor or no planning. Small company with a  small company mentality--trying to present a facade of a mature well run company to drive up stock prices.No sense of job security:Big push to off shore manufacturing. Low tech product and manufacturing processes. No product diversity.  lessThe company overall does a good job trying to make employees happy. Job satisfaction varies department to department. Engineering and new product development in general is lacking. The company does not know how to develop new products nor has the culture or mindset to get it done. There are a lot of new hires that have never designed, developed, and launched a product into production. They do have masters degrees and PhD's but no real on the job experience. This is evident across the whole company and not just R&D. The existing products have been on the market for decades with only minor modifications. Their engineering and manufacturing processes are outdated. Interaction between groups is very difficult as responsibilities are overlapping and undefined. As with most organizations, the stock performance for next quarter is the most important goal. Product quality is an after thought. There also is job uncertainty in the future as manufacturing is moving off shore to Cost Rica. Who knows what other functions will follow... Definitely not a long term career choice by any means.A typical day at work is spent in meetings leaving little time to focus on tasks. Decisions are made by committee as most departments lack leadership with real experience. Project/Team meetings leave you frustrated and confused and are little more than a waste of time in most cases. Most people work on several projects that end up magnifying the problem. The only way to complete your tasks is to work 50 plus hours a week.I have learned nothing while at this company. In fact my skills are going to waste.  more... I no longer do anything technical that requires any thought or creativity. Often I feel I made a very poor career choice coming here.Overall lower level management it lacking due to inexperience. Mid-level management is just trying to hang on until retirement and upper level management is more concerned with boosting the stock price so they can cash in on their many stock options.Most co-workers are great. Due to the size of the company it can get very cliquey depending on what department you work in. So, you do need to watch your back.The hardest part of the job is trying to figure out what is expected of you day to day. It is also difficult to focus due to boredom.The most enjoyable part of the job is using the onsite gym.  lessA typical day at work is spent reviewing and creating documentation. Then training on how to do it and recreating it after the FDA audits.  I have learned that you spend an exponentially greater time ""properly"" documenting a new design than you actually get to spend designing it. Unfortunately, I have learned no new marketable skills while here.Upper management seems out of touch with what is really going on where as mid management is spread too thin to direct limited resources properly. This creates a lot of frustration when extra resources are promised but never a reality.Immediate Co-workers are great but all in all the company is very cliquey. Too little cooperation between departments. Always an ""Us against them"" environment. Too many inexperienced people in key roles.Chances of career growth are limited due to small product portfolio. It's all about who you know, not what you know which leads to inexperienced people in key roles that are unable to make a decision. The hardest part of the job is staying motivated due to boredom, too many meetings, and lack of interesting work. The most enjoyable part of the job is the rare opportunity when you actually get to perform design engineering work....and yes there is a ping pong table and on site work out room.Great workplace! The management is dedicated to providing an environment that is conducive of employee engagement and cohesiveness.Cyberonics is a good company to work for especially if you crave autonomy.  Challenges surround the fact that the company only has one product and it is very mature and not well received by many key opinion leaders.This position provided ample opportunities to work on a variety of projects.  The Legal Department also grew over time as the legal needs of the company grew.After the two week training period was over, the complaint flood gates opened up and all hell broke loose. I worked all day, everyday...seriously. I worked all day, everyday.Great company to work with. Manager, with a wrong attitude to sales people.Too many meetings for problem resolution. Procedures need to be streamlined to better minimize so many meetings.","501 to 1,000",Houston,Houston,TX,2016-11-03T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/53d61b04-9745-405c-b6df-35c6d378dc29?mescoid=1500153001001&jobPosition=23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

63,5087.0,Institute Assoc Scientist III,MD Anderson Cancer Center,4.1,259.0,"There really isn't a typical day in dining services, each day brings new opportunities to improve and learned new techniques. I really enjoy interacting with my co-workers to find new ways to be more cost effective.Currently working here now for the past 3 and a half years and I hate coming to work. The leadership is terrible, which trickles down to the employees. Its very hard to transfer to other areas, so Im basically stuck. I've been trying to move to other areas for 3 years, and cant even get an interview for positions I'm over qualified for.  Promotion from within is almost impossible...There is extreme favoritism. If your  not one of the ""teachers pets"" your days will be very challenging.  Whatever you do, dont go anywhere near the PBS dept. I really like the purpose and mission behind the work, but I just hate the environment. Unless your a doctor or scientist, I'd choose somewhere else to work.Management really does play favorites,and will go off hearsay, not actual facts.. They will go as far as making up things about you to find a reason to give you a hard time.They will deduct 100-200 dollars from your check for parking every month on top of the retirement they take from your check, that you cannot adjust. On top of that you will still end up walking a couple of blocks to get to work. Alot of backstabbing and untrustworthy people there. I wouldn't want to come back.A relatively fast paced work environment with many opportunities for connection and advancement. I learned much about cancer and the medical field in general. Management was decent but could be frustrating to communicate with at times - sometimes not seeming very receptive or accepting of feedback. Coworkers were good - worked with many caring people. The hardest part of the job was balancing the many many different tasks required at any given time within the constraints of an 8 hour day. Many days it felt like there simply are not enough hours in the day. Most enjoyable was helping patients.Great place to work and advance your career. Several opportunities to learn, gain new skills, and interact with experts in cancer.Managers show favortism and never hire African American  men. They will hire the women but never the men. They also give poor raises and they will barely advance from withinThe experience of working here for the past eight years has been rewarding. But financially I feel that I can do better elsewhere. Advancement wise I think that I can do better elsewhere. Supervisory staff falls a little short of being professional.LOVED THE WORK I DID HERE BUT THE MANAGEMENT WAS HORRIBLE. The most unprofessional group I've ever met. The played favoritism and i wasnt into that tupe of culture. I hated going to work with these people. E.V.E.R.Y.D.A.Y. The one  reason I lasted a year was because I felt the job I did made a difference in people's look lives.MD Anderson is a great company to start a career and retire from there too.  The benefits will make you want to stay with the company.  They have a good reimbursement program and the managers will work with your schedule if you're pursuing higher learning.The company is awesome but it lacked in leadership in some areas and resource skills that would drive the needs of the employee and organization to where it needed to go.The only thing about MD Anderson that is great is the benefits because you are working for the state.  The big issue is that if you are not a member of one of the races that are considered a minority (African American, Hispanic, Asian etc) you cannot get ahead in your career.  To be white at MD Anderson is a bad thing.  Also the management tends to play favorites, not being fair across the board with all employees.my 11 months working at md Anderson was horrible I dreaded coming in for work I would never have a assigned area and that was even after I made my 90 days. they where so unorganized they would have you doing stuff that wasn't even in the job description . I would never recommend anyone for this job nor any job at md Anderson. it was so racist and so divided pcps would get attitudes  as well as the nurse's  with the housekeepersPoor communication and no proper training program for new employees. Very poor management system. Would not listen or help me be successful. Group had terrible manners and did not try to include me. Group conversation was demeaning and negative. Employees made multiple mistakes but they were judged differently because they were already part of the group. No possible thought of ever being promoted.If you apply and get a position at MD Anderson it is a difficult place to get into first of all. Once you are in you would probably wish you hadn't. The co-workers are not very nice and the management plays favorites. I was there for 14 years and they worked hard to get rid of me. Watch your back and don't believe it when someone says they like you.MD Anderson is a great place to learn and grow as a nurse. The benefits and schedule are incomparable. The actual job of caring for cancer patients can be physically and emotionally exhausting, but is worth it if you truly enjoy what you do.MD Anderson was my very first job, that came with benefits, overtime and other career based amenities. It was the first time I was able to get a taste of the ""real world"" and its politics. MD Anderson motivated to return to school and finish my degree.I really enjoyed working here, this to is also very easy, and good money, plus they have really good benefits for you and your loved ones, its a great way to work.A typical day a work is cleaning office and clinic areas after closing time.  While working I learned how to properly clean a clinical facility.  The few months that I worked as a Building Attendant I. The job position and requirement were good I have no complaints. During the short stay on the job I experience 3 supervisors which gave me the notion that there is some unsteadiness in the management area. Why so many new supervisors in less than 3 months.  Co-workers no problems go along well with all co-workers.  The hardest part of the job to many changes of upper management.The most enjoyable part of the job lunch.This company is great to work for. Paid benefits, beautiful facilities including a fitness center, always providing continuing education.I found MD Anderson to be a thriving atmosphere where I was able to learn from coworkers, faculty and management. It's a place that cultivates its employees and encourages them to find their niche within the institution and work toward promotion. If it wasn't for the awful commute from Katy to the Med Center, I'd still be an employee there.The health care benefits are great. They offer tuition reimbursement which is important when trying to further your education. In general, a great place to work.","10,000+",Houston,Houston,TX,2015-12-08T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/ec983371-4b5d-4e2c-8220-eaeff9168c63?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=31,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

66,5090.0,"Staff Environmental Geologist (Houston, TX)","ERM Group, Inc.",3.4,53.0,"Partner oriented organization with a strong emphasis on billable hours, certifications and advancement. Very challenging and interesting work requiring a lot of international travel.This job was never meant to be a salaried position.  Work weeks would range from 40 hours a week to 90 hours a week, all while getting paid the same weekly rate.  The travel ranged from 50% to 80% based on the month.Working hard and doing the right thing isn't enough, you have to be willing to play the game.  Do not underestimate the power of politics.The management tries to addresss the low morale however, actions and words don't match.good experience. some work very interesting, other work not as interesting. no additional comments at this time. the experience likely outweighed the negativesMany projects with interesting work.  Opportunities abound with work. If you like to work and have no life outside of work, this is the place for you.  There was a tremendous variety of projects to work on.  Colleagues were there to help and share techniques to complete high quality jobs.  The hardest part of the job was working for a poor manager whose reputation was well known as someone who would make your life difficult if not miserable.  The best part of the job was when I was released from the position and no longer had to deal with the individual in question.Overall a fine place to work if you are a robot, lacking feelings and desire to do anything but work.  Additionally, since annual growth targets were unrealistic, firings and layoffs have become the norm.  Expect no understanding, mercy, or pity from this bunch of wolves.Tetra Tech was a great company to work for.  Work life balance was great.  Compensation was good and benefits as well.  Definitely miss the people and environment.  Always looked forward to going to the office.ERM was a great company to work for.  The people and overall culture was positive and a great atmosphere.  Great benefits and a great work life balance.The work day id between 8 am and 5 pm. One knows exactly what and how to do the work assigned. little room for creativity. Can be monotonous.The company has a set way of doing things and there is not verring from that.The hardest part is meeting the expectation of the different project managers.Used to be a fun place until Obama's war on coal. Smart workers but hard climate to work in. Co-workers are fun to work with.I really didn't enjoy my time at this company. The employees made me a little uncomfortable. There employees weren't too friendlyThis is a company that is trying to transition from a mid-sized company into a large one.  They really don't care much about anything other than what the spreadsheets say.  To that end, they have zero interest in employee development.  There is zero training and zero opportunities for advancement.  They hire outside the company for very nearly every position and don't even tell us they're looking for positions senior to our current level.  While I was there, they assigned EVERYBODY an ""employee level"" that basically just puts you in a specific box.  It's nearly impossible to climb out of that box and advance.I was there nearly 10 years and found that as time went on, they were doing everything possible to get rid of the long term employees and replace us with cheaper, disposable people who would stay for a couple years and then move on.""Leadership"" if you want to call it that, came from England.  They wanted no input from us colonists whatsoever and if we offered any, we were silenced almost immediately.Great company to work for and provides out of the box thinking to handle any size project. Use all the current up to date computer programs to maximize the design and turn around time to satisfy any client.ERM will remain the worst company I have worked for during my 20 years in the work force. I joined in 2007 and realized within a month that the office I belonged to had some serious issues. It was back in the ""Opco"" days when one ERM office would actually compete against another ERM office for profits and sometimes ignore common sense when delivering services to a client.Aside from the competitive nature of sales and MY client attitude, I joined a team who's leader told me ""you are in a different Opco"", I cannot help you..."". Needless to say, I did not speak to him ever after unless required to. in 2008-2009, ERM, globally, decided to ""address"" this counter productive issue and ""deployed"" a new strategy around ""collaboration""... Wow! What a giant step forward in recognizing this rotten environment! I thought the company would turn this around and work on getting new blood with a different mentality to offset the bad vibes often encountered within the office. It did not happen, 5 years later... Ended in the ""me, myself and I"" mode for over 7 years... As for the ""strategy"", ERM put all its eggs in the Oil and Gas and mining basket (recruiting, etc.). Fast forward to 2014/ 15, such markets have stalled and ERM is now leaking its wounds and looking at growth elsewhere... Maybe a diversified sector growth portfolio would have been wiser? Bottom line, stay away : poor strategy, poor leadership, poor knowledge sharing/ management, rotten work environment...Very typical corporate environment. Globally minded, empowering a revolving door of post graduate, energetic, youth. If travelling lifestyle is desirable to you, this is a great place to work.Very laid back friendly company to be a part of. There are many opportunities to volunteer on environmental projects as well as opportunities to interact with other employees out of the office.Fun workplace environment with great people, but the work was not as sustainability focused as I initially had hoped. Also, poor management and little to no mentorship. Easy to get ""pigeon-holed"" into work.It was a pleasure going to work everyday as my coworkers became good friends.  I developed a good relationship with my clients and even though the job was hard, I loved it because I like to be busy all the time. The hardest part of the job was working crazy hours during the end of the month closing.  The most enjoyable part was making new friends that until today we communicate.No good things to say about the Atlanta office with the exception of the presence of a hard working crew of staff scientistsLack of diversityUnethical practicesLow moraleDemoralizing business practices (requires billability exceeding 100%)Several of the best staff left due to poor people managementHuman resources lead at Atlanta office lacked integrityThey were understanding when things could not get done and they never expected too much from you. Great company, very humane.I would get in at 8 and be done no later than 5:30 (with an hour commute on each end).  I learned that ERM talks a good family game but refuses to consider that 5 day in the office meant 50+ hour work weeks.  Profit is the only motivator, and training was something that would be sacrificed for the almighty dollar.   The majority of the people that I worked with were dedicated professionals committed to their work.One caution:  if you thought that your experience and talents would provide you with an office or at least a cubicle, you are wrong.  ERM believes in an alienating model of open workspaces where there is no privacy or the ability to relax at your workstation, because you are in a situation to be surveilled at your workstation.  I have spoken to people leaving and turning down positions with ERM and that has been one of the largest issues working with this company.Some very nice people and the my coworkers are fantastic.  Chance for promotion and career development somewhat limited.",,Houston,Houston,TX,2016-11-17T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/ff3a16b5-a1f6-4165-a20e-1c82609b254f?mescoid=1900265001001&jobPosition=34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

76,5100.0,Reporting and Analytics Developer,Apache Corp,3.8,95.0,"I am very thankful to have had the opportunity to be a part of this corporation. I was a paid intern and I was very well treated by both co-workers and supervisors. Since I was an intern, I did have to do some of the heavy lifting, but I was more than happy to help as much as I could.I loved everything about my job with Apache! I would not have gotten this job if it were't for my dad knowing the main boss. Learned a lot about how the oilfield works.I gained very valuable and necessary knowledge as a new land professional. I was eager to come to work and apply myself in anyway that I could; eager to help or work for any division. The management was incredible and wanted to see each employee excel in their professional careers.Easy work daysHeavy Data EntryEasy TrainingGreat Upper ManagementGreat LocationGreat Job OpportunitiesCreated oil spreadsheets to help back up data systemGreat day bonus not enough training time, but they keep their family members employed and will let go of outsiders. Great pay, but not worth the amount of time you spend away from homeWork 40 hours a week assisting both remote sites and corporate headquarters with managing their records.Learned how to manage databases, manage records and design computing systems.Commuting to work.Being allowed to contribute in the determination of a technical solution to complex data issues.It was good while it lasted. Apache had great benefits and good people. Just like everyone else right now, reductions are going on.I loved working for Apache Corporation, they offered competitive salary with even better benefits! They offer flexible work schedule working 9 hour days Monday - Thursday and 4 hours on Friday, no weekends with very little overtime and traveling. I hate that Apache closed their Tulsa office.They made you feel like it was a family, everyone was important to the end game.  No matter if you were bottom or top the company gave the impression of carringApache Oil and Gas is an excellent company that appreciates a contrarian spirit and hardworking employees.  The employees are a wide range of ages with excellent communication and teamwork skills.Hold Meeting with the crews to inform them of activities the night crew was doing.  Learned how to lead crews with a positive attitude.Management backed me with the decisions I made.  Learning to lead a crew without having to yell and scream.  Teaching people the right way to perform a job task.Allowed me to grow my career in the oil and gas industry, put a lot of trust in my skills and sent me to training as needed. Very good place to workIn my first 18 months I had 6 different managers to which I had to report. They constantly pushed for more work while handing out minimal compensation.Was only there short time but all in all very good place and environment to work. I was transferred before I got started. Others I know love it.Tulsa office was closed after being an active and viable part of the community for 60 years.  I worked for Apache Corporation for 32 plus years and loved my tenure there.  The workplace was like an extended family, including employees, and vendors we dealt with.  The office closure was like a death.They are very friendly to their employees and the contractors who support them. The management team is laid back. Nothing else to add about them, please ask if you want more information.90% of the co-workers are easy to get along with and communicate to.  The hardest part of the job was to get the operators to send you monthly or even daily platform reports.  over all a good company to work for.Great people and good atmosphere to be around. Each job presents its own challenge. Get to work along beside some great folks who have great knowledge in what they do. I get to share what I know with them while training them on how to troubleshoot problems with controls for water systems and teach them what to look for when problems arise.overall a great place to work,compensation and benefits are awesome. work environment varies by office but overall is pretty positiveI was a contractor while at Mariner.  Apache hired me as a full time employee and provided me many opportunities for advancement.My day usually started with a safety meeting. Afterwards i would walk around the refinery and make sure all JSA's were filled out and signed by every employee. The hardest part of my day was firing people for working unsafe and dealing with unexpected injuries.","1,001 to 5,000",Houston,Houston,TX,2016-10-18T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/587a2ac4-aa0e-4242-b846-a2cc9e50b3fd?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Great culture where teamwork was encouraged and was something that people thrived on.some of the people were nice, but departments were often unorganized with some people doing the work of a few. I found it difficult to deal with constantly being told I was getting a raise (up to regular starting wage!) if I would do this or that, and once I had upheld my end of the deal, they totally forgot about my raise.Family cultureDedicated to their employees and customersLongevityDecent compensation packageGreat co-workersManagement was empatheticCo-workers were a great bunch.

Management and co-workers are great.  The hardest part of the job is being away from family for weeks at a time and 14 to 16 hour work days.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being off work for two weeks at a time.Fun work environment, very easy going management, always room for improvement And advancement. I loved my job! Probably best one I've ever had!There are many good things about this company: they take early career training very seriously and their early career program is one of the best of the industry.Corp Tax days are long & hectic with many deadlines.Tax Sr. Leadership & Management lack empathy & proper communication regarding their subordinates.

I also participated and led safety briefings as well as identified safety hazards at work sites.Management was efficient considering the distances between locations and very hands on. As with any job some co workers were positive and upbeat while others could have very unsafe working styles. The hardest part of the job was the amount of time spent seated on location. The part I enjoyed most was being outdoors often and the sweeping landscapes of the North Dakota Badlands.will be doing daily audits, ordering.had to be on your  best with employees stealing,calling in sick.the Management would come in put on demands for me the manager they would yell at you in front of customers or whom ever was in the storeWorking for Hess corporation allowed my opportunities for growth.
