34,5058.0,"Intern, Land GIS Analyst 2017",ConocoPhillips,4.1,544.0,"I had a fantastic ConocoPhillips work experience. I elected for the severance and everything was nicely timed. The management was very disappointing but I got to work on big projects and was compensated well.I felt like the stress of the job was largely artificial. I didn't work very hard but definitely harder than my peers and was able to get 2 ratings and one 1 rating.Managers dont care about employees anymore. it was a struggle for everyone cutting throats for their jobs. Used to be a great place to work. since the oil price dropped, thats all in the past.Benefits are horrible but the management in the southeastern New Mexico is wonderful. Company as a whole has some issues.  It doesn't pay very well they start out out at the very bottom and it's very hard to get a raise and very hard to promote. They need to promote people who have ambition to move up and learn more don't hold someone down.There are a lot of great people to work with here but the bureaucracy makes it difficult to push big projects to completion and have a big impact.There is not always great interaction between the different business functions and groups try to make themselves look good instead of looking for what is best for the company.Traffic control - Logging in/out scale traffic - Inspect of all cars/trucks.As for management - Their skill and experience are not strong. ..........Past tense..it was a good company. Senior management will not run it like a large independent oil and gas corporation, that it is. Its not Exxon...don't try to run it like it is, quit comparing the company to Exxon, Chevron, BP & shell...Great co-workers. Great benefits. The company is pretty large for an independent, so I would expect more layoffs in the near future until the company is more in line with the size of peer companies.The management team is great and they are doing their best to keep open communication as the industry is in its downturn.  The co-workers bring this pace to life and are a joy to be around.Like any major in the O&G space, they are working hard to manage the downturn in the industry.  Given the right job in the right management team, COP is a good place to work.ConocoPhillips gave me the opportunity to expand my experience as a Cost Control Specialist. I had the opportunity to travel and work with people from different countries and cultures and was able to support them gaining the recognized expertise in multicultural relations.The managers have an open door policy and are willing to listen and assist if possible. The people are also great! I came in with a learning curve having been in Higher Education and the help I received was great!Oil and gas prices required continued workforce reductions.Obtained extensive knowledge of managing employees, budgets and projects.Obtained extensive knowledge of Land, both surface and mineral.Long hours/dangerous work in the Oil Field/not for everyone/work outdoors in extreme heat and or cold. Not much family time/can be called on to work weekends as well/pays reasonably wellIf market is good all is fine - downturn mens layoffs which happened in '15 & '16. I retired before that happened in June 2016during layoff period office environment became toxic - ""throwing people under the Bus"" - Blame game - heavy office politicsGreat support from coworkers.  I learned a lot about the economics in the oil and gas industry.  Management seemed to take a great interest in employees.Great company if you want to develop yourself professionally as a new hire, but unfortunately the company has not been managed well since the spin-off from PSX in 2012. The company mismanaged their costs and their capital discipline during the lead up to the crash in prices in 2015, which has resulted in massive layoffs and earning losses. The company retains a few good assets that are competitive and will enable them to keep their doors open for a long time. The company touts itself as an independent (nimble) E&P company, but it's unfortunately held back by the top-down management and gridlock bureaucracy.I enjoyed my tenure at ConocoPhillips. The folks I work for and with were largely top-notch individuals with solid skill sets. My Business Unit was unique in that it seemed to always attract quality team players who enjoyed the basin we worked and the results we achieved. It is unfortunate that market volitility had such a deleterious affect on the industry as a whole. In the end, the bonus outcome is that many of us get an opportunity to re-invent ourselves (in my case, again).ConocoPhillips is a good place to work if the price of Oil is high. They have a difficult time forecasting and managing the business If the oil price is low.Work there for 19 years and really have nothing good to say about the company other than meeting some really good people. I lost my job to some low life that never came to work and spent the last 11 months doing his job out in the field.our work is hard but we enjoy it my team work is goodand everybody work together management is oksupervisor stay on top of everything and work with us on any issuesOverall people are nice and pay is good but going through a down cycle due to low energy commodity prices.... maybe a good time to join if you are a contrarian.As a college student they market their ""Engineering Academy"" as a great training program, however it's just virtual training classes and computer based learning. It is helpful, but definitely not what I would call a great training program. Also, the company needs to make up its mind if it is going to be an independent or a major.","10,000+",Houston,Houston,TX,2016-08-24T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/dc1deff9-d43a-41ce-9717-ec766e53c898?mescoid=1500140001001&jobPosition=2,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
