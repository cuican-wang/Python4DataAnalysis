8,5032.0,Radiation Physicist II  MSLH Cancer Center,Houston Methodist,4.2,790.0,"I would arrive at work at 8:30 and immediately do send outs for the daily courier to take to another hospital.  I would answer phones for the pathologists and do clerical work as well as some transcription when the full time transcriptionist was not available or needed help.  My co-workers were very supportive and helpful. It felt like we were a family, including management.  The hardest part of the job was learning all the different things I had to do and adapting to the changes in policy that would occasionally happen.Contacting the doctor to inform him of hospital call and checking with interns on stats.Learning all the various aspects of psychological problems that individual could have. Learning that prominent figures were actually being treated for psychological problems.  Actually management is this position was the best hands on experience I had. The doctor was very interested in making sure I understood this aspect of medicine and each client needed special care. I was taught to take every phone call seriously because the clients were very fragile.I appreciated every aspect of this position.I enjoy my job everyday I came to work I wish I still work for this company Great management Good co-workers  Family/friendly place to workVery well organized and handled the best way it wants to be handled. ICARE is the main thing to always think as you are with patients.The benefits and pay are great, but the work/life balance is terrible. Also management is awful and everything done there through them is based on politics and who they like and don't like. They make your life and job difficult if you're not favored by leadership. HR is not to be trusted either nor half the people that work in the radiology department. Typical day is usually always busy with the occasional slow day, hardest part is dealing with management and their expectations. Most enjoyable part is the some of the people that you get to work with and having a starbucks on site.The charge nurse would make sure we got breaks. Floor manager very in tune with what was going on, on the floor. I learned to work on committees in working toward a solution to a specific problem. My co-workers were mostly independent in working by themselves. The hardest part of my job was seeing patients in pain that could not be controlled. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing patients come in debilitated and able to walk out on their own at discharge.Amazing work environment. ON the job training is very effective and employees are considered family. I learned the importance of hand hygiene and patient safety.A typical day for me begins a 6:30a.m. meeting and greeting patients and family members assisting demographic part of their clinic visit. .Over the last 3 years I have learned so much about the transplant process.The hardest part about my job was working under staffed for a fast expending transplant clinic.The most enjoyable part was seeing the faces on patients faces that come out of the transplant process healthy with their new organs.Very different get to know different people.like doctors nurses physical therapists people.Getting to know what they jobs duties are overall great place to work for love the bonus we get every 3 months love the environment friendly people,patients meeting patients family member overall love working for Houston MethodistStart with 4 to 5 acute/chronic patients. Perform full assessment on my assigned patients. Perform all physicians orders for patients. Update daily care plans with patients participation. Work in collaboration with charge nurse to meet patient's needs. Most enjoyable part of my job is when positive results or a life is saved from given out best nursing care and acting promptly to any changes in patients' condition.The hardest part of my job is when i am not able to get immediate response to further provide care for my patientsVery good rate of pay. Can be fast pace but great work helps a lot.Easy to pick up shifts and easy work with call policy only use it very need to call off. Union employeeI enjoyed working at J C Penny in the childrens dept... I was well acquainted with the customers and was always recognized for my amazing customer service skills by the leadership team.* Face to face interaction with patients and family* Handles charts of patients* Schedules appointments* Assistance to nurses, physicians, patients and family, visitors, and otherThis job can be overwhelming at times and frustrating. Little to no team work. The supervisors have no respect and dont really want to work with you unless they like you. Its a lot of drama even with the supervisors.I have a bachelor degree but was stuck in an entry level job. The director of my department seemed paranoid and very accusatory. I was thankful that she didn't come around often.Over the years at Houston Methodist I enjoyed the people that I had a pleasure of working with on a day to day basis. We worked as a ""TEAM"" to get the job done day in and out. Management stayed on top of us to make sure that our job was being done in the best and most safe way possible. The hardest part of my job was leaving. I had no real complaints because I worked with people who knew what there job was and did it as such. If ever a problem we could all talk to each other fix the issue and continue with our daily work with no problems. The most enjoyable part of my job was that we communicated very well with each other and made everyday a fun day.Did not like working there. .no yeam work..system is not fair dealing with co workers and supervisor..i am looking for another job that better suits me.Intense environment. High patient load, Good team, but high turnover. Stressful but it is what you make it. Nice community hospital that typically getting slammed.Good place to work; you can learn a lot working here. Good work life balance. Coworkers are kind. Pretty solid benefits working for a hospital. Ranked the best hospital in Texas.Enjoy working with team.  Assignments to medical or surgical units.Management available for support and assistance, always positive.Co-workers a joy to be with.Hardest part  of job would be coordinating multiple physician groups to accomplish best outcomes for patients.Working with teams on units, nurses, respiratory therapists, social workers, physical and occupational therapyGood culture and they take care of their employees. One issues is if you want to create change it takes a very very long change if it ever happens.","10,000+",Houston,Sugar Land,TX,2016-11-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/fda80b13-9c6a-4902-9e17-5316b0386afd?mescoid=1900257001001&jobPosition=3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
