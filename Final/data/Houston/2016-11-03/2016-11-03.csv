55,5079.0,Senior Biostatistician,Cyberonics,2.8,19.0,"As Cyberonics, it was an excellent place to work.  Since becoming LivaNova, not so much.  New management structure and style significantly hurting morale.  Could impact success of the company over time.Totally dysfunctional management.  Total management management by intimidation.  Company does not recognize sales as the work horse.  Cut commissions to make a numberIn the past, this company was a fun place to work with a lot of ability to grow within your position.  In the past 5 or so years, the politics have really ruined a great place to work.  It was disappointing to see such a great company be overpowered by a few individuals who have too much control.  People fear for their jobs daily as they can be let go on the word of one person without the proper amount of research into the situation from the HR department.  In the past I would have highly recommended this company.There is a disconnect between the employees and management. Requirements were often not passed down or talked about between departments.Great Health Benefits and nice coworkers - super busy environment - great team building and training - an atmosphere driven by patient care and concernAttend clinics at my neurologists office and assist with diagnostic testing on the VNS devices in patients, as well as offer different dosing strategies to optimize efficacy with these patients. While in clinic, I must sell VNS to the neurologists and all the office staff in order to obtain patients that VNS will help. I then call the patients and schedule appointments with them. I educate/sell them on VNS therapy. Once I receive patient approval, I proceed to a surgeon's office and assist in setting up consults/OR dates for these patients. Once I set these dates, I proceed to the hospital and have the purchaser buy the necessary product at the price I have negotiated with them. I attend the surgery in order to run diagnostic testing to ensure the device was properly implanted, after which I contact the patients neurologist and schedule a 2 week follow up in order to have the device turned on.I took a quality job and relocated out of state. Things to watch-out for. Thier Quality organization has high turn over rate; either people quit or get fired. My predessor was fired after 10 years of service for poor performance, da! another fellow who was relocated from CA was fired after 1.5 years of service for poor performance. When they relocate you, they would get you to sign a contract that if you quit in 24 months, you owe them the relcoation money; unfair proposition, they sort of pass on all the risk to you. Thier style of management is micro type- top down; for 12 months, I averaged 12hours/day of work and when I expressed concern, I was told they were paying me more so they expect more. There is lack of medical device professionals in the area and so they mostly fill thier positions by relocating people out of the area or get H visa workers by promising them green card.Great organization allowing you to be creative, yourself and fun.  The product is amazing and ultimately we all get the opportunity to help improve the lives of our patients every day in the role we play with Cyberonics. The people are diverse, kind and helpful and I believe this is truly a great place to begin, grow or continue your career.A typical day at work is spent looking for a new job!I am learning nothing new while here.Lack of quality leadership/management at all levels of engineering.Most managers lead from behind--never making any decisions or providing guidance. Management moves you from project to project with no warning making it difficult to focus.Many good co-workers. Too few experienced people. Too many Ph.D's with no industry experience and a chip on their shoulder. Too many contractors with no ""skin in the game"".The hardest part of the job is to stay focused and positive in a backwards environment with too many meetings and distractions.The most enjoyable part of the job: For me, there is not one.Company as a whole does not know how to develop new products. They do not have the right mindset as they have never done it before as current product is over 10 years old. They are growing too fast with inexperienced leaders in too many key positions.Low tech electronics designs. Low tech manufacturing.""Meet the dates we'll fix it later"" mentality.Poor career choice for me, but I needed a pay check.I am a professional with 20 years experience who took a job with Cyberonics over a year ago. I am being passed on for promotions while being used as target practice by management for juniors to advance thier career. I have seen this happening to a few others around here as well. If you are 45 and over, kiss your career bye if you take a job in there.A typical day at work: is spent in planning meetings, filling out redundant documentation, and training on how to fill out this documentation.What I learned: I learned no new skills while employed at Cyberonics. It is a very boring job and my role and  responsibilities did not match the job description that I was hired for!Management: Young and inexperienced--to the point of being ineffective. No people skills--not a good people manager.Your co-workers: A lot of good people but a very cliquey atmosphere and culture. It's hard to fit in unless you already know someone that works there. Group to group interaction is poor. Too much ""us against them"" mentality. No sense of team work, even in your immediate group. The hardest part of the job: Figuring out what you are responsible to do. There are too many overlapping and undefined responsibilities group to group. I worked for a group manager and with several project managers. Each have a different idea of what my responsibilities are. The group manager never managed--too busy working on his own projects.The most enjoyable part of the job: None for me so I left. As an engineer there is just too much documentation and not enough engineering work. Things move at a VERY slow pace due to poor culture, lack of experienced people, and lack of resources. I simply did not research the company enough before I joined. The location is in the SE Houston I-45 Corridor. It's a VERY hard commute unless you live in the immediate area. Housing  costs in the immediate area are relatively high. Turn over is high depending  more... on the group. Departments do not work well together. It is a reactive organization which means poor or no planning. Small company with a  small company mentality--trying to present a facade of a mature well run company to drive up stock prices.No sense of job security:Big push to off shore manufacturing. Low tech product and manufacturing processes. No product diversity.  lessThe company overall does a good job trying to make employees happy. Job satisfaction varies department to department. Engineering and new product development in general is lacking. The company does not know how to develop new products nor has the culture or mindset to get it done. There are a lot of new hires that have never designed, developed, and launched a product into production. They do have masters degrees and PhD's but no real on the job experience. This is evident across the whole company and not just R&D. The existing products have been on the market for decades with only minor modifications. Their engineering and manufacturing processes are outdated. Interaction between groups is very difficult as responsibilities are overlapping and undefined. As with most organizations, the stock performance for next quarter is the most important goal. Product quality is an after thought. There also is job uncertainty in the future as manufacturing is moving off shore to Cost Rica. Who knows what other functions will follow... Definitely not a long term career choice by any means.A typical day at work is spent in meetings leaving little time to focus on tasks. Decisions are made by committee as most departments lack leadership with real experience. Project/Team meetings leave you frustrated and confused and are little more than a waste of time in most cases. Most people work on several projects that end up magnifying the problem. The only way to complete your tasks is to work 50 plus hours a week.I have learned nothing while at this company. In fact my skills are going to waste.  more... I no longer do anything technical that requires any thought or creativity. Often I feel I made a very poor career choice coming here.Overall lower level management it lacking due to inexperience. Mid-level management is just trying to hang on until retirement and upper level management is more concerned with boosting the stock price so they can cash in on their many stock options.Most co-workers are great. Due to the size of the company it can get very cliquey depending on what department you work in. So, you do need to watch your back.The hardest part of the job is trying to figure out what is expected of you day to day. It is also difficult to focus due to boredom.The most enjoyable part of the job is using the onsite gym.  lessA typical day at work is spent reviewing and creating documentation. Then training on how to do it and recreating it after the FDA audits.  I have learned that you spend an exponentially greater time ""properly"" documenting a new design than you actually get to spend designing it. Unfortunately, I have learned no new marketable skills while here.Upper management seems out of touch with what is really going on where as mid management is spread too thin to direct limited resources properly. This creates a lot of frustration when extra resources are promised but never a reality.Immediate Co-workers are great but all in all the company is very cliquey. Too little cooperation between departments. Always an ""Us against them"" environment. Too many inexperienced people in key roles.Chances of career growth are limited due to small product portfolio. It's all about who you know, not what you know which leads to inexperienced people in key roles that are unable to make a decision. The hardest part of the job is staying motivated due to boredom, too many meetings, and lack of interesting work. The most enjoyable part of the job is the rare opportunity when you actually get to perform design engineering work....and yes there is a ping pong table and on site work out room.Great workplace! The management is dedicated to providing an environment that is conducive of employee engagement and cohesiveness.Cyberonics is a good company to work for especially if you crave autonomy.  Challenges surround the fact that the company only has one product and it is very mature and not well received by many key opinion leaders.This position provided ample opportunities to work on a variety of projects.  The Legal Department also grew over time as the legal needs of the company grew.After the two week training period was over, the complaint flood gates opened up and all hell broke loose. I worked all day, everyday...seriously. I worked all day, everyday.Great company to work with. Manager, with a wrong attitude to sales people.Too many meetings for problem resolution. Procedures need to be streamlined to better minimize so many meetings.","501 to 1,000",Houston,Houston,TX,2016-11-03T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/53d61b04-9745-405c-b6df-35c6d378dc29?mescoid=1500153001001&jobPosition=23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
