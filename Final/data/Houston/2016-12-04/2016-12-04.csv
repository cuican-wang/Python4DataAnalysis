42,5066.0,Research Scientist,"Limited Brands, Inc.",3.9,336.0,"Working in sales for Limited Brands, Victoria's Secret has had many pro's and cons, unfortunately it is very difficult to soley rely on this job as a source of income, and with the daily pressures applied and goals that are set for each employee, they do not neccisarly give you the pay / oppurtunities / hours you would expect.In the time I worked for the company they pushed there company values on you since day one. These are values the company doesn't really stuck by. There is a lot of favoritism and workplace harassment in Saftey Services and I'm sure other departments. For a supervisor to be able to hit a employee is unacceptable and joking or not do it on two separate occasions. The company then punishes you for reporting the supervisor because they stick with management. When ever is this behavior ever acceptable in corporate america?Managers played favorites which led to high attrition rates; co-workers were great though. Customers were difficult to please and a lot of them, even after recommendations, wouldn't buy anything which reflects negatively on you as an associate(Even if they aren't based on commissions). One manager specifically said I was going to be working register and then decided I would be better at 'loss prevention' and decided to cancel a shift because I didnt have enough cashier experience for it.(I wonder why)I have loved working for Victoria's Secret. They want their associates to be happy where they are at and gives chances to really grow your career with the company. They're always up and changing (while doing so, they're always keeping you up to date and making sure you've done the training that you may need) so you learn so many different skills while working there.The management is great and supportive of their associates. They take opinions and concerns and usually act on them. Everyone that I've worked with has always been positive and caring for one another.A typical day at work is  problem solving, meetings, project management, finance meeting.  I manage projects from beginning phase to material arriving on-site. I have learned so much in position, but the overall arching skill set  that I have obtained is problem solving.  I have learned how to not only recognize problems but how to proactively seek them out!  As well as understand all parties that affected by the problem and bring 3 solutions to assist in resolving these problems.My management is very strong and supportiveThe hardest part of my job,  is that there are not enough hours in the day to get everything completed that I want to get completedThe most enjoyable part of my job is the completion of my projects and seeing actual stores that I have worked on opennice warehouse job, the hardest thing about the job is standing for 10 hours at a time. The other workers stay to their selves allowing you to work and focus on your assigned task.I learned great sales experience while working for the company L Brands in their Victoria's Secret store! Management is very motivating to reach sales goals.I have learned a lot working in a small Ecommerce team at La Senza. I have experienced great leadership, whom has taught me how to grow within my position. I love working on photo shoot sets for the Ecommerce team and help produce great product for our site.management needs to have more interaction with employees instead of having all decisions made by the employees in dc who look to them for guidance not wait until it goes wrong then place blame.A great place to work! As a long time employee, it was a great place to grow as well. A typical day could be non-stop meetings....I learned a lot about ITIL, Disaster Recovery and many more of the skills I consider to be some of my strongest  while at LimitedbrandsEvery employees, co-workers as well as team leaders and supervisors were nice and friendly. I would recommend all to give a try at this company. Pay rate is good, company benefit are also good.A good paying job that has many different roles one may apply for. Sometimes a bit tedious, but you are rewarded for hard work and a willingness to learn.I love being a part of the LBrands family and am proud to work there.  It's an exciting and creative place to work.  Love how involved they are with giving back to the communities.Wish they had a gym though.They mainly hire seasonal but if you get hired on, the pay and benefits are really good. Very clean facility and management takes care of the issues if found.A good Place to work on your people skills. Always work to be done on the floor or in the back. Employees compete to raise there own personal SPA (your sales).In general L Brands is a wonderful and exciting place to work.  Unfortunately leadership varies through out the company, you just have to hope you have good leadership in whichever department you work for.I submitted my resume with a degree and they placed me in a department where my job is to fold dirty laundry to be sold back to the customerJob functions vary from day-to-day, and there is never a dull moment.  Depending on location, managers can be accountable for anywhere from 10-50 employees.I would recommend LBrands to most anyone.  The company values and fundamentals are prevalent.  Leadership development is a focus.Been working with L Brands for a few years, some parts of the business are great, others not so much. Layoffs have now happened 2 times in 3 years.I enjoyed my contract with LB, the culture was very friendly and within a few weeks, I was completely used to the decor of the place (rather non-conservative)","10,000+",Houston,Houston,TX,2016-12-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/3f7c6f27-29cd-4dc3-a211-10b4ffefe5bb?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
