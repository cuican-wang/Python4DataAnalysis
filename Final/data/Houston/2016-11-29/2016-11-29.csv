23,5047.0,Toxicologist III,Harris County,3.8,74.0,"I liked working with the public. Never had any problems with management. No problems with coworkers pretty enjoyable job over all.If I could return to work here, I would! The ONLY reason why I did not maintain employment here was out of both my and their hands.I learned a great deal, and it was an incredible experience. Everyone was really knowledgeable and efficient in their day to day. I would recommend anyone work here if given the opportunity.A typical day at work came with long lines, upset customers, screaming babies, and continuously having to explain to customers why their paperwork couldn't be processed. I learned not to buy a vehicle from just any car dealership. The hardest part of the job was the short breaks and even shorter lunches.Every day is something new, and there's no way you can prepare for it. Management has been there for years and they play play favoritism. The pay is not that great .You can do what ever you want at this job. Once you re hired on it is very hard to get fired from here. A lot of people trying to get ahead and will do anything to get aheadThis place is extremely unprofessional! Management is a joke. It's impossible for you to grow here. They have a flexible work schedule but most of my time here has been spent surfing the Internet. NO WORK TO DO. Didn't learn anything here. The pay is ok. Vacation and sick days or comp time must be used for natural disasters or building closure issues. No short or long term disability. THEY DO NOT PAY FOR EMPLOYEE PARKING EVEN THOUGH THEY OWN MOST OF THE PARKING GARAGES IN DOWNTOWN. I've been on a wait list for a parking spot for two years now. You must provide your own forks, knives, spoons, plates, napkins AND water!Filing mail, answering phone calls/emails. Seeing client's, making home visits, and frequent court visits to discuss client's status while on supervision.If you're a multi-tasker, this is a great job for you, which was a great job for me.  I enjoyed being the bookkeeper and also working as retention of volunteers.  The folks in the office are hard working , dedicated people who do not work for the $$ but for the best interest of the volunteers.a typical day at work was to be able to make my customers as comfortable as possible. Being that they were at the tax office bothered a lot of individuals, and was always making sure they left with a smile on their face.i'd rather not comment on management.My co workers were somewhat great, the hardest part of my job was rejecting customers because they didn't have the correct documents for their transactions.Over worked, and made to do double shift at the last minute. Some coworkers think they are the  Captain. People are constantly in your personal life. The pay is not is not good, but you may never have a life outside of the agency. Too many cases. May not get home until 9:00 or ten at night. Run!A typical job as a Forensic Investigator Assistant or Forensic Investigator III would vary from day to shift, now day is the same. Some days you might be in the office answering phones, but 99.9% of the times the job requires you to go either alone or with another coworker to pick up bodies at hospital, scenes like highways, freeways, houses, under bridges, under trains, automobile accidents, bayous, airports, plane crashes, boats, lakes, you name it!! The ones no many people like are decomposing bodies, specially if it is inside a hoarder's house in the summer, children, and floaters or drawing etc... The difficulty of the job is when the deceased is heavy and you have to carry the body down the stairs, from attics, roof, so many weird places. It's difficult to explain everything in a short paragraph. The position for Assistants are pretty much picking bodies, triage calls and other morgue related duties. FI III take photos of certain scenes and have to do what Assistants do. Assistant's make around (14+/HR), Fi III around (16+/HR). Fi II are the ones that go to scenes with Assistants and Fi III, but Fi II only take photos and write the reports and make around ($18+/HR). If you are skinny, you might not want to apply for Assistant or Fi III, they are usually big people that do the job because of the amount of lifting required, like some said: this is a muscle job.Benefits? Aetna provides health insurance and it's free for you, no overtime is paid, instead they accumulate that, and if you ever resign, you receive a big check if you have a lot of comp. Time. Raises are very  more... bad, pretty much pennies a year. PD: make sure before you apply that you will stand seeing dead people in many different ways, decomposing, hanging, dawning, chopped into pieces, and so many unthinkable ways to die. Be prepare to stand odors, the heat, the cold, the rain, etc.. Don't think you're going to be working under the rain with an umbrella. It's a dirty position, but rewarding for some.  lessHarris County is a nice place to work if you are attempting to get your foot in the door with gaining work experience. The culture of the department is very family-oriented. The sense of family makes the fast paced work and deadline driven obligations of the job bearable.Great county, but lacks affordable housing, has good schools and great people. However, county commission reluctant to take on hard issues and pay employees,  Certain commissioners micro manage and harass employees.Work consist of having a good understanding of HUD rules and regulation. Must be able to multi-task and have a good working relationship with grant recipients.Great place to work at while in school. Awesome work environment. It is always fun and time goes by fast. Great food, competitive pay. hardest part is working holidays and too many customers to deal with at the same time.Working have Harris County has been some of the worst experience ever. Management is extremely inconsistent always making up policy as they see fit, they don't care about their employees it's impossible to try to move up or to another department without having the ""politics"" in the way. Working in detention it's like of the employees are the real criminals because they're out they aren't looking at the residents/inmates, they're constantly looking at us to see what type of errors we make and not trying to tell us to rectify it more like trying to find a way to fire us. Morale is completely blow upper management and administration can do stuff like call in or what have you and when lower employees to do the same we get penalized and have consequences to face. Just like when they were recently on the news none of upper adman had consequences to face only lower workers which is completely unfair.This job requires someone who can work in a fast paced environment and able to complete tasks with minimal supervision. Attention to detail and whereabouts. As a Screen Technician you are required to go through training and being on time is a requirement. It requires attention to detail and ability to maintain total security of information obtained. You work alongside law enforcement and other government agencies and officials. Co workers are there to complete the same job you are, therefore don't expect training to be something just taught. All senses will be used in this field.Low morale within office.. Petty arguements cause larger issues. Employee Over sensitivity causes workplace uncomfortableness.First employee to become Lead Clerk 3 months after training. Quick learnerGreat customer serviceGreat way to meet attorneyGreat people and excellent benefits virtually no job growth this place is perfect for people at a latter stage in life that desire no promotions or increase in salary.
