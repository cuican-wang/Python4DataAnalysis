18,5042.0,US Houston: Predictive Modeling Data Scientist,Halliburton,3.9,3100.0,"The people are great and work/life balance is good. Job security is very poor. Houston management is very removed from what the company actually does.This was my first offshore job was very interesting and fun to learn new skills. i have many certifications and got to fly in helicopters pretty often best part of the job was the flights for freeGreat benefits and plenty of room for advancement. There are many jobs all over the world. They are fair and willing to train for any job and transfer to any location.Halliburton is a good way to start a career in the oilfield.  They helped me get my CDL with Hazmat and payed for it all.  I would recommend Halliburton if you are wanting to go into the oilfield.The job is challenging and there is a lot to offer. but there is no room for family they are your family, so if one is married like i am it strains ones marriage and  alone kids time. but the money is good. so one must learn to balance work with family.  hard to do!Halliburton as always been a great company to work for.  The people are great and the management is great.  There are several classes Halliburton offers and really help with the changing of the oil and gas industry.I learned the jig plant and how to operate the loader I was a leadman It could have been more better managementworking in the snow was the hardest part of this job100+ hour work weeks. Outdoors. The hardest part of the job was staying awake for so long. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new and interesting people.I really enjoyed working for Halliburton, learned a lot and had many opportunities that I took advantage of.  On the job travel to Africa and Brazil.  I was laid off May, 2016.learned a lot about oilfield procedures and values. grew as a person and learned a lot about myself and how far I could push myself.Job was pretty easy just a lot of time away from my family.  A lot of travel time and never home for the holidays.  Pay rate was one of the lowest in the area but you made a good living due to the fact that the average work week was about 85 hours or moreIs relaxed environment.Most people speak and are kind.I am looking because I need more of a challenge. The campus is beautifulI've learned many things but am looking to learn more.good work place always on the move working and being productive big on safety and always advancing towards safe and productive workOverall a good company to work for. The people where great and helped me transition to civilian life it made it easier for me because I still had a brother hood and we all worked together as one team just like the Marine corps.Erratic work schedule. Never knew when i was leaving or coming back. The actual job was easy just not knowing when i was leaving made it very hardThe work is hard and is a long hours, on land had to stay up 30 hours multiple times, offshore had to stay up 54 hours, and get little sleep at both. The people you work with make it all worth while because they help each other on the crew. Halliburton is mostly about the company and not your life style, what I mean by this is that you hardly have a life while working for this company. The money is good but running and maintaining the multi million dollar equipment makes the job a little better. As with any other job as long as you work and don't hide you can improve your position and move up in the company.They had a very good culture and great learning experience. Made a lot of friends and worked in a good environment. Most of the skills that I know today have come from the hard work that I have done learning and this company.Halliburton is a great place to learn about the oil and gas industry. There are many opportunities available at Halliburton locations around the world.I liked the company goals and culture. A change in pay and facility(management)  prompted me to seek other means of employment. Enjoyed my time at the company and would work there again.Overall the company was good to work at.  It has a very good life center and cafeteria.  They are big on safety at the workplace.The job itself was good u get to work on new and old cars that came through the shop. The pay was not very good but I was a newcomer as well. I had to leave due to the 1hr drive I had to make but good company.","10,000+",Houston,Houston,TX,2016-07-20T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/85fb50e3-3508-4d6e-898b-3e6d3775c231?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=12,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
