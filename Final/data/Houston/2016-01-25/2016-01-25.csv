51,5075.0,Chemist,Veolia,3.6,599.0,"good company to work for, takes care of employees well. work is fun but also easy-going. get to meet some cool people. always learning new things.On a typical day-to-day basis, I was faced with being able to tolerate all types of attitudes and personalities because of the various types of disabilities that each individual person may have possessed.  This division of the Transportation industry afforded more of an opportunity to understand what is truly meant by door-to-door service as opposed to a particular set route that the professional bus operators have and this position gave an opportunity to learn more about how to get around Baltimore.Regular day at work, pre-trip my bus making sure it's safe for on the road driving and for my passengers SAFETY FIRST!!!!!!!!!. As the day goes on it is a great day when I have safely drove passengers across the city of Greensboro.Picking up garbage on route and transporting materials to disposal site. Also i assist the helper with lifting materials up to 75 lbs.This is a safety driven work place.  Some days were very busy and long hours and other days were not as busy and 8 hour days.  This was decided depending on the customers request.training intense but overall with good work ethic and hard work, good place to work.    Hired for day shift.  A shift change occurred.  I suppose when hiring individuals, these could be addressed as a possibility of occurring during employment.The communication between upper management and the first line employees is very poor. More proper training is needed, especially when it is in reference to dealing with irate customers. Employees shouldn't be rushed out of training until all necessary information has been presented.The job depends greatly on the yard a driver is based out of. No one yard is ever the same.  Some yards in the state of Wisconsin do more industrial cleaning and hazmat jobs. The yard I am based out of, is mainly hauling waste and by products for our customers. It can be and is often hectic and poorly planned. The strong lack of communication from dispatchers, and the customers is almost non-existent. Its a guess and go situation half of the time. It is based off of a mon-fri schedule, but some contracts run 7 days a week irregardless. That means youre getting at least a 34 hour reset over the weekend, and thats it.The hours add up fast, and there is serious money to be made, but there's little to no free time to enjoy the extra money. 70 hour weeks are common here. It may be a local job, but you have no more free time than you would otr. The equipment is rough. All well used equipment. Other yards definitely see better equipment then others. Everything comes in used, and is well abused with constant starting and stopping, idling, etc. Yet, it is barely maintained or ran until repaired. The organization is last second in maintenance as well. Never had I drove for someone, who told someone to run oos equipment, but fix minor things and get after them about it like its our fault.The pay program is also out of date. Once a 90 day probation period is up, you get paid by the load. If theres downtime, or non billable work, you still get hourly, but being paid by the load encourages speeding, shortcuts, and lack of progessive driving.They tell the less than or the bare minimum  more... on what your job is, and half of the time, thats not even what happens. When you get hired, they tell you one thing, and it changes ince you actually start working. They need to make some serious changes here.  lessOk company to work for management, is ok coworkers are awesome,  work is fun there's nothing more to say about the companyVeolia was a good company to work for when they were Yellow Van service . But since they become more of a corporate environment . They don't care about the older drivers whom have been there for 13 plus years. All they care about is montoring the dash cam and looking for reasons to fire drivers.I enjoy working there, a lot of hands on offered and showed how to do something, great place to move up, management is respectful and easy to get along with.Highly reactive to meet customer needs. Systems are generally followed, but their is room for improvement. Decisions are made at the highest level of the organization. There is no delegation.There was no career path in terms of advancement. A typical workday is a 12 hour shift inside petrochemical refineries, chemical refineries, power plants, and industrial plants. I learned a lot about safety, health and environmental, project management including planning and scheduling. Management was inconsistent, and my co-workers were manageable. The hardest part of the job is working in the elements for longer periods of time. The most enjoyable part of the job is completing scheduled projects ahead of schedule.I began with Crown Solutions and a short time after we were acquired by Veolia N.A.. The work was exciting onsite but the headaches of running large projects, heavy travel and senior management that could get their act together by the time I left pushed me to go out on my own.The Rialto Water Project, has some of the best people brought on to make this project a positive project. The hardest part of the project is to get all parties involved on the same pageMy impression of Veolia is that they couldn't care less about individual employees.  They just need enough bodies to complete projects and keep making a profit.  Lately the equipment has not been maintained very well which makes each job harder than it needs to be,Great company to work for with great benefits. Learned a lot about power plants, refineries and various other industries. Working for this company also entailed extensive travel to various locations but this provided a way to network with other employees and customers.It's a good company,for some. For other's your success in the company is solely based on who you know and not your work performance.Upper management is pretty out of touch with workings of field guys. You will work a ton of variable hours throughout the week so any balance between work and home is difficult to maintain.Informative and helpful superiors, good work environment. Numerous opportunities to grow. Conveniently located therefor easy to travel to work. While handling numerous flammable, reactive and oxidizers as well as being a labor intensive job, I always felt safe. Participated in weekly safety calls to ensure safety in the workplace.unload truck and operator a forklift and making sure that the material go where need to and make sure everyone had their so they do their job",,Houston,Houston,TX,2016-01-25T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/96e85309-d5cb-45a7-b47b-b816815c67a9?mescoid=1900259001001&jobPosition=19,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
