2,5026.0,Sr Data Scientist,SYSCO,3.5,899.0,"Great culture for advancement.  Management offers lots of support, tons of training and terrific mentoring program program.inconsistant hours. highly stressful.as an order selector, had to maintain high level of speed of processing orders.as an forklift operator more comfortableA good place to work. Good pay. Great work environment. Great work hours. Good management. Great co-workers. Hardest part of job is some of the places you have to deliver. Most enjoyable part is the pay.Month-end is busy and can be stressful.   Sysco does offer growth personally and professionally, to contribute to the success of a dynamic organization.great company to work for. they take care of their employees, they appreciate hard work and compensate you for it. I worked in the warehouse and it is very clean and organized.they have excellent benefits and plenty of opportunity to move around within the company. they have plenty of perks and extras you can get with just a little bit of extra effort , theres always free stuff being handed out, the people are cool  It really is a good one to work for unfortunately I found it while I was in the back stretch of getting my welding certificates so I decided against staying but I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get into warehousing.There was very little communication, hardly any credible organization of the tasks at hand and most of the drivers were ignorant idiots.I was a night picker, got paid decent money, but was required to work long hours. if you are young and maybe not sure what you want to do in life this might be a good job for youWas a temp for 2 months.  Was trained for 1 day. Busted my butt for the time I was there.  Worked 10 hour days.  The first two weeks were great.  Co-Workers super friendly then week three hit and the cattyness began.  Micro managed by fellow employee who was not a supervisor.  They stood over me while waiting for me to finish my tasks.  Would go through my desk and just take stuff without letting me know or leaving a note so I wasted time looking for work that I thought I had misplaced.  Was ultimately let go do to not completing a function of my job that I was never trained on.It's hard work but you make real good money as long as you don't mind working for it. You get home most the time unless they stick u on a over night. So if you have young kids you want be with them every night.not possible to balance work life.     Great potential to much is asked fwith a poor manager to lead.   my experince with the company is poor but due to my manager and not the over all companyYou will make lots of money as a driver for sysco working 50-60 hours a week 12-14 hours a day. It is extremely hard and stressful so you will need thick skin to succeed. It can be done but its certainly not for everyone.Terrible place to work,15 yrs and got absolutely no respect.Nothing but a pack mule.Brown nose management did not stand behind drivers,did not properly maintain equipment,constantly cutting pay,hours,benefits while expecting more and more from drivers everyday.This place will destroy your body because of the amount of unnecessary work you have to do because of the totally fouled up way they do things.Do yourself a favor and RUN as fast as you can away from this company!Good old boys club, It's all about who you are in bed with. Sysco's size is a blessing and a curse. Large broker community at your finger tip, however products are price above market which ca be problematic in competitive situationReally one of the worst places i have every worked in my career.  The management is not strong and caters to larger pieces of business, and does appear to care about the small business owner in the industry.Working Mon-Friday      Monday & Thursday pulling doubles & delivered to West Virginia   Tuesday Paducah & Tennessee & Illinois Area than Friday in Lexington KyI didn't care for this job because of the stress that it puts on a person!My co workers weren't happy do to the job demand!Which I felt made my job harder! I enjoy hard work but the people I'm surrounded. by need to be happy !!!Great people to work with and for. Customers are great and I enjoy interacting with them every day. They all bring light in to the day. Long running company that is well liked by allExcellent environment to foster strong teamwork and support of the overall goals. Quick to adopt new ideas in an ever-changing landscape of customer needs. I very much enjoy working with the organization and its ability to deliver .Long hours interfere with personal life. It will distance you from your family and friends. But you will have an opportunity to make a lot of money if you don't over work yourself.A great place to work while you are in school, or a second job.  Has a great work life balance, works around school schedules.Every house will vary in regards to loads, routes, treatment of drivers.  Work is physical and requires patience when dealing with customers and with the load itself.","10,000+",Houston,Houston,TX,2016-10-21T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/6c901b14-eb22-4073-bd23-07edc5b1c55f?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
