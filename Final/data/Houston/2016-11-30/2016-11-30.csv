22,5046.0,Mathematical Scientist,Oxy,4.2,15.0,"Most management is awesome, as well as other individual contributors. I love that they promote within, as opposed to outsourcing.There were opportunities to move up, but the oil and gas industry is very competitive. No type of job security. Management is very backwards, and most of the time didn't understand what our jobs were.worldwide company that gave me a lot of experience with customs and frieght forwarder. company was manged very well. would work there again if it was an optionbusy day. good co workers, management very nice. enjoyed my job. Enjoyed assisting customers. I learned what I could about crude hauling and some of the dispatchingnice work camp, hot meals, very cold, extreme working conditions at times.  Friendly people.  Not much to do during your time off.It's always a fun day at work because of the people that we work with. We believe in making the best of every day. I learn something new all the time. The hardest part of my job is not being able to help those in need when i know they are truly struggling and have done all they can on their end to make the best out of their situation. And the most enjoyable part of the job is at the same time providing support and any assistance to those who truly need it.NICE ENOUGHI learned to make myself and my family come first, there was no management. the hardest part was no sleep for 30+ hrs while getting no respect. the best part of this experience is that I learned the grass is not always greener on the other side,Great company.  Incredibly busy during the 15 months of my employment.  Pleasant co-workers, friendly management.  Work was scheduled for alternate Fridays off.Nothing was typical here, I learned that I respect structure and management input in the workplace. ""Coworker"" Controlling, bossy and insulting. The hardest part was being put down and micro managed by coworker. Working at home.Co workers were fun to work withManagement was really goodEquipment is old, not up to dateExcelleng place to grow and get lots of responsibility. Very well integrated team members. Good mentors and advisors for beginners. Plenty of opportunities to outside on the fieldi would like to work in your company and will do my best to increase the company's profit and productivity. thank uOXY / CRC is a good company to work for.
