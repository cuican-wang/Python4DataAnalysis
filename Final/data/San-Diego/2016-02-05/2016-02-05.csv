The engineers are dedicated and professional.  Many have a work hard, play hard mentality.  You are encouraged to take on projects and responsibilities if you are up for it.  I like the culture.It's cool that they stock the office with nice breakfast bars and drinks.Work is 8am to 5pm in the office, some remote..Bringing your ""A"" game is a must.Co-workers are pretty cool.",,San-Diego,San Diego,CA,2016-02-05T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/0f2aaf27-4995-4aa1-8bf2-90d5424b0c90?mescoid=1500140001001&jobPosition=28,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
