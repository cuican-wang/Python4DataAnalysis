60,5222.0,Analytics Engineer,Pluralsight,5.0,2.0,"I love my job, I love what my company stands for, I love the people I work with and who they desire for our company to become.Work was very comfortable and allowed us to be creative and motivated with the elimination of the PTO policy. I learned that freedom allowed to bring the best autonomy out of employees. Management was great, although with hyper growth the culture can quickly become slippery when hiring several managers at a time.I could not say good enough about my co-workers. Great teamwork. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with hyper growth, there tends to be a lot of growing pains, but you learn a lot by going through this. The best part of the job was the paid benefits, free drinks and snacks and paid 'family lunch' every Wednesday (which happens to be a great team building activity)",,San-Diego,San Diego,CA,2016-10-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/64273fb0-d93a-4a40-ba69-f1cbc0a7bc76?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=32,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
