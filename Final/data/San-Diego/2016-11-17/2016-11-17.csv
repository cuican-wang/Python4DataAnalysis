37,5199.0,"Scientist, Operator",General Atomics,4.0,85.0,"The biggest issue was co-workers.  They spent a great deal of time talking about their perspective on politics and religion.  The F-bombs fell like rain.  I believe that this is because nearly all of them came from the shipyards.It is a great work place with challenging project and scientific work. Staff members and coworkers  are well qualified and do exemplary work. We solve and advance new technologies and top management encourage employees to advance their career. I learnt a lot about advanced engineering concepts for next generation application and project management activities dealing with technology, finances and cost distribution. coworkers work in small teams and share their knowledge and skills with others. Seminars and training sessions greatly helped me to be more productive. The hardest part of the job is to keep marching forward and apply technologies to commonplace use.The most enjoyable part of the job is the blend of  challenging and unique technical work and the ""Country Club"" ambience to remain stress free, physically fit and be pleasant always.It depends on which department, but the leadership is so lacking, it is sometimes non existent. The great thing is that it is true: you will find a lot of people who share your thoughts and they make the job fun, and will also become great friends. This is a company with cutting edge technology for the marketplace, but the systems, leadership, compensation, benefits, and advancement, are something from the 1960's.This job required a rotation schedule from stateside to overseas, while stateside a typical day was focused on research, development, and testing, staying proficient on current systems and any updates and staying deployment ready. While deployed we had an alternating schedule where every other day we either worked, managed, or produce products at the ground station or while flying. Co-workers had great camaraderie and pulled together to accomplish tasks. Hardest part was being away from family during deployments but understood the nature of the job and mission objectives and what was needed to accomplish those tasks. Best part was working with great like minded individuals.Patrolled facility and parameters to ensure doors, gates were secure. Responded to any security based inquiries and all alarms and emergencies Monitor access to the facility by means of screening personnel and  visitors. Issued ID badges. Monitor and enforce parking regulations. Maintained  security logs  and wrote reports on unusual events.Was available to work all 3 different shifts and have worked all security posts.  I have worked with all kinds of people from different ethnic backgrounds and worked independently and also in a team setting.This company had been amazing since I've started there they have a great schedule, offer the best benefits I've had and the company is still growing so there is a lot of room to grow within the company they also offer great training opportunities.Typical start of a job with much that wasn't explained during the interview process.  Style was to be put before the vice president with results without direction for those results from middle management.However well you negotiate entry salary will make or break your stay, don't ever give salary raises. They only way to advance is to leave and come packCompensation is ok but has changed a lot from when i first started working for the company back in 2008. The percent boost for deployment went down from 95% to 80% when i was let go due to our military contract ending.I loved working at GA, although contract employees are only allowed to work 1 year as a contractor (management will not hire an additional FTE recruiter, so my contract is ending after 1 year).GA / EMS is a decent place to work. Takes a while to get access to everything you need, but once you get going, you'll be pushed to the limit. Stress is high here. Pay is good and you'll use the top technical equipment.Lot of really smart people.  Some interesting work.  At the forefront of UAVs.  Management cannot get out of each others way though.The EMS organization is extremely fractured, does not follow process, poor training, promote unqualified individuals to become leads.  There is a lot of sabotage from leads, do not take responsibility for their mistakes.  Emotionally managed, not strategically managed.I learned a lot here. I did two software engineering internships over the later two summers at GA ASI. I would recommend this company to anybody looking to learn and grow their skills.* Like to work here at G.A. specially with Fusion group. live and work balance, not too pressure. * Great working environment with friendly and support co-worker * Like the campus here with Tennis, Swimming Pool, Volleyball, basketball, gym, ect...I enjoyed my job when everything was flowing pretty good, and everyone got along. My Supervisor relocated to another area, and then another Supervisor took his place. Everything was fine until an extreme change was made with yet another Supervisor which said from the very beginning that, ""she"" was not going to change anything because it looked like everything was flowing nicely already....Well, that was not something promised and from that point forward, everything in our department was being changed and turned upside down. Nothing was ever the same as before ""she"" took over and completely uprooted our happy free flowing work routine. Nobody in our department was happy or accepting of the chaos that ""she"" created and things went downhill from there.Great people and I learned a great deal there. A lack of fun equipment to work with. I got to work in Iraq with a great people. I had a blast there.Working hours can vary, especially if you are sent to a work site for a certain period of time (usually 3-4 Months).This is a great place to work if you are single and want to travel. The traveling can be challenging if you want to stop and take a breath. Management is quite understanding, and they rarely fire anyone, which is a good thing, for the most part. They also listen to requests, if you need a break from traveling.My Co-workers were the best part of the job. You meet people from all over the world and work together. This job really makes you a part of a team, and through that, I've formed strong bonds with people that I still keep in touch with.The hardest part of the job is being away from family, missing holidays, and not actually enjoying life. The pay makes up for a lot of this but it does affect you mentally over time.The most enjoyable part of my job was traveling with co-workers that I had previously worked with. It made my job much more enjoyable and even on off-time, we had a great time.Maintaining a comfortable atmosphere for the customers, with various types of building controls, maintaining many different types of units, package units, heat pumps, split systems, chillers , vav's, boilers, pumps, motors, ice machines, kitchen equipment etc.My typical day was being the first Engineering Tech. there to help out at 5:00am (all other Engineers didn't' start till 8:00am) help set up  test fixtures and run production testing by setting up data acquisition equipment. After helping break down test fixtures i would extract data and take it to my office to make graphs and spread sheets using Microsoft excel for DCMA (Defense Contract Management agency) My favorite part of my job was having down time. i utilized that time to learn new jobs and experience in other departments. I am always looking forward to learning new things! All co-workers are all fun and easy to get along with.Good people to work around; Challenging work environment. Company expanding very rapidly. I enjoyed coming to work daily because we never knew what was going to take place. As the addenda changed daily, my staff reacted without complaining and shifted priorities with fluidity. Being in a manufacturing / engineering environment, the processes required quick decisions and implementation.",,San-Diego,San Diego,CA,2016-11-17T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/dfb5d15e-1ed4-474c-9e9d-cccb8fc5ac15?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
