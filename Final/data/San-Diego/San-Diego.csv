15,5177.0,Principal Scientist,MilliporeSigma,4.3,10.0,"Large company with various opportunities and room to advance.  Flexible hours and good work/life balance.  Good pay and benefits .  Too much change in the pass 5 years.  New Infrastructure and support systems are not in place to support day to day activity.Working in this lab has been an amazing experience so far. I have learned to adapt quickly and take on new assays. Once trained, I still have guidance if needed and can ask questions without worry. I have been able to gain microbial and analytical quality experience, making me a well rounded scientist. The work is consistent, and if organized, there is no reason to be overwhelmed.Great company! Stable and fun company to work for. Work life balance, stable company with good management. Wages could be higher to compete with big pharma.I really enjoy my work with MilliporeSigma, it's a company that's growing but not beyond its capacity. I feel that with the new acquisition by Merck, it will continue to be on the forefront of life science production and R&D.This company has very good benefits.  They have acquired a lot of companies throughout the years to become a stronger company with a huge portfolio.  The company likes to focus on talent development and grow their current teams.Like any other Facilities position it has its challenges. I started when it was just a small locally owned business of 40 employees and now it is part of 50,000 emplyees and revenue of $13,500,000,000.This is a great company to begin your career at especially if you aim at going back to school or earning advanced certificates because the tuition reimbursement is great!Co-workers were friendly but 'clicky.' Training is not very organized. Expectations are not explained. Work is not very difficult but very monotonous.Great place to learn, I love the people. Everyone is willing to help and teach you any side of the business.  Advantage of a big company you can see and understand product development from starting in R&D to on the shelf manufactured. It is great to be able to witness projects like that.Great company to work for, with supportive teams and lots of opportunity to grow, good benefits, and outstanding training courses.",,San-Diego,Carlsbad,CA,2016-11-09T11:45,http://jobview.monster.com/principal-scientist-job-carlsbad-ca-us-175720625.aspx?jobPosition=22,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
16,5178.0,Associate Director,Ionis Pharmaceuticals,3.1,8.0,"Started off great but the culture changed and the fun part was taken out of the equation. Very business like with no time for fun.most people are super stressed out.  lots of managers and directors.  good scientist but the environment is super stressful.Poor & under qualified management, not helpful in helping you succeed. Poor culture: members of the group do not get along, vicious and unproductive work environment, HR and management do not handle it in an effective way. Work long hours every week, not good work-life balance, not worth the money.Management expects you to know how to solve every problem dependently with little mentor-ship, will fire you if you do not meet there expectations.Management was ill prepared for many meetings, reviews, and general interactions.Every person in a senior position or with direct reports, with the exception of a very VERY small handful of employees, did not belong in that position because of lack of qualifications and inability to communicate to direct reports. Most of the people in higher positions were put there due to advanced degrees and have absolutely no training or knowledge of how to be a manager, work with direct reports, or run a group. Promotions into ""director/associate director"" were not uncommon for someone with less than 5 years of industrial experience due to their ability to help the softball team do well. Favoritism was a very common occurrence in meetings, if your manager or director did not like you they did their best to make you out to be a scapegoat in weekly meetings. Any disagreement with your direct manager automatically assumed you were in the wrong. Logic and data to back up factual points were overlooked due to ""buddy buddy"" of directors and managers.  The environment was vicious at the research associate/scientist level as well. Due to the hostile feeling at the higher levels the junior staff was more than willing to push someone else under the bus if it had the slightest change of making them look good. The hardest part of this job was walking in the door every morning, with the dread of what was to come. The routine testings that were performed were repetitive and required only a basic understanding so the actual lab work was easy enough. It was the politics and the very negative  more... environment that made this job absolutely toxic.If offered a position I would suggest turning and walking away, no amount of stock options/RSU's/health benefits are worth the stress and unhappiness that this company instills in its employees.This company always seems to like it's turnover percentages. When I started working there every new employee seemed to be so excited that less than 3% turnover meant that this company was a great company and would treat you like family and you'd have a career forever. Currently it's around 6.6% turnover, the average in biotech is actually lower than 8.5% (which is the average in life sciences) so congratulations, our company is bragging about how we are at the industry standard for employee turnover. If that's not a huge red flag as to how this company is run nothing is. The only reason this number isn't much higher is because the people that are still around and not leaving is because of the ""golden handcuffs"" Due to the stock options being worth so much money, if you were to leave you would lose a lot of money in stocks that haven't yet vested. If I didn't have several mouths to feed that were depending on my salary, I would have left years ago  lessIsis' policy was to teach/train/promote each employee to her/his highest capability. My position was created from the need to claim the next corporate step of submitting an NDA for Isis' first drug. We all were on a steep learning curve learning exactly what the FDA required to permit a drug to go market. I was generally updating SOPs, managing required elements for the CMC (Chapter 7 - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls. To follow the USA FDA submission I was also instrumental in a Canadian and British government submissions for the same compound.At Isis, we are committed to creating and developing important new medicines.  We believe in striving for excellence in this endeavor and that the future will be defined by outstanding people.  We are committed to recruiting, developing, motivating and rewarding these outstanding employees.  Our culture is designed to foster innovation and scientific excellence.   We pride ourselves on our scientific rigor and maintain an intense, fast-paced, dynamic work environment.   Our core principles include ""commit to science and the scientific process""; ""have a bias to act"" and ""have fun"".  We believe our low turnover, which averages 6% per year for both voluntary and involuntary compares favorably to the industry average of 16.6% and speaks to the positive environment we provide our employees.  You are invited to visit our website, learn more, and decide if Isis may be for you:  www.isispharm.comI worked in the organosynthesis lab for one of the projects at Isis. It was a very rewarding experience that taught me all the hard work it takes to get a product from the research labs to the consumer.The company already went through transition. Easy job.

A typical day would consist of me starting the early morning meeting, then executing an outbound dialer campaign for the call center reps.I monitor calls while they are on the phone, and also continue to monitor calls afterwards as well. Upon listening to these calls, I offered my advice on the calls, and set up all reports for metrics going forward.I handled the incentive payout for the day and also made sure the engineering team had a chain of qualified solar leads go through so we we could sell solar systems.Fast moving environment with great employees.

28,5190.0,Data Scientist,"Sequenom, Inc.",3.5,17.0,"Mostly good people to work with and the job was easy and not very stressful. It is a shame that the company is tanking due to poor upper management choices.I loved working for this company.  The benefits and compensation were awesome.  Would go back tomorrow if I could.  Only left because of schedule issuesSequenom, as a company, does great work. Small company doing wonderful work in prenatal and genetic testing. However..the accessioning lab is not so great. Management is horrible and inept. Very unorganized and employee moral is low. VERY HIGH TURNOVER RATE! In the first few weeks of my employment, 5 people quit. As far as the work, it was not difficult. It's mostly data entry, so having lab experience is not necessary. I don't know what the other departments are like at the RTP location, but I would caution those of you who apply for the SPT position. My opinion: don't do it!Very flexible work environment.  I learned a lot about laboratory compliance and credentialing ancillary facility/organizations with Medicare, Medicaid and Commercial PayorsManagement team is excellentCoworkers greatI cannot think of anything that I could deem ""hard"" about the job, I looked forward to working and never minded coming into the officeI enjoyed everything about the jobHas a great CLIA lab work process, good work place to work for, I've learned allot about time management.  The management team are too objective to picking on internal personnel on a micro managing circumstances.  I had great co-workers there when I was working there.  The hardest thing of part of the job is that I was appointed to do someone else job other than my own.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when I over came the logistics of the job after the guy who left the company and that I had to take over his place.I had high hopes for this company as I left another full time job for this position thinking that a start up comapany would offer room for advancement and a more personable culture however, that is not what happened. My co-workers were wonderful, I enjoyed the effort that everyone put in to make the day go by  smoothly.   I was stuck doing a high repetitive job and my success was at the hands of a misquided and clique like management team.  I really tried to do my best for this company but they do not appreciate the talent they have there and instead to get ahead, you need to be best friends with your superiors. The lab workers were always blamed for things going wrong and there is no incentive to excel.  I would highly suggest you take your skill set elsewhere.Overall, Good company to work for, although the benefits aren't much, but insurance is okay. It has relax environment to be in, and the location is NICE.If you want to have easier working conditions, this company is definitely for you. This is my first molecular job and it was very impressive to see cutting-edge technology, compared to where I came from (LabCorp, INC.). Unfortunately, it is run by management that does not know how to do the test. This accounts for lots of confusion and mishandled progression. There seems to be a lot of meetings without real solutions, and a lot of wasted approved overtime. It was so bad when I first came here, that the norm was to work 6-7 days a week. Things have mellowed out a bit now. There was a recent lay-off, which didn't affect Laboratory Employees too much, but I feel that this may not be the last of it. There are waaaay too many supervisors, and too many CLS's employed by this company. I can easily see more people being let go. So consider this as you apply.I applied to a CLS position.  I received an email requesting a telephone screening interview with an HR representative almost immediately.  My contact with this HR rep was extremely challenging as she was not knowledgeable and was very defensive.  Most of my contact was spend ""walking on eggshells"" so as not to offend her but she seemed to be offended by everything.  It was very disturbing.  I was left with the impression that this is a very poorly managed company to allow this person to screen technical staff and provide a ""first impression"" to potential employees.Sequenom designs, develops, manufactures and markets innovative technology, instrumentation and tests that target and serve discovery and clinical research, and clinical molecular diagnostics markets. Applications include translational research, oncology, agricultural genomics and in vitro diagnostics for prenatal and retinal disorders.Sequenom seemed much more open and flexible when I was first hired.  As the company has expanded from just under 200 to just under 600 employees things have gotten a bit more corporate and some of the old culture of Friday happy hours where you could sit and chat about projects in a relaxed atmosphere has gone away.  I still enjoy working here, I'd recommend it to anyone looking, but it's definitely not a small company environment any more :)I love working for this company selling and education ophthalmologists about a novel genetic test. Love the people I work with, they are hardworking, smart, funny, and dedicated.low vacation accrual. management mostly male.overall a good place to work.Sequenom is a good place for R&D if you are scientist. Specially great are the TGIFs...they cut back on those now.However, if you are a CLS CAUTION and stay away from it. It was cited numerous times by CLIA and dont know why they are still open. You are much better off with working in Quest/Labcorp.Their management sucks and still under training. Not a good place for a CLSOperate like a start up even though they are a well established company with more than 15+ years in the genetic analysis and research market. Good people and is expanding. Management could do more to promote development and more innovations.Nice company to work for with lots of future potential. The company is on the cutting edge of molecular diagnostics.It was a wonderful, truly a great organization. Good managers and team building!

37,5199.0,"Scientist, Operator",General Atomics,4.0,85.0,"The biggest issue was co-workers.  They spent a great deal of time talking about their perspective on politics and religion.  The F-bombs fell like rain.  I believe that this is because nearly all of them came from the shipyards.It is a great work place with challenging project and scientific work. Staff members and coworkers  are well qualified and do exemplary work. We solve and advance new technologies and top management encourage employees to advance their career. I learnt a lot about advanced engineering concepts for next generation application and project management activities dealing with technology, finances and cost distribution. coworkers work in small teams and share their knowledge and skills with others. Seminars and training sessions greatly helped me to be more productive. The hardest part of the job is to keep marching forward and apply technologies to commonplace use.The most enjoyable part of the job is the blend of  challenging and unique technical work and the ""Country Club"" ambience to remain stress free, physically fit and be pleasant always.It depends on which department, but the leadership is so lacking, it is sometimes non existent. The great thing is that it is true: you will find a lot of people who share your thoughts and they make the job fun, and will also become great friends. This is a company with cutting edge technology for the marketplace, but the systems, leadership, compensation, benefits, and advancement, are something from the 1960's.This job required a rotation schedule from stateside to overseas, while stateside a typical day was focused on research, development, and testing, staying proficient on current systems and any updates and staying deployment ready. While deployed we had an alternating schedule where every other day we either worked, managed, or produce products at the ground station or while flying. Co-workers had great camaraderie and pulled together to accomplish tasks. Hardest part was being away from family during deployments but understood the nature of the job and mission objectives and what was needed to accomplish those tasks. Best part was working with great like minded individuals.Patrolled facility and parameters to ensure doors, gates were secure. Responded to any security based inquiries and all alarms and emergencies Monitor access to the facility by means of screening personnel and  visitors. Issued ID badges. Monitor and enforce parking regulations. Maintained  security logs  and wrote reports on unusual events.Was available to work all 3 different shifts and have worked all security posts.  I have worked with all kinds of people from different ethnic backgrounds and worked independently and also in a team setting.This company had been amazing since I've started there they have a great schedule, offer the best benefits I've had and the company is still growing so there is a lot of room to grow within the company they also offer great training opportunities.Typical start of a job with much that wasn't explained during the interview process.  Style was to be put before the vice president with results without direction for those results from middle management.However well you negotiate entry salary will make or break your stay, don't ever give salary raises. They only way to advance is to leave and come packCompensation is ok but has changed a lot from when i first started working for the company back in 2008. The percent boost for deployment went down from 95% to 80% when i was let go due to our military contract ending.I loved working at GA, although contract employees are only allowed to work 1 year as a contractor (management will not hire an additional FTE recruiter, so my contract is ending after 1 year).GA / EMS is a decent place to work. Takes a while to get access to everything you need, but once you get going, you'll be pushed to the limit. Stress is high here. Pay is good and you'll use the top technical equipment.Lot of really smart people.  Some interesting work.  At the forefront of UAVs.  Management cannot get out of each others way though.The EMS organization is extremely fractured, does not follow process, poor training, promote unqualified individuals to become leads.  There is a lot of sabotage from leads, do not take responsibility for their mistakes.  Emotionally managed, not strategically managed.I learned a lot here. I did two software engineering internships over the later two summers at GA ASI. I would recommend this company to anybody looking to learn and grow their skills.* Like to work here at G.A. specially with Fusion group. live and work balance, not too pressure. * Great working environment with friendly and support co-worker * Like the campus here with Tennis, Swimming Pool, Volleyball, basketball, gym, ect...I enjoyed my job when everything was flowing pretty good, and everyone got along. My Supervisor relocated to another area, and then another Supervisor took his place. Everything was fine until an extreme change was made with yet another Supervisor which said from the very beginning that, ""she"" was not going to change anything because it looked like everything was flowing nicely already....Well, that was not something promised and from that point forward, everything in our department was being changed and turned upside down. Nothing was ever the same as before ""she"" took over and completely uprooted our happy free flowing work routine. Nobody in our department was happy or accepting of the chaos that ""she"" created and things went downhill from there.Great people and I learned a great deal there. A lack of fun equipment to work with. I got to work in Iraq with a great people. I had a blast there.Working hours can vary, especially if you are sent to a work site for a certain period of time (usually 3-4 Months).This is a great place to work if you are single and want to travel. The traveling can be challenging if you want to stop and take a breath. Management is quite understanding, and they rarely fire anyone, which is a good thing, for the most part. They also listen to requests, if you need a break from traveling.My Co-workers were the best part of the job. You meet people from all over the world and work together. This job really makes you a part of a team, and through that, I've formed strong bonds with people that I still keep in touch with.The hardest part of the job is being away from family, missing holidays, and not actually enjoying life. The pay makes up for a lot of this but it does affect you mentally over time.The most enjoyable part of my job was traveling with co-workers that I had previously worked with. It made my job much more enjoyable and even on off-time, we had a great time.Maintaining a comfortable atmosphere for the customers, with various types of building controls, maintaining many different types of units, package units, heat pumps, split systems, chillers , vav's, boilers, pumps, motors, ice machines, kitchen equipment etc.My typical day was being the first Engineering Tech. there to help out at 5:00am (all other Engineers didn't' start till 8:00am) help set up  test fixtures and run production testing by setting up data acquisition equipment. After helping break down test fixtures i would extract data and take it to my office to make graphs and spread sheets using Microsoft excel for DCMA (Defense Contract Management agency) My favorite part of my job was having down time. i utilized that time to learn new jobs and experience in other departments. I am always looking forward to learning new things! All co-workers are all fun and easy to get along with.Good people to work around; Challenging work environment. Company expanding very rapidly. I enjoyed coming to work daily because we never knew what was going to take place. As the addenda changed daily, my staff reacted without complaining and shifted priorities with fluidity. Being in a manufacturing / engineering environment, the processes required quick decisions and implementation.",,San-Diego,San Diego,CA,2016-11-17T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/dfb5d15e-1ed4-474c-9e9d-cccb8fc5ac15?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

My Boss at th time was a wonderful women and the HR department was the best. I loved the fact that the engineers treated me like I was family. The location was wonderful and I really enjoyed working with this company for almost 8 years.HDR had one of the easiest environments to work in that I have ever experienced. The people are wonderful, the management let's you figure things out on your own but is always there to answer your questions, and they make an effort to allow you to work on tasks and get involved with the company when you express certain desires to do so.Wonderful company in every aspect. Highly recommended.Lots of large complex projects with many challenges daily.  learned many things about working in large national teams.HDR is a great place to work at.  Lots of projects and oppurtunities.  Large room for growth and advancement to management.This was a type of contract job.  I learned contract jobs have you feeling a bit used and unappreciated. My direct Supervisor is nice and my coworker is great.Im needing to find a job as soon as possible. Hdr was not a great job for me due to the lack of help and communication from the supervisor there is no set job at HDRI love coming to work and do what I do everyday.

There is always a solution to everything.The job was very interesting and provided excellent mentoring for a young engineer right out of college.  Commercial buildings and industrial plant experience combined.In the short time I have worked with HDR as I have been on contract with them I have come to respect their work and their management. Compensation is fair, and working expectations are reasonable. It is a large company and seems to have great opportunity to work worldwide.HDR has a strong benefits package including a well performing ESOP. Leadership is honest and hardworking and doesn't take cutting people lightly just to make a few extra bucks.

Well managed and productive office. It's just too bad it's in Houston, Texas. Friendly co-workers, family atmosphere, lots of office functions to make for a real team feel. I have done work for several states because HDR is one of the best at work sharing between offices.This can be a great company to work for in the right situation. I was an employee for the Chicago office for 6 years remotely. I worked out of an office in Springfield, approximately 4 hours south if Chicago.I was laid off due to reduction in work in the area. I firmly believe the Department Heads there did everything they could to not let me go, but ultimately were forced to by the corporate office.I was asked to rejoin the office in 2014 as a remote employee working out of my home. I was glad to do this as HDR has always been very good to me and to work for and with.Strong culture of excellence while rebuilding interstate roads and bridges. Accelerated pace of construction which inspired ingenuity and problem solving while offering much experience in a compressed amount of time.This is a very fast-paced company with major responsibilities.  The crew is among the hardest working people that I've had the pleasure of working with.HDR offers excellent benefits and I loved the culture. I worked in the Claremont branch and was laid off after 3.5 years of employment.  Since I have been unemployed from the company many employees have been laid off or have left due to poor management specifically the department manager.The employee benefits and PTO are excellent. Management could have been more in touch with employees. Communication from management was lacking.

Good Company culture. A very good team.We all know that painful feeling waking up in the morning to get ready for a job that we don't like.  Going to work each morning for Astellas was not that way for me.  This is a wonderful company that provides exceptional compensation and benefits for their employees.  This company truly cares about their employees lives and well being.  The flexibility and vacation time provided is nothing less of exceptional.  I greatly enjoy working for this company.  Astellas has set the bar very high.Good place to start your working life out of college. The pay isnt the best but its solid for a good resume builder. Get in and get out. The staff and people who are in management are great.I learned much about the sales and marketing aspects of product promotion, as well as the technical aspects of the product.  The sales team that I worked with was exceptional.  I enjoyed getting out in the professional community and networking with others in my profession.Solid work place environment. Good opportunity. Supportive colleagues and well intention-ed management. Since my stay with Astellas was short, I had little to complain about.OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was bought by Astellas, so I worked mostly for OSI.  My co-workers were wonderful; very supportive, eager to teach and learn from each other, always striving to improve. In my time there, we had several directors, most of whom were knowledgeable, helpful and approachable. Being in cancer research, management made a real effort to show us how our work was impacting patients by holding talks given by Medical Affairs, Clinical and Marketing. We had great educational benefits; they reimbursed for classes you took related to your career path.Excellent company with great products. Top in industry for benefits and work life balance. Great teammates in all areas of the business.

All employees try to be honest and work hard to release new medicines in the world to save as many people who need to be cured. Astellas has been trying to have diversities and they have now.I've worked in other corporate positions but none of them were the right fit for me and balancing all of the things I'm involved in outside of the office.

Worked with others and didn't have to be micro managed.  We had a steroid free product that dermatologsits wanted.Good products and good field sales leadership. Smart people who know what they're doing in the field. In the home office, there are many excellent people who have strong technical sales. There's an over reliance on consultants who bring in fresh ideas and milk millions of dollars off the bottom line. The best technicians rise to the top, as long as they're likable people. This results in poor leadership in the home office. But, nobody really cares about home office leadership because technicians are replaceable and the field sales folks continue to bring in the dollars.Run don't walk.

It is very unhealthy work situation.It is a great company to work for. I enjoyed my time there. I had a great mentor to shepherd me through the organization. Management was very supportive and co-workers were willing to help when necessary.Astellas Pharma is a fast paced growing company, that offers an  atmosphere that promotes teamwork, and empowers employees to  thrive in their career.I was the maintenance manager for a two/three shift operation.  I would arrive at work before the third shift was over in order to talk with the maintenance techs to find out what had happened during their shift and know current equipment status.  I would then review the Work Order System to assign new work orders and verify status of urgent work orders.  Daily activity was determined by priorities, downed equipment repair was number one priority, then projects and then necessary meetings for production scheduling and other needs.  Since this was a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility we work under clean room conditions.  The nature of maintenance required the maintenance techs to use extra care and caution when performing normal procedures to the equipment.  In addition to maintaining the production and support equipment our team also performed the majority of calibrations for the site, this averaged to about 650 calibrations per month, we never missed making schedule. Upper management was very open to discussion but still demanding schedules were maintained.  Projects were scheduled during site shut downs unless it was a equipment modification that required immediate attention.My management team was primarily consisted of operations managers, I was the only maintenance manager.  We worked well together covering production and project work making equipment and resource schedules that made everyone's schedule as much as possible.The hardest part of the job was keeping the right combination of maintenance tech skill sets distributed to each shift during high work rate  more... schedules without hiring additional techs or working excessive overtime.  We went from a five day two shift production schedule to a twenty-four seven day schedule for approximately six months, this was a challenging time for everyone.I enjoyed seeing the monthly schedules completed early or at least on schedule especially when we had trying situations to overcome in addition to our normal work load.  I also enjoyed seeing a project come to completion weather it was outside contractors or our maintenance techs or a combination of both.  I also enjoyed observing maintenance techs learning new skills and growing their proficiency in all areas of their work assignments.  less",,San-Diego,San Diego,CA,2016-10-15T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/d368dde7-24c3-46e2-88d3-0e60997a1e67?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=14,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

46,5208.0,QC Associate Scientist I,Zoetis,3.7,66.0,"Everyone is very welcoming and nice. However the departments don't exactly get along very well. Great learning environment and management is extremely nice and helpful.I highly recommend the internship program at Zoetis.The engineers you work with over the summer are heavily involved in the recruitment process which is really nice. They are willing to work with non-traditional engineering backgrounds, as they did in my case.Many of the engineers/designers/scientists that work here are willing to set aside their time to talk about their projects and share their expertise. I was heavily involved in 2 - 3 projects over the 3 month I was here.Organized chaos.  Not well run by management and company cannot deliver certain goods in a timely manner that meets the clients needs.I was to maintain a fully operational unit, reaching all my production rates. Keep hourly checks on my product and machines while maintaining a clean unit.Becoming a Zoetis colleague was very beneficial for me. I learned a lot more skills that helped me expand my knowledge and opportunities.I had a great manager and very nice team of the department.Time is very flexible; everybody treated as a responsible adult.No micromanagement.Nice work environment.Company is constantly buy some other businesses so everybody's position is not very stable; nobody knows what will happens next.It was Challenging It was More learningIt was Good to have big teamWe had good time, share.We were give good facilities which cannot be compared with other companiesPoorly managed team where training and advancement require a person to suck up to the supervisor. Highly stressful and lots of favoritism shown. Back stabbing environment.Very good place to work.  Nice and friendly staff, and plenty of advancement opportunities.  Month meetings really kept everyone updated and on point.  I wouldn't change anything about this company.Excellent culture and environment, great place to work and grow with the company.  Largest Animal Health company which has its benefits and downside.As a contingent worker, you will hate this place. They offer nothing of benefit. They will dangle a golden carrot in front of you and yank it away as soon as you think progress in your career is being made. Chances of getting hired in as a temp are slim to none. Good luck.This could have been a good company but inept management --all imports from Pfizer---has led it to become a seemingly inevitable takeover target.  The culture has been decimated after the recent 20% cut in the workforce.  Not a good place to work!Looking for a new opprotunity as lay offs are occurring again for the millionth time  it's an unstable place to be currentlyNice and Very helpful people.Management is great-very understanding and open to ideas.Positive environment to grow.Pay is good too.this is a good place to work but there is little chance of advancing in the company.  As of right now they only hire temps. good clean facility.Directing the movement of data across multiple systems and small project management. Validation of DEA licensing for fraud and accurate data information before submission of shipping pharmaceuticals to office.Majority of the co-workers are very kind but there is a significant amount that love to ruin other's days. The people that are above you can do no wrong and you are always at fault.Not enough space, lazy workers that complain all day as opposed to working while others actually work. But they are nice and the supervisors are very understanding and supportive of the team.Processing and packaging pharmaceuticals for livestock and Veterinarians with outdated equipment. Safety is not a concern from my experience, rarely saw management (beginning of the day and maybe the end of the day) 12 hour shifts 6am to 6pm. Co workers had no sense of safety in the area we were assigned to. The hardest part at times was performing maintenance on the regularly failing mill operations Leaving for the day was the most enjoyable part of the day.They are passionate about providing the best product to their customers and truly engender a team mentality.  This is a very good company to work for.Zoetis is a very family friendly workplace.  As long as you get your work done, management is very flexible with colleagues' schedule and supportive of colleagues having a good life outside of the office.","5,001 to 10,000",San-Diego,San Diego,CA,2016-10-09T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/943b7424-5cc8-430d-b67b-0281b5d6cbe3?mescoid=1900306001001&jobPosition=17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

52,5214.0,Staff Scientist 1,"Affymetrix, Inc.",3.8,26.0,"Affymetrix was acquired by another company so they are no longer in business,Once acquired the business was merged into the new companyCompany had a great work life balance.Given the opportunity to understand their products and how to use that knowledge when re-implementing Xactly.Able to work with management,Allowed my staff the ability to work with implementing the Xactly system for their future skill set.The hardest part of the job was doing the GL and monthly accruals- that is not my background.The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I met and worked with on a daily basis.Good products, people, and processes.  Changing management resulted in various changes, largely positive, to how the organization was run.Typical day at work included 30% bench work, 50% documentation and 20% interaction with cross functional teams, vendors, customers etc. The hardest part of the job was the efforts that went into establishing stringent requirements in creating a GLP environment and transitioning a Research Use Product only to a diagnostic product for clinical applications. The lack of quality and regulatory knowledge amongst colleagues from within and various other departments made the process longer and harder. The most enjoyable part was a great, determined and hardworking manager to work and report to. Working with a team willing to learn and adapt to changes. Interesting and consistent challenges during the course of development to launch of the product. Also plenty of opportunities to learn and grow in the company.Affymetrix is a decent place to work for, but it seems next to almost impossible to advance within. For the most part they give good incentives, health care, 401k, vacation time and few other perks. They try to keep the morale high by having a employees activities committee conduct monthly events. The hardest part of the job are the people, but that is usually at most jobs. In my area my co-workers are very close knit and we work like a family. Management can a shaky at times, but nothing to really worry about. There are many learning opportunities because Affymetrix highly promotes cross training. When I started working here you get all benefits from day one.Affymetrix is a good company to work for but it is not financially solvent. Thus I couldn't really move forward in the organization even though I did ""quality work."" Hours are flexible and eating was great until they took away breakfast. They had layoffs while I was there and I ultimately became a victim of budgetary constraints. I was replaced by a contract worker that was fired in the initial layoffs and was rehired back on a contract basis. There is some backstabbing though and certain people don't know too much. The company is not going to stay afloat due to bad management and a lot of workers I saw goofing off.Affymetrix is a great organization with a close knit culture. One of the most internally connected companies I've ever worked with.Best place to work for. Friendly environment. Great management team. I enjoyed my busy desk, always challenging on a daily basis.I learned a lot from the people I work for and has been my mentor all the time.I will surely miss the company.Overall This is a god place to work. I do wish that I was more challenge at my job on a day to day basis.7+ plus years good professional experience in the Analysis, Architecture, Design, Development, Implementation, Integration and Testing of Client / Server / Internet / Intranet Systems for Engineering, Research, Financial and Insurance Industries using Object Oriented Analysis/Design/Methodologies.Hands-on experience with the latest Java EE 5 platform. Strong exposure to lightweight containers like EJB 3.0. JPA 1 and Hibernate 3.0. Solid experience in lightweight POJO based frameworks like spring 3.0(Dependency Injection, IOC, ORM, DAO, AOP, MVC, JMS and Business Integration).Good experience in Spring AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming) and IOC (Inversion of Control).I begin work each day by checking my email. I gown up into proper lab wear then procede into lab. I take a filling order and follow each procedure. Work orders vary from quanity which determine the time frame. After completing the work order I return all materials and close the work order into the companies software. The management is pretty laid back and the co-workers are the same. There is no hard part about the job. One of the best things they have are educational classes that you get credits and certificates when complete.There was a good focus on getting things done while maintaining flexibility and freedom to work in the way that best suits youThe most enjoyable part of the job was listening to music and setting up experiments using different types of skills. The typical day was getting there at 7:30 am in morning. Starting my day with good breakfast and listening to music and working on DNA chips. Using micropipette filling chips with Hyb buffer and then putting it in Hybridization Oven.The best thing about working for a company like Affy is knowing that the end result (products/services) positively affect the quality of human life.For me, this simple fact has been the most powerful reason to work there and why I choose to remain in biotech !Very aggressive work schedule focused primarily on profits. They do have an excellent product which is of great benefit to mankind. Perhaps with the the recent restructure and change in management they will be able to work to their mission and product a product that will make great strides in diagnostic medicine.I made my weekly schedule which included all service call coordination and installs. Keep up on expense reports and service reports. make my own travel arrangements.Typical work day was ok,I learned about all kinds of bulk and liquid materials,management was fine,co-workers were ok,hardest part of job was very big orders in which took alot of time to get done,my most enjoyable parts of job was the christmas party'sa typical day at worKwhat you learnedmanagementyour co-workersthe hardest part of the jobthe most enjoyable part of the jobManagement in the corporate is very incompetence.

54,5216.0,Bioinformatician / Computational Biologist,"Kelly Services, Inc.",3.9,7100.0,"great company to work with I have no complains they are there when need to seek a opportunity down of it just short terms. excellent staff member there i would recommend it to any one out there with the experience I had.The typical workday with this agency was quite regular as a 9 to 5..  Working for different companies afforded the ability to experience company cultures, different businesses, and different locations to work,  The management changed a bit more than other companies, however,  the company kept their protocols in place.  Co-workers were diverse, skilled, and non-skilled labor, corporate, retail, and service workers, of every level, in many different companies.  The hardest part of the job was that you could be called to go work in a very short time span, as well as, the pay was average.  The flexibility of making the decision to work when you decided, along with experiencing different companies and different people was by far the absolutely best part of the jobs with this company.A productive work place with repetitive work.Good friendly people but alot of workplace drama. Good work schedule with a constant flow and adequate lunch breaks.Horrible temp company. They do not care about there employees. You will not advance being a temp employee at any job being through this company. All they do is look to make money off of having you as an employeeGreat company overall not many flaws. Great coworkers and good work atmosphere. Employers are very kind and help out with all your needs. Can improve on hiring process though.Its a fantastic way to find temporary work. lower ratings in some areas are to be expected as that of a temp service. Typically Kelly's agents act with a high amount of professionalism and kindness.I have always been a factory, warehouse worker type person and the transition to an office environment answering phone calls is very different.  I have worked as a cashier and have customer experience but taking phone calls of upset customers every so often is overwhelming at first. I have learned that I cannot take it personal which is not easy on some calls, however, there it is a joy in talking to new people everyday. You met some really unique people of all ages.My co-workers are great, we talk a little when there is no calls and it is nice to just relax and talk about the job or what is going on around us. A typical day in the call center is taking almost 60 to 80 calls a day. Helping customers with their recalled item. Most of the time is rather relaxing until an irate customer calls and complains about how they are being treated and how unfair their situation is. I understand their frustration and try to fix their problem quick and easy if at all possible. Not all callers get the answer they are looking for and I do the best I can until I have run out of options to get their problem the solution it needs. All in all it is okay but some days it is very difficult.I enjoyed my time with Kelly Services. The recruiters were very friendly and helpful. They always tried to match a job to my skill level and encouraged me to try new things. They were always available to help with answers to questions I might have about a position or driving distance to an assignment.Kelly services has many jobs. It is like indeed. They get back with you. The facility is nice and so are the people. I believe they maybe under a new company.While my contact with them is minimal, they are the access to the project work I am doing and it's pretty seamless. I have been impressed with the level of communication I receive from them.Co-workers were great, however when it came to Kelly Services and how their reaction was to the people they hired - they seem to want the extreme out of them.The job was wonderful, I met new people and my peers were excellent. but when it came down to getting a hold of Kelly Services to explain what was going on I didn't know really who to report to.Need better Management team in there New Mexico location.  Little to no benefits during my last two year contract. There were no jobs available after my contract Expired. The position itself was a great experience.The workers are good and kind. They provide excellent customer service and know how to take care of issues when they occur. The people in the office were well respective and always remembered to treat you as a member of the team.Co-workers are amazing but the management is poor which provides for a very negative work environment. The work itself provides for quick burn out and little reward especially as far as receiving competitive wages and recognition.Check in with front office at the school, get keys to the classroom. Got to classroom find instructions and roll call sheets. Make sure all classes are accounted for. Assign work and follow schedule for the day. at the end of the day return keys sign out and go home.If you need to make extra money with the overtime you do at this place you will help you.  a lot of safety consciousness, like to keep people away from danger.I got ripped off numerous times from my paycheck and they don't take your work experience into account plus not finding full-time work I would not recommend this place to anyoneThis was a temp agency for staffing various jobs for those of us who needed a temp job before landing FT employment.  Not something to do as a career.Just don't.  Money flow issues, management issues.  Unable to order parts, unable to get quotes.

57,5219.0,Scientist-II,Kaztronix LLC,3.2,18.0,"I like to be busy.I typically am accountable (and hands on) for:*Systems Analysis*Specification Collection*Project Management*QA Management and*Training to targeted audiences.""You do crazy really well!""I agree.   I like to know what is going on with every aspect of the project I'm working.I've been exposed to dysfunctional teams and have worked hard to rebuild trust and create a combined, open relationship were contention previously existed.I've learned that individual team members have unique preferences which I try to respect to ensure I, in turn, get the information or work completed as required.I enjoy working on fast-paced assignments and meeting all the persons who contribute to the success of the initiative.The hardest part of the job is knowing that most of the employees on a project team already have full-time, day jobs.Anything I request related to a new initiative/project is above and beyond their daily workload.    I try to mitigate stress on these employees by negotiating deadlines that work for everyone.These employees do not report to me, so there is no other incentive to 'play nice' together other than to respect the team and deliver what I promise, earning their respect.The Company was Great. The contract job they had was not what I was initially told. Thats how the military works for you. They contract you for network engineer but the position doesn't do any networking period. Its a sit and monitoring position No fault to kaztronix at all great company they just need accurate descriptions of their contracts so they know exactly what they are sending their people to do.Kaztronix is an intermediary that places contractors with clients.  I was contracted through Kaztronix as a project manager.  The account manager was fine in terms of setting up the interview with the client and occasionally following up once the gig started.  Other than onboarding and separation, I had virtually no contact with Kaztronix.  I did get paid on time.Here's the warning: Beware all aspects of the HR department, which is terrible -- all slots seemed to be staffed by first-job employees, none of whom seem to know their business.  There were delays in the start date, due to HR's inability to get a background check done on time.  There were multiple requests from them for the same information and once it got booted to someone else in the chain, it had to be resubmitted again.Upon separation, I received no customary HR separation package of paperwork -- just a one page COBRA notice.  They did not process my 401(k) transfer request in a timely fashion, which literally cost me some money.There are a lot better contractor firms out there.  Take my advice and look for one.I was fortunate enough to experience this company only through the interview process. I have two masters degrees from a tier one school, and they contacted me about possible placement in the NYC JNJ office. The first impression I had was awful. It sounded like someone from Mumbai was calling me. I could hardly understand them. The contract rate that was our agreement was dropped by 30 percent post interview. It made the possibility of even working for them impossible. They're just another greedy contract recruiter to leach off educated people in pharma. Stay far away.I worked for Kaztronix LLC. out of  McLean VA. for 2 1/2 years. I worked in the Dallas Texas area. (several hundred miles away)They where great to work for. Any time I had a problem, it was handled Very promptly. The pay was good.The people where friendly.I could not ask for better people to work for.I have been a contractor for 2 years at Kaztronix.. They have been fantastic because not only did they find me a job, they communicated how/ what I needed to accomplish and improve upon while on the job. In two months I'm projected to be converted to an FTE.. I would never had this opportunity if wasn't for Kaztronix. Other Agencies don't communicate with their contract employees..The overall atmosphere is  lively and fun! The opportunity for advancement is super attainable and can happen based on performance . My coworkers are helpful and constantly provide guidance and assistanceRun as fast as you can with this miss leading company. I work for them and what a big mistake on my part. There health ins.is way to costly and there is a contractor  by the name of crossfire that has a way better health ins and they get  you more money to work for them.Kraztronix does not care about you or me all they want is there money. I refer people to crossfire because Kaztronix does not want to pay you the referral money. They come up with a lame excuse to why they don't have to pay you.They tell you what you want to hear and they never back it up .Get every thing in writing from this company.I WELL NEVER REFERR ANY ONE TO THIS COMPANY.I REFERR THEM TO OTHER CONTRACTORS LIKE CROSSFIRE.Stay away. Seek an alternative recruiter if they contact you about a position.Unprofessional, lack of details and will not answer basic questions when you push for details of how the company makes their money. I don't know if they're outright dishonest, but when they tried to get my rate of pay level down, stating it was unmarketable, and I asked if that was because their cut would be less - they wouldn't answer- when I asked how they make their money, they wouldn't answer and told me I was welcome to go to another recruiter.Juvenile and unprofessional at best.I would typically be making phone calls and sending e-mails to potential job seekers in order to discuss with them the job opportunities I had available. This position improved my conversational and listening skills and allowed me to handle multiple tasks at a time successfully.They will say anything to get you onboard. I was sold on taking a contract position with the company at a lower pay than I would normally have accepted because I was told that they had ""excellent benefits"", including medical, dental, a 401(k) and paid Personal Time Off (PTO) even for contract employees. They never sent me any details until after I started. That is when I found that the benefits were prohibitively expensive and Kaztronix did not share in any of the costs. Also, the waiting period was so long that by the time I became eligible for benefits, my three month contract was up. They do have a 401(k) but there is no match. During my contract I did not use any PTO. I had been told that any unused PTO would be paid out when my contract was up. That was a lie. When I called to check on where my PTO check was, I was told that they don't pay accrued leave to contract employees. Stay away, far away from this place.I worked for  this company which is a temp service and they were a good temp. Service to work for . I had to call in my work hours and number of days workedI have nothing but excellent things to report about KAZTRONIX, management identifies with their employees!Kaztronix is a fun environment. I was hired as a recruiter supporting It. The compensation can be excellent if you produce numbers.I love working for Kaztronix.  Co-workers are awesome; they are very helpful, attentive, competitive, creative, hardworking, and just people one would want to hangout with.  Managers, directors, and executives are also awesome; they love to acknowledge people's hard work, they truly appreciate people, they are flexible with one's work life balance, they are understanding, motivating, inspirational, and just good people who promote integrity and honesty.  Never would I have thought I would be thanked for doing my job but that is the type of people they are.  It feels so good to be at the bottom of the chain and hear the words ""thank you"" from the owner of a company.  Management does push one to do their very best, they let one know to be successful one needs to put in extra hours and they are always sure to keep that in mind when one asks for time off or to take care of a personal issue on company time.  They treat you like adults and they know you will make up the time.  Kaztronix is my home and of course things aren't perfect but because of the people I work with and the mentorship they provide, I could never see myself leaving or not giving 100%.  I would say it's a family atmosphere.no paid time off, expensive benefits, poor salary, job description had nothing to do with the actual job.temp assignment, hardest part of the job to know that was only temporaryBusy staffing agency for Government, IT and Pharmaceuticals.",201 to 500,San-Diego,SAN DIEGO,CA,2016-11-22T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/66cefc02-2756-40bc-b1fc-6eaade9f74ed?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=29,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Managed orders, advertising, and collateral for six regional sales managers.Working for BASF there were long work days, old out dated equipment, too many work hazards to name. Most of my co workers were a joy to work with despite the working conditions. Restrooms in my work area were always inoperable. Management expect other work tasks to be performed without training or compensation. There is a two tier employee pay grade....older workers earn $20+ an hour while new hires earn $12+ an hour.Instrumentation and Electrical Tech.  Maintaining all instruments,  wiring,  etc.  Troubleshoot, more troubleshoot,  and fixing of same.  The job is constantly mind challenging in a good way.  Always something new going on.  We are well respected and appreciated. The entire plant treats each other well. Mgmt well responsive to care of family.  BASF offers EXCELLENT benefits at an OUTSTANDING cost.  Mgmt is responsive to our needs in doing our work. BUT,  you MUST be willing to work when you come to work and when a company treats you right and you care about YOUR plant,  that means our crew might be there for 3 extra hours sweaty,  dirty,  hungry until that critical piece of equipment is fixed.Typical day, meet stats. Management has favorites, no place for movement, education maters not experience. Co-workers friendly. Hardest part of job individual Department POLITICS.  Job Life Balance: enjoyed job, co workers, working from home. No job security!!!!  company has started out-sourcing departments.BASF offers great compensation.  The environment can sometime be stressful due to occasional periods of being short staffed.  If you work hard and utilize the company resources, there is a lot to be learned from the dedicated and knowledgeable workforce.Excellent benefits. High level of respect in work environment - can't ask for a better work environment. MIddle management at times lacks direction, but supervisors are very friendly and everyone is very collaborative.Great benefits. Management can set unrealistic expectations. Bad work environment/Cut-throat mentality. Work in all outside conditions was pretty horrible.BASF offers a number of locations and types of businesses; Strong upper level leadership with a very forward looking vision; Many opportunities; promotes from within; good comp and benefits as well as training opportunitiesI am currently working two positions at BASF and I work 12 hour shifts three days on three days off rotating days and nights every three days.  A typical work day entails me first fulfilling my duties as a chemical operator followed by performing safety observation, various data entry, safety research, and removal of safety barriers for my position as Steering Team Facilitator.  Bi-monthly, myself along with members of the Steering Team review data collected over the course of the month and determine team progress and potential safety hazards that require attention.  The hardest part of the role of facilitator is finding time in my busy work day to fulfill the duties of the position in addition to motivating other observers.  The hardest part of the chemical operator position is manufacturing high quality products with aging machinery.  The most enjoyable part of my employment at BASF is seeing the observation process lead to the removal of safety barriers.Management doesn't care much about technicians that do all the work. Salary is low and stays low unless you advance many times. Negotiate your salary high BEFORE you get hired, you won't get another chance. Technicians get the lowest bonus' at $1000/yr.I'm a contractor therefore I do not have the benefits that the company's permanent employees. Laid back and flexible environment. Everyone is willing to train with no problem. Main problem is that the opportunities to become permanent are limited or almost no existent.I had a very busy, high stress, very diversified job. I worked very hard, but I enjoyed it.  I liked my co-workers and had good relationships with everyone.  Of course, I met a great deal of people in my 33-year career, and there was occasionally  a difficult, temperamental person.  I learned how to keep my cool and just do my job.  I learned a great deal over the years in different departments, Accounting, Finance, Purchasing, Sales and Tax.  The most enjoyable part of my job, I think, was my relationship with my co-workers, the different activities provided by the company and my work in the different department I worked in. I also enjoyed meeting and dealing with many different types of people inside and outside of the company.  The hardest part of the job was the amount of work and the many deadlines that I had to meet.  But I learned to work under pressure, and I learned to deal with the stress by prioritizing my duties, and I always met my deadlines.long hours job is dirty. benefits are good pay is good. hardest part of job is standing for long hours. working with others is in my department has been good.Company moved to Mexico. Was the best company I have ever worked for. Great benefits and great work relationships. Very close to my home. Continue to keep in touch with people who still live in New Jersey.Every one seems very nice, but it is not perfect just like any company. Job security is fairly good since the company employs so many people even if your job is being done away with they can find you a different position.they hire mostly contract workers, if your not from the area you don't feel welcome. 12 hr shift rotating days. no benefits to any contract workers.Great Company to work for. Excellent pay and great benefits.  Company offers a ton of perks/discounts and seem to care about the employeesManagement now expects you to live at the site, corporate work life balance policies aren't enforced.  Quality manager is a micromanager know it all. Morale is very low due to constant hire from outside versus promoting from within.Busy environment, Great pay and benefits, Good management typical chemical plant shift work nights and days, very safety oriented very safe plantThis job is just not for everyone. Great pay and benefits but you are required to wear a full face respirator to block harmful chemical materials. Some material is worse than others. If you can make it past the first couple of months this job should be a breeze.Safety is a last concern and everyone fights like its high school. the pay is low and the benefits are very costly and poor. the instrument department is very sad to be around.","10,000+",San-Diego,San Diego,CA,2016-11-03T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/feb43af7-daf2-4c60-9639-3ccd42cb4622?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=30,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

But, the Ag industry in general is in a period of fluxI worked for the company for 10 years and was recently laid off ahead of the Bayer acquisition announcement. It used to be a really great place to work and I enjoyed the people I was working for and with for the most part. Over the past 3 years, the morale has declined significantly, particularly in the Vegetables Division. People weren't being treated with respect and I saw many great assets to the company leave because of it.I learned a lot during my time there, they have awesome benefits in terms of retirement, insurance, paid time off/holidays and such but in the end it doesn't make up for how the organization as a whole treats its employee base. Hopefully the acquisition brings some improvements to the culture.Monsanto is a great place to work if you're seeking to define your career.  The benefits are good and seemingly tailored for families.  The recent flux by restructuring is unfortunate, and it leaves a lot to be desired with job security.  It seems to happen on an annual basis, too.  However, you're free to pursue self-education during your career development and complete your goals by the means you see fit.  You also must excel performing in ambiguous situations and reading conversations.Management is hit-or-miss.  Some managers are excellent while others are less than excellent.  It really depends on who you get.Monsanto is a great place to work, great benefits and safety on and off the job. The only thing is that management will change very often and setting goals was stressfull besides your work you need to do presentations and be involved in committees within the company, they do many trainings in different topics sometimes it's overwhelming.A hands-on working environment offering great experience with quality plant management skills.  Always safety focused with a deep concern for pest management as well as we managed workflows from various growth chambers and greenhouses.Built on observational skills pertaining to plant health.  Time management and communication were a must in managing daily, weekly, and monthly tasks for complex work flows concerning regulated transgenic material.It was a slow day most days, but a good employee will find the job very rewarding regarding benefits and people. There was not alot of work to do in my particular position, but the work I did do, kept the business running. A typical day was just paying any bills that came in the mail and greeting people that came in. Most of the time I was alone due to the other employees working outside of the facility, but most of the time it didn't bother me. I was able to get my work done without much interruption. The environment was very friendly and welcoming. The bosses were very lenient and allowed a lot of leeway when it came to needs outside the office.lots of reorganization and downsizing in progress, lack of consistency between team leads, mgmt has no idea of the reality going on down in the trenches, a lot of good people have left - own their own or with all the layoffs.Evergreen industry requiring constant changes in processes. Role changes every 2-4 years. Diverse environment. Great benefits and holiday calendar. Corporate discounts with various organizations/businesses.Coworkers are in the older crowedYou get exposed to several areas and learnYou have the chance to work in different areas of the companyManagers help you grow professionallyLocation is not greatGreat benefitsGreat vacation timeYou get the chance to interact with several locations around the worldNot all Monsanto plants are the same or do the same work. However, the benefits package & insurance are a definite plus.It is better to work for them in a management or internship rather than basic blue collar. My experience with Monsanto for the first 16 plus years was pretty good. The changes in staff, management, & arrangements with the technology with & for security for the area I am specifically located has hindered more than helped.Great culture and people are passionate about what they do. Benefits are great and great work life balance. People are friendly and very welcomingMonsanto is very active in creating a work culture that is inclusive and progressive. Compensations and work benefits are excellentGood benefits and experience.  Seems to have taken a recent down turn.  Company is managed by Dilbert like people and can be hard to get anything done.Left a great company cause of all the great things ive heard about culture at monsanto, since ive arrived ive seen massive layoffs because of not meeting eps guidance.  IT transformation has been a joke, layoff all competent americans and outsource everything to india so if you rely on IT to succeed youre already set up to fail, IT there is a joke.  Tons of budget cuts cant even get lunches for meetings anymore.  But by far the biggest disappointment is the lousy CEO hugh grant, he passed up the acquisition of syngenta cause hes gutless and then that started a massive industry consolidation.  Syngenta was then bought by chem china and dow and dupont merged and now monsantos getting acquired by foreign german co bayer.  Itll be like inbev all over again, already seeing tons of people leaving and retiring because of it, only reason to stay anymore is if youve worked here too long and have to wait for the package.  I feel bad for new workers coming here now, do your research people.Monsanto is a vibrant facility with a knowledgeable core group of employees who work together to achieve overall satisfaction for the company and business end users. I enjoy the relaxed environment and learning different application functions that help customer's business thrive. The hardest parts of my day are the meetings, but knowing I have a core group I can depend on, I get through my days with a breeze.As an contractor you do not get all the Full time employee benefits, but the day to day life is great. Management mostly treats you as an employee not just a temp. Some of the most compassionate individual I have ever met.Encourage personal development, which is good. Good at innovationChange fastSome management is poorHardworking employeeThe Senior Chemist position at Monsanto consisted of primarily short term problems and mini-projects closely associated with various aspects of dicamba process development and some marketed product support for other products.  Because of the short term nature of the assignments the opportunity for significant contributions, meaningful work experience, learning,  and professional growth was quite limited. This may have more to do with the position being a temporary contract assignment than anything else, but even so for the type of work Monsanto wanted and the manner in which they managed it they would have done just as well to engage a junior chemist.  Lower level management was talented and easy to work with, but they lacked the necessary experience in chemical process development to make sound assessments and correctly management development and manufacturing risk.  Higher level management had little or no commitment to chemistry and inadequate understanding of the company's risk exposure.  Although Monsanto's management and cultural shortcomings were a source of continuing frustration, the culture was very congenial and the work itself--laboratory chemical process development--was enjoyable.Work long 10+ hour days, in which i was in charge of making managerial decisions in a high work flow environment.  Large part of my shift was spent ""putting out fires"" from the previous work group.  Lots of young people to work with (20-35 age group), high demand for workers because of the high turnover rate from 2nd and 3rd shift employees.  The best part about working in this company was the ability to work with cutting edge genetic technology, the worst part was the office politics.Worked there in research for Monsanto for 12 years until it closed in 1992 making chemotherapy drugs military contracts for the navy and air force.

73,5235.0,Associate Scientist,Artech Information Systems,3.8,141.0,"Overall a good experience, some things could have been handled better.  There was no job security and very little interaction directly with Artedh.   There were no other projects that I could be assigned to when my current assignment ended.  As a consultant on site with their client (i.e. revenue generator) the company benefits outside of salary were not there.Artech can get a bad rap from its contractors but for fulltime employees it's a good place with a great culture and good benefits. CEO really cares about employees and if you work hard you'll be rewarded. I'm a corporate employee so my thoughts may differ from those in regional offices.A typical day was started at 8 AM with a meeting about the workload and priorities of the day. We head home around 430 PM each day. While I was employed I learned a great deal about remote administration in the Windows environment, as well as configuring User accounts and network resources within Active Directory. Artech is a contracting firm. The only communication I had with management was when they changed the terms of my contract and wanted to pay me less. I did not have any fellow Artech employees working with me. The hardest part of the job was being discouraged from finding solutions to base wide computer problems. One time I was actually told that a certain platform would not be of concern several months down the road so do not worry about employing a fix for the end User. Easily, the most enjoyable part of the job is hearing the customer say their computer has never run so well after you've worked your magic.This is not a great company to work for, they are unethical and treat the employees and contractors bad. They promise you a salary when you first speak with them but when the job offer comes it is lower. i would never recommend this company.Good contracting agency. The company does a really good job the first time you gain a contract through them. They took good care of me when i needed anything or had any concerns. The only (sole) disappointment is that after my contract was complete, I was no longer able to get responses from the local recruiters to find additional contracts for work.I was able to gain many new skills during my 15 months in this role and every day was different. I supported three members of the communications department team and learned how to be a team player while completing a personal workload of local events and different communication tasks at the same time. Writing was a huge part of this role, both in short form event invitations and long form editorial articles. I was responsible for updating our company website and site televisions with new editorial content each week, which meant that I had to maintain a working knowledge of the technical systems used for posting new material. I coordinated with outside vendors for internal company events and partnered with other departments like HR and IT for news stories and program launches. Being in communications meant that you worked with every employee in some capacity. It was very much like being the glue of the company culture.This role truly gave me perspective on what it means to develop a business plan, provide the resources to execute that plan, follow through with those resources, and summarize your results. The most important part of that process is analyzing the steps and finding what can be improved for the next time around.I only worked with this agent a short time.  I found it difficult to understand the recruiters when speaking with them due to heavy foreign accents, however the written communications gave clearer understanding of project and requirements.Artech placed me in IBM originally and was wonderful to work for.  Time sheets were easy to fill out and submit electronically, and while I was there, a 401K offering was created.   Very positive.An interesting and enjoyable place to work.  I talked to people in far away places.  I worked with people in upper managementand learned much from them.If you work at Artech, you have to believe in yourself because management can make you question your abilities. People are underpaid for the amount of work that is expected of them.I think they need to appreciate their employees more. I have seen too many good people leave and management doesn't seem to care.I wish management would listen to its employees. For example, there are managers who aren't totally present when you meet with them. They are either too busy answering emails, doing work in front of you, which makes you feel completely disrespected.Co-workers are great. The job itself is enjoyable, but they need to provide more resources so people don't have to do other people's jobs, which affects the job that they were hired for in the first place.I was a contract employee for 2 years.  I was disappointed that I never heard a word near the end of my contract about other contract possibilities. After 2 years I thought that maybe they would like to pick me up on another contact for another company in the area since they were familiar with my work.  I had discussed it with the main office 4 or 5 months earlier but I never heard another word about it.  I really enjoyed working with Artech, I would work for them again.I really enjoyed working at Harley-Davidson for the CEO with Artech.  I learned new computer skills and utilized the skills I had in preparing PowerPoint presentations and handling other special projects on a daily basis.  My supervisor was awesome and the hardest part of the job was leaving due to budget cuts.  I would consider another contract with Artech again!Didn't last as long as expected.  Contract position.  Pay and benefits were decent.  HR was easy to work with.  Opportunity to learn about the health care industry.I ensured end of day (EOD) processes completed properly.Investigated and corrected promotions that were abending or lost.Corrected and deployed price fixes for the system and/or individual stores.  I enjoyed working with the people; wish the contract was longer and that new development was done.Work days are typically 10 to 12 hours per day.  Learned healthcare version of project management.  Co-workers are helpful.  Hardest part of the job is the drive (distance).  Most enjoyable part of the job is knowing what I produce for the healthcare provider is towards the service for the patients.Working at this company, nobody is looking over your shoulder, just as long as you know what you're doing and finished your work on time. You just need to be productive.I really give HIGH Praise for Artech and the staff member there placing me with a IT Job will IBM.  I really love my job and I'm working in the area which I'm proud to be part of.  I say Thank You to ArtechThey are very professional and helpful in their field. They are very informative and knowledgeable in order to reach their goals on time.Artech is a great employer. They always support their employees and help employees grow and learn.They could do better when it comes to their quickness to respond, but it's understandable since they have such a high number of employees.  A typical day consists of supporting the client and ensuring you're available for any concerns or needs that may need to be addressed immediately.Perform to Support Medical-Perfusion System production floor, Engineer projects, conducts preventive maintenance on all equipment to help people to find the jobs.Professional, Enjoyable staff, supportive.

Without good management, there isn't growth for employees.This is a great company with smart, hard-working people. The company has never evolved a development plan or path for motivated employees, advancement is often about self-promotion.Great company culture, great people, everyday is a new day very dynamic and awesome. I like the working environment and people who are always willing you help out whenever.Very innovative and encouraging group to work with.Learned alot in terms of bringing productivity.Mentored junior level canditates on ETL  technical skills.It all depends on what department or team you are with, but I had wonderful time working there.  Interned at marketing department for a few month and everyone was nice and they are all more than willing to help you out.  Vertex really does value your work/life balance and I really felt like I was treated as a valuable asset to the company.Vertex pharmaceuticals has a very welcoming and warm environment. A typical day for me involves many interactions with clients and customers, dealing with on-your-toes situations, working on promotions for our service, organizing BEOs, managing my catering team and making sure our operation runs smoothly and effectively. I have learned many management and communications skills, organizational tactics, and overall business processes and etiquette. My managers are great teachers who set examples for the rest of our staff to follow. A lot of what I have learned is because of their endless efforts to teach me something new every day. Other than my managers, the rest of my co-workers help to create a fun yet productive environment. Usually, the hardest part of my day isn't a single task, but working at a minimum, 11 hour days. This can be tiresome, at times, although necessary. On the contrary, the best part of my job is getting to build relations with our clients on a daily basis.Great BenefitsInnovative companySmart peopleNice placeI have learned a lot working at this place. Good coworkersGood peopleexcellent company to work for, great atmosphere, locality is key.  there is a lot of immature people and who have to be in a group to be happy..I was on a temp to hire assignment there that did not work out.  Vertex treated their temps just as they treated their full time employees, which was really great.  A lot of great perks were offered (fitness center being one of them) that I took advantage of even though I was a temp worker.  I was very interested in becomming a full time employee.Vertex had two drugs approved during my 7 years there and the stock went from $22 when I started to $143 at one point in 2015. Vertex has fantastic benefits and I met and worked with a lot of wonderful people.Working at Vertex has been a great experience! The people are all there for the same reason, to help patients with cystic fibrosis and they do every day! I've learned so much, not only from my managers but from my co-workers. Everyone is helpful should you ask questions about what they do or how your position fits into the bigger scheme of the company.Worked as a contract staff and it was difficult to mingle with the full time staff. Offices moved to Boston from Cambridge making the commute harder.Vertex is a great company to work for. A fast pace environment The atmospher is greatThis was a great place to work. Unfortunately I was finished with my contract here.I would not recommend working for Vertex, have been with the organization for over two years and just gets worse, not better- Management is all talk. Do NOT recommend working within the procurement and sourcing group.very busy in and out procedure rooms supporting researchers. I have learned that communication, pay close attention to instructions giving is very important. I worked with very open minded individuals where we shared and trained each other on different procedures and techniques to continue with good training. the hardest part is when researchers and scientist schedules last minute things. I get to have close communications with my co-workers, work closely and learn from each other.Atmosphere was very good, co workers very well liked as well as Management.  Amex is a very good company long term to work for.Company makes business decisions suddenly, without regard for long-term outlook or their reputation. They pay well but don't promote appropriately.  People are given new titles that don't accurately reflect their job duties, essentially demoting them with no consideration how this will affect their resumes. They pay lip service to ""job/life balance"" but treat people as disposable. Not a happy place to work.colleagues appreciated hard-working contributers. Vertex rewarded team for efforts, while keeping patients needs top of mind.  was well respected by healthcare providers, worked with highly competent colleaguesVertex Pharmaceuticals is a very unstable company, where there is some sort of reorganization several times a year. You may not be performing the work that you were hired to do. They boast about a flexible work schedule; however, they do not practice this. Everything is in favor of upper management (training, time off, work from home, etc.). Overall Vertex does not practice what they preach.job is great but constant layoffs, firings and fear of job security.","1,001 to 5,000",San-Diego,San Diego,CA,2016-05-19T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/ebe15473-0dfc-45f7-ae43-e63e4df6c9d0?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
