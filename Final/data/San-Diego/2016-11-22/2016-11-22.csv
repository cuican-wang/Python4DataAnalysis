57,5219.0,Scientist-II,Kaztronix LLC,3.2,18.0,"I like to be busy.I typically am accountable (and hands on) for:*Systems Analysis*Specification Collection*Project Management*QA Management and*Training to targeted audiences.""You do crazy really well!""I agree.   I like to know what is going on with every aspect of the project I'm working.I've been exposed to dysfunctional teams and have worked hard to rebuild trust and create a combined, open relationship were contention previously existed.I've learned that individual team members have unique preferences which I try to respect to ensure I, in turn, get the information or work completed as required.I enjoy working on fast-paced assignments and meeting all the persons who contribute to the success of the initiative.The hardest part of the job is knowing that most of the employees on a project team already have full-time, day jobs.Anything I request related to a new initiative/project is above and beyond their daily workload.    I try to mitigate stress on these employees by negotiating deadlines that work for everyone.These employees do not report to me, so there is no other incentive to 'play nice' together other than to respect the team and deliver what I promise, earning their respect.The Company was Great. The contract job they had was not what I was initially told. Thats how the military works for you. They contract you for network engineer but the position doesn't do any networking period. Its a sit and monitoring position No fault to kaztronix at all great company they just need accurate descriptions of their contracts so they know exactly what they are sending their people to do.Kaztronix is an intermediary that places contractors with clients.  I was contracted through Kaztronix as a project manager.  The account manager was fine in terms of setting up the interview with the client and occasionally following up once the gig started.  Other than onboarding and separation, I had virtually no contact with Kaztronix.  I did get paid on time.Here's the warning: Beware all aspects of the HR department, which is terrible -- all slots seemed to be staffed by first-job employees, none of whom seem to know their business.  There were delays in the start date, due to HR's inability to get a background check done on time.  There were multiple requests from them for the same information and once it got booted to someone else in the chain, it had to be resubmitted again.Upon separation, I received no customary HR separation package of paperwork -- just a one page COBRA notice.  They did not process my 401(k) transfer request in a timely fashion, which literally cost me some money.There are a lot better contractor firms out there.  Take my advice and look for one.I was fortunate enough to experience this company only through the interview process. I have two masters degrees from a tier one school, and they contacted me about possible placement in the NYC JNJ office. The first impression I had was awful. It sounded like someone from Mumbai was calling me. I could hardly understand them. The contract rate that was our agreement was dropped by 30 percent post interview. It made the possibility of even working for them impossible. They're just another greedy contract recruiter to leach off educated people in pharma. Stay far away.I worked for Kaztronix LLC. out of  McLean VA. for 2 1/2 years. I worked in the Dallas Texas area. (several hundred miles away)They where great to work for. Any time I had a problem, it was handled Very promptly. The pay was good.The people where friendly.I could not ask for better people to work for.I have been a contractor for 2 years at Kaztronix.. They have been fantastic because not only did they find me a job, they communicated how/ what I needed to accomplish and improve upon while on the job. In two months I'm projected to be converted to an FTE.. I would never had this opportunity if wasn't for Kaztronix. Other Agencies don't communicate with their contract employees..The overall atmosphere is  lively and fun! The opportunity for advancement is super attainable and can happen based on performance . My coworkers are helpful and constantly provide guidance and assistanceRun as fast as you can with this miss leading company. I work for them and what a big mistake on my part. There health ins.is way to costly and there is a contractor  by the name of crossfire that has a way better health ins and they get  you more money to work for them.Kraztronix does not care about you or me all they want is there money. I refer people to crossfire because Kaztronix does not want to pay you the referral money. They come up with a lame excuse to why they don't have to pay you.They tell you what you want to hear and they never back it up .Get every thing in writing from this company.I WELL NEVER REFERR ANY ONE TO THIS COMPANY.I REFERR THEM TO OTHER CONTRACTORS LIKE CROSSFIRE.Stay away. Seek an alternative recruiter if they contact you about a position.Unprofessional, lack of details and will not answer basic questions when you push for details of how the company makes their money. I don't know if they're outright dishonest, but when they tried to get my rate of pay level down, stating it was unmarketable, and I asked if that was because their cut would be less - they wouldn't answer- when I asked how they make their money, they wouldn't answer and told me I was welcome to go to another recruiter.Juvenile and unprofessional at best.I would typically be making phone calls and sending e-mails to potential job seekers in order to discuss with them the job opportunities I had available. This position improved my conversational and listening skills and allowed me to handle multiple tasks at a time successfully.They will say anything to get you onboard. I was sold on taking a contract position with the company at a lower pay than I would normally have accepted because I was told that they had ""excellent benefits"", including medical, dental, a 401(k) and paid Personal Time Off (PTO) even for contract employees. They never sent me any details until after I started. That is when I found that the benefits were prohibitively expensive and Kaztronix did not share in any of the costs. Also, the waiting period was so long that by the time I became eligible for benefits, my three month contract was up. They do have a 401(k) but there is no match. During my contract I did not use any PTO. I had been told that any unused PTO would be paid out when my contract was up. That was a lie. When I called to check on where my PTO check was, I was told that they don't pay accrued leave to contract employees. Stay away, far away from this place.I worked for  this company which is a temp service and they were a good temp. Service to work for . I had to call in my work hours and number of days workedI have nothing but excellent things to report about KAZTRONIX, management identifies with their employees!Kaztronix is a fun environment. I was hired as a recruiter supporting It. The compensation can be excellent if you produce numbers.I love working for Kaztronix.  Co-workers are awesome; they are very helpful, attentive, competitive, creative, hardworking, and just people one would want to hangout with.  Managers, directors, and executives are also awesome; they love to acknowledge people's hard work, they truly appreciate people, they are flexible with one's work life balance, they are understanding, motivating, inspirational, and just good people who promote integrity and honesty.  Never would I have thought I would be thanked for doing my job but that is the type of people they are.  It feels so good to be at the bottom of the chain and hear the words ""thank you"" from the owner of a company.  Management does push one to do their very best, they let one know to be successful one needs to put in extra hours and they are always sure to keep that in mind when one asks for time off or to take care of a personal issue on company time.  They treat you like adults and they know you will make up the time.  Kaztronix is my home and of course things aren't perfect but because of the people I work with and the mentorship they provide, I could never see myself leaving or not giving 100%.  I would say it's a family atmosphere.no paid time off, expensive benefits, poor salary, job description had nothing to do with the actual job.temp assignment, hardest part of the job to know that was only temporaryBusy staffing agency for Government, IT and Pharmaceuticals.",201 to 500,San-Diego,SAN DIEGO,CA,2016-11-22T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/66cefc02-2756-40bc-b1fc-6eaade9f74ed?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=29,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
