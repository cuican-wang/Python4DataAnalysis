67,5229.0,Computational Microbiologist,Monsanto,4.2,499.0,"Long work daysGet people to work withGet to work outsideAt the end of pollination there is a pizza partyget to listen to your own musicHardest part is being out in the heat of summerget to work with your friendsPay was good and benefits and Bonuses were exemplary.  profit sharing and stock options also good.  Long hours were sometimes hard, but they were mostly seasonal and got better with management adjustments.You have to like working outside in the heat and dust much of the year, but it IS farming, even if its research.  I enjoyed the active lifestyle.  There was a lot of pressure due to tight deadlines, but it was exciting and seldom got boring.Corporate restructuring has led to a large number of layoffs (Mine included) and I 'm sure the recent Buy-out by BAYER will shake things up even more.  But, the Ag industry in general is in a period of fluxI worked for the company for 10 years and was recently laid off ahead of the Bayer acquisition announcement. It used to be a really great place to work and I enjoyed the people I was working for and with for the most part. Over the past 3 years, the morale has declined significantly, particularly in the Vegetables Division. People weren't being treated with respect and I saw many great assets to the company leave because of it.I learned a lot during my time there, they have awesome benefits in terms of retirement, insurance, paid time off/holidays and such but in the end it doesn't make up for how the organization as a whole treats its employee base. Hopefully the acquisition brings some improvements to the culture.Monsanto is a great place to work if you're seeking to define your career.  The benefits are good and seemingly tailored for families.  The recent flux by restructuring is unfortunate, and it leaves a lot to be desired with job security.  It seems to happen on an annual basis, too.  However, you're free to pursue self-education during your career development and complete your goals by the means you see fit.  You also must excel performing in ambiguous situations and reading conversations.Management is hit-or-miss.  Some managers are excellent while others are less than excellent.  It really depends on who you get.Monsanto is a great place to work, great benefits and safety on and off the job. The only thing is that management will change very often and setting goals was stressfull besides your work you need to do presentations and be involved in committees within the company, they do many trainings in different topics sometimes it's overwhelming.A hands-on working environment offering great experience with quality plant management skills.  Always safety focused with a deep concern for pest management as well as we managed workflows from various growth chambers and greenhouses.Built on observational skills pertaining to plant health.  Time management and communication were a must in managing daily, weekly, and monthly tasks for complex work flows concerning regulated transgenic material.It was a slow day most days, but a good employee will find the job very rewarding regarding benefits and people. There was not alot of work to do in my particular position, but the work I did do, kept the business running. A typical day was just paying any bills that came in the mail and greeting people that came in. Most of the time I was alone due to the other employees working outside of the facility, but most of the time it didn't bother me. I was able to get my work done without much interruption. The environment was very friendly and welcoming. The bosses were very lenient and allowed a lot of leeway when it came to needs outside the office.lots of reorganization and downsizing in progress, lack of consistency between team leads, mgmt has no idea of the reality going on down in the trenches, a lot of good people have left - own their own or with all the layoffs.Evergreen industry requiring constant changes in processes. Role changes every 2-4 years. Diverse environment. Great benefits and holiday calendar. Corporate discounts with various organizations/businesses.Coworkers are in the older crowedYou get exposed to several areas and learnYou have the chance to work in different areas of the companyManagers help you grow professionallyLocation is not greatGreat benefitsGreat vacation timeYou get the chance to interact with several locations around the worldNot all Monsanto plants are the same or do the same work. However, the benefits package & insurance are a definite plus.It is better to work for them in a management or internship rather than basic blue collar. My experience with Monsanto for the first 16 plus years was pretty good. The changes in staff, management, & arrangements with the technology with & for security for the area I am specifically located has hindered more than helped.Great culture and people are passionate about what they do. Benefits are great and great work life balance. People are friendly and very welcomingMonsanto is very active in creating a work culture that is inclusive and progressive. Compensations and work benefits are excellentGood benefits and experience.  Seems to have taken a recent down turn.  Company is managed by Dilbert like people and can be hard to get anything done.Left a great company cause of all the great things ive heard about culture at monsanto, since ive arrived ive seen massive layoffs because of not meeting eps guidance.  IT transformation has been a joke, layoff all competent americans and outsource everything to india so if you rely on IT to succeed youre already set up to fail, IT there is a joke.  Tons of budget cuts cant even get lunches for meetings anymore.  But by far the biggest disappointment is the lousy CEO hugh grant, he passed up the acquisition of syngenta cause hes gutless and then that started a massive industry consolidation.  Syngenta was then bought by chem china and dow and dupont merged and now monsantos getting acquired by foreign german co bayer.  Itll be like inbev all over again, already seeing tons of people leaving and retiring because of it, only reason to stay anymore is if youve worked here too long and have to wait for the package.  I feel bad for new workers coming here now, do your research people.Monsanto is a vibrant facility with a knowledgeable core group of employees who work together to achieve overall satisfaction for the company and business end users. I enjoy the relaxed environment and learning different application functions that help customer's business thrive. The hardest parts of my day are the meetings, but knowing I have a core group I can depend on, I get through my days with a breeze.As an contractor you do not get all the Full time employee benefits, but the day to day life is great. Management mostly treats you as an employee not just a temp. Some of the most compassionate individual I have ever met.Encourage personal development, which is good. Good at innovationChange fastSome management is poorHardworking employeeThe Senior Chemist position at Monsanto consisted of primarily short term problems and mini-projects closely associated with various aspects of dicamba process development and some marketed product support for other products.  Because of the short term nature of the assignments the opportunity for significant contributions, meaningful work experience, learning,  and professional growth was quite limited. This may have more to do with the position being a temporary contract assignment than anything else, but even so for the type of work Monsanto wanted and the manner in which they managed it they would have done just as well to engage a junior chemist.  Lower level management was talented and easy to work with, but they lacked the necessary experience in chemical process development to make sound assessments and correctly management development and manufacturing risk.  Higher level management had little or no commitment to chemistry and inadequate understanding of the company's risk exposure.  Although Monsanto's management and cultural shortcomings were a source of continuing frustration, the culture was very congenial and the work itself--laboratory chemical process development--was enjoyable.Work long 10+ hour days, in which i was in charge of making managerial decisions in a high work flow environment.  Large part of my shift was spent ""putting out fires"" from the previous work group.  Lots of young people to work with (20-35 age group), high demand for workers because of the high turnover rate from 2nd and 3rd shift employees.  The best part about working in this company was the ability to work with cutting edge genetic technology, the worst part was the office politics.Worked there in research for Monsanto for 12 years until it closed in 1992 making chemotherapy drugs military contracts for the navy and air force.
