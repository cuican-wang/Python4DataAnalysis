58,5220.0,"Scientist II, San Diego",BASF,4.2,1000.0,"Dealt with a high volume of inbound calls from clients across the country.  Managed orders, advertising, and collateral for six regional sales managers.Working for BASF there were long work days, old out dated equipment, too many work hazards to name. Most of my co workers were a joy to work with despite the working conditions. Restrooms in my work area were always inoperable. Management expect other work tasks to be performed without training or compensation. There is a two tier employee pay grade....older workers earn $20+ an hour while new hires earn $12+ an hour.Instrumentation and Electrical Tech.  Maintaining all instruments,  wiring,  etc.  Troubleshoot, more troubleshoot,  and fixing of same.  The job is constantly mind challenging in a good way.  Always something new going on.  We are well respected and appreciated. The entire plant treats each other well. Mgmt well responsive to care of family.  BASF offers EXCELLENT benefits at an OUTSTANDING cost.  Mgmt is responsive to our needs in doing our work. BUT,  you MUST be willing to work when you come to work and when a company treats you right and you care about YOUR plant,  that means our crew might be there for 3 extra hours sweaty,  dirty,  hungry until that critical piece of equipment is fixed.Typical day, meet stats. Management has favorites, no place for movement, education maters not experience. Co-workers friendly. Hardest part of job individual Department POLITICS.  Job Life Balance: enjoyed job, co workers, working from home. No job security!!!!  company has started out-sourcing departments.BASF offers great compensation.  The environment can sometime be stressful due to occasional periods of being short staffed.  If you work hard and utilize the company resources, there is a lot to be learned from the dedicated and knowledgeable workforce.Excellent benefits. High level of respect in work environment - can't ask for a better work environment. MIddle management at times lacks direction, but supervisors are very friendly and everyone is very collaborative.Great benefits. Management can set unrealistic expectations. Bad work environment/Cut-throat mentality. Work in all outside conditions was pretty horrible.BASF offers a number of locations and types of businesses; Strong upper level leadership with a very forward looking vision; Many opportunities; promotes from within; good comp and benefits as well as training opportunitiesI am currently working two positions at BASF and I work 12 hour shifts three days on three days off rotating days and nights every three days.  A typical work day entails me first fulfilling my duties as a chemical operator followed by performing safety observation, various data entry, safety research, and removal of safety barriers for my position as Steering Team Facilitator.  Bi-monthly, myself along with members of the Steering Team review data collected over the course of the month and determine team progress and potential safety hazards that require attention.  The hardest part of the role of facilitator is finding time in my busy work day to fulfill the duties of the position in addition to motivating other observers.  The hardest part of the chemical operator position is manufacturing high quality products with aging machinery.  The most enjoyable part of my employment at BASF is seeing the observation process lead to the removal of safety barriers.Management doesn't care much about technicians that do all the work. Salary is low and stays low unless you advance many times. Negotiate your salary high BEFORE you get hired, you won't get another chance. Technicians get the lowest bonus' at $1000/yr.I'm a contractor therefore I do not have the benefits that the company's permanent employees. Laid back and flexible environment. Everyone is willing to train with no problem. Main problem is that the opportunities to become permanent are limited or almost no existent.I had a very busy, high stress, very diversified job. I worked very hard, but I enjoyed it.  I liked my co-workers and had good relationships with everyone.  Of course, I met a great deal of people in my 33-year career, and there was occasionally  a difficult, temperamental person.  I learned how to keep my cool and just do my job.  I learned a great deal over the years in different departments, Accounting, Finance, Purchasing, Sales and Tax.  The most enjoyable part of my job, I think, was my relationship with my co-workers, the different activities provided by the company and my work in the different department I worked in. I also enjoyed meeting and dealing with many different types of people inside and outside of the company.  The hardest part of the job was the amount of work and the many deadlines that I had to meet.  But I learned to work under pressure, and I learned to deal with the stress by prioritizing my duties, and I always met my deadlines.long hours job is dirty. benefits are good pay is good. hardest part of job is standing for long hours. working with others is in my department has been good.Company moved to Mexico. Was the best company I have ever worked for. Great benefits and great work relationships. Very close to my home. Continue to keep in touch with people who still live in New Jersey.Every one seems very nice, but it is not perfect just like any company. Job security is fairly good since the company employs so many people even if your job is being done away with they can find you a different position.they hire mostly contract workers, if your not from the area you don't feel welcome. 12 hr shift rotating days. no benefits to any contract workers.Great Company to work for. Excellent pay and great benefits.  Company offers a ton of perks/discounts and seem to care about the employeesManagement now expects you to live at the site, corporate work life balance policies aren't enforced.  Quality manager is a micromanager know it all. Morale is very low due to constant hire from outside versus promoting from within.Busy environment, Great pay and benefits, Good management typical chemical plant shift work nights and days, very safety oriented very safe plantThis job is just not for everyone. Great pay and benefits but you are required to wear a full face respirator to block harmful chemical materials. Some material is worse than others. If you can make it past the first couple of months this job should be a breeze.Safety is a last concern and everyone fights like its high school. the pay is low and the benefits are very costly and poor. the instrument department is very sad to be around.","10,000+",San-Diego,San Diego,CA,2016-11-03T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/feb43af7-daf2-4c60-9639-3ccd42cb4622?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=30,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
