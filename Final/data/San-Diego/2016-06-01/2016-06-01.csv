73,5235.0,Associate Scientist,Artech Information Systems,3.8,141.0,"Overall a good experience, some things could have been handled better.  There was no job security and very little interaction directly with Artedh.   There were no other projects that I could be assigned to when my current assignment ended.  As a consultant on site with their client (i.e. revenue generator) the company benefits outside of salary were not there.Artech can get a bad rap from its contractors but for fulltime employees it's a good place with a great culture and good benefits. CEO really cares about employees and if you work hard you'll be rewarded. I'm a corporate employee so my thoughts may differ from those in regional offices.A typical day was started at 8 AM with a meeting about the workload and priorities of the day. We head home around 430 PM each day. While I was employed I learned a great deal about remote administration in the Windows environment, as well as configuring User accounts and network resources within Active Directory. Artech is a contracting firm. The only communication I had with management was when they changed the terms of my contract and wanted to pay me less. I did not have any fellow Artech employees working with me. The hardest part of the job was being discouraged from finding solutions to base wide computer problems. One time I was actually told that a certain platform would not be of concern several months down the road so do not worry about employing a fix for the end User. Easily, the most enjoyable part of the job is hearing the customer say their computer has never run so well after you've worked your magic.This is not a great company to work for, they are unethical and treat the employees and contractors bad. They promise you a salary when you first speak with them but when the job offer comes it is lower. i would never recommend this company.Good contracting agency. The company does a really good job the first time you gain a contract through them. They took good care of me when i needed anything or had any concerns. The only (sole) disappointment is that after my contract was complete, I was no longer able to get responses from the local recruiters to find additional contracts for work.I was able to gain many new skills during my 15 months in this role and every day was different. I supported three members of the communications department team and learned how to be a team player while completing a personal workload of local events and different communication tasks at the same time. Writing was a huge part of this role, both in short form event invitations and long form editorial articles. I was responsible for updating our company website and site televisions with new editorial content each week, which meant that I had to maintain a working knowledge of the technical systems used for posting new material. I coordinated with outside vendors for internal company events and partnered with other departments like HR and IT for news stories and program launches. Being in communications meant that you worked with every employee in some capacity. It was very much like being the glue of the company culture.This role truly gave me perspective on what it means to develop a business plan, provide the resources to execute that plan, follow through with those resources, and summarize your results. The most important part of that process is analyzing the steps and finding what can be improved for the next time around.I only worked with this agent a short time.  I found it difficult to understand the recruiters when speaking with them due to heavy foreign accents, however the written communications gave clearer understanding of project and requirements.Artech placed me in IBM originally and was wonderful to work for.  Time sheets were easy to fill out and submit electronically, and while I was there, a 401K offering was created.   Very positive.An interesting and enjoyable place to work.  I talked to people in far away places.  I worked with people in upper managementand learned much from them.If you work at Artech, you have to believe in yourself because management can make you question your abilities. People are underpaid for the amount of work that is expected of them.I think they need to appreciate their employees more. I have seen too many good people leave and management doesn't seem to care.I wish management would listen to its employees. For example, there are managers who aren't totally present when you meet with them. They are either too busy answering emails, doing work in front of you, which makes you feel completely disrespected.Co-workers are great. The job itself is enjoyable, but they need to provide more resources so people don't have to do other people's jobs, which affects the job that they were hired for in the first place.I was a contract employee for 2 years.  I was disappointed that I never heard a word near the end of my contract about other contract possibilities. After 2 years I thought that maybe they would like to pick me up on another contact for another company in the area since they were familiar with my work.  I had discussed it with the main office 4 or 5 months earlier but I never heard another word about it.  I really enjoyed working with Artech, I would work for them again.I really enjoyed working at Harley-Davidson for the CEO with Artech.  I learned new computer skills and utilized the skills I had in preparing PowerPoint presentations and handling other special projects on a daily basis.  My supervisor was awesome and the hardest part of the job was leaving due to budget cuts.  I would consider another contract with Artech again!Didn't last as long as expected.  Contract position.  Pay and benefits were decent.  HR was easy to work with.  Opportunity to learn about the health care industry.I ensured end of day (EOD) processes completed properly.Investigated and corrected promotions that were abending or lost.Corrected and deployed price fixes for the system and/or individual stores.  I enjoyed working with the people; wish the contract was longer and that new development was done.Work days are typically 10 to 12 hours per day.  Learned healthcare version of project management.  Co-workers are helpful.  Hardest part of the job is the drive (distance).  Most enjoyable part of the job is knowing what I produce for the healthcare provider is towards the service for the patients.Working at this company, nobody is looking over your shoulder, just as long as you know what you're doing and finished your work on time. You just need to be productive.I really give HIGH Praise for Artech and the staff member there placing me with a IT Job will IBM.  I really love my job and I'm working in the area which I'm proud to be part of.  I say Thank You to ArtechThey are very professional and helpful in their field. They are very informative and knowledgeable in order to reach their goals on time.Artech is a great employer. They always support their employees and help employees grow and learn.They could do better when it comes to their quickness to respond, but it's understandable since they have such a high number of employees.  A typical day consists of supporting the client and ensuring you're available for any concerns or needs that may need to be addressed immediately.Perform to Support Medical-Perfusion System production floor, Engineer projects, conducts preventive maintenance on all equipment to help people to find the jobs.Professional, Enjoyable staff, supportive. This is a recruiting and staffing agency with a strong relationship with the client.",,San-Diego,San Diego,CA,2016-06-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/00cde05c-ab22-4ac5-9c43-7081fc373948?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
