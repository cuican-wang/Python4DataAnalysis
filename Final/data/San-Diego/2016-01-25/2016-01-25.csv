54,5216.0,Bioinformatician / Computational Biologist,"Kelly Services, Inc.",3.9,7100.0,"great company to work with I have no complains they are there when need to seek a opportunity down of it just short terms. excellent staff member there i would recommend it to any one out there with the experience I had.The typical workday with this agency was quite regular as a 9 to 5..  Working for different companies afforded the ability to experience company cultures, different businesses, and different locations to work,  The management changed a bit more than other companies, however,  the company kept their protocols in place.  Co-workers were diverse, skilled, and non-skilled labor, corporate, retail, and service workers, of every level, in many different companies.  The hardest part of the job was that you could be called to go work in a very short time span, as well as, the pay was average.  The flexibility of making the decision to work when you decided, along with experiencing different companies and different people was by far the absolutely best part of the jobs with this company.A productive work place with repetitive work.Good friendly people but alot of workplace drama. Good work schedule with a constant flow and adequate lunch breaks.Horrible temp company. They do not care about there employees. You will not advance being a temp employee at any job being through this company. All they do is look to make money off of having you as an employeeGreat company overall not many flaws. Great coworkers and good work atmosphere. Employers are very kind and help out with all your needs. Can improve on hiring process though.Its a fantastic way to find temporary work. lower ratings in some areas are to be expected as that of a temp service. Typically Kelly's agents act with a high amount of professionalism and kindness.I have always been a factory, warehouse worker type person and the transition to an office environment answering phone calls is very different.  I have worked as a cashier and have customer experience but taking phone calls of upset customers every so often is overwhelming at first. I have learned that I cannot take it personal which is not easy on some calls, however, there it is a joy in talking to new people everyday. You met some really unique people of all ages.My co-workers are great, we talk a little when there is no calls and it is nice to just relax and talk about the job or what is going on around us. A typical day in the call center is taking almost 60 to 80 calls a day. Helping customers with their recalled item. Most of the time is rather relaxing until an irate customer calls and complains about how they are being treated and how unfair their situation is. I understand their frustration and try to fix their problem quick and easy if at all possible. Not all callers get the answer they are looking for and I do the best I can until I have run out of options to get their problem the solution it needs. All in all it is okay but some days it is very difficult.I enjoyed my time with Kelly Services. The recruiters were very friendly and helpful. They always tried to match a job to my skill level and encouraged me to try new things. They were always available to help with answers to questions I might have about a position or driving distance to an assignment.Kelly services has many jobs. It is like indeed. They get back with you. The facility is nice and so are the people. I believe they maybe under a new company.While my contact with them is minimal, they are the access to the project work I am doing and it's pretty seamless. I have been impressed with the level of communication I receive from them.Co-workers were great, however when it came to Kelly Services and how their reaction was to the people they hired - they seem to want the extreme out of them.The job was wonderful, I met new people and my peers were excellent. but when it came down to getting a hold of Kelly Services to explain what was going on I didn't know really who to report to.Need better Management team in there New Mexico location.  Little to no benefits during my last two year contract. There were no jobs available after my contract Expired. The position itself was a great experience.The workers are good and kind. They provide excellent customer service and know how to take care of issues when they occur. The people in the office were well respective and always remembered to treat you as a member of the team.Co-workers are amazing but the management is poor which provides for a very negative work environment. The work itself provides for quick burn out and little reward especially as far as receiving competitive wages and recognition.Check in with front office at the school, get keys to the classroom. Got to classroom find instructions and roll call sheets. Make sure all classes are accounted for. Assign work and follow schedule for the day. at the end of the day return keys sign out and go home.If you need to make extra money with the overtime you do at this place you will help you.  a lot of safety consciousness, like to keep people away from danger.I got ripped off numerous times from my paycheck and they don't take your work experience into account plus not finding full-time work I would not recommend this place to anyoneThis was a temp agency for staffing various jobs for those of us who needed a temp job before landing FT employment.  Not something to do as a career.Just don't.  Money flow issues, management issues.  Unable to order parts, unable to get quotes. Boss left to work in a different city, and rarely returns to check on things.They really helped me get started and gave me a clear job description. I have not had to have much contact with them after the initial start up.","5,001 to 10,000",San-Diego,San Diego,CA,2016-01-25T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/8fbc8449-7dbf-4102-bee8-59d24bfd8c3a?mescoid=1900245001001&jobPosition=26,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
