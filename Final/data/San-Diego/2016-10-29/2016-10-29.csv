They do help a lot with my experiences, as far as providing reminders for required information, helped me through training etc....Manager is very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of being a contractor is you are always running with a higher productivity standard. The most enjoyable part of the job is you got a little bit of everything throughout your experience.Great work environment, employees are hugely appreciated by the employers",,San-Diego,San Diego,CA,2016-10-29T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/ac94b803-c3d7-4d41-8e90-0b818b207b27?mescoid=1900259001001&jobPosition=10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
