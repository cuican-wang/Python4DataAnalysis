52,5214.0,Staff Scientist 1,"Affymetrix, Inc.",3.8,26.0,"Affymetrix was acquired by another company so they are no longer in business,Once acquired the business was merged into the new companyCompany had a great work life balance.Given the opportunity to understand their products and how to use that knowledge when re-implementing Xactly.Able to work with management,Allowed my staff the ability to work with implementing the Xactly system for their future skill set.The hardest part of the job was doing the GL and monthly accruals- that is not my background.The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I met and worked with on a daily basis.Good products, people, and processes.  Changing management resulted in various changes, largely positive, to how the organization was run.Typical day at work included 30% bench work, 50% documentation and 20% interaction with cross functional teams, vendors, customers etc. The hardest part of the job was the efforts that went into establishing stringent requirements in creating a GLP environment and transitioning a Research Use Product only to a diagnostic product for clinical applications. The lack of quality and regulatory knowledge amongst colleagues from within and various other departments made the process longer and harder. The most enjoyable part was a great, determined and hardworking manager to work and report to. Working with a team willing to learn and adapt to changes. Interesting and consistent challenges during the course of development to launch of the product. Also plenty of opportunities to learn and grow in the company.Affymetrix is a decent place to work for, but it seems next to almost impossible to advance within. For the most part they give good incentives, health care, 401k, vacation time and few other perks. They try to keep the morale high by having a employees activities committee conduct monthly events. The hardest part of the job are the people, but that is usually at most jobs. In my area my co-workers are very close knit and we work like a family. Management can a shaky at times, but nothing to really worry about. There are many learning opportunities because Affymetrix highly promotes cross training. When I started working here you get all benefits from day one.Affymetrix is a good company to work for but it is not financially solvent. Thus I couldn't really move forward in the organization even though I did ""quality work."" Hours are flexible and eating was great until they took away breakfast. They had layoffs while I was there and I ultimately became a victim of budgetary constraints. I was replaced by a contract worker that was fired in the initial layoffs and was rehired back on a contract basis. There is some backstabbing though and certain people don't know too much. The company is not going to stay afloat due to bad management and a lot of workers I saw goofing off.Affymetrix is a great organization with a close knit culture. One of the most internally connected companies I've ever worked with.Best place to work for. Friendly environment. Great management team. I enjoyed my busy desk, always challenging on a daily basis.I learned a lot from the people I work for and has been my mentor all the time.I will surely miss the company.Overall This is a god place to work. I do wish that I was more challenge at my job on a day to day basis.7+ plus years good professional experience in the Analysis, Architecture, Design, Development, Implementation, Integration and Testing of Client / Server / Internet / Intranet Systems for Engineering, Research, Financial and Insurance Industries using Object Oriented Analysis/Design/Methodologies.Hands-on experience with the latest Java EE 5 platform. Strong exposure to lightweight containers like EJB 3.0. JPA 1 and Hibernate 3.0. Solid experience in lightweight POJO based frameworks like spring 3.0(Dependency Injection, IOC, ORM, DAO, AOP, MVC, JMS and Business Integration).Good experience in Spring AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming) and IOC (Inversion of Control).I begin work each day by checking my email. I gown up into proper lab wear then procede into lab. I take a filling order and follow each procedure. Work orders vary from quanity which determine the time frame. After completing the work order I return all materials and close the work order into the companies software. The management is pretty laid back and the co-workers are the same. There is no hard part about the job. One of the best things they have are educational classes that you get credits and certificates when complete.There was a good focus on getting things done while maintaining flexibility and freedom to work in the way that best suits youThe most enjoyable part of the job was listening to music and setting up experiments using different types of skills. The typical day was getting there at 7:30 am in morning. Starting my day with good breakfast and listening to music and working on DNA chips. Using micropipette filling chips with Hyb buffer and then putting it in Hybridization Oven.The best thing about working for a company like Affy is knowing that the end result (products/services) positively affect the quality of human life.For me, this simple fact has been the most powerful reason to work there and why I choose to remain in biotech !Very aggressive work schedule focused primarily on profits. They do have an excellent product which is of great benefit to mankind. Perhaps with the the recent restructure and change in management they will be able to work to their mission and product a product that will make great strides in diagnostic medicine.I made my weekly schedule which included all service call coordination and installs. Keep up on expense reports and service reports. make my own travel arrangements.Typical work day was ok,I learned about all kinds of bulk and liquid materials,management was fine,co-workers were ok,hardest part of job was very big orders in which took alot of time to get done,my most enjoyable parts of job was the christmas party'sa typical day at worKwhat you learnedmanagementyour co-workersthe hardest part of the jobthe most enjoyable part of the jobManagement in the corporate is very incompetence. No new products for years and no new technology. Management is full of dead woodsGreat place to work. Wonderful co-workers and teamwork.Company cares about the workers and makes a pleasant and enjoyable place to be.Worked here for 13 years. Great boss and co-workers. Had excellent amenities.",,San-Diego,San Diego,CA,2016-08-09T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/3e76ab3b-157c-4dc0-95e6-39435773e95a?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
