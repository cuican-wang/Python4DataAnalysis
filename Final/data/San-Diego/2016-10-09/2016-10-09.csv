46,5208.0,QC Associate Scientist I,Zoetis,3.7,66.0,"Everyone is very welcoming and nice. However the departments don't exactly get along very well. Great learning environment and management is extremely nice and helpful.I highly recommend the internship program at Zoetis.The engineers you work with over the summer are heavily involved in the recruitment process which is really nice. They are willing to work with non-traditional engineering backgrounds, as they did in my case.Many of the engineers/designers/scientists that work here are willing to set aside their time to talk about their projects and share their expertise. I was heavily involved in 2 - 3 projects over the 3 month I was here.Organized chaos.  Not well run by management and company cannot deliver certain goods in a timely manner that meets the clients needs.I was to maintain a fully operational unit, reaching all my production rates. Keep hourly checks on my product and machines while maintaining a clean unit.Becoming a Zoetis colleague was very beneficial for me. I learned a lot more skills that helped me expand my knowledge and opportunities.I had a great manager and very nice team of the department.Time is very flexible; everybody treated as a responsible adult.No micromanagement.Nice work environment.Company is constantly buy some other businesses so everybody's position is not very stable; nobody knows what will happens next.It was Challenging It was More learningIt was Good to have big teamWe had good time, share.We were give good facilities which cannot be compared with other companiesPoorly managed team where training and advancement require a person to suck up to the supervisor. Highly stressful and lots of favoritism shown. Back stabbing environment.Very good place to work.  Nice and friendly staff, and plenty of advancement opportunities.  Month meetings really kept everyone updated and on point.  I wouldn't change anything about this company.Excellent culture and environment, great place to work and grow with the company.  Largest Animal Health company which has its benefits and downside.As a contingent worker, you will hate this place. They offer nothing of benefit. They will dangle a golden carrot in front of you and yank it away as soon as you think progress in your career is being made. Chances of getting hired in as a temp are slim to none. Good luck.This could have been a good company but inept management --all imports from Pfizer---has led it to become a seemingly inevitable takeover target.  The culture has been decimated after the recent 20% cut in the workforce.  Not a good place to work!Looking for a new opprotunity as lay offs are occurring again for the millionth time  it's an unstable place to be currentlyNice and Very helpful people.Management is great-very understanding and open to ideas.Positive environment to grow.Pay is good too.this is a good place to work but there is little chance of advancing in the company.  As of right now they only hire temps. good clean facility.Directing the movement of data across multiple systems and small project management. Validation of DEA licensing for fraud and accurate data information before submission of shipping pharmaceuticals to office.Majority of the co-workers are very kind but there is a significant amount that love to ruin other's days. The people that are above you can do no wrong and you are always at fault.Not enough space, lazy workers that complain all day as opposed to working while others actually work. But they are nice and the supervisors are very understanding and supportive of the team.Processing and packaging pharmaceuticals for livestock and Veterinarians with outdated equipment. Safety is not a concern from my experience, rarely saw management (beginning of the day and maybe the end of the day) 12 hour shifts 6am to 6pm. Co workers had no sense of safety in the area we were assigned to. The hardest part at times was performing maintenance on the regularly failing mill operations Leaving for the day was the most enjoyable part of the day.They are passionate about providing the best product to their customers and truly engender a team mentality.  This is a very good company to work for.Zoetis is a very family friendly workplace.  As long as you get your work done, management is very flexible with colleagues' schedule and supportive of colleagues having a good life outside of the office.","5,001 to 10,000",San-Diego,San Diego,CA,2016-10-09T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/943b7424-5cc8-430d-b67b-0281b5d6cbe3?mescoid=1900306001001&jobPosition=17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
