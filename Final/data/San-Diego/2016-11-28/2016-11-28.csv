It is hard to get management opportunity unless you are in someone elses pocket.good company, great environment. good benefits but poor compensation . Great location. Very fast paced. Every other week there is a meeting to discuss business and direction company is taking, results, etc.Good place to work and grow your career. Business casual fun environment. Good co-workers. And  management. Recommend others to work thereI managed all day-to-day call center operations including lead generation, call campaigns, customer care, sales and engineering. A typical day would consist of me starting the early morning meeting, then executing an outbound dialer campaign for the call center reps.I monitor calls while they are on the phone, and also continue to monitor calls afterwards as well. Upon listening to these calls, I offered my advice on the calls, and set up all reports for metrics going forward.I handled the incentive payout for the day and also made sure the engineering team had a chain of qualified solar leads go through so we we could sell solar systems.Fast moving environment with great employees.  Company is still in start up phase but has great potential.  Enjoyed working with employees to provide excellent HR services including benefits administration and onboarding.  Responsible for automating and updating processes.this was a company that had alot that I could learn and did learn. My skills with excel and Quickbooks increased. The accounting team was seperated based on project and corporate areas, I was the only person involved on both teams due to client promotional payouts.Start early, end late, need more resources.Learned that start ups are risky!Mixed review of management.Staff works hard.Tough not knowing if/who will survive.Best reward is solar is increasing across the U.S.enjoyed working for this wonderful solar companywonderful work place, fantastic opportunity for growth- great corporate culture- awesome managersOne Roof develops a proprietary application that provides an end to end transaction platform for solar financing. One Roof partners with other businesses and leverages their platform and monetizes the use of the application by third parties and contractors.My job was directing IT service delivery at the San Diego headquarters and the Phoenix call center as well as satellite offices and a field force.My coworkers were bright and talented people that were a pleasure to work with.I really enjoyed learning so many new things working at a smaller startup. I'm used to working in larger, enterprise level engagements so this was a chance to really get my hands dirty and wear a lot of different hats.Good place to work with decent compensation - the company is very receptive to new ideas and suggestionsA typical day at work consists of managing leasing agreements from initiation to completion. The majority of the work load also consists of quality assurance, building lasting- relationships with dealers, installers, contractors and homeowners and document processes.A Fun start up with lots of potential.
