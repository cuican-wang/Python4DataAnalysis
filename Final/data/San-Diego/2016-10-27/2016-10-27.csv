Go to lunch repeat. Do site visits to inspect project progress and that it meets design specificationsBest experience in Real Estate field, opportunity to learn and advance in a career to become a licensed RE Agent to work in parallel with the FDOT and Turnpike as a consultant.HDR was a great place to work. My Boss at th time was a wonderful women and the HR department was the best. I loved the fact that the engineers treated me like I was family. The location was wonderful and I really enjoyed working with this company for almost 8 years.HDR had one of the easiest environments to work in that I have ever experienced. The people are wonderful, the management let's you figure things out on your own but is always there to answer your questions, and they make an effort to allow you to work on tasks and get involved with the company when you express certain desires to do so.Wonderful company in every aspect. Highly recommended.Lots of large complex projects with many challenges daily.  learned many things about working in large national teams.HDR is a great place to work at.  Lots of projects and oppurtunities.  Large room for growth and advancement to management.This was a type of contract job.  I learned contract jobs have you feeling a bit used and unappreciated. My direct Supervisor is nice and my coworker is great.Im needing to find a job as soon as possible. Hdr was not a great job for me due to the lack of help and communication from the supervisor there is no set job at HDRI love coming to work and do what I do everyday. Learning new things, Helping people with anything the need. There is good and bad days but always make the best out of it no matter what. There is always a solution to everything.The job was very interesting and provided excellent mentoring for a young engineer right out of college.  Commercial buildings and industrial plant experience combined.In the short time I have worked with HDR as I have been on contract with them I have come to respect their work and their management. Compensation is fair, and working expectations are reasonable. It is a large company and seems to have great opportunity to work worldwide.HDR has a strong benefits package including a well performing ESOP. Leadership is honest and hardworking and doesn't take cutting people lightly just to make a few extra bucks. HDR is a nice sizde firm to work for with all the resources of a large company but the feel of a small one.A typical day would include processing all AR/AP entries in QuickBooks.  Handling payroll for a small staff of 5 employees.  Responsible for finalizing and submitting quotations to potential customers both in the industrial and municipal markets.   Manage inventory of spare parts and arrange for shipment of equipment to locations nationwide.The management and people in general at HDR are fantastic. Become a part of an employee-owned corporation with a great future.Excellent communication between employer and employeeBenefits to die for Assignments discussed with employees for acceptanceRemuneration based on experienceHDR Houston is a great place to work. Well managed and productive office. It's just too bad it's in Houston, Texas. Friendly co-workers, family atmosphere, lots of office functions to make for a real team feel. I have done work for several states because HDR is one of the best at work sharing between offices.This can be a great company to work for in the right situation. I was an employee for the Chicago office for 6 years remotely. I worked out of an office in Springfield, approximately 4 hours south if Chicago.I was laid off due to reduction in work in the area. I firmly believe the Department Heads there did everything they could to not let me go, but ultimately were forced to by the corporate office.I was asked to rejoin the office in 2014 as a remote employee working out of my home. I was glad to do this as HDR has always been very good to me and to work for and with.Strong culture of excellence while rebuilding interstate roads and bridges. Accelerated pace of construction which inspired ingenuity and problem solving while offering much experience in a compressed amount of time.This is a very fast-paced company with major responsibilities.  The crew is among the hardest working people that I've had the pleasure of working with.HDR offers excellent benefits and I loved the culture. I worked in the Claremont branch and was laid off after 3.5 years of employment.  Since I have been unemployed from the company many employees have been laid off or have left due to poor management specifically the department manager.The employee benefits and PTO are excellent. Management could have been more in touch with employees. Communication from management was lacking. I worked with many good and hard working people.","5,001 to 10,000",San-Diego,San Diego,CA,2016-10-27T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/0135c8cc-c271-44f6-8043-ccce605bfceb?mescoid=1900265001001&jobPosition=11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
