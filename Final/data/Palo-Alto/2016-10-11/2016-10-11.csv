95,1499.0,Marketing Measurement Data Scientist,Hewlett-Packard Company,4.0,6900.0,"Overall, I had a great experience with a lot of multi-faceted functions and diverse groups. It was fun to see how everything meshed into a giant enterprise that we tried to keep afloat. I was part of various SWAT teams dispatched to either plug leaks or develop new processes to improve the overall lethargy that develops with any large organization, as it tends to entropy, per natural law. Frequent change and renewal were the keys to continued success.work with advancement but never a pay raise; worked as a family where everyone was able to help each other; hardest part of job when someone expected to get a complete refund for shipments that they received 1-2 years ago; most enjoyable when able to help someone when the computer messed up and to make them extra happy!Awesome job.  Great pay, very fun people to work with. I was an inside account rep, worked closely with our partners in helping our clients solve their technical needs.  Terrible CEO.  Would fly in and promise there is nothing going on and then lay off 20 people for no reason the next day.  Seen it happen many times until it happened to me right before Christmas when i was the TOP ISR in the west coast.  Denied me my bonuses and my vacation I won.After Receiving instructions from Supervisor to which line/section your working for the day, you follow the orders of the operator throughout the day. I learned how to cooperate with people from all backgrounds.Very Friendly and Team oriented.Clocking in on time with so many employees and very little swipe stations.The 25 cent coffee in the brake room.Reviewed all hardware and software in SAN Landscape for errors and issues.  Reviewed and planned capacity goals and levels on each array.  Reviewed software support and matrices to determine EOSL for both software and hardware.  Reviewed vendor ETAs, FCO and bugs to determine upgrade path.  Planned and coordinated vendor hardware/software upgrade and fixes with vendors and platform towers to determine best course of action. Opened, closed and represented change controls to CAB board.  Ensured day to day allocations, reclaims and storage incident tickets were opened, closed, tracked and worked to meet SLAsI have worked for HP / Hewlett Packard Enterprise for 27 years. HP/HPE have fantastic work cultures with world class practices around diversity and inclusion, work/life balance, ethics, and career advancement. Work is engaging and challenging.  Employees are rewarded for exemplary performance.  HP/HPE foster highly engaging work environments that foster teaming and productivity.HP is a great place to work.  Management respects individual contributors, and places a high value on employee recognition.  I would recommend HP to anyone as a great place to work.  There is opportunity for training and advancement.  The HP way is still alive an well with many managers, which means work life balance and flexible work schedules.Working at HP/HPE has provided me the opportunity to expand my knowledge and skills and adapt them to different environments and scenarios.  The working environment has changed dramatically due to a profound reorganization, however, HP/HPE has been very good to me.  The groups I have worked with have been staffed by great people, my direct management has always been open and supportive, and the hardest part is leaving the company at this point.  HPE has merged/divested with another company and, subsequently, all groups have been decentralized resulting in a massive budget cuts and workforce reduction.The company has provided me a free hand to manage my responsibility in a specific site assignment.Daily quality and safety inspections and reporting.Weekly quality meetings and preparatory meetings of segment of work.Completed work segment pre-final and final inspections.Daily updating of red line drawings.The company managers also provided me full support in any site work issues and resolutions.What a great company Hewlett and Packard created.  The HP Way.  The essence that the employees' brainpower was the company's most important resource.  This once magnificent company is a shell of it's former self through 236+ acquisitions and over 50 spinoffs. The people were the most intelligent, focused, hysterical team players I've ever had the privilege of working with.Typical day consisted of attempting to help customers on the contract via remote connection. Most customers were expecting a technician to come onsite. Metrics for the job went up while the number of tickets that were able to be pulled from the queue went down. Customers generally did not know their own company's internal policy and would want to argue, thus most tickets from the queue would be sent to a field technician to explain to them first hand. The workload and policies became even more frustrating as time progressed as the red tape involved became more cumbersome to work with, our closure numbers needed to increase and our number of tickets that were received decreased. It became a lose-lose situation rapidly.Moving away from work at home flexibility even in the technology space, only in strategic locations like Plano, TX; Pontiac, MI; Colorado Springs, CO; Atlanta, GA; etc.Work life balance is a challenge given layoffs and additional workload inline with strategy to resource labor cost by switching from highly skilled resources to mid/lower skilled resources.I spend about half of my day using Excel spreadsheets to prepare a route to stop by as many printers that need serviced. I have learned many different things about laser printing since the start of this job. My team lead and my boss were my two biggest motivators in getting my certification. The majority of my co-workers are nice, respectful people. There are a few that act rather unprofessional when they become stressed. The most difficult part of my current job, is really not even difficult. Covering 2.8 million square feet on foot 5 days a week is physically tiring, but it is a mental cake-walk. I love working with the many different models of printers and all other platforms of technology in such a large call-center environment.Worked as phone support to schedule a time for the Wal-Mart store and the HP service tech to be on site to change out the main store server.  Needed to make sure the equipment arrived with all the parts in good condition and was available for the HP tech to install. Helped with packing, shipping and tracking of equipment. Enjoyed the physical part of the job the best. Assisted with Project Manager with getting project done in time as needed.Elite, Care Pack, and Support 1 representative. Taking inbound calls from customers with computers that need repair. Updating drivers, software, and firmware. Troubleshooting over the phone to properly diagnose issue and effectively replace parts, set up services, and repair in a time efficient manner. Maintaining customer satisfaction at all times. Communicating with customers using email and making outbound calls. Utilizing all available sources for proper diagnoses on all calls. Maintaining cases and make sure cases are closed properly and on time. Time management efficient.HP had a nice work environment. Everybody was very similar in attitude and aptitude. We would all work very well together on our team at least. We had a gym on campus where we worked out together. A few cafeterias to choose from for lunch, lots of nice restaurants and entertainment nearby etc.Entered and maintained provider applications, contracts and updates into the system and provider information into credentialing database. Communicating effectively and courteously both orally and in writing and demonstrate empathy in difficult interpersonal situationsVerified potential and existing Providerâ€™s licensure, liability insurance, and BNDD, CDS and DEA certificate.Very productive, a stress free work place, great relationship with co-workers really nothing negative about anything regarding working with HP.I had a very productive client base, excellent sales opportunities, established an excellent relationship with my customers, my work day was very enjoyable.Develop new business, work with existing accounts, and minimize lost business to achieve profitable sales growth and special objectives. Seek and qualify prospects in accordance with company account stratification goals. Research customer business needs and develop a mix of products and service to meet needs. Evaluate market trends and recommend products to customers, based on business needs and goals. Informed of market conditions, product innovations, and competitors products, prices, and sales; share information with customers as part of value-added services provided. Create customers for life""Contract side of things""No communication what so ever. Everything is done at the last minute. Everyone plays the blame game and won't take responsibility for themselves. Management is a joke. Always asking to get a new project done within an impossible time frame. No promotions given no matter how long you work there and how hard you work. What I learned after working here is how not to properly manage people and have good time management. The most enjoyable part of the job was leaving it.Management is losing focus and to many layers of it, not enough workers in the trenches.  I enjoy the work I do and the coworkers that I have, however the open door policy will lead to your demise.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,Palo Alto,CA,2016-10-11T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/5e6e61b6-c7d8-47ed-9d5e-9816771441fd?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=27,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
