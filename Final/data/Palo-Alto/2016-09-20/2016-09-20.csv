Love the free snack and the beer bash and BBQ.Service Now is a good place to work. Depends on what position you are in, but overall a great company to work for. All and all not a bad place to work.very dynamic place to work at, with very limited coordination, more managers than real workers, need a very thick skin layer to keep going, everyday you might be at risk of loosing job, because manager of other stream did not like you.* Productive and fun workplace with ping pong table.* Good perks with lunch provided once a week",,Palo-Alto,Santa Clara,CA,2016-09-20T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/96ece73b-66bd-4cbc-a463-9dfc13d13de5?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
