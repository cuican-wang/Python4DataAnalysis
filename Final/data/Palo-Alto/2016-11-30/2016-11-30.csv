651,2055.0,Senior Biostatistician/Statistical Programmer,stryker,4.0,429.0,"Stryker Orthopedics gave me a great opportunity to learn about Orthopedics. I spent seven years as a Stryker employee. During that time they were very helpful in teaching me all aspects of Orthopedic medical equipment distribution. During my time at Stryker I was able to grow as an employee and was awarded two promotions. I would highly recommend Stryker as a place to work!The system that was in place was antiquated for and adp product and they were not utlizing the full spectrum of the original package they paid for. They also were paying for upgrades that did not have to be done as they are not a fortune 500 company and it was way more expensive then it should have been but they were leading this project with hr director who had no know ledge of payroll systemsthe people were very nice and I enjoyed the work load expectancy for such a demanding company. Also the training on the type of work was very diligent and concise with what we were dealing with.I had a great experience with Stryker. Its a wonderful company with a supportive team. Your days are incredibly long and its not a typical sales job. It is very service heavy. You will learn a ton and feel incredibly accomplished.Stryker is a stable and secure company in Kalamazoo, MI. If your looking for a job with benefits, then this is a good place to work.Start at 6AM and built basic hospital beds. Medium paced work environment, and laid back. Management was wonderful. Hardest part was big orders and a certain deadline. Most enjoyable part was the people and the environment.Stryker is a great company to work for and the upper management and staff are very professional, friendly and willing to help new employees. Overall, the company offers a lot and it provides an opportunity to develop and learn new skills. The company promotes a great job culture.Stryker is a solid company that is growing everyday.  The culture of people plus benefits makes this a great place to work and grow.  They are part of the Healthcare Industry that will always have great job security.Pretty easy job.  the hardest part is working with needy doctors and hospital staff.  the compensation is great for fresh out of college students.  this is a good stepping stone for any medical sale positionStryker is a rapidly growing company. They purchased Bechtold and merged the company together. There is a lot to learn and there is no shortage of work. What you will also get a micromanaging and cuts on overtime. Management has also gone through change and its not lick the old Stryker. It's starting to feel like whats more important is the micromanagement of employees and cut backs.Each employee seeks to drive one another. While it is competitive there is cohesiveness among employees. All are expected to work and achieve outside their current role and develop themselves.Sales staff worked well with office employees.  Management was open to communication with support staff.  The typical day included answering incoming calls from both customers and sales force, data entry, filing and other administrative duties.Very bureaucratic. Hard to get anything done fast. Upper level management is tough to get in touch with to get anything done. Earning potential is very very good. Doubtful many people would put up with the work without the pay. The ones that do well in this business work from 6 in the morning until 7 at night. Working in the OR and not behind a desk is a great benefit if you hate working in a cube like me.Large company so very slow decision making processes but very overall a wonderful company to work for.  They are progressive and always expanding.This is a great place to work the work is easy the people are friendly I look forward to being here and learning more about the company and what they have to offer I also think this would be a great places to work 30+ yearsI really like this job, First thing good for my health, because health is better , I can work better , Future is good, Environment is also good.distribution is one team. like family member.This is a productive and fun work environment. Co-workers become like family. Management has a very hands on approach to working with everyone and they believe in promoting from within.hard work and interesting tasks, excellent treatment the employee with very good security, good supervision, a lot of teamwork, sold good variety of foodCoordinated team and resolved the difficulties which we faced during validating the products and trained the workers about the measurement systems etc.It was good experience. I met a lot of very nice people. I would definable work there again. Very good company. Filled with opportunity, growth and chances.Stryker is really all about the people.  It is staffed with very hard working people who uphold a culture of ethics and compliance while meeting a demanding work load.  Stryker repays its employees with generous benefits and salary.  Employees know they are appreciated for their hard work.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,Fremont,CA,2016-11-30T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/6e64f4d2-878f-493c-b376-066c6cc1a5c1?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
