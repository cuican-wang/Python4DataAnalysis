187,1591.0,Data Scientist 1,Clorox,4.1,290.0,"It was a fast job you had 2 move real fast and keep up. Good personality up there but they really do care about you up i liked the job.They look down on the good workers and praise the lazy workers. They believe that whatever they wanted to do was ok, didn't really care too much about how the workers feel. Didn't appreciate the hard work and dedication I put in.Load and unload trucks with forklifts, pallet jacks, or cherry pickers with Clorox products. Conducted inventory control. Managed and reviewed customer orders/requests and manually enter data of orders.Coordinated with shipperâ€™s customer service representatives on exceptions, rush orders and order changes.It was easy money. No one on your back. laid back supervisors. Great environment clean enviornment. Really enjoyed my time there keep count of your pointsIt's an ok place to work. I moved while I was working there so the commute turned into a hassle for me. 82 miles 1 way. Not their fault.When working 4 10s a week I put up with it because I had 3 days off.Then my hours changed to 4 9s M-Th  and 4 hrs. on Friday. I tried it for about 3 months but after a while the 164 mile round trip wore on me so I put in my notice.The Clorox Company is an excellent place to work.  There is a perfect work / life balance. Good atmosphere, Safe environment, Excellent health benefits.Clorox (unlike any other company) has a positive, engaging and inspiring work environment.  You can work hard but you can also find time to play. Management encourages you to learn more and to consider advancement.  Excellent place to work but benefits are not offered to everyone.It is a traditional company with more than 100 years of history.  To advance in this company, one needs to be in the ""in group"" with the few senior managers.Keeping all safety procedures and rules enforced. Stocking and handling hazardous chemicals.  Very busy tidy work place, always new employees.The day always starts off good at Clorox. There are lots of people with different backgrounds and ages who are there to help anyone that just started the job. The thing that i loved most about this job was that they always had things for you to do. I learned that Clorox does not only ship clorox products but others as well, and that taught me once again uu cant judge a book my its cover.  At this job i also learned more about my personality as well as my future. Because the job had many people  that i got to meet and grew alone with them, I had a better understanding of what life is really about.Its a very good first job for new comers. It definitely prepared me for a warehouse workplace. The pay rate started off fair, and became excellent after a while. I liked it. My co-workers were the best.Wonderful work life balance, managers are very knowledgeable.  Work is always challenging and exciting. Co-workers are always pleasant and engaging.Unfortunately, the plant closed. I enjoyed my time working for Clorox. I learned a lot and felt like I truly contributed to the company. The pay was great and I loved the hours. I appreciated how safety conscience the plant was.It's not one of the best places to work but if you need something fast it's ag guaranteed job but the hardest part of the job is standing in the heat for that long it's a lot of drama there sothe Lee's you talk the Less you talk to people the betterClorox cares for their employees and that is shown through the people you work with. The people you work with here are irreplaceable. The culture and work environment are outstanding.Good company, a fun place to work.  A ton of visibility to upper level management.  Very friendly work environment, I would recommend.  They compensate the interns very well.I love working at Clorox and would continue if I could pursue my ideal role from my current location.   Unfortunately, such an opportunity does not exist in my current location. Next steps for me would mean continued heavy travel and / or another move for my family and me.My first job was at The Clorox Company, and they do great job of teaching you how to transition from college to a work environment. A typical day deals with a lot of meetings, phone calls, and some lab time. Most managers are strong people developers who truly want you to succeed. Coworkers are friendly and the work environment promotes collaboration allowing you to talk to anyone at any level at any time. The hardest part of the job is that when you're in a position you have to stay in that position for about 2 years before they will rotate you. Most enjoyable part of the job is how rewarding it is to see the products you've worked on in stores.Great place all co workers treated you like family. Learned so much while working there. Great benefits from helping you out with school and time off if needed.Worked as a team member. Ran machinery, assembly, and fork truck. There was only one other women on the shift that I worked at so I missed getting to talk to someone that had the same interests as I did. I had a hard time sleeping during the day because I had  sons at home at that time. The lack of sleep really got the best of me.Need to be able to work independently and with others that included diverse leadership styles to include:Extreme detailed, clear written and oral communication skills, taking ownership of a project from beginning to end, define current and future processes, work in an extremely fast pace environment, high quantity and quality of work needed","5,001 to 10,000",Palo-Alto,Pleasanton,CA,2016-08-26T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/f636c4a2-c285-407b-94fe-430db75ad819?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=14,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
