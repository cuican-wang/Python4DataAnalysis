28,1432.0,"Principal Scientist, Protein Science",Boehringer Ingelheim,4.1,309.0,"Productive and challenging; flexible work environment due to new workplace of the future and reducing the carbon footprint. Unstable work environment at the moment due to restructuring within the company.Boehringer Ingelheim, Value through innovation. A German Pharmaceutical Company, that in my experience, takes care of their employees.With the advancement system, there is a change to meet personal goals, with regular talks called Mitarbeitergespr√§ch (talks with the employee). The hardest part of the job, is time management and prioritize the budget spendings. But overall, is a very satisfying job, with an amazing working environment as well as co-workes.Although I do not currently work there now I did love the culture, management and the scientists. Had I became a permanent employee ( I was a student temp) the benefits package would have been wonderful along with the pay. But i was fool and moved back to my home town after school. Everything that keeps an employee happy is what is offered at this company. Excellent leadership in management, harmonious staff of employees which only led to a great work environment of diverse group of people of differing ethnicities and backgrounds.My role with BI is diverse and broad. It is a clinical sell with scientific support, it addresses the changing landscape of healthcare. Educating not only in early recognition and its importance but in the benefits of earlier treatment and prevention of admissions and readmissions into hospitals. Providing pharmaceutical treatment options through guideline emphasis and education. It speaks to the increasing number of ACO's and PCMH's and the challenges that they have in meeting specific quality metrics and measures to optimize the triple aim goal.BI has done a great job at launching a large number of products over the last few years.  Unfortunately most of those launches have not produced in terms of sales.  As such, the company is going through a major re-organization, where the long-term-plan is not well communicated and people are being quietly laid off.  There is a strong German family culture at BI, where things are done the ""BI-way"".  If you want to read, eat, sleep, and live SOPs, then this is the place for you.  If you have creative, new ways to do things, that will not be embraced and you're better off elsewhere.  There are too many people who have been there too long to do anything new.  There is little room for growth, and the office politics are the worst I have ever seen in 20+ years.Finally, the company does not do a good job of understanding the US market.Own your business! A strong work ethic, along with good organizational and analytical skills, will boost chances for success. Phenomenal co-workers in the field and insightful and supportive management allow for enjoyable, self-direcred work days. Customers are appreciative but increasingly harder to see.A good place to work.  Going trough some changes.Future in question.Fair compensationMinimal chance for promotion.good productsBoehringer Ingelheim was an excellent company to work for.  Beautiful grounds, excellent pay scale and was always welcome to learn new tasks.  I learned event planning throughout the life cycle, portal website entries, and much more.  The company is very structured, but appreciates their employees.Job security is and has been a great thing with this company.  I have learned a great deal with this campany.  But as I further my education with the goal of bettering myself and my families life, I feel I am ready for something more challenging.Sales, Field Training, KOL development, POA development, co marketing, mentoring reps, great work environment, good benefits, hard working teamsroom for growth through development planning and implementationGreat culture where very smart people working together.  Many good challenges. Opportunity for growth limited given significant business challenges over next few years.  Not very strong pipeline...some around Biosimilars; doesn't compare to other pharma companies.Constantly restructuring, cutting, laying off.  If you're good at what you do, less chance of that but still possible.I worked for them as a temp for about 8 or 9 months then was hired in as a fulltime employ. I really enjoyed working for them and would very much like to work there again.Very good company to work for.  Privately held and based out of Germany.  Has won many innovation awards.  Company offer very good benefits.German owned company by German family.  They do value the employee and provide great work/life balance.  Unfortunately this does not drive success in business.  Management is held hostage to Germany demands which would be fine except business in America differs from Germany and one size does not fit all.  This disconnect is driving poor performance.This is a wonderful place to work. BI offers great pay and benefits. It's a growing company that is all over the world and offers employees growth potential.Typically would see 8-10 primary/specialty physicians daily. Review their provider data. Learned how to not only sell to providers, but pharmacists as well.  Became a field trainer to aid in the education of new/establish representatives.  Hardest part of this job is it is difficult to break past the glass ceiling.  The people that are currently apart of the company are lovely.The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and working with people from all different management levels as well as globally.The typical day at work was very fast paced with constant changes in priorities from immediate management. Some of this dictated by manufacturing requirements and some dictated by marketing demands.B.I. is a wonderful place to work with very supportive management. They offer many opportunities for advancement and are actively seeking new employees to add to the team.Great company to work to. Top of the line pharmaceutical products. Travel requires at least 3 times a year. Great benefits.I most appreciate the opportunity to create and innovate concepts and tools that meet business needs (vs being given something from a center of excellence to implement). Undergoing transformation- need even more people with business acumen, agility and ability to influence and get things done despite obstacles - together we will continue to evolve the human pharmaceuticals business model.BI takes care of its great employees. I have worked with many managers and all have advanced my career and helped me improve my value. Great experience.",,Palo-Alto,Fremont,CA,2016-11-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/dd94aac0-bce7-4f1d-b8c9-5e118ed1e0e4?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=14,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
