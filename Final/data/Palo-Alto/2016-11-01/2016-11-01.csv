217,1621.0,"Applications Scientist, Bioproduction and Development",pall corporation,3.4,115.0,"I worked in a microbiology lab where where i validated drugs from pharmaceutical companies for their antibacterial properties. I learned more about microbiology lab than i did in college. I partook in interviews and building the team for the lab. The dynamic between myself and my coworkers facilitated the completion of our assignments. Hardest part of the job is meeting the time framed that has been put in placed while trying to validate a drug that became unpredictable. I enjoyed the company of my coworkers on and off work.Worked part time for this company. Rude and unprofessional.  No respect between employees and management. Employees have no respect for each other.  Employees do what they want! Needs Management to step up to the plate and Manager each department. HR really needs to get involved and resolve many issues.Micro Managed by a bully, my advice is stay far away until they figure out he is the problem - people don't quit the company they quit the manager and this guy is why I quit along with a ton of other managers.company is good. pay is good. people are good. management should be little better. the overtaking of Danaher is bad, its making people loose job. Pay is good but could be better.Purging previous years' invoices to make room for the current years' invoices,  placing purged invoices  in alpha/numeric order, placing them in the archives. Training for SAT was sporadic, some coworkers were memorable.There was plenty of work to keep you busy threw the night. Co-workers were enjoyable to be around. Management was exceptional. Plenty of hours to get over time.Tight Security at the compoundLearned about the Japanese culture, Workshops provided to help you get acclimated to the environmentSales and Marketing trainingNice company to work forPall gave me the opportunity to enter the Quality Control Career and working with great team members I was able to acquire skills to further my career.Typical manufacturing shop.   good group of guys, some worked, some slept. Management restructured often, which left everyone running around cause no one knew anything. Promised training to advance and increase pay, never happened. Boss had his favorites, and was a slug.The Job was not that bad but everything was built in house. No parts were ever there.. most of the stuff was made in house and still not on the shelf..I develop new membranes or methods out of new materials. In this work, high inventive and technical skills are necessary combined with quick adaption to problems. Additionally, collaboration between groups (chemistry/development) is essential.Critical thinking and time management are important to decide when a research idea is not feasible.Worked as a shipping/receiving clerk and learned more of receiving/shipping process. Management worked well with its co-workers. Co-workers worked well together as a team. Most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers.This Place is a Joke! They only hire people without experience. A typical work day is watching everyone walk around and gossip. you are not trained properly. Management have their favorites, and have no idea what they are doing. Co-workers are Phony. The hardest part of the job was not getting rewarded for your hard work. The most enjoyable part of the job was the day I left. Well since they just sold the place I'm sure it will not last to much longer. Good Luck!Business is business Pall Corporation is a outstanding Corporation.Long working hours for everyone but overtime is a plus unless you are salary based.I learned we have great hard working people in great places.My coworkers are one of the greatest part of working at Pall.The hardest part of the job is working long hours for overtime to make what is annually promised to me, which leaves me with no  life balance.The most enjoyable part of the job is to hear my supervisors complimenting my hard work and dedication does not go unnoticed.If all you want is mandatory overtime and loss of winter shutdown due to management keeping an impossible production schedule. Then this is the place for you. I have never been in a company that thought so badly of management, that the day I started training I was told to run as fast as I can and never look back.Annual raises are measley and it doesn't matter if you slack off or work hard.  They are the same for just about everyone.They give you a ""promotion"" by changing your title and increasing the work load with hardly any pay increase.Help me get out of here!Fast pace work with heavy machines that curragate pleats in materials to develops industrial filters. Worked with a great group of people. The management style was open and flexible to all.  The hardest part of the day was during inventory checks and the most enjoyable part was when inventory check was completed.The Port Washington site is an amazing facility. Both the people and the architecture are continually inspiring creative thinking. Engineers and scientists are continually encouraged to generate ideas for inventions as part of performance reviews and all ideas are considered in making products that wow customers. Overall, it is a great company for the advancing engineer.Pall Corporation demands a professional work environment, and it's employees largely adhere to these standards willingly. Work amenities are well above-average. Stock program, 401k, Health Benefits are all high quality.There has been an ongoing organizational restructure for the past three years which makes nearly every employee's position transient. The nature of a transitional environment leads to job insecurity, and issues adhering to long-term organizational goals. This has subsequently hurt the creation of a true team-oriented work environment, due to employee's fears of losing their own occupations, and the revolving-door nature of the organizational charts.Pall is a good place to work if you are self sufficient and are able to understand dynamics. Not sure what lies ahead for Pall but I suppose it could be good for some.  They have a great work/life balance as long as you do your job.Great place to work. I learned a lot of skills that will help me with my future. Management team communicates well, but could be better with the directives.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,Sunnyvale,CA,2016-11-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/c3a60a72-d695-44fc-8ea6-b55999beb696?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=9,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

342,1746.0,Jr. Biologist/Scientist,ARCADIS,3.6,101.0,"I love the people I work with. Aggressive billable hours goals can be tough to get used to if you haven't worked as a consultant before.Strong global company with the desire to do great things. First part of the climb was, to pay off all senior staff to leave the company and hire Collage students. Effects, the company lost clients and senior knowledge. Next up was to hold back and stop yearly merit increases... when moral was already low from previous actions, it just dipped lower. Each deparment has their own personnel challenges. No company is going to give their money away, but this one will try to give up as little as possible on it's staff, even if you do more than expected (above and bound).After 23 years of my service, Arcadis fired me while I was out on disability recovering from my liver transplant. They then started to force out any senior members who had 20+ years of experience. This was a cost saving measure to purge all the high end salaries. Many of the furloughed employees were from the original G & M firm who helped Arcadis grow from 10,000 to over 55,000 people. We in the Southeast provided most of the revenues to finance their expansion. We were rewarded with pink slips. My advice is to join the company for experience and leave for a better job as soon as you can. Loyalty is not a word in the Arcadis vocabulary.My overall experience has been good. I like what I do, and where I do it, I love the fact that I serve a purpose to the American public. Management has been very helpful in helping to adjust to the different areas and scope of work. The hardest part about this job is the travel. I loved it at first. Now I just need to be at home more with my family. My co-workers have all on the most part been one of the best parts to my job. Most of them are in the same boat as I. This make relationships easy to relate to.Poor company to work with.  I was with the firm for many, many years and it has gone down hill since the merger with Malcolm Pirnie.  The merger was poorly managed, the leadership team let the smaller purchased company come in and change how a well managed company was run and it FAILED.  Morale in most offices is very bad, there is no loyalty, management talks of a ""transformation plan"" that has falsified KPI's.  Bonuses have gone down, down, down every year since the merger with Malcolm Pirnie.  The hires they make into leadership and business development roles are very poorly vetted, business revenue is not improving year after year.  I think this company needs to start from scratch and get back to basics and should start by getting rid of all of the Malcolm Pirnie employees still left in the firm.Huge turnover. Management is horrible with money, so they are constantly looking for younger people who will do the same work for a fraction of a good wage. Laid off after thirty years of loyalty and hard work because their poor work can't maintain clients. It used to be a good company but they fired all of the people who made the company work. Good luck in this shrinking industry.The pay and benefits have been great, but the hours are terrible.  I have no time for life outside of work.  Management seems to want to help you succeed, and will pay for any continued educationWas an acquired firm but was a great place to work! Great people and culture with room for advancement. Wished the company was able to maintain the workforce.Flexible work schedule, Great people, but stability and advancement opportunities are poor. For similar role with a competitor, the salary is low as well.The position was not advertised as the actual position required. My expertise was in Project Accounting, not Governmental Contract Accounting.Ok, very large company with many offices and international locations. Felt too large and impersonal. Okay place to start careergreat opportunity to learn and for professional development,  My co-workers are team spirited and work well together.- Work for this company for 8 yrs since I was 19.- Company is willing to teach and groom new trainees- Friendly co-workers- Not doing redundant work every week- Hardest part about the job was learning new, tedious, and critical work that needed to be completed as soon as possible. - The most enjoyable part about the job was learning new and intense work on a daily basis.Communication is very poor. As a new employee the burden is shifted to me to figure out what projects I'm on or I am notified less than a day before that I'm on a job. We're supposed to have project meetings which I'm never involved in, but am expected to know what was discussed. Finally, the way expense reporting and billable hours work is horrible. Lets just say that if I work over 40 hours, but 8 of those hours were to overhead and not a project well I just wont get paid for those 8 hours. At least they are flexible with career paths and letting you decide what type of work you'd like to learn.Where to begin? From the beginning a lot of promises were said but never followed up on. Me and fellow colleagues helped build up a new process for a project we were collaborating on globally and were literally used and abused. Once the project was completed management dropped our hours from 50% for example and expect people to stay busy of be threatened with layoff. A lot of blackmailing goes on if you are not of the big boys club or one of their favorites. A lot of favoritism occurs and management likes to speak to people like dirt. Also they expect you to work 10 hours without an outside social life. They also treat women like its 1950. If you are married and have children they make you feel guilty about having to leave work after 8 hours. It is like working on a slave ship for very low pay, I would avoid this company by all means.A typical work day is continually putting out fires.  I rarely knew in the morning what I would be working on in the afternoon, but I always knew I would be busy.Ever since the company became publicly traded on the stock market job security and morale plummeted.Please understand the majority of these perfect positive reviews of Arcadis are fake. This is a company that tries so hard to impress their competitors and stakeholders that they neglect the well-being of their employees. Arcaadis is seeing a lot of decline - don't believe the heresay of acquisitions/partnering and how strongly they are positioned. They aren't. Staff is dwindling and most major competitors know they are a joke in the industry. What you should focus on is the mass exodus of employees, bipolar management, micro-managers, no office morale, extremely low pay, no sick days, no bonuses, and NO WORK. Layoffs are constant here because Arcadis just cant win.Billability is truly the only thing that matters at this company.  You can be the most brilliant, talented, well-liked person imaginable, but if you suddenly, through no fault of your own, find yourself less billable than someone who just processes storage boxes all day, then you go, and they stay.  Your timesheet is either your ticket upward or the nail in your coffin.As much as they try, the divisional walls at the company will never be taken down.  If a certain division is in need of a skill, and you have that skill, you may never find each other.  People are laid off all the time who could probably have been kept quite busy elsewhere, but management is unaware of how to make that happen.The most difficult part of the job is the heavy focus on billabilty and finding work for one's self. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to interact with new clients and other contractors on a daily basis.Company is very driven around business development. Projects are very impressive to work on. The PMCM division is  still working on developing standard procedures. Advancement seems to be promotion to project manager as well as take on business development role concurrently.I enjoyed working with the Project Managers from all over the US and Canada as well as Brazil, Chile, & Peru.  I enjoyed the challenges of the larger projects.I learned the practices and procedures of accounting","5,001 to 10,000",Palo-Alto,San Jose,CA,2016-11-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/eebfb8b2-449c-40e1-8a0b-414ee9c644f9?mescoid=1900240001001&jobPosition=29,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
