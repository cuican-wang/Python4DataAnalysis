146,1550.0,ITSM Data Scientist,ServiceNow,4.0,31.0,"Assist clients with daily activities that they have requested.  Requests would come in on daily basis from multiple clients and a queue manager would assign them out based on availability.The people who work for ServiceNow are amazing.  Highly intelligent, hard working, and team supporting.  If you need help, they are there for you!The challenge is this:  Billable hours are the mantra in Professional Services.  You are constantly pushed to make your billable hours, but you have limited or no control over what is sold.  If you are not meeting your billable hours, which varies in requirements from quarter to quarter based on what Sales ""says"" they are going to close, you are constantly reminded that you have not met your quota.Though there is never an overt ""threat"" that you will be let go if you don't meet your hours, there are enough ""reminders"" that make you feel insecure.If you are technical at ServiceNow, this is not a problem.  There is always more than enough work.  If you are non-technical (process, organizational change, governance), this is a constant challenge.  ServiceNow, despite individual groups attempts to change the culture, is a ""Software House"" -- platform is king.The job always kept you on your toes, the best part being the communication and collaboration among team members.The level of transparency among the peers and managers is also worth praising.Working at ServiceNow is like drinking out of a fire house. Very bright folks. Everyone is driven and carries their own weight. Never a dull moment. Lots of restructuring making it difficult to have job security and advancement.Fast paced culture, going thru the typical growing pains, very good product development.  Bright future for this company.  Smart management team.This was a great company to work for.  I started working there during its infancy, but now it is becoming a 1 Billion dollar company.I have learned a lot, traveled a lot, and was very loyal to the company.Great place to be if you have a chance.Awesome work experience. Nice exposure to work.Learned a lot from this work experience. Had good time and the team was really cool.This company truly invests in and values the employees. The culture is incredible and the product is solid. Im truly inspired regularly through working with different teams and collaborating on what can be done! I'd highly recommend working here:)ServiceNow is an excellent young company with potential.  If you are a valued member of ServiceNow your job is secured.  During my time here I have seen a lot of turnover in other departments.  You can be here one day and gone the next week. This is the only discouraging thing about SNC.I love this company and I love the people. They are by far the best people I've worked with after 15+ years in high tech. Everyone will roll up their sleeves and pitch in to help get the job done. People are open, honest and transparent (in my experience). By far the best company I've worked for in high tech - the benefits and pay are world class! I've learned what it really means to have a true team and see these people in action together. The hardest part of the job is learning a completely new SaaS platform around ITSM. There is also a lot of change here and if you don't handle change well, it may be tough for you. I personally deal with change really well so that's probably part of the reason I am so happy here. The most enjoyable part of my job has been working with such great people. My co-workers are the best!!Great company culture, dog-friendly, perks are amazing. Hands-on, collaborative work across departments. Have fun on a daily basis and above all get stuff done!Great company with high Growth. Excellent product line. The company is going into a transformation process to support new product lines and new startegies. Sometimes too US centric in startegies and decision making..Great place to work, people are amazing and some of the smartest people I have met. Only there for a 6 month contract.Training could have been better, and longer.  Got used to drinking from the firehose.Hardest part of the job was trying to keep up to requirements during training.Best part of the job was at 5pm I got to leave it until the next day.ServiceNow is a toxic culture where inexperienced management is trying to lead without having a vision or strategy...This may be well and good if they left the rank and file alone to do their jobs- unfortunately for all the employees management is constantly imposing their changing direction and capricious policies on them. There are little to no processes in the company and the Program management office lacks direction so nothing gets accomplished. Nice employees in general- high turnover rate as everyone is trying to get outSNOW is a great place to work.  The atmosphere lends itself to professional advancement.  SNOW was like my second home.  My collegues are people that I still share life with. Great for college graduates and expereiced professionals alike.Wonderful work life balance and great dev team and outstanding sales people. Great benefits and pay. Executive Team top notchAwesome leadership and vision. The product is one that you can be confident in, and truly represents a next level of service for the United States Government. The Federal team is experienced, driven, and highly successful. The market is receptive and the team has made some significant movement forward in the last year alone.Company has grown too fast, infrastructure still needs a lot of work. Many employees confused as to who is responsible for what. Management tends to micro manage.Co-workers are friendly and helpful, learned a lot about ITSM, hardest part of the job was how quickly management expects you to ramp up without assistance.Hard time with work/life balance when you are traveling all over the world.ServiceNow provides you with all of the tools you need to succeed. Management has an open door policy.",,Palo-Alto,Santa Clara,CA,2016-09-21T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/bcb30f88-1d06-443f-817e-9176a642cb1e?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
348,1752.0,Analytic ML Developer,Ericsson,4.1,2800.0,"The company's internship program is great. Work life balance is also good. Co Workers are very helpful and approachable.The most hardest part of the job is to understand the product.I enjoyed working at Ericsson as they were proactive and forward thinking. Teamwork approach and management was excellent. We put in long days but the end results for our customer paid off well.- Devilry , customer satisfaction, flexible and self authorized at my work. - Focus on customer and lead.- Manage my daily work with little intervention from my manager. - Remotely managed and diverse co-workers from the glob.- Full responsibility in selling and managing multi million projects.- Result oriented, time management, acknowledged.I loved my job. Just no Job Security, no advancement. Tried getting a transfer. Not easy. Old manager was easier to work for. Once getting a new manager. He only cared about himself and not his workersI was fortunate to work with really amazing people. The people in the organization makes this one of the best places to work for.Started my first job with MNC. it had a great experience.Learned new things and willing to learn much more.Good atmosphere and got the opportunity to work with good and professional people.Through +12 year of working inside telecom industry "" GSM , data transmission and FTTXdelivery projects "" make me gain technical knowledge and management skills , member ofnational and international organization team works , share different challenge and successstories , all aim me to build my work experienceI worked at this job for 19 years. worked as a technician back when it was nextel-sprint. once ericsson took over the maintenance contract for sprint things spiraled down fast. many jobs were outsourced to India and most senior techs were let go so they could hire young fresh techs just out of school for way less pay. just a sad thing we see now with businesses here in the usa.Maintenance Program Manager driving periodic software deliveries, achieving above the target WLA performance and concluding escalations from Customers and Stake Holders.Working in lean and agile software cross functional team, achieved continuous delivery of maintenance releases  with high quality, on-time delivery and with allocated budget.Leadership team member of Bug tracking tool migration activity (change management)  and successfully planned and migrated Bug tracking activities from ExtraView to  MHWEB (Ericsson) across multiple global operation teams with out impacting day to day operations of 2000 developers and testers.Work at Ericsson is demanding but exciting in that there are multiple avenues to grow and develop across several wireless technologies.During my time at Ericsson, I worked with outstanding people maintaining wireless networks and deploying next generation technology while challenging was also exciting to learn new skills.The hardest part was learning and adapting quickly in order to support our customers. I enjoyed have the flexible hours and time, work life balance was acceptable.Decent pay for the work, excellent learning experience.  Allowed me to work the hours that I liked and allowed me to go to other depts to learn what they did as wellEricsson had excellent products, but was missing the market moves toward lower cost R&D, and was drawn into the 5G race too far in advance of the market.  The Chinese continue to take share and Ericsson is scrambling to address cost overhead.The management is too focused on the short term and should have seen the longer term trends long in advance of the current bad results.  Co-workers are well qualified but out of touch with the customer.Hardest part of the job was to sell good business with flagging product line up.Most enjoyable part of the job was hitting the marks with products that had the attention of Sweden.To get anything done here takes way too long.  Our customers have spoken, our employees have complained.  The job culture is not conducive to the work they are trying to accomplish and it has shown in lost contracts and lost sales. On top of all that, there are at least one or two layoffs a year so you're always on the chopping block.As with most large companies trying to do more less. Technology and industry is changing and the company is trying to keep up. Layoffs are constant and staff development is poor.When not thinking about the problems of having only one customer that everyone's job depended on, this was a great company to work for.  Co-workers, were a joy to work with as were many of those I was not directly working with.However - because the presence of Ericsson in the US was almost completely dependant upon their Sprint contract, the ground we were on was always shaky.  In the end, it was the contract that ended most of our jobs.Leader in the wireless broadband area.  Company performs many trend researches and has great vision.  For example, Ericsson talked about Connected Society with billions of connections long before IoT became the buzz word.  Company offers a lot of online learning materials to employees.At Ericsson and I must say the benefits and the experiences that I got from the work I was engaged are probably second to none.  I reported to a very engaging and skilled director that served as a mentor for me and helped me grow.  The one thing that I did always dislike is that every year there were layoffs.  It is difficult to keep motivated when you know that around 4th Quarter there will be a culling of the heads in the office.  This may have been unique to the Overland Park Office and not as frequent in PlanoLove working for Ericsson, learn many things, how to manage capital   assets, how to manage other employees to build core switches in a live environment, how to work with implementation managers on meeting deadlines and ensuring job was up to specs at all times. A typical day at work was usually very long. The most enjoyable part was when we all work together to accomplish the same goal, plus meeting new co-workers.A typical day at work consisted of logging onto computers and phone. Outlook was a daily tasks of checking emails and responding to customers. Ran reports and attended monthly meetings. Hardest part was waiting on other vendors and teams to provide eta's to give to our customers if units were not locally at the warehouse due to damaged or lost.Ericsson's home office was in Sweden and cell phones were just coming into view. Many visitors came to office and many presentations were made regarding this new product.Good company, great benefits, coworkers very professional, work environment and schedule flexibility are great. Needs improvement: too many layers of management.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,Santa Clara,CA,2016-09-21T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/6c9d852b-df17-44d9-bb97-fd300c2e2ceb?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=35,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
