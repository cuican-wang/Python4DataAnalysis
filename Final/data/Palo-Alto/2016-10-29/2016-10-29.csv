Very unorganized.I love it here because everyone's friendly, managers are outgoing, understanding and kind. The lunch days are awesome and everyone supports one another.Strengthen my practice on Scrum methodology as well as offering opportunity deep diving automotive area.heard the CEO talking about minorities in the bathroom one time and before leaving the bathroom made sure no one heard him and his buddy.Overall, Telenav is a great place to work. Good talent and people willing to help each other out. If I could change one thing is that there are too many ""bosses, not enough workers""... Too many managers and directors making poor decisions.Pay is excellent, but work/life balance is non-existing. With major sites in China, expect to work many nights because of the time difference.People and culture are among the best I've encountered in my experience. Benefits have improved in the past couple of years. Interesting technology to work with.  People and culture are among the best I've encountered in my experience.

I got a lot of experience of mobile testing.Pleasant place to do work. Sometimes hectic getting things approved.-Mobile testing using SDK-Grey box testing using Central Logs-Grey box using PuTTy-Black box testing mobile applicationTelenav has a very good working place. I did the internship in last summer at Telenav. The co-workers are very helpful and en-courageous. There are lots of fun in the office. Actually working is fun here. My manager and other team members were very cooperative. I learned a lot of things during my internship period.Work everyday was the same but there were times where the department would be blasted with late updates and issues, making the day crucial on top of all my daily duties. Company provided great healthcare and fun events for employees with amazing prizes. My fellow co-workers were the best, I think that's what made it hard when I left here because working there for almost 5 years, people there became family. The company outsourced and was moving to another building, so there were ongoing changes and new projects without providing any training. I had to manage doing projects on my own with limited information, also trying to finish up with my personal work on top of that with no approved overtime. I tried my best and appreciate all the work experience from Telenav.","501 to 1,000",Palo-Alto,Santa Clara,CA,2016-10-29T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/5fab43cb-6832-432a-843d-e33cdf859d27?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=29,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
297,1701.0,Sr Clinical Scientist,St. Jude Medical,4.0,225.0,"SJM is good company to work for I'm glad I got the opportunity to work and get to work in the quality group, it was new to me and I picked up new skills.Everyone is normally in a good mood and easy to talk to. Communication barriers in the department that I work for are not an issue and neither has it been with other departments. Management in some areas could learn to loosen up in order to allow their employees to maximize their full potential and abilities. Other than that, compensation is decent, the people are great, the company is solid and there's a cafeteria if you happen to forget that morning to bring your lunch.Average payLong hoursNo bonus for sr. engineers and under.Its basically a meat grinder.No one tells you you that you have to work long hours. However the expectations for delivery of projects will compel you to work long hours. Additionally, if you meet or exceed your goals for the year don't expect a promotion unless you are in RD.Management is flexible when and how you put in your hours for work. There is ample opportunities to advance within the company, but you are not compensated well when you are promoted. There is also no type of bonuses program. The benefits are excellent though.Management can get very unorganized and sometimes unprofessional. Don't expect too much on pay increases when converting from temp to full time St. Jude employee. They offer good benefits but PTO sucks. A lot of opportunities for over time.Worse place I have ever worked. Management is a joke they have their picks. You are not given the respect you deserve. And you make one mistake even if you are training you never hear the end of it. Low salary also 10.00 for first second and third 11.00 that is hired on. Tempts. Make 9.25.The St. Jude Medical Hackettstown, NJ location was a wonderful place to work. The people were very kind, fun loving and hard working. We all worked very well together, as a team. I did find that the IT department is structured in such a way that advancement at satellite offices is difficult. Most days at work - the first 5 years - I would make sure the backup were successful, test restores, assist users, install new systems - both client & server, patch servers, and ensure that the manufacturing IT operations were running smoothly. At times the FDA would show up and we would quickly set up front room/back room scenarios for auditing exercises. I would also remove viruses and ensure that all users had the latest antivirus on their machines. We used a help desk system called Remedy daily and that made it easy to keep track of tickets. I enjoy helping people very much.A typical day at work is processing medical device report forms by correlating in groups or with field specialists such as sales representatives and health professionals. I have learned a lot about the human heart and all the possible adverse outcomes. I have also learned that there are many different devices and products out there that can treat those adverse outcomes. St. Jude Medical has taught me to have more empathy and patience with my co-workers. It taught me to teach myself how to provide an enjoyable environment in an every day office. The hardest part of the job was witnessing many co-workers come and go since we had a strict budget for the department. Many different managers and directors have also had their share of time with the department. Other than the workload and the strict budget, this job is very enjoyable in the sense that you really get a feel for what it is to practice team work.The employees and management team are very genuine and supportive. The culture is very positive and it is a fun environment. New ideas are encouraged and implemented.Great job, learned a lot and promoted several times, so advancement is possible. Your always busy with good work environment. The hardest part of the job was working with the doctors, but the more you work with them, the more you understood.Overall I would not recommend working there. Too much politics and managment has no vision for the future. New engineers are hired based on capabilities, rather than on experience.The environment is diverse and humane with conditions that foster professional growth. The sense of job security is ever present although the recent acquisition may put a damper on that. The company is solid and treats people wellWorking at St. Jude Medical, I have learned a lot about the medical device industry. I have come to enjoy the greatness of making devices that can save lives. But at the location I worked at, I did not like my management team. Due to the fact that I worked for two different Production Leads, I was stretch very thin and cross-trained in many positions which I had no issue with. Although I was able to complete tasks for both teams, the leads did not have good communication which led to misunderstandings and unnecessary panic at times. The hardest part of the job was definitely the lack of communication between leads and their employees. There were a lot of employees who would have enough productive work for half the day while there were a handful of operators who had to be extremely productive the entire week to complete their tasks. Another hard thing about this workplace is how sly they are to making experienced employees train employees with more seniority and then promotes the senior employees into the trainer of those respective positions, which is completely unjust to all of the experienced employees who work so hard to learn and perfect their techniques for their position.I would not recommend anyone to work here if they wished to have a long-term job because I do not see enough employee appreciation within the company, not just from the department I worked in. I know this because I have worked with engineers, techs, and other employees from different departments and they, too, had their share of unappreciative experiences with this company.Responsible for opening the office. Check voicemail to see if any therapist called out if so then work on moving cancelling the patient appointment. Answer phone calls direct them to the appropriate area. Check patients in, collect co-payment, schedule appointments. Register new patients. Call insurance to verify benefits, obtain authorization for treatment . Balance money at the end of the shift.I worked for SJM full time from 1995 to 2004 and the culture has stayed the same, hard working but trying to have fun at work. I have worked for some of the other large med device company's and would rate SJM as the best. Would like more consistency on how contractors are converted to full time.I can't vouch for positions outside of IT, but management is pretty flexible. Bad weather? Kids sick? Working from home is typically not a problem. I find all of my teammates likable.A typical day at work for me consisted of receiving, issuing, and ordering inventory stock.I learned the value of teamwork. My job was dependent on everyone around doing what they were suppose to do, and we did it successfully.The hardest part of the job was dealing with surprised FDA and International audits.The most enjoyable part of the day was lunch time, you get to hang out with co-workers and friends.it is a good place to develop one's career. on job training is available which makes it suitable for full and part time employees. clean environment too.Assembly line. Trained and worked in multiple stations when completing medical device. Hours worked were Monday - Thursday from 4:30 pm to 2:30 am.I would work for  St Jude again, but always try to be prepared for the position to be relocated somewhere within the U.S. or offshore.Management is really not strong. they are not on the same page, its not a united place where every one will work together as a team. They do not hire the right people for the higher chairs of the company.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,Sunnyvale,CA,2016-10-29T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/49d95e65-7112-4107-9f93-95fd80d32a67?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=19,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
