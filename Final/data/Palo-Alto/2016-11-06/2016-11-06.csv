81,1485.0,Data Scientist,BNY MELLON,3.6,1600.0,"great company with great benefits. Definitely recommended. It typical day of work depends on the department you work for.Overall one of if not the best job I have ever worked for the pay rate just doesn't meet my family responsibilities. The hours are great the benefits are good as far as life insurance and vacation days and 401K but the medical and dental deductible is outrageous it doesn't meet the single family requirement. You have to work another job just to pay off deductible and copayment for medical and dental visits.The job itself is fine. It can have days where it's challenging but mostly repetitive. Most difficult aspect is working with other internal teams, especially those outsourced to India who do not understand questions being asked or speak English very well. Advancing your career can be very difficult. Most do not receive promotions for hard work. Instead, you have to move departments or try and get an offer outside the company and hope to be offered a promotion to stay. Raises are terrible and I've been on what they call the 'exceeds expections' category most years (highest review for merit increases). Expect no more than 1-2.5% raise/year. The company is so focused on cutting expenses they have outsourced so many jobs and make cuts a few times/year. They also do not replace positions when someone leaves, unless it's an absolute necessity, so many teams are left very short staffed and therefore overworked.Working at this place for 10 years and have to say it has changed in so many negative ways.1.) Management has poor communication with the people under them or at the same level. 2.) The raises decreased immensely and health benefit cost are now higher.3.) They continue on letting go of hard workers while keeping poor workers to remain in the company.4.) New trainees come on the floor and are here no more than 6 -12 months because the pay and management is so bad and upper management doesn't recognize that so many workers on floor are unhappy and stressed due to lack of help and lack of management communication.This job is ok for High School graduates or college graduates to get their foot in the door in the career world, but definitely not a good long term career place.The Asset Management Operations team of executives does not value or attempt to retain existing workers.  Payroll kept low by hiring new workers directly from college.  Once they are trained and working well, they face limited chances of advancement or salary increases.  Morale remains low, as workers realize their productivity will not be matched by recognition or compensation.  The teams do support each other, for they wish to retain their job until they can move on.  Established professionals hired from outside are given take it or leave it offers.Fast-paced enhancing my agility and bringing to the surface skills I was unaware I possessed.  I did not enter the organization playing the Acoustic Guitar, Keyboard and Producing Music.  My gifts and latent talents were brought out and developed during my employment.  I've done Administrative Assistant work for over 20 years in various industries and I believe it's time to use my natural gifts and talents and work in an industry where I can be of service to Humanity.This firm afforded me the opportunity to fully utilize my financial degree which made me the well-rounded professional I am today.  I gained analytical experience, managerial experience, client management experience, and both internal and external compliance/regulatory experience.Chicago site management and supervision is the worst very unprofessional and care nothing about the employees. Everything is based on company need regardless of the employees situation they may be having with other life responsibilities other then the job. The rules are very unfair also. Chicago site also is very diverse but the management isn't specially with the African Americans.A steady busy day to day work load.  Resolving issues. Mentoring and is a subject expert matter to co-workers.Over the years I've learned the investment's ins and outs, financial tools and vendors systems, writing SQL statements to pull data from the database, Eagle STAR and PACE system. Hardest part of the job was the lack of job security due to lay-offs over the recent years.Most enjoyable part of every day is knowing I can help resolve issues for our clients,  Guiding and answering questions my teammates have.  Fortunate to have friendly coworkers and report to a flexible manager.Mediocre company with poor benefits, advancement, salary and leadership.There seems to be a lack of vision and forward thinking. Most initiatives are either knee-jerk or reactionary. Much too much time spent on putting out fires and addressing regulatory issues.The asset management operations team of executives does not retain existing workers. Instead, hires new workers directly from college. Once they are trained and working well, they face limited chances of advancement or salary increases. The best part of the job is getting to know our internal and external customers.Not much room for advancement. Pay is not competitive.Raises are next to nothing, if you're lucky to get anything. You have to be thankful they give you anything.I was fortunate to work on a team that allowed to work from home sometimes, so I didn't have to go to that hole (Brooklyn) that often; a lot of people aren't so lucky.BNY Mellon is a great company to work for.  Everyone is usually friendly and easy to work with.  The management can award you for your efforts however can be easily overmissed. Low compensation compared to other companies in the industry in the area.This company is very political.  If the managers like you then you have a shot.  I worked there for almost fifteen years and as let go because I made a mistake.  They are in a lay off status and will get rid of you any way they can.  They do not look out for the employees but only for the company.  The pay is low for the work being done.  The benefits suck.Nice company but when it comes to advancement at times it is not all what it seems. Work force has become more of do with less associates, but have more work. Expectations take over a normal working day.Typically we have the daily schedule and work routines, everyone are assigned to certain clients/funds unless someone else is out for work. We are managing/processing the funds for our client and providing any services upon for requests. overall the company and the team are good but just the manager managing skills need to improve.BNY Mellon can provide you with a steady, challenging lifetime career in a modern, clean, friendly work environment.  The company strives to provide their employees with competitive salary and benefits.BNY Mellon is a very large company with plenty of different opportunities. For that reason, I believe it is a great place to start with directly out of college. There is a high degree of lateral moblity, however, this is not the case as far as upwards mobility is concerned,I worked here many years and my experience throughout the bank has been nothing short of  great.  I've met a lot of people in my time at the bank and have remained friends.Low compensation, no job security and hard to advance.  You can work hard but little recognition only good thing is coworkersEmployees are not paid enough. They go above and beyond and their work is usually met with just praise and not enough monetary rewards. This provides a lack if incentive.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,Palo Alto,CA,2016-11-06T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/245aaa2b-ba67-447b-842b-ee704d3d762a?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=13,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
