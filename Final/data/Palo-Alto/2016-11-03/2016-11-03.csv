477,1881.0,Sr Staff Scientist Analyst - Chemist,Abbott Laboratories,4.2,1300.0,"My work at Abbott Labs was very much a typical ""corporate America"" experience. Though it was very predictable and gratifying, I missed the opportunity to have more creative outlets.I performed line maintenance support for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance on Bag fabricators, Fill/seal rotary fillers, Bag overwrap machines, Continuous Sterilizer and Packaging equipment. I completed plc program changes for installation on weekends, I completed all necessary paperwork. this included Cad drawings, ECR's, Printouts of electrical drawings, backups of the plc programs. I worked with production management, engineering, and maintenance personnel. The most enjoyable part of my job was the satisfaction that I earned the respect of all the people that I worked withThe project brought together multiple departments to work on resolving an issue created with a system implementation.  Working with these people helped everyone learn about other departmentsHard working people in need of some management change. Style of management in need for a better strategy to succeed. Too many foreigners trying to fit in a complex culture. Talent and expertise overshadowed by outspokenness.Good pay and benefits.  Too many meetings. Good management.  Flexible with life issues. Co-workers were good. Team environment was good. Time off was good.A great company to work for. Being able to go home everyday knowing you are helping a company that save lives is one of the best feelings in the world.the working environment is good with knowledgeable staff and good management. Sometimes employees are asked to do very difficult tasks in an unreasonable amount of time. and there are some employees that are very cliqueish management will get rid of you if they feel you're damaging their percentages so attention to detail is key.The Rocky Mount site, under Abbott Labs, was a great place to work.  Employees were dedicated to providing quality products to meet customer needs.The company itself is good but the management working in our country is very much biased and the compensation given to the employees is well beyond the expected.Great work place and opportunities foe employee skills enhancements. leader in Pharma companies. Work environment is great and flexibility at work place and courteous colleagues.Provided a comfortable work environmentVery productive peers and managementModerate facilitiesOn site work out facilityOn site cafeteriaEnjoyed my time working thereAbbott is a company that inspires people to excel and learn new and improved techniques in daily job performances. Training and procedures is a must for all.I loved tis job. the only issue was the shifts. They were short on people so a lot of workers were working 12 hour shifts multiple days out the week.I enjoyed working for this company. Overall it's generally a good place to work. liked the people that I worked with they liked being there. The number one reason people stay is because of the benefits for the pension plan and insurance.It is a positive environment to work and prosper in. Communication is very vital at Abbott and they do it well. They are very good about working with your personal schedule and lifeIt was really nice working therepeople there are very friendlyI learned a lot while working thereCo-Workers are pretty freindlyI enjoy each and every moment Management is very goodThere was no typical day at workI really enjoyed my time at Abbott Laboratories, which was the catalyst for expanding my engineering ""toolbox"" and learning different aspects of the business.I love my job and I love how Abbott balances family and work life. The management is amazing and makes sure that if you want to learn and grow in your career then opportunities are given.The people are very helpful and knowledgeable.   I would love to work with Abbott again. The facility has a full gym to work out and the cafeteria is open at night.Terrible to move from temp to hired. Worked as a temp for almost a year and there were no opportunities to get hired in. They were cutting jobs when I went elsewhere.I learned to processed and inspect various stents. I was certified with different machinery and tooling. I enjoyed working with people who speak different languages. Embracing diversity is a must in a production line.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,Santa Clara,CA,2016-11-03T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/7d1b582d-6dc1-4e3a-9991-640ef5fb0009?mescoid=1300090001001&jobPosition=24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
