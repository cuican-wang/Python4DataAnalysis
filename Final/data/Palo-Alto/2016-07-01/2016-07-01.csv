232,1636.0,Director Biostatistics,Pharmacyclics,2.8,14.0,"No longer the company that I was happy at a few years back.  Lots of Micromanagement from the new management.  Poor culture and bullying going on within different groups.Extremely supportive managers provided guidance as well as pushed us to succeed all while promoting team work. It was evident from the start that the company cared for your well being.I accepted a position moved my family out here after a less than stellar interview. I was promised that they would make up the lower pay rapidly with job promotion if I produced results. Within less than six months I had senior directors thanking me for the stellar job. The promised promotion to make up for the loss I took, never happened and over a year later never will happen.Line managers lie to your face, gossip behind your back, spread inconsistencies ( aka lies), and talk to other try to hunt down personal information to manipulate. This is appalling. Never have I seen this in a work environment to the degree. It is unprofessional boardering of discrimination lawsuits. I am just waiting to move on at a different company. Others have switched departments as frequent as every year just to get away for the rude and clueless upper management.Managers take credit for employee work. No class when it comes to talking to people. They just dont care. Culture does not promote  open communication. No growth, lack of promotion/raise unless you kiss-butt or are buddies with the manager.Fun, fast paced, great team and management. Recently acquired company, most enjoyable part was seeing everything come together on the Events team.Culture of fear. Lack of leadership at most levels. Not a fun place to work for most. Lots of people are leaving, which is why so many jobs are available. Expect more of this.Greatly improved since new management took over.  There are great people working there and the drug is amazing and doing great work.Was a great place to work. Very close to my house. I got to meet great people and they are still my friends. They had a company wide lay off after clinical trials failed.Great product--a home run.  Culture--Toxic.  Exec. Team lead through micromanagement, fear and intimidation.  Amateurs at building a collaborative, high performance team.  Very political.  Compensation and promotions are out of the blue no rhyme or reason.  If COO likes you and you suck up enough, you will have two promotions and large increases in one year.  Everyone can work their tail off and never get promoted.  Very uneven rewards and no recognition.  No work life balance.  It's all work.  Leaders are rude and they don't deserve the titles or compensation they have.Typical Day: Many meetings to set up and take down, up to 1-4 per day all between 11:30- 1, and upwards of 20+ attendees. What I learned:  I learned patience is all one has when dealing with crazy timelinesManagement: Management takes care of their own, they were all AMAZING.  Although in any place there may be some which can be difficult to please. Co-Workers:  Best co-workers ever, many whom will stay with you during rough seas.  Never saw so many people work as hard as they do, co-workers and the powers that be. Hard part of job: Seeing the stress on peoples faces, and wanting to do anything to help relieve their stress, but I am not a qualified scientist or Dr, so I would support in any way I could, especially by making sure they eat or drink to keep going.Enjoyable part of job:  The FDA approvals and the importance of their new drug Imbruvica.  It is extremely rewarding to be on that crazy train to see the end results.Everyone below Manager level is paid Hourly.This means half of the company..!Typical day usually requires some sort of testing whether it be KF, disso, assay/impurities, or GC. PCYC was willing to train me from the beginning so i learned everything from cGMP documentation, how to run LC's, to audit readiness, etc. Management in QC is excellent, other departments may vary. Colleagues in the Quality department are great. Teamwork is crucial. Hardest part of the job is getting over how urgent everything is. Everything always seems to be most urgent and due ASAP. The most enjoyable thing about the job is knowing my work has contributed to helping patients.Employees: stressed out and confusedManagement: arrogant, selfish and incompetentProjects: disorganized and un-realCulture: 'push you around', 'sink and drown',Questionable ethical standard, or lack thereof, and decisions made by untrained individuals.","501 to 1,000",Palo-Alto,Sunnyvale,CA,2016-07-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/36585b01-8cbb-47e1-8edd-cd71485e33fd?mescoid=1500153001001&jobPosition=24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
