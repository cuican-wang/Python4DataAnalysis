1,1405.0,"Data Scientist, Internet Services Team",Apple Inc.,4.3,2700.0,"As a specialist, your duty is to help customers. Whether that is purchasing Apple merchandise or helping them trouble shoot. I learned more about communicating with customers. How to figure out more than one solution to one problem and to always keep the customers interests ahead of mine. Hardest part of my job was dealing with tasks that I was in no way required to do. Some customers would come in with issues that you had to resolve despite it not being an Apple app problem or software malfunction. But keeping Apple loyalty among customers is very important, so it had to be done. Enjoyable part of my job was helping people. As well as interacting with customers. I was able to learn new tasks and solutions every day. My coworkers were more than willing to lend a hand if needed and were so diverse in their education, backgrounds and fields of expertise that they had so much to offer myself as well the customers.Work/Life balance is horrible if you're in a shift job that changes hours and days every 14 weeks and you have kids. Management wants to cheerlead you through the long hours, poor raises and sudden shifts in job requirements with copious swag and beer parties you can't even attend if you're on shift anyway (or you'll be on the phone buzzed, which isn't allowed). If you're willing to still through those for the health and retirement benefits then this is the place for you. Otherwise, look elsewhere. It's so competitive here, people trying to get ahead will not hesitate to throw you under the bus and climb over.Typical day of my work is to schedule multiple interview while also monitoring day to day schedules (up to 4 - 5 a day). I also send out offer letters and on-board new candidates. I learned how to juggle all these things at once and how to handle work/life balance. Working at Apple as taught me how to use Mac software as well. Management is great! They always made sure to communicate and never point a finger. Just get the problem fixed if it ever raised. My workers are really dependable. Everyone wanted to help and so did I. Hardest part of my could be the last min updates to interview schedules but that was usually day to day so it did not become a problem. The most enjoyable part if when I get to on-board new candidates that I scheduled. It can be so rewarding to know that all your hard work was a life changing to someone.The company treats you like family and not just a number or an employee. You are welcomed with open arms into the Apple Culture and you find yourself speaking and acting the Apple way even though you may not even be present at work. Level of expectations are extremely high and you find yourself doing the same in your personal life. You learn that ""good enough"" doesn't fly but rather that perfection is expected of you & you find everyone else striving on a daily basis to meet that level of expectation. There is job security! Its hard to advance internally but to advance externally is easier.Apple as a company is a great company to work for. They train and give competitive wages. The benefits are a real positive that the company offers. A typical day at work can be very stressful and physically demanding.I learned teamwork, technical skills and staff development. Co-workers were my favorite part of the job, however management left a little to be desired. The hardest part of the Job is the customers that demanded more than what we can give. The most enjoyable would be the repairing computers.The best part of working at Apple was helping customers who appreciated your knowledge and expertise. However, management and getting promoted could be very political. Employees were given opportunities to mentor continuing and incoming hires, as well as start programs that contribute to internal culture. While at Apple, I started Old Orchard Magazine, a publication designed to get all the store's news to the entire team, while including light-hearted, health-related content about flu shots and yoga poses.I've had a great time at Apple, I started as a lowly phone agent in 2007, but in 9 years have increased my salary by 4 times and am doing jobs I never thought in 2007 I'd be doing now. Management is great, (keep in mind there are 10k people in this campus, and I've mainly worked in the operations side of things without a degree) albeit times the culture seems to be shifting from the bottom up worship of the past to a top-down middle manager methodology.(Contract position)A typical day of work consists of 75% of the day spent at your cubical on a laptop with a large monitor, 12.5% of mandatory break time (two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch break), and 12.5% of group discussions and team meetings. Management at times seems to lack interpersonal skills and asking questions is always a tricky situation to navigate. The team is encouraged to ask questions to maintain consistency on projects, but ask the wrong question and you risk being ridiculed by management. Team members are often compared to one another to create a competitive work environment. Favoritism by management is a large problem the team faces, and payment is not always on time or accurate.Best call center helpdesk to work in hands down - training is extensive, couching and follow-up is constant, only hurdle is politics with management that will affect promotions and new positions.Overall, working for the Apple Store is an amazing opportunity. Their entry level pay is higher than most places, and you get plenty of benefits, even if you're part time. You just need to be willing to handle an extremely fast paced environment with a constant flow of customer traffic. Your skills with customer focus, product knowledge, and learning on the fly play a huge part in being a specialist for Apple.Most of the coworkers are friendly and willing to help, but unfortunately, the management uses personal favoritism in order to determine who gets to grow within the company.This is blessing and a curse, as it gives the person with little previous experience the chance to gain top notch management experience. With so many unqualified managers running around though, it turns into a culture that fosters favoritism, and promotes based on networking, rather than actual job experience and talent.I loved this job at first, but my vision was clouded by the glam of working for the company. Once the koolaid wears off, you find yourself surrounded by a bunch of zealots who would throw you under a bus in a moment's notice to get that next promotion. Be careful who you trust at this company, be very careful.Also, I had 10 different managers in 9 months. I only switched teams twice. They are constantly moving managers around, building cold and lifeless manager/employee relationships that are vaguely based on personality, and largely based on metrics.By all means, get your job experience, but get out before it sucks the soul out of you. The mangers ruin this job.Working for Apple was one of my best job experiences. The only downside was that once I was determined to be a ""rock star"" in sales, it was almost impossible for me to move into a different position within the store. I was only able to recieve my technician liscense after having surgery, and not being able to be on the sales floor, which allowed me time to study and pass the test. Even then, I was only allowed behind the genuis bar when they were shorthanded.Good Job Work/Life BalanceGood Compensation/BenefitsGood Job Security/AdvancementGood ManagementGood Job CultureOverall Good experience at Apple.It's a fun place to work. Very progressive and inclusive culture. Top notch benefits. Have met some great people. Processes are always changing. Would like to see more stability on schedule.This is a great place to work! The team culture is awesome and great and the benefits are off the chart! The option to work from home and the company advancement are great!Apple was great to work for, don't get me wrong but they were stingy when it came to raises and there was not a lot of chances for a home based agent to move up.  Probably because well, you are home based and many of the job openings are not.  The benefits are excellent; if I remember it correctly you had health benefits on day one (no waiting period.) which of course if very rare.  Another very silly and vain perk was just the fact that you are working for Apple!  When people would ask who you worked for and I would say Apple you could see the admiration on their faces (and working from home for them just added to their jealousy!)  All in all it was an awesome experience and one that I really wouldn't hesitate to recommend to someone else.From your first to your last day with Apple, expect to be pushed to your limits in your knowledge and ability in several ways. Your team and your fellow coworkers are great at supporting you and keeping the environment cheerful and positive. Plenty of opportunities to grow as an AppleCare representative and in administrative positions. That in mind, you will need to be more than proactive in reaching out to additional hiring managers if you want to be anything but AppleCare.This company has changed drastically over the last few years. As it has grown quickly, the work environment has become much more corporate. There is a large influx of former Dell management that have joined the team and the work environment is more like Dell (all of the bad stories you have heard over the years). Employees are now seen as disposable.Worked in a highly engaged, valued customer service position. Enjoyed learning about Apple Technology and programs and worked with like-minded individuals.Management was varied but driven and provided good support on job roles and information. The co-worker environment was minimal since the position was work from home, and allowed personal relationships to build when wanted.The hardest part of the job was having to let it go. If the option was or is available to me I would absolutely work for them again.The most enjoyable part was the problem solving. Being able to resolve and determine technical issues.Have to love this company. It is a test of your intelligence, Technical aptitude and definitely people skills. If your looking for a feel good job that tests your limits this is the place. The people that you work with are great! They will become your second family. Benefits are second to none. And corporate knows exactly what they are doing and always have something in place to transition into whatever it is they are doing.My overall experience at apple has been excellent, however most my my negative experiences such as bad management, over micromanagement, and poor benefits apply to the contracting company Apex Systems.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,Cupertino,CA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/data-scientist-internet-services-team-job-cupertino-ca-us-176041343.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

They have acquired Blue Coat and most recently Life Lock.   I enjoy the people and time at Symantec.    Their is an onsite cafeteria serving gourmet/healthy food.All of the pro's and con's of high tech, but better than most.  Company has undergone a lot of change in past few years.  Expect more, given state of industry.Had great camaraderie with coworkers and people reporting to me.  We pushed each other to try the impossible, to ask the ""what if..."" questions, to expand our knowledge.Working with Symantec was a great experience. The team environment was very supportive and encouraging. I had the best years of my career at Symantec.Symantec has been great with accommodations that I needed.What I learned during my 20 years:- Security practices- Tracking suspicious computer/network behaviors- Watching for individual/personal behaviors to watch out for abuse of network/corporate resources.- Backup & Server availability.great place to work for unfortunately my department was outsourced to Pune India,The people or coworkers were all team players and always helped out  to get the job done.benefits all were goood ones.Too many chiefs in this place and they all have their own agendas. The minions are great and a lot work towards growth which a lot of their bosses support which is a great thing but a lot also prevent this from happening.I learned I don't like sales. But the inside sales organization was fun. The people are mostly fun. They tend to change the pay structure a little too much.Great company really learned a lot working in a team collaboration was wonderful experience if i get chance work again Good place to learning new technologies	Information Technology analyst with over 7+ years of experience implementing, configuring, analyzing, customizing, maintaining and administering ERP software systems.While my experience at Symantec was overall positive, some of the management will throw you to the wolves to produce good numbers while ignoring your skills.  Workers are viewed--beyond what is acceptable--as expendable.  Training is minimal.  No effort is made to mine your talents.That aside, the camaraderie is collaborative, and the culture allows one to add significantly to one's skillset.It is a good company to work for, very amazing experience. I enjoyed my work experience in here with my collegues. Enjoyed most of my workSymantec currently rates very low job security wise. The Symantec -Veritas split and acquisition of Blue Coat have made things volatile and chaoticThe management themselves are confused about what's happening and this does have a baneful impact on the employees. The chaos has holistically impacted the full timers and contractors and many are being laid offGood Company, undergoing transformation. Good times ahead with new acquisitions and investment partners joining in.Chilled out work culture with good work / life balance.Compensation is not great though.Not highly recommended for career enhancement.If you are not working for the latest company that they have acquired, watch your back.  Your job is headed to the cheapest place they can outsource it to.Veritas was purchased by Symantec. The majority of my employment was during the Veritas years. There was plenty of opportunity for overtime. As a matter of fact, it was required. I learned much during my employment here.Now that the Symantec/Veritas experiment is over, it will be interesting to see if the stand alone Veritas can return to former greatness.  Will need to adapt better to the cloud.Great place to work.  It is unfortunate that the Veritas Springfield site was chosen for a shut down after the split from Symantec.  I loved my job and the people I worked with.The company was great to work for.  They were extremely flexible with work from home options. They took great care of their employees.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,Mountain View,CA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/9779b64a-2eff-4e00-9495-7c19b66a126d?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

A lot of time wasted in meeting rooms and directors really don't know wich direction to move forward.A typical day at work will include helping customers place their orders for their small businesses. Working at Intuit is a very rewarding career.Great company to work for, benefits are great when you are a full time agent. Even seasonal's were treated with the same respect. The management was not the best within training, and you were led on about advancement opportunities. Training was not enough for the type of job you were doing But overall the company is great and so are the managers, just needs to learn to manage time better and to be more direct with advancement opportunities instead of lying just to keep people on board,Great job, Great co-workers, Great Management.

121,1525.0,Data Scientist_Intern Evergreen,Intel Corp.,4.2,2000.0,"This is a great company with excellent management. Incredible technology and great leadership. I was part of one of their acquisitions and they are a company that rewards the people that are willing to work like it's their company.Intel probably has the biggest challenge now to find it's purpose in a a world where the PC is become less relevant.  I wish them the best of luck.What can you say? It is Intel!! This company takes care of its employees like none other.  Job training was top of the line. You did not have a supervisor, you had a facilitator .Former employees of Intel of Puerto Rico still consider themselves as one big family. We had such fun doing our jobs making for excellent quality products. Everyone had a sense of pride and responsibility that was greatly compensated with gifts to include extra cash bonuses. Great, great company.I have learned so many new  technical things which i don't know,here management is very good and coorperative,co-workers are very friendly most enjoyable part of the company is work culture.Am working at Intel mostly very busy everyday, The fun part that my Boss and my coworkers are very friendly and team work. we always sit down trying to solve the issue to make thing right.Good place to work if you can stand for long periods of time good to employees clean and respectful Environment. People were nice.Intel as great benefits; flexible work environment. Lots of room for growth and advancement. But it depends on you and your manager as to what you get out of your career.Intel senior management has good intentions but the culture doesn't support the proliferation of their ideas.  Middle and lower management are generally poorly trained and that can impact your career unless you are savvy enough to maneuver around them.  But there are some real gems working at Intel, the benefits are great, and the opportunities can be rather exciting.A productive working environment. You could transfer from within the company. Learned new jobs.  Met new and worked with a diverse working force. Good benefits.My experience at Intel has been a very positive one. This is a company that gives one the opportunity to maintain a great work-life balance and at the same time, exposes you to opportunities for innovation. The management is helpful and always looking for solutions to any problems the employees might have - in some cases even personal ones  in order to create a healthy work atmosphere. The work itself is the most fun part and so is working and ideating with the team.Intel hires a hardworking and dedicated workforce which is the best part of working there. What learned there will certainly help me be successful in my next job.Intel really did provide training and growth opportunities within their organization. They cared about the companies success. They had cubicles that had large windows so you didn't feel so confined, opportunities to support local charity events and tuition reimbursement. Great company!Intel was a great company to work for 10 years ago but in recent times the quality of the systems were significantly degraded due to poor management and prioritizing move to low paid and unskilled work force outside of USA at the high cost to USA workers forced out of our jobs after training non USA workers.In Intel I have learned how to manage the issues and the way to interact with employees to get things to get it done, intel is the safety nil work place and management the hardest part was vendor managing, the more enjoyable part of my work was event setups.Intel is not a steady place to work if you are looking for a life time career. Employment depends on the economical and political environment of the times.The company has huge potential, but engineering organizations lack ability to create good leaders.Numbers are valued more than people within development and HVM engineering organizations.Intense, fun, leading edge of technology, always pushing the envelope. Free coffee/soft drinks, fruits, gym on site and many great benefits. Constant work/life balance issues.It is a good place for hardware development or mid-managment level. more challenging for software development because the culture is so different and behind.Depending upon which group you report into, if you want to be challenged, Intel's the place to be. Some days will require long hours. In many ways, the manufacturing world continues to be like the 1970s.Intel provides a very competitive working environment and good opportunities for challenging assignments and advanced opportunities.

122,1526.0,Senior Data Scientist - Product Analytics,"Netflix, Inc.",3.8,247.0,"My typical day at work was pretty simple if all went well. My job was to answer questions, comments, and concerns with the website and the product we were providing as well as assisting with devices customers where using. It was a new challenge for each call and that was what kept it fun for myself. You would have a few bad eggs of course, but that rarely slowed down the pace of the day overall. Management told you how you could improve on your calls, and co-workers would talk to you during breaks about what they do when you run into a sticky situation. The hardest part about the job was having a rush of callers that gave us no breathing room in between to collect ourselves again. This, however, is standard with most jobs involving customer interaction. Also, compared to the number of customers they have, we were only helping a very small percentage of the overall user base. In short, the customers that called were the ones that definitely needed our help.Typical day at work is coworkers greeting me as I walk in the call center and customers eager to speak to me to have their issues resolved. I learned that it's easier to sympathize with a customer than to argue. Hardest part about the job is staying confident in yourself when you have angry customers criticizing you for mistakes that may have been on their part. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people and creating new friendships.Taking on a queue of thousands of calls on a daily basis taught me patience and fast problem solving skills, both are things I carry with me each day. It was a really team player type of environment I had the chance to work closely with management daily which taught me leadership skills. The most enjoyable part of my job here had to be talking to my customers giving them a great experience with each call made my day.NetflixCS claims to be different from any other call center environment in many ways. The problem is that, with every development, there are several setbacks. NetflixCS has outsourced many departments and has shown little interest in promoting or retaining talented employees. As with many other similar customer service jobs, they simply do not care, and are just as happy to replace you as they are to hire you. Simply having acceptable compensation and benefits does not a good work environment make.Love waking up to go to work. Very relaxed work environment with flexible seating arrangements. Teams were very intimate and team leads worked with agents one on one week after week to improve in areas that were lacking. For every holiday and new release there was a celebration including food and games.This was a great job in the fact the the co-workers and the atmosphere were relaxed, and overall friendly. However, they gave little opportunity for in house promotions though originally promised all promotions would be in house. Training provided was proficient, but could have been stronger as the company later changed it's customer care requirements. The benefits at this job were amazing, and overall I would definitely recommend this company to anyone ow that they have fully established the needs of the company and customer care required as well.I enjoyed listening to music while I worked on the machines. When I first started working there it was fun people were tired but for the most part happy. Shortly after I was hired they started laying off and firing most of the employees. They also kept changing and getting rid of supervisors and managers. It was also very difficult to progress even though they said there was room for growth.Autonomy, great compensation and the opportunity to work with the best of the best.  This is an opportunity of a lifetime! Only problem is they spoil you and makes it impossible to find anything else that compares!This is one of THE best places that I have ever had the opportunity working at. The work atmosphere is unlike any other. They are such a welcome, caring, fun, and open group of people. This is a place where you can literally be yourself, not feel judged, and just have an amazing time at work. They teach you, uplift you, and help you reach your goals in all aspects. I have learned so many things, and I am happy that I was able to work their because I think they have made me a better person overall, and I can take the skills that I learned there, and put them into my life.The crew and trainers who I was set to work with were great. I unfortunately had to leave Netflix due to medical problems, but was pleased with the amount of training I received. I never once met or saw my direct boss, but saw my trainers on a constant basis. The work was relatively slow paced, which left a lot of room for no productivity.Typical day at work is answering lots of calls and talking with lots of customers from different locations. Things I have learned is how to help customers around their accounts. Management and co-workers are very awesome. Awesome part of the job are breaks and free lunches.Worse place ever as it was all temporary from the very start.. so they have 3 interviews they make you jump thru after you go thru the hardest hiring process as far as applying and awaiting an interview period?? I think I didn't hear a response for about 6-7 months later?? The management was so poorly picked and orcustrated that I would highly doubt Netflix CS survival here in Utah.. I bet now they hire the lower bracket of individuals with actual experience and knowledge about tech support that their turnover ratio has to be a record high.. the supervisor I had was very demeaning and condescending and passive aggressive like he had an agenda to ruin folks lives, cause nobody on my team is there anymore as I still communicate with all of them!!Worked the shipping and receiving office. Hours 9 am to 5:30. Unloaded daily deliveries of all DVD'S.  Then the second half of the day I shipped out the Netflix swag for all 55 Hubs ( shirts to hats etc)enter all shipment into a excel spreadsheet and sent daily tracking numbers to the managers. Once delivered enter the data and tracking into a spreadsheet that was sent out weekly. Also took care of all the in house mail coming into the hub. We worked as a team always open discussions together. Loved the company.I worked for netflix for almost 2 years. It gave me the chance to help build a company. I was one of the first agents to work for netflixcs. While working there I sawany changes happen over the 2 years. I also had the chance to help build the company's culture and grow larger.The job is not a difficult job, but it is very redundant and the constantly want improvement even when improvement is not easy. It is hard to come in to the same thing every day and it gets to the point you dread hearing the beep in your ear letting you know a call is coming. Most customers calling in are angry about things you cannot control such as being unable to take certain payment methods by phone or content you can't put on for them. you get at least one angry customer a day typically on average and it is difficult on your self esteem and it is an emotionally draining job. THAT is what makes it difficult not the job at hand itself.This is definitely a great and fun place to work. I love video games and tech so working at this call center was really fun. Getting to know new releases and playing with the different devises that you could load the app ontoProvide exceptional customer service and problem solving by responding to all inbound calls, assist customers with new and existing accounts, website navigation, and account billing. Be an active listener who can show empathy and patience. Work in a fast paced, high volume, changing, and non-scripted environment while learning and strives to gain new knowledge about product and service changes.Shifts are unstable and you have to be willing to change your schedule during shift bidding.

Good personality up there but they really do care about you up i liked the job.They look down on the good workers and praise the lazy workers. They believe that whatever they wanted to do was ok, didn't really care too much about how the workers feel. Didn't appreciate the hard work and dedication I put in.Load and unload trucks with forklifts, pallet jacks, or cherry pickers with Clorox products. Conducted inventory control. Managed and reviewed customer orders/requests and manually enter data of orders.Coordinated with shipper’s customer service representatives on exceptions, rush orders and order changes.It was easy money. No one on your back. laid back supervisors. Great environment clean enviornment. Really enjoyed my time there keep count of your pointsIt's an ok place to work. I moved while I was working there so the commute turned into a hassle for me. 82 miles 1 way. Not their fault.When working 4 10s a week I put up with it because I had 3 days off.Then my hours changed to 4 9s M-Th  and 4 hrs. on Friday. I tried it for about 3 months but after a while the 164 mile round trip wore on me so I put in my notice.The Clorox Company is an excellent place to work.  There is a perfect work / life balance. Good atmosphere, Safe environment, Excellent health benefits.Clorox (unlike any other company) has a positive, engaging and inspiring work environment.  You can work hard but you can also find time to play. Management encourages you to learn more and to consider advancement.  Excellent place to work but benefits are not offered to everyone.It is a traditional company with more than 100 years of history.  To advance in this company, one needs to be in the ""in group"" with the few senior managers.Keeping all safety procedures and rules enforced. Stocking and handling hazardous chemicals.  Very busy tidy work place, always new employees.The day always starts off good at Clorox. There are lots of people with different backgrounds and ages who are there to help anyone that just started the job. The thing that i loved most about this job was that they always had things for you to do. I learned that Clorox does not only ship clorox products but others as well, and that taught me once again uu cant judge a book my its cover.  At this job i also learned more about my personality as well as my future. Because the job had many people  that i got to meet and grew alone with them, I had a better understanding of what life is really about.Its a very good first job for new comers. It definitely prepared me for a warehouse workplace. The pay rate started off fair, and became excellent after a while. I liked it. My co-workers were the best.Wonderful work life balance, managers are very knowledgeable.  Work is always challenging and exciting. Co-workers are always pleasant and engaging.Unfortunately, the plant closed. I enjoyed my time working for Clorox. I learned a lot and felt like I truly contributed to the company. The pay was great and I loved the hours. I appreciated how safety conscience the plant was.It's not one of the best places to work but if you need something fast it's ag guaranteed job but the hardest part of the job is standing in the heat for that long it's a lot of drama there sothe Lee's you talk the Less you talk to people the betterClorox cares for their employees and that is shown through the people you work with. The people you work with here are irreplaceable. The culture and work environment are outstanding.Good company, a fun place to work.  A ton of visibility to upper level management.  Very friendly work environment, I would recommend.  They compensate the interns very well.I love working at Clorox and would continue if I could pursue my ideal role from my current location.   Unfortunately, such an opportunity does not exist in my current location. Next steps for me would mean continued heavy travel and / or another move for my family and me.My first job was at The Clorox Company, and they do great job of teaching you how to transition from college to a work environment. A typical day deals with a lot of meetings, phone calls, and some lab time. Most managers are strong people developers who truly want you to succeed. Coworkers are friendly and the work environment promotes collaboration allowing you to talk to anyone at any level at any time. The hardest part of the job is that when you're in a position you have to stay in that position for about 2 years before they will rotate you. Most enjoyable part of the job is how rewarding it is to see the products you've worked on in stores.Great place all co workers treated you like family. Learned so much while working there. Great benefits from helping you out with school and time off if needed.Worked as a team member. Ran machinery, assembly, and fork truck. There was only one other women on the shift that I worked at so I missed getting to talk to someone that had the same interests as I did. I had a hard time sleeping during the day because I had  sons at home at that time. The lack of sleep really got the best of me.Need to be able to work independently and with others that included diverse leadership styles to include:Extreme detailed, clear written and oral communication skills, taking ownership of a project from beginning to end, define current and future processes, work in an extremely fast pace environment, high quantity and quality of work needed","5,001 to 10,000",Palo-Alto,Pleasanton,CA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/a4001451-22ef-4124-b429-1d8f85feb58b?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=2,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
177,1581.0,Aster Presales Data Scientist,Teradata Corporation,3.7,38.0,"Working at Teradata introduced me to working in a fast pace office setting by teaching me how to handle stress and meeting deadlines and special projects without impacting my work quality or professional demeanor.Overall, Teradata is a great company to work for during my time there.  Unfortunately the division I was working for was sold and there was a reduction in force.If you aren't hired in as management you won't get good raises and the bonuses have decreased dramatically over the years. Training isn't a regular issue here and if you get any it must be on your own time. They offer virtual jobs, so this is the only true perk to Teradata.It seems the corporate policy is to hire at a low income and keep it low with very small annual raises if you even get a raise.Teradata Corporation is a proven leader in its field of data warehousing, with very effective personnel staffed throughout from entry level up through the executive suite. In my part of the organization (sales and marketing), there is a heavy reliance on a national / international network of far-flung resources, many who work remotely from their homes.As such, the culture is based around multiple daily conference calls and heavy use of email. It makes for a great work-life balance, and yet our productivity as a company proves that people remain focused on executing their responsibilities with focus and rigor.The hardest part of life at Teradata for me, however, has been the company's very flat structure and limited opportunities for career advancement and growth. Compensation is relatively competitive, though, which serves as a partial offset.Voted one of the best 25 companies to work for.Teradata Labs, the company's development arm, is based in San Diego (approx 1,500 employees)...with approx 10,000 employees worldwide.Bad Company. they don't care for their Employees. No Extra pay For Extra Hours worked. No Assistence provide for any Certifications. Higher Management is never reachable.My day consists of updating our current ERP system by fixing code, writing new code, testing, and creating Oracle forms. On top of upgrading the ERP system, I support the current system by helping the business users solve errors or problems they come across. My manager is great. He's very laid back as long as our work is completed in the time it's allocated to. Upper management could be better but still good people. The hardest part of my job is juggling all the work that's given to me in a given day. We are a $5 Billion company and our ERP team only consists of 14 people. Between supporting the current system and upgrading to Oracle E-business suite R12, time has to be managed well. The most enjoyable part of the job is staying busy.Responsible tracking and auditing travel & expenses for over 30 countries globally which is cultrally interesting and challenging. We have a good group of people and great contacts within the other department internally and globally. Hardest part is at times the language barrier, but we work with it and in the end it works. But, this can also be the most enjoyable, learning about all other parts of the world. All in all a great company!The company is great but going through changes, not all changes are good though. The management is a bit older and can find it hard to relate to the younger workers.Good technology, great coworkers. Lots of new strategic acquisitions in the big data space. Long work days due to large account base.Company trying to move in new direction.  Making the right decisions to shed low return assets.Lots of very good technology.The people I worked with are some of the smartest I have ever known. Managers are the best I have had the plaesure to work for.challenged with Hadoop and Cloud analytics offerings -> slow to no growth;  would be best to merge/ sell company;  selling marketing analytics is only firs step..Teradata has been one of the best companies I have worked for.  The people are outstanding.  I love what I do and I hope to carry this love for financial planning and analysis to my next employment.Great history but currently transitioning to a SaaS world and struggling.  Most likely an acquisition target at this point.The project I am working on Marketing Analysis application. A great team to work with and exposure to lots of technology within the big data Marketing Analytic.If you have a decent managers in the office, things will be good, if you don't its gonna make your work life suffer, don't expect much.  There is a park near by that you can scream atthe end of your work day but its closed during the winter.  Most managers in IT seem rather level headed, but something is changing in the air.I enjoy working here at Teradata.  However, I feel that I have reached my full potential and fell there is no longer any advancement for me here.Interesting company. Gone through a lot of changes since I worked there.Great company to work for and management sets the goals and let its people perform the work.

240,1644.0,Autonomous Vehicle Research Scientist - Technology Scouting,Ford,4.3,2300.0,"Enjoyed opportunity to self manage and work independently. The position of ""accounting specialist"" required travel through out the North and Southeast US. I enjoyed doing needs analysis in each of the auto dealerships and to customize the accounting software to meet the expectations  of dealership management.Days are normally 10 hrs day and 1st shift starts at 2 AM and sometimes last until 2 pm seven days a week. as a supervisor you must keep employees pumped up to get great production. The end result of good quality is always a plus.Loved the job. Wish I hadn't of messed up during my 30 day probation period. If I cannot find a better workplace before my yearly peiod to wait to reapply I plan on going back to work for TAC for sure!I liked working here. I was able to be able to do a little bit of everything. I helped out with the warranty department, I filed all thee paperwork form the previous days work as well as I was able to work with the guests and service advisers.Direct manager is not experienced enough for the role he stepped into witch desegregated work experience. made day to day very tedious and stressful. overall organization and owners we pleasantit been very nice and amazing job ,coworker really nice, every body know his or her job , the management really good and they always looking for new driver .Professionally patrolled to check for irregularities and to inspect protection devices and fire control equipment. Prepare logs and reports as required for informational purposes Respond to incidents of fire, medical emergency, bomb threat, flooding, inclement weather and other job related incidents.A very interesting, fun place to place.  As long as the work was getting done in a timely manner, you were free to talk while doing your work, which made the time go fast and streefree.db2 to write queries, business objects and crystal reports for reporting and opportunities to automate and/or improve an existing process.  Can make recommendations for action plans or streamlining to improve business performance.A very hard job . I found a niche in the paint department and did well . Because we had a strong Union we achieved advancements in pay and benefits.  With a bad economy in the Bush years the union lost power and the worker doing my job today is making the same money that I made in 2002 . The benefits have been eroding also . The retirees are paying higher prices on the benefits that they earned and have slowly lost . Well established company, I worked almost thirty-four years there and my father worked over forty-nine years.You get to meet great people and work with them as well.  great training programs and they are willing to do what it takes to get the job done.I have worked for Ford for 31 years and achieved more than my dreams could have imagined. I have met many people from around the world and have worked and launched various products in many of the plants in the United States. I have enjoyed coming back to do contract work as I am always glad to see many people again and work with them during launch. I greatly appreciated my time with the company.It's a nice job to have if you are a full-time employee!  With going from tpt to sts it's kind of hard deciding if you want to keep the job.  Or the fact that you just keep wondering if you will ever get hired in full-time!It was one of my early job. Learned a lot while being productive. Will work again if I had a chance to work there. Support after hours was sometimes difficult (laptop provided by company was a bit slow) but overall it was great.I worked for Cat Drive Away a company that's affiliated with Ford Motor Company. Fast and steady place to work. Very laid back and easy money... I loved working there and the people was very outgoing.Ford is a great family company with a knowledgable staff and a great work/life balance. The only downside is that all roads lead back to Dearborn / SE Michigan.Working at Ford was a good job. I enjoyed working with the other employees. Shifts were on a rotating bases, usually every three months your shift would be rotated. Lots of overtime.A typical day at work included monitoring equipment and automation and responding to problems with machinery.  It was very rewarding to diagnose issues and plan and execute resolutions.Being at a dealership you are exposed to the ins and outs of the car world and it being car make specific you end up learning everything about that make.  And as far as training is concerned the possibilities are endless, unfortunately working for a dealership does have a lot of drawbacks, mainly the drama of a high school world and there is a lot of political stuff involved, everything is based on time down to how you get paid.It was great place to work. But they changed their main focus on pharmacology. Providing PBM services and outsources IT services.Great benefits package but with what all you have to endure and deal with, it's no wonder that the pay and benefits package is what it is.  Some company personnel is great while others can be difficult to have to work under.  You will live inside this place and if you have a family, you will hear about their lives thru text on breaks.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,Palo Alto,CA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/e30a81b6-53c9-4f1b-8d60-6ad8c114d27c?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=32,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

382,1786.0,Customer Experience Analytics Engineer,PayPal,3.9,442.0,"Worked at a subsidiary of PayPal at Boston. The experience was half way between decent and good. Had high expectations for the work but was disappointed. Very good people though, loved working with them.Work-life balance good, fairly low stress environment, but if you don't fit a certain personality type, you will be relegated to bottom of the performance ""calibration curve"" and will get poor ratings and generally be ignored by management in favor of the teacher's pet types. Visibility is supreme at PayPal, and counts for more than results. So if you aren't a self-promoter, you will fade into obscurity.PayPal is a fast paced call center where a lot of hard working talent gets lost in the shuffle and menial busy work. Each day consists of handle anywhere from 30-70 contacts from customers via phone. There is very little down time and the scheduling is inflexible. Those who get ahead know someone, are willing to make big sacrifices to their work life balance, or get lucky. Turnover is very high and management holds onto apathetic supervisors just because they've been there a while. The benefits and bonuses make up for how difficult it is to keep a positive attitude at such menial work.PayPal was an excellent place to work. The culture was diverse and the management was spectacular. I was a contract employee working as a Talent Acquisition Coordinator. My day to day duties consisted of onboarding new hires, acting as an onboarding ambassador. I scheduled interviews for potential applicants throughout the country. My coworkers were so helpful and like a family, we were true teammates. The hardest part of the job would be to schedule interviews on and off site for sometimes up to eight people throughout the country. Many of the executives had very hectic schedules. The most enjoyable part was interacting with my teammates who were all offsite but especially dealing with my coworkers on site as well as working closely with the applicants.Over, it was a good place to work. The co-workers and workplace environment made it easy to work. Great benefits, company parties, and team-building events were a plus. The only drawback was having to meet unrealistic goals and metrics. Metrics are based on comment cards sent into customers. If customers are unhappy with the company, and not you directly, you still get penalized. Some micro-managing with upper Management. Can be stressful at times. Calls consisted mostly with payments and account status. Speaking to co-workers in the Philippians can be frustrating. If you have no problem with meeting metric, then this job is for you.PayPal has wonderful values, PAC committees that gather employee feedback, holiday pay, sick pay starting 2016 (a benefit that was given after a PAC committee review), health care, 401K, ESOP, Flex Spending, Management takes an active roll in employee development. Family friendly (Company Parties). Beautiful grounds, Secure building, Clean Restrooms, Clean mothers room, Charitable business, happy work-floors (There are tough days, but they applaud your crowing achievements). You can really build your career with PayPal.Excellent benefits and work/life balance. Inclusive culture with a progressive mindset. There has been steady growth over the years and the outlook for PayPal is excellent.The company is in a good posistion for growth and dominance in this market sector. Key partnerships are essential after splitting from ebay. Lots of change and there are many levels of management. As they grow I would anticipate a lot of flucuation in the continued future.I used to love working at PayPal but within the last few years it has become extremely apparent that once you hit 10 years or so they suddenly need to ""reduce headcount"" and you are out the door. Great place to start but make sure to keep options open once you've been there a while.New company since split from eBay - still feeling the growing pains. Enjoyable, but frustrating job since upper management made decisions without considering input from hands-on experts.I worked here and gained good experience in Customer Service over the phones. I worked in the call center and it was a controlled environment with strict time constraints to be adhered to and so forth.  If you want to move up here, best advice is to take initiative early and build rapport with your managers or otherwise be pinholed as just another worker.  I considered this to be just a stop in the road but stayed longer than I planned.  This was an overall good place to work and I would do it again under different circumstances.Great training program. I train a lot of the new team members. Management is supportive and invites input from workers. I have enhanced my skills as a communicator and trainer. Not eating to much in the awesome cafeteria is difficult. I enjoy interacting with Paypal clients to resolve they're issues.I really enjoyed working at this company. I worked with a great group of people and my supervisors and manager were nice and willing to work with me. I hardest part of the job was meeting the time allowed for each call.Good place to work for full time employees. Offers great benefits, good work life balance and good growth opportunities.Could have better policies for high performing consultants to get converted into full time employees.PayPal never seems to reach their potential.  Tenured, senior high performing employees routinely shown the down at or near their 10th anniversary, especially white males.  Absence of grey beards, and older women too, negatively impacts the ability of PayPal to understand the marketplace. Lack of business acumen in the management ranks is detrimental (most people managers are in their first jobs ever.) The management style is to keep employees afraid, which negatively impacts morale.  Entrepreneurial spirit is severely disciplined. PayPal is devolving vs evolving. Look for a buyout/sale/downward trajectory as their market awareness is poor (Level 2 insider.)What started out as a close family type of atmosphere grew to be corporate and all about making the most money. Great benefits and the people in the trenches are what makes this place great but the culture needs to change and improveGreat place to work benefits start first day.  Lots of training and testing but, with it.  Opportunities for advancement .  On site restaurant great food.  Answering customers phone calls and or emails.  Lots of reading from knowledge base.The company has good benefits, great work culture, very supportive, fun management and continuous training and productive fun work environment.I love the whole culture at PayPal. The training was wonderful. The culture is welcoming and warming. Co-worker supportive and helpful. Management there when you need them. The openness and honesty is the most enjoyable par.My review of this company is awesome.  The managers are great and they are willing to help in any way to help you succeed to get your goal.  Awesome companyPay Pal Was Soo Amazing They Believed In The Upside Down Pyramid Form. From The CEO To The Less Tener Agent The Paypal Culture Is Beyond Phenomenal.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,San Jose,CA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/ec82441d-e4de-4d24-9e76-38a246befa6f?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
