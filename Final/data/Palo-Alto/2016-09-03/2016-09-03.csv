226,1630.0,Research Scientist- Yahoo Knowledge Graph,Yahoo,4.1,325.0,"The most enjoyable part of the job was writing popular content.  Writing for the site allowed me to practice my writing skills.Lot of talented people and lot of fun loving environment.One of the early pioneer for open source community. Lot of new innovation and passion in the environmentThey try and pretend they are different, but it's just like working in any other call center environment.  It's all about how short your calls are, how many you take, and how well you can stick to a script.  The benefits are great, if you have to be stuck doing call center work.State of the art facilityco-workers are very helpfulteam environmentability to continue/further your careernegative: job was very redundant (not enough stimulation)Started off as a dream job but slowly (over the course of 3 years) turned south with layoffs and incompetent middle management who seemed less concerned with core Yahoo goals and beliefs.dealing with invoices and budget issues plus handling vendors and contracts, people attitude at Yahoo that I worked with on issues. lots of companies to deal with because Yahoo purchase 28 companies in one year with no process in place.Don't do it. Money is good. Team worker is terrible unless you like working for a dictator. One of the worst supervisor in industry. C Whitney. Turn over tells it all.Full of high energy and amazing team members. Fast paced environment. My managers were great. I still keep in touch with them.I've worked at Yahoo for my entire professional career.  I've seen the company grow from a fun start-up to a full fledged company.  Yahoo has worked to be a leader in the industry; however, there were many years where Yahoo did not provide a clear strategy externally.  This same lack of focus was evident internally as well, which impacted overall morale.The people at Yahoo are amazing, and the atmosphere is one of collaboration and involvement.  Yahoo does a great job in ensuring inclusiveness of all people, and the overall awareness of social issues and the world is encouraging.I get a media pass at San Diego Charger games and report over live radio what is and has happened in the game. I have learned how be a more productive speaker and getting to the exact key points of what is going in the game as I only have 1 minute to describe everything. getting everything summarized in a minute is the hardest part.Good Place to Work, great culture, waning market share.Focus on collaboration and team environment.Lots of perks, such as beer, offsites, games, etc.A little tense right now due to business conditions and the macro environment.Yahoo! has it all, great people great technology and projects to work on. The benefits are also awesome and they have a good work life balance. The free food is excellent, lots of choices, healthy and tasty.Yahoo! is a great company to work for.Great benefits and perks, the culture is awesome, and there's always lots to do.I would recommend this company to everyone!Amazing place to work if you don't mind a lottery style management system. The coworkers and work place was amazing, at least when I worked there, but hey lay offs and cut backs can diminish a place. I felt challenged on the job and successes were meaningful as you helped to turn businesses successful.Changing metrics turned it from an interesting place to work into a grindhouse.Metrics changed months after I was hired.The highest paid ""non-essential"" staff was let go.Help to support Yahoo customers via chat and email support only. We were doing phone support but that has been downsized.I worked as a contractor at Yahoo, and only for the amopunt of time that Yahoo limits for contractors. Because of my technical background I also got involved in creating pages for mobile search.Yahoo interviewed me for full-time employment because of my high productivity/output, it did not go through, however, because of the proximity in time to the lay-off in 2016 for which the people interviewing had no knowledge was going to happen.Work/Life balance leans much more on the Work side. Nearly everyone you work with is passionate about what they do and are supportive of each other. The people are what make the environment enjoyable.Typical day: Constant flow of requests for various design either pre-sales or post-sales that SHOULD have a one week turn around due date but have to be done in a day. Two at the most. A typical workload would be about 5 projects at the same time. Dealing with sales and tech AND the big client.management: All the designers are managers. Always begin a project with a kick off call; including the necessary team from other properties and verticals. From beginning til deliverable or launch date.hardest part: short deadlines or if the client isn't being fast in their responses and excess number of changes.enjoyable part: getting it done without a hitchWas a fantastic workplace for the first 3 years. The last year has been very depressing and seeing half the company get laid off was very disheartening. All so board members could take home a fatter paycheck.When I joined the company, there were great people, a ton of industry leading technology, and a sense of camaraderie as we tried to turn around an industry icon.Unfortunately, Yahoo never figured out its ""one thing"".  The one constant at the company was no product was ever finished.  Yahoo had a ""ship and forget"" mentality, and across all of the CEOs I worked for that never changed.Despite all of this, I really enjoyed my experience there.  It was a fantastic training ground for learning how to execute in challenging and dysfunctional environments.  Those product leaders who could work well with others, fight without ego, and drive towards a common goal were able to deliver despite everything else going on.Few other places offer the scale, impact and global reach of the products we worked on.  However, the past year has shown a significant, and fatal, decline in leadership, culture, and opportunity.Workplace with lot of opportunities to work on systems of large scale spanning several key areas. I had a chance to work with several intellectuals at this organization",,Palo-Alto,Sunnyvale,CA,2016-09-03T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/c9236de0-4d6d-4f70-9098-a7aeb298c480?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
