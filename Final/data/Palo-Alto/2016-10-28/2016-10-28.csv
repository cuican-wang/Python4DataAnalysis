84,1488.0,Data Scientist,Samsung Electronics America Inc,3.9,1900.0,"I got a lot of experience in this Very big project ( west quern 2nd phase project). It's Oil and Gas project. it's the third Biggest project of oil and gas in the worldIt was a very fast paced environment in which you had to keep up with. I wouldn't recommend for anyone that is not used to being in a fast paced setting. Overall, it was a great assignment job.Typical day was a 10 to 12 hour shift with 3 to 4 overtime for every other day. I maintained 400 production tools process flows and adjustments for the majority of the time. The rest of the time would be dedicated to meetings and management of passdown logs. I learned a lot from samsung. Physics, quantum mechanics, chemical engineering and so much more. It was the job I loved just because of the amount of things to do and learn. The culture was very segregated engineers and techs would be separate from production and house services that caused a lot of political infighting but things got done. Most of the management had a very high attrition rate and was replaced often. Mostly due to the lack of advancement. The pay raises were there but there was no upward movement in the company. The hardest part of the job was the balance of the information and its application to the production. You had to be able to see things down to the submolecular level to figure out how you needed to fix any given situation while trying to figure out how it would affect the rest of the production line as a whole. The best part was when you figured it out. That realization when you can hold your own with some of the brightest minds in the world when it comes to something you can't even see.I did a few months work at the San Jose Campus location prior to its rebuild. The management is great in the Sales department as they take care of their employees and contractors equally when I was there.I love to work in Samsung and i like to grow very fast but some conditions is preventing to achieve to my goal. Remarkable  i got more than 15 certification in 2 years.I've been working at SAS for 1 year and 4 months. I am a contractor. People at SAS are very nice and always willing to train you if you are open minded.Company does not know or train supervisors to be any kind of leader.  Good ole boy network is alive and well here.  I know people here that have been with the company 16 years and have never been promoted.I loved my job, I hate that I had to leave ... military orders. My boss was great and I loved the challenges they had for us. I do wish it paid better considering the large amount of Miles, wear and tear it did on my car.- Many meetings and work pressure- Best in class Corporate Operation- Responsibility and pressure- Many co workers rate Samsung same as I do- Employee audit- Good Pay for hard workersEmployees never stayed long and something was alwasy wrong with checks on payday. The work environment was intense and stressfulI love what I do when I work for Samsung but trying to move up in the company takes a really long time. There are no benefits for part timers and everything is focused on full timers. Enjoy my just and the people I meet just wish there was more.Alorica is a nice place to work at somethings within the company are not professionally handled. Would like to understand some of their policies better, not every inderstandableManagement and coworkers were fun to work with, and all materials were provided. We had proper training and if anything had to have any sort of difficulty, our manager made sure to train us properly on it.Since it was a third party company outsourcing customer service, there was no internal growth possibilities due to preferentism therefore no job security.If you are not accepted from the beginning, the ""Country Club"" crowd will push you out and make completing task virtually impossible to complete in a timely manner.Shipping and receiving products via 18 wheel deliveries.I had an entry level opportunity that has lead me to my current employer being Wireless Evolution, Inc.Wonderful Management, very educational.Co-Workers were not a part of my team.  Associates within the Warehouse works for the Warehouse we leased.  I lead our Warehouse staff from our only Samsung Distribution center in the Midwest and reported to upper Management at home office in Dallas.Working 3rd shift, decision making was always crucial as the rest of the company was asleep and most likely unreachable should an issue arise.Working for Samsung which is an innovative leader in the industry.Samsung work environment is hardship based on customer requirement. but for the employment an employee can live for the long time in samsungI recieved 3 certificate  from this job for being best line worker of the months i learned how to do everything  on the line,if i got to work and my lead was running late i knew how to start the line and get everybody goingI'm looking to build a name for myself with a new company at this point. Working for Samsung was fine. The company itself is amazing. But I didn't see room for advancement.Samsung overall is a great company to work for. They treat all employee's equality and fairly. Each day we were taken care of and made sure we felt part of the team and we were happy. As every job not everyday was the best day and the environment would be stressful surrounding the events of the Note7 having issues. My co-workers were very hard workers and all enjoyed being at work. The management was also pretty good. Some supervisors were a little lazy when it came to stepping up and helping fellow agents that needed it.You are usually walking around trying to find customers to interact with but most customers come to you. The best thing i recommend is that if you are in a best buy store you need to build a relationship with the bby employees.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,Mountain View,CA,2016-10-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/3be2df6e-1651-4b94-8ccd-c2529a3f619c?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
