700,2104.0,Toxicologist,Chevron,4.1,1200.0,"At the Colfax location, you deal with rude customers, a lot of heavy lifting and busy work. The coworkers are great but the management favors certain workers and cuts them a lot of slack while being hard on the rest.Great place to work and develop. Job is flexible, opportunity to travel. Could be less hierarchical and while some places are micro managed others allow for plenty of breathing roomVery good company I enjoy working for with amazing benefits, wonderful pay and excellent structure.  Truly the best company I have ever worked for.We were a small team of people working together. There was never a lack of communication or any problems. the cash registers worked well, i had good hours and decent pay. A lot of times I would be able to get off early because of hard work and was treated as good as i was at my job.Its a ok place to work during the day. It gets scary sometimes at night because u never know whats going to happen but it was also due to the location i was in. I loved seeing the new faces and also my regulars that came in. The owner was a very lovely person. I enjoyed conversation with her.A typical day at work was very repetitive with working with customer sales and store cleanliness. Clerks learned how to handle cash and customer service as well as stocking the shelves for future purchases. The management team was very willing to work for their employees. Most of the co-workers were willing to accomplish their job effectively.It was a great and laid back shift. The people who I worked with were great and it was just a relaxed environment. When it was bought out however, it just wasn't the same and u was forced to quit because of upset between myself and the new ownerWhen I worked as a contractor for chevron I was surprised about the instability of the work environment.  During my time there I slowly saw benefits I was promised be taken away with the instability of the field of work.  Over time the things I had appreciated about the job disappeared and I was left with the realization that this is no longer a company I would like to work for.* A typical day at work is helping the customers with their every needs.* Management was very friendly and productive.* The most enjoyable part of the job was that i got to help my customers.Abundant opportunities to be exposed to, and be involved with exciting subsurface opportunities across the globe. Highly skilled workforce, open to sharing their work and mentoring othersExcellent workplace culture, stressing safety, performance, and inclusionIt's a cool company to work for bein that I been there a whole year and the work and life balance is really suitable. Depending on the area, life and work balance differs along with pay.It's a private owned gas station but the  owners are amazing they treat you like family, they always try to help in anyway they can weather is be personal or work related. The customers are so friendly and nice.I enjoyed working with the onsite manager. I think they should appreciate employees more and the good things they do. They need some incentives for employees. Overall it was alright.Great work environment, Team orientation and lots of team efforts. Great work culture to work for and a balance work and life style. Team motivation. Team FocusIt's a workplace with lots of talented and nice people, fun to work at.  Generally the Company provides employees opportunities to grow and find their best interest to suit for business.Chevron is one of the BEST companies I have had the pleasure to work for. Very close staff. Everyone pulls for each other. The benefits are great. My hours are perfect. Unfortunately this BU is closing down and going to Questa Mine site. There the project will go into reclamation. I have learned so many skills with Chevron and they always encourage me to learn more. My supervisor is great and my coworker are assume.It was great working there. Great pay and you see celebrities every now and then. It stays fast pace during the summer and spring. But during the winter and fall, it's slow.I have worked here for 2 years now and have become very familiar with the company, and what is expected with the company. I have worked as management here and feel the company has provided me with great opportunities to excel and further pursue my career.Chevron is a very fast paced environment that requires attention to detail and team work skills. In my five years of employment with this company I learned most of the skills I know and use today. The hardest part of any job is to not complete a task and leave it for the next shift to complete this happens quite often in this company because everyday there are new task and deadlines to be met.I enjoyed working at the Chevron because there was so much to do. It wasn't your typical gas station. Attached was the A&W restaurant which I also worked whenever I was scheduled there. My managers were however lazy, except for one, which led to hostility among other employees.This company is great to work for. It offers competitive pay and advancement opportunities. The owner cares about the well-being of his employees. the company offers incentives.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,San Ramon,CA,2016-10-06T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/ba9cf4c5-7721-4919-b6a5-10cee92ce23a?mescoid=1900254001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
