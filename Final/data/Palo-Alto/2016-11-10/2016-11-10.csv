0,1404.0,Senior Data Scientist,NVIDIA Corporation,4.2,100.0,"People are friendly.  Really organized.  I learned a lot about the systems and how everything worked at the site.  Management was great.  The only thing I really did not like was the fact that growth opportunities took a while.  I have a lot of experience in security but needed to be patient in order to grow in the company.Working is not clearly directed. Direction is being changed every moment. Management has no enough experience to work on the system product and handing the people who from various cultures previously.Nvidia was a great company to work with. Employees are smart and creative thinker. Company takes care of its employees.You would learn a lot of new technologies here.Nvidia is one of the best company. I learned lot from my team. People are very cooperative. Sometimes, work load was not manageable but over all I rate 5 out of 5.Great co-workers, fun, challenging innovative products.  Upper management tends to have unrealistic schedule expectations that leads to long hours, stress and low morale.Every GPU cycle presents new challenges, features and work. Nvidia constantly pushes the envelopes in all aspects and leads the industry with new technologies.Most of the time, I am working with multiple teams to bring new chips and features to market. I am constantly learning and am supported by capable leaders and peers.Constantly working on new features and different teams across the world means I'm working around the clock. Work/life balance is reasonable but at times can be quite challenging over long periods of time. Management has good vision and direction. CEO is always thinking years in advance and pivots the company when beneficial to the future. Nvidia is constantly pushing gross margins which can be felt at the engineering level. Intent is good but can be overly restrictive at times (e.g.: lab equipment, computer purchases, etc).Was very informative to learn about how conferences work from outside in. Worked from checkin to after party and concluded with take down of the event. Was a great learning experience working along side the Events team at Nvidia.it is good company and really friendly environment to work with. My daily responsibilities are debugging, troubleshoot and fixing all the RMA devices. Sometime i have to work with software engineer in flashing and making sure the devices have a good and functioning image. I have enjoy and love to work for this company.As with many big corporations, there's a big game being played on employees..here it was primarily using West Valley Staffing, the in house staffing agency to lure people in with potential jobs at a growing co/dept but in fact, the department has NO requisition/authority to make this contractor a permanent employee, and NO incentive to, because WV pays below market, with almost no benefits, no sick time, no holiday pay unless you've been there 6 mos, etc. Good luck going through years of being underpaid, below market, for the ""hopes"" of becoming a permanent employee.  (stories of people being contractors for 2-5 years abound)And the other game is people working cross functionally, with reporting/performance/pay managed by one manager, but actual work and projects with multiple managers who don't communicate, so no one really knows everything you're being asked to do, or should be paid to do.One thing to remember before starting a job at NVIDIA that is, you are responsible for your work. Super Cool people and super smart minds. Your every word has weight. So when you say something to management or peers you better get it done because your word stands for your commitment. You will get all the help you need but you gotta ask for it. Nobody is going to do spoon feeding for you. The best part about it is you will learn a lot in the process and you feel confident. That's my best take away from NVIDIA.fair place to work, the culture is not so good in my team, but some team is better, pretty much depend on the style of the managerManagement is off hand which provides personal growth There is a lot of room for creativity. Work here to work in a environment that promotes growth.Nvidia is a great company to work for.   It is well known for GPU products using in gaming and High Performance Computing.  It is growing in Visual Computing  and Virtual RealityThis was a volunteer experience in which I setup monitors, booths, posters, and tables for the GTC conference. In addition I help setup lan cables in each room to provide everyone with a connection to the internet. This is one of the most memorable and enjoyable volunteer work I have ever done. Talking to the executives during the conference and learning about IT and how important it is before a day of a big event opens my eyes about the men and women of the IT industry.The company is run by  business savvy engineers which is quite rare for a company of this size.  The primary focus in the mobile products is always on delivery of a quality product.The CEO has demonstrated the ability to make strategic investments without bending to shareholder fickleness.  Sometimes these investments work out, other times they do not.  This is extremely important for companies long term health.The company focuses hiring on top talent across the industry.  This results in a diverse workforce that may be overwhelmed but is generally quite technically competent.This company has no regard for you or your family.  As long as you perform you will be OK...but if you are not a culture fit.  Good bye.    It is micromanaged by a megalomanic.  And frankly there is not much upside in their product line.  Intel will eventually eat their lunch.highly talented peoplegood managementgood base packageco-workers support is very goodgood work-life balanceCompany always tries to come up with good products and has courage to enter new markets.Nvidia is a great place to work, but it's lacking when it comes to having a conducive environment for younger or start-upy kinds of employees. It's a very classic style of doing business, and many of the middle people (who've been there for less than 10 years) will tell you that you could do worse in many places, but you could also easily do a lot better.Management is pretty hands off, certain ones will micromanage, but in general the structure of power is accessible from the lower rungs. The hardest part of my position was being one of the very few people who represented the target market/audience, and so many of the people making these products wouldn't ever consume them, and that dissonance was aggravating to be around.Learning and Development team at Nvidia is fairly new and still going through growing pains. There is immense potential for great stuff here but the lack of accountability is the crux of the problem. A lot of the times we over promise and under deliver. That doesn't help matters for a young team that is still finding a place of its own. My grouse is that we are still considered a non essential function and pretty much operate like a service organization instead of being strategic!This was my first professional job. I suffered a lot but also learned a lot from my co workers and colleagues! Even though I left that industry but I still miss them!Loved working here.  I probably learned the most about being QA here than anywhere else.  The people are all great and never was left without equipment to test with.",,Palo-Alto,Santa Clara,CA,2016-11-10T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/senior-data-scientist-job-santa-clara-ca-us-175759969.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
