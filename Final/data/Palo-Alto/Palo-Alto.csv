0,1404.0,Senior Data Scientist,NVIDIA Corporation,4.2,100.0,"People are friendly.  Really organized.  I learned a lot about the systems and how everything worked at the site.  Management was great.  The only thing I really did not like was the fact that growth opportunities took a while.  I have a lot of experience in security but needed to be patient in order to grow in the company.Working is not clearly directed. Direction is being changed every moment. Management has no enough experience to work on the system product and handing the people who from various cultures previously.Nvidia was a great company to work with. Employees are smart and creative thinker. Company takes care of its employees.You would learn a lot of new technologies here.Nvidia is one of the best company. I learned lot from my team. People are very cooperative. Sometimes, work load was not manageable but over all I rate 5 out of 5.Great co-workers, fun, challenging innovative products.  Upper management tends to have unrealistic schedule expectations that leads to long hours, stress and low morale.Every GPU cycle presents new challenges, features and work. Nvidia constantly pushes the envelopes in all aspects and leads the industry with new technologies.Most of the time, I am working with multiple teams to bring new chips and features to market. I am constantly learning and am supported by capable leaders and peers.Constantly working on new features and different teams across the world means I'm working around the clock. Work/life balance is reasonable but at times can be quite challenging over long periods of time. Management has good vision and direction. CEO is always thinking years in advance and pivots the company when beneficial to the future. Nvidia is constantly pushing gross margins which can be felt at the engineering level. Intent is good but can be overly restrictive at times (e.g.: lab equipment, computer purchases, etc).Was very informative to learn about how conferences work from outside in. Worked from checkin to after party and concluded with take down of the event. Was a great learning experience working along side the Events team at Nvidia.it is good company and really friendly environment to work with. My daily responsibilities are debugging, troubleshoot and fixing all the RMA devices. Sometime i have to work with software engineer in flashing and making sure the devices have a good and functioning image. I have enjoy and love to work for this company.As with many big corporations, there's a big game being played on employees..here it was primarily using West Valley Staffing, the in house staffing agency to lure people in with potential jobs at a growing co/dept but in fact, the department has NO requisition/authority to make this contractor a permanent employee, and NO incentive to, because WV pays below market, with almost no benefits, no sick time, no holiday pay unless you've been there 6 mos, etc. Good luck going through years of being underpaid, below market, for the ""hopes"" of becoming a permanent employee.  (stories of people being contractors for 2-5 years abound)And the other game is people working cross functionally, with reporting/performance/pay managed by one manager, but actual work and projects with multiple managers who don't communicate, so no one really knows everything you're being asked to do, or should be paid to do.One thing to remember before starting a job at NVIDIA that is, you are responsible for your work. Super Cool people and super smart minds. Your every word has weight. So when you say something to management or peers you better get it done because your word stands for your commitment. You will get all the help you need but you gotta ask for it. Nobody is going to do spoon feeding for you. The best part about it is you will learn a lot in the process and you feel confident. That's my best take away from NVIDIA.fair place to work, the culture is not so good in my team, but some team is better, pretty much depend on the style of the managerManagement is off hand which provides personal growth There is a lot of room for creativity. Work here to work in a environment that promotes growth.Nvidia is a great company to work for.   It is well known for GPU products using in gaming and High Performance Computing.  It is growing in Visual Computing  and Virtual RealityThis was a volunteer experience in which I setup monitors, booths, posters, and tables for the GTC conference. In addition I help setup lan cables in each room to provide everyone with a connection to the internet. This is one of the most memorable and enjoyable volunteer work I have ever done. Talking to the executives during the conference and learning about IT and how important it is before a day of a big event opens my eyes about the men and women of the IT industry.The company is run by  business savvy engineers which is quite rare for a company of this size.  The primary focus in the mobile products is always on delivery of a quality product.The CEO has demonstrated the ability to make strategic investments without bending to shareholder fickleness.  Sometimes these investments work out, other times they do not.  This is extremely important for companies long term health.The company focuses hiring on top talent across the industry.  This results in a diverse workforce that may be overwhelmed but is generally quite technically competent.This company has no regard for you or your family.  As long as you perform you will be OK...but if you are not a culture fit.  Good bye.    It is micromanaged by a megalomanic.  And frankly there is not much upside in their product line.  Intel will eventually eat their lunch.highly talented peoplegood managementgood base packageco-workers support is very goodgood work-life balanceCompany always tries to come up with good products and has courage to enter new markets.Nvidia is a great place to work, but it's lacking when it comes to having a conducive environment for younger or start-upy kinds of employees. It's a very classic style of doing business, and many of the middle people (who've been there for less than 10 years) will tell you that you could do worse in many places, but you could also easily do a lot better.Management is pretty hands off, certain ones will micromanage, but in general the structure of power is accessible from the lower rungs. The hardest part of my position was being one of the very few people who represented the target market/audience, and so many of the people making these products wouldn't ever consume them, and that dissonance was aggravating to be around.Learning and Development team at Nvidia is fairly new and still going through growing pains. There is immense potential for great stuff here but the lack of accountability is the crux of the problem. A lot of the times we over promise and under deliver. That doesn't help matters for a young team that is still finding a place of its own. My grouse is that we are still considered a non essential function and pretty much operate like a service organization instead of being strategic!This was my first professional job. I suffered a lot but also learned a lot from my co workers and colleagues! Even though I left that industry but I still miss them!Loved working here.  I probably learned the most about being QA here than anywhere else.  The people are all great and never was left without equipment to test with.",,Palo-Alto,Santa Clara,CA,2016-11-10T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/senior-data-scientist-job-santa-clara-ca-us-175759969.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
1,1405.0,"Data Scientist, Internet Services Team",Apple Inc.,4.3,2700.0,"As a specialist, your duty is to help customers. Whether that is purchasing Apple merchandise or helping them trouble shoot. I learned more about communicating with customers. How to figure out more than one solution to one problem and to always keep the customers interests ahead of mine. Hardest part of my job was dealing with tasks that I was in no way required to do. Some customers would come in with issues that you had to resolve despite it not being an Apple app problem or software malfunction. But keeping Apple loyalty among customers is very important, so it had to be done. Enjoyable part of my job was helping people. As well as interacting with customers. I was able to learn new tasks and solutions every day. My coworkers were more than willing to lend a hand if needed and were so diverse in their education, backgrounds and fields of expertise that they had so much to offer myself as well the customers.Work/Life balance is horrible if you're in a shift job that changes hours and days every 14 weeks and you have kids. Management wants to cheerlead you through the long hours, poor raises and sudden shifts in job requirements with copious swag and beer parties you can't even attend if you're on shift anyway (or you'll be on the phone buzzed, which isn't allowed). If you're willing to still through those for the health and retirement benefits then this is the place for you. Otherwise, look elsewhere. It's so competitive here, people trying to get ahead will not hesitate to throw you under the bus and climb over.Typical day of my work is to schedule multiple interview while also monitoring day to day schedules (up to 4 - 5 a day). I also send out offer letters and on-board new candidates. I learned how to juggle all these things at once and how to handle work/life balance. Working at Apple as taught me how to use Mac software as well. Management is great! They always made sure to communicate and never point a finger. Just get the problem fixed if it ever raised. My workers are really dependable. Everyone wanted to help and so did I. Hardest part of my could be the last min updates to interview schedules but that was usually day to day so it did not become a problem. The most enjoyable part if when I get to on-board new candidates that I scheduled. It can be so rewarding to know that all your hard work was a life changing to someone.The company treats you like family and not just a number or an employee. You are welcomed with open arms into the Apple Culture and you find yourself speaking and acting the Apple way even though you may not even be present at work. Level of expectations are extremely high and you find yourself doing the same in your personal life. You learn that ""good enough"" doesn't fly but rather that perfection is expected of you & you find everyone else striving on a daily basis to meet that level of expectation. There is job security! Its hard to advance internally but to advance externally is easier.Apple as a company is a great company to work for. They train and give competitive wages. The benefits are a real positive that the company offers. A typical day at work can be very stressful and physically demanding.I learned teamwork, technical skills and staff development. Co-workers were my favorite part of the job, however management left a little to be desired. The hardest part of the Job is the customers that demanded more than what we can give. The most enjoyable would be the repairing computers.The best part of working at Apple was helping customers who appreciated your knowledge and expertise. However, management and getting promoted could be very political. Employees were given opportunities to mentor continuing and incoming hires, as well as start programs that contribute to internal culture. While at Apple, I started Old Orchard Magazine, a publication designed to get all the store's news to the entire team, while including light-hearted, health-related content about flu shots and yoga poses.I've had a great time at Apple, I started as a lowly phone agent in 2007, but in 9 years have increased my salary by 4 times and am doing jobs I never thought in 2007 I'd be doing now. Management is great, (keep in mind there are 10k people in this campus, and I've mainly worked in the operations side of things without a degree) albeit times the culture seems to be shifting from the bottom up worship of the past to a top-down middle manager methodology.(Contract position)A typical day of work consists of 75% of the day spent at your cubical on a laptop with a large monitor, 12.5% of mandatory break time (two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch break), and 12.5% of group discussions and team meetings. Management at times seems to lack interpersonal skills and asking questions is always a tricky situation to navigate. The team is encouraged to ask questions to maintain consistency on projects, but ask the wrong question and you risk being ridiculed by management. Team members are often compared to one another to create a competitive work environment. Favoritism by management is a large problem the team faces, and payment is not always on time or accurate.Best call center helpdesk to work in hands down - training is extensive, couching and follow-up is constant, only hurdle is politics with management that will affect promotions and new positions.Overall, working for the Apple Store is an amazing opportunity. Their entry level pay is higher than most places, and you get plenty of benefits, even if you're part time. You just need to be willing to handle an extremely fast paced environment with a constant flow of customer traffic. Your skills with customer focus, product knowledge, and learning on the fly play a huge part in being a specialist for Apple.Most of the coworkers are friendly and willing to help, but unfortunately, the management uses personal favoritism in order to determine who gets to grow within the company.This is blessing and a curse, as it gives the person with little previous experience the chance to gain top notch management experience. With so many unqualified managers running around though, it turns into a culture that fosters favoritism, and promotes based on networking, rather than actual job experience and talent.I loved this job at first, but my vision was clouded by the glam of working for the company. Once the koolaid wears off, you find yourself surrounded by a bunch of zealots who would throw you under a bus in a moment's notice to get that next promotion. Be careful who you trust at this company, be very careful.Also, I had 10 different managers in 9 months. I only switched teams twice. They are constantly moving managers around, building cold and lifeless manager/employee relationships that are vaguely based on personality, and largely based on metrics.By all means, get your job experience, but get out before it sucks the soul out of you. The mangers ruin this job.Working for Apple was one of my best job experiences. The only downside was that once I was determined to be a ""rock star"" in sales, it was almost impossible for me to move into a different position within the store. I was only able to recieve my technician liscense after having surgery, and not being able to be on the sales floor, which allowed me time to study and pass the test. Even then, I was only allowed behind the genuis bar when they were shorthanded.Good Job Work/Life BalanceGood Compensation/BenefitsGood Job Security/AdvancementGood ManagementGood Job CultureOverall Good experience at Apple.It's a fun place to work. Very progressive and inclusive culture. Top notch benefits. Have met some great people. Processes are always changing. Would like to see more stability on schedule.This is a great place to work! The team culture is awesome and great and the benefits are off the chart! The option to work from home and the company advancement are great!Apple was great to work for, don't get me wrong but they were stingy when it came to raises and there was not a lot of chances for a home based agent to move up.  Probably because well, you are home based and many of the job openings are not.  The benefits are excellent; if I remember it correctly you had health benefits on day one (no waiting period.) which of course if very rare.  Another very silly and vain perk was just the fact that you are working for Apple!  When people would ask who you worked for and I would say Apple you could see the admiration on their faces (and working from home for them just added to their jealousy!)  All in all it was an awesome experience and one that I really wouldn't hesitate to recommend to someone else.From your first to your last day with Apple, expect to be pushed to your limits in your knowledge and ability in several ways. Your team and your fellow coworkers are great at supporting you and keeping the environment cheerful and positive. Plenty of opportunities to grow as an AppleCare representative and in administrative positions. That in mind, you will need to be more than proactive in reaching out to additional hiring managers if you want to be anything but AppleCare.This company has changed drastically over the last few years. As it has grown quickly, the work environment has become much more corporate. There is a large influx of former Dell management that have joined the team and the work environment is more like Dell (all of the bad stories you have heard over the years). Employees are now seen as disposable.Worked in a highly engaged, valued customer service position. Enjoyed learning about Apple Technology and programs and worked with like-minded individuals.Management was varied but driven and provided good support on job roles and information. The co-worker environment was minimal since the position was work from home, and allowed personal relationships to build when wanted.The hardest part of the job was having to let it go. If the option was or is available to me I would absolutely work for them again.The most enjoyable part was the problem solving. Being able to resolve and determine technical issues.Have to love this company. It is a test of your intelligence, Technical aptitude and definitely people skills. If your looking for a feel good job that tests your limits this is the place. The people that you work with are great! They will become your second family. Benefits are second to none. And corporate knows exactly what they are doing and always have something in place to transition into whatever it is they are doing.My overall experience at apple has been excellent, however most my my negative experiences such as bad management, over micromanagement, and poor benefits apply to the contracting company Apex Systems.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,Cupertino,CA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/data-scientist-internet-services-team-job-cupertino-ca-us-176041343.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

They use to walk the talk of the culture and importance of community.  They used to treat their employees like valuable team members.  Now, it has turned into a burn them and churn them, no matter how much a person has contributed to the success of the organization.Management changes every few years and the culture changes to reflect the beliefs and management practices of the current establishment.My position required leadership skills to direct the work force towards company goals. This included on time deliveries, customer interaction, and diplomacy. Other responsibilities included training of workers, both salary and hourly, and safety. It was a pleasure to work with, on the most part, professional people in their fields of expertise. This created a high expectation that the team would achieve daily and long range goals. I earned the respect from all levels of management.1. Bosch expect you to grow automatically, the training/follow-up feed back is severely insufficient.2. Bosch encourage you to work over time: it is not on the rule, but the task assigned to you definitely make you work over 50, even 60 hours per week, on an average Engineer;  3. Highly bureaucratic management.4. Lack humanistic care: my colleague's wife is during pregnancy at her 9th month, the company still assign him to German for 8 weeks! He miss the most important moment in his life! Similar things happened very often.5. HR is not nice to you, especially if you are a not US citizen: your green-card sponsorship, H-1 B are reluctant approve with delay.Relatively good compensation; Good to be a manager in BoschBosch is a non-profit organization, which means it's not publically traded and there are no share holders. It's a very diverse company, as well as the largest automotive supplier in the world.Bosch treats its employees well and there are many opportunities, especially for those with 4yr degrees.Wonderful experience while working for Bosch in Broadview, Illinois.  Excellent Leadership and ample opportunity for career movement.  Technical and operations training is world class.  The benefits at Bosch AANA, are great especially when compared to what other companies are currently offering.  The only reason I left is Bosch moved their distribution to Atlanta Georgia.Well structured company to work for. Great benefits. Great pay and fun people to work with. Management was awesome. Was respective very well. Made a lot of friends.Management not transparent to employees but decent work culture and good opportunity to learn.Decent compensation and very good work-life balance. Limited growth opportunities for employees.Don't recommend, they don't care about the employees only the profits and quantity of parts put out, long hours 7 day work week,lots of employee turnover* Fast paced and results driven environment* I Learned that you will never achieve true confidence or success without stepping out of your comfort zone.* I Worked with some of the most talented managers with strong engineering back rounds that were committed to success. They were always approachable and willing to share their knowledge.* My co-workers and I worked as one. We worked as a team and addressed problems in the same manner.* The hardest part of the job was learning how to get all supportive groups of inter-connected processes to work together and consistently live up to their end of the task.* The most enjoyable part of the job was making commitments to our customer and being able to deliver on those commitments.Good benefits and opportunities for advancement. Moving to a centralized theme wherever possible to provide consistency to employees.Good benefitsGood work environmentterrible communications between departments.little advancement possibilitiesA lot of escaltion/task forcethe majority of employees are waiting to retire and do not care about being productive. management seems to encourage this behavior. it's a wonder things get done.Management leadership skills are lacking. Its more of a dictatorship. You are treated like a number and not a person with a life and family outside of Bosch. The hardest part of the job is the mandatory weekends. Some months we can work of 21 straight days. The most enjoyable part of the job is the pay. Advancement is on a ""who you know not what you know' basis.I have learned a lot from this position regarding strategic planning of the product line, communication with different management levels inside and outside of organization and also i have learned that i am not a 100% office person. I like to travel outside the office, meat people and get challenged by their needs.So it's hard to get a real feel for the company culture/environment.  I work in a Ford facility which is much older and has an older work culture, however while on site at Bosch facilities my experiences were much better. They have to distance themselves from the customer, Ford, even if they're in the same building.A typical day at work for me was extremely rewarding. This was a 7 day operation that required a lot of team work. What I learned from here was my knowledge of heat treat and the importance of team work. The management staff that I worked with was top notch. Most of my coworkers were also top notch. The was really nothing hard about this job but hearing the news we were closing. The great working relationships that you build!!Typical day is mostly desk environment but it greatly depends on the product line one works in.   Being a large company many responsibilities are compartmentalized, however a position where interaction with multiple disciplines was most rewarding because it allows you to become a generalist.  At the same time, you could also become an expert in a specific component, so it's easy to find that this company provides opportunities across the board to fit the breadth of knowledge you're hoping to gain in a product/system.The typical day of work at Bosch starts early and ends late, but it's an enjoyable work environment with good people. I learned how to work hard for room and board, how to make lifelong friends and how to enjoy a salad buffet. Management was effective, and coworkers worked together fluidly. The hardest part was leaving. The most enjoyable parts were learning how to do my tasks more proficiently.( A typical day at work ) my crew and I reaching our daily quota          ( what I learn )  troubleshoot , calibrating , testing , rework                  ( management ) respectful and supportive ( co-workers ) , respectful and willing to lend a hand ,( hardest part of the job )  when machines would malfunction , ( most enjoyable part of job )  leading my guys helping and teaching as much as possibleTreated badly an terrible job security. They followed me to the bathroom an talked down to workers. i will never work there ever again an do not recommend it to anyone.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,"Palo Alto, CA",CA,2016-11-29T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/statistician-job-palo-alto-ca-ca-us-176850010.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The fact that you have to start as a temp instead of direct hire is kind of a negative due to the pay as a temp. You cannot live on $11/hr.  But if hired perm, the pay is well above average.I learned a lot about different parts. I liked my managers. I got along well with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was when our contract ended. I enjoyed going to work everyday to learn more, and meet new people.Don't recommend, they don't care about the employees only the profits and quantity of parts put out, long hours 7 day work week,lots of employee turnoverDidnt do too much but stacked tools onto a pallet. There was nothing much more to learn. The supervisors were good people and they always checked on you to make sure you was ok.I have learned a lot from this position regarding strategic planning of the product line, communication with different management levels inside and outside of organization and also i have learned that i am not a 100% office person. I like to travel outside the office, meat people and get challenged by their needs.good memories.German culture is great.willing to work in any where in Bosch ltd.Good food and increment is also good.Want to work in Germany and other parts of the world and  i want learn more quality about Bosch products.I did not enjoy working here. The salary was no where near enough to do everything they expect you to do. I was doing work a manager should've been doing.Very productive. I learned  the difference parts of the fuel injectors. Also there are different types of injection. Working for Bosch has been and experience for me because I have learned so many things about the fuel injections.Treated badly an terrible job security. They followed me to the bathroom an talked down to workers. i will never work there ever again an do not recommend it to anyone.great place to work would recommend to other people managment was great took time and cared about employees worked thirds","10,000+",Palo-Alto,Palo Alto,CA,2016-12-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/7731744b-3f8b-4299-9f27-f8b719df54b8?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

28,1432.0,"Principal Scientist, Protein Science",Boehringer Ingelheim,4.1,309.0,"Productive and challenging; flexible work environment due to new workplace of the future and reducing the carbon footprint. Unstable work environment at the moment due to restructuring within the company.Boehringer Ingelheim, Value through innovation. A German Pharmaceutical Company, that in my experience, takes care of their employees.With the advancement system, there is a change to meet personal goals, with regular talks called Mitarbeitergespräch (talks with the employee). The hardest part of the job, is time management and prioritize the budget spendings. But overall, is a very satisfying job, with an amazing working environment as well as co-workes.Although I do not currently work there now I did love the culture, management and the scientists. Had I became a permanent employee ( I was a student temp) the benefits package would have been wonderful along with the pay. But i was fool and moved back to my home town after school. Everything that keeps an employee happy is what is offered at this company. Excellent leadership in management, harmonious staff of employees which only led to a great work environment of diverse group of people of differing ethnicities and backgrounds.My role with BI is diverse and broad. It is a clinical sell with scientific support, it addresses the changing landscape of healthcare. Educating not only in early recognition and its importance but in the benefits of earlier treatment and prevention of admissions and readmissions into hospitals. Providing pharmaceutical treatment options through guideline emphasis and education. It speaks to the increasing number of ACO's and PCMH's and the challenges that they have in meeting specific quality metrics and measures to optimize the triple aim goal.BI has done a great job at launching a large number of products over the last few years.  Unfortunately most of those launches have not produced in terms of sales.  As such, the company is going through a major re-organization, where the long-term-plan is not well communicated and people are being quietly laid off.  There is a strong German family culture at BI, where things are done the ""BI-way"".  If you want to read, eat, sleep, and live SOPs, then this is the place for you.  If you have creative, new ways to do things, that will not be embraced and you're better off elsewhere.  There are too many people who have been there too long to do anything new.  There is little room for growth, and the office politics are the worst I have ever seen in 20+ years.Finally, the company does not do a good job of understanding the US market.Own your business! A strong work ethic, along with good organizational and analytical skills, will boost chances for success. Phenomenal co-workers in the field and insightful and supportive management allow for enjoyable, self-direcred work days. Customers are appreciative but increasingly harder to see.A good place to work.  Going trough some changes.Future in question.Fair compensationMinimal chance for promotion.good productsBoehringer Ingelheim was an excellent company to work for.  Beautiful grounds, excellent pay scale and was always welcome to learn new tasks.  I learned event planning throughout the life cycle, portal website entries, and much more.  The company is very structured, but appreciates their employees.Job security is and has been a great thing with this company.  I have learned a great deal with this campany.  But as I further my education with the goal of bettering myself and my families life, I feel I am ready for something more challenging.Sales, Field Training, KOL development, POA development, co marketing, mentoring reps, great work environment, good benefits, hard working teamsroom for growth through development planning and implementationGreat culture where very smart people working together.  Many good challenges. Opportunity for growth limited given significant business challenges over next few years.  Not very strong pipeline...some around Biosimilars; doesn't compare to other pharma companies.Constantly restructuring, cutting, laying off.  If you're good at what you do, less chance of that but still possible.I worked for them as a temp for about 8 or 9 months then was hired in as a fulltime employ. I really enjoyed working for them and would very much like to work there again.Very good company to work for.  Privately held and based out of Germany.  Has won many innovation awards.  Company offer very good benefits.German owned company by German family.  They do value the employee and provide great work/life balance.  Unfortunately this does not drive success in business.  Management is held hostage to Germany demands which would be fine except business in America differs from Germany and one size does not fit all.  This disconnect is driving poor performance.This is a wonderful place to work. BI offers great pay and benefits. It's a growing company that is all over the world and offers employees growth potential.Typically would see 8-10 primary/specialty physicians daily. Review their provider data. Learned how to not only sell to providers, but pharmacists as well.  Became a field trainer to aid in the education of new/establish representatives.  Hardest part of this job is it is difficult to break past the glass ceiling.  The people that are currently apart of the company are lovely.The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and working with people from all different management levels as well as globally.The typical day at work was very fast paced with constant changes in priorities from immediate management. Some of this dictated by manufacturing requirements and some dictated by marketing demands.B.I. is a wonderful place to work with very supportive management. They offer many opportunities for advancement and are actively seeking new employees to add to the team.Great company to work to. Top of the line pharmaceutical products. Travel requires at least 3 times a year. Great benefits.I most appreciate the opportunity to create and innovate concepts and tools that meet business needs (vs being given something from a center of excellence to implement). Undergoing transformation- need even more people with business acumen, agility and ability to influence and get things done despite obstacles - together we will continue to evolve the human pharmaceuticals business model.BI takes care of its great employees. I have worked with many managers and all have advanced my career and helped me improve my value.

70,1474.0,Staff Data Scientist,Tesla Motors,3.6,320.0,"Great Company to work for. They take good care of their employees. Everyday seems to go buy very fast, it's a fast paced work place. Many of people enjoy the atmosphere.First off , it is not Tesla Motors, It's Tesla Electric : Tesla Electric is a very young company in Sulphur , La. which has had it's growing pains but is coming into it's own. The work place is very friendly , yet professional, one of teaching and learning while putting out very high quality work in the residential and commercial electrical arena. I would reccomend Tesla to anyone wanting a high quality electrical finished product. Tesla Electric performs much bigger than it is.Geat place to work, the people are very experienced there talents. Helps you grow into a better, more reliable person. The hardest part is being there for 12 hrs and only get a 15 minute break but you get used to it. The work was very easy when you leaned it. The pack line was the easiest to work. The assembly line was tough but when you do it a lot it comes easier.great place to workgood managementsatisfactiongood learning experinancegood team supportplace to implement ideasgood cafateria n nice food n recreationGreat place to work !!!!!!!!!You can to learning and enjoy your job every day .My managers do excelent job too.The benefits is good .Working for Tesla was an opportunity of a life time and I miss it every day. It was awesome being part of something great to help improve our environment. However I was promised a lot when i took the job, but Tesla's management never followed through with there word. I also was injured off the job and Tesla would not modify my position temporarily until I healed and was just let go.The best work ethics I have ever seen. Most people would push for getting things done and are not very political. Work-life balance is poor (in Body in White at least), management would push for quick return but undermine sustainability of employees. Burned out employees will only stay for a year or two max. Great learning opportunity for employees, but because of the non-sustainable attitude, most employees would not last long.Tesla is a fast change place, and we are improving all the timeChallenges are huge all the timeGreen companyHi Tech CompanyGreat opportunity learning variety of skills. working here was a great experience and you get to meet different people everyday and the majority of people are all very nice, although you gain many skills and definitely have good income working there, if you want a job as well as a social life and be able to have time for outside of work activities or such especially if you are not a local to the area this would not be able to mix well together since the majority of people working here are required to work a maximum of 70 hours a week, about 12 hours a day.Highly Demanding and well respected job with little compensation and benefits. Tesla had so many great employees that were simply chased away due to Tesla's negligence.Great place to work with a nice balance of work and home. I worked four twelve hour shifts with three days off a week. Starting pay was $17.00 an hour with a raise every six months of about a dollar. However you are on your feet for just about your whole shift and some of the management can be hard to work with at times, but definitely a great job to be at.Regular 8 hour shifts with optional overtime. Management not the brightest but also not the worst. Overall you are given the tasks and are expected to complete them before the days end.The only issue is the amount of hours required to work there. There is no way to balance the work life and your personal life.I learned many valuable skills about working in a production environment by spending three years at the Tesla factory. The most enjoyable part of working there was being part of a growing company, and having a chance to see some cutting edge technology.Tesla is fast paced and dynamic.  Everyone is driven by the Mission which makes the work day easier to focus on the overall goal.  Brilliant people working towards a better future.Its a very good place to work , very good benefits  and pay. The only down side is that they have really long hours and hardly higher girls. My experience here was incrediblethe most enjoyable part was the staff. a typical work day consist of maning your post and placing parts on cars specific to the manifest instructions.Tesla Motors is by far the best place to work. Not only are you working for very luxurious vehicle company but also very technologically advance. Working for Tesla was very rewarding.Tesla is a exacly place start your carrier off pays very well and lots of overtime. If you do have alot time on your hands i recommend tesla motors for youThe management was a bit lazy and unorganized but the people that worked there were very kind. There are a lot of people who took the work for granted and gave up on the quality of work.Great company to work for, every day is a new experience, Co-workers are the best. The Hardest part of the job is you never know what is next for you.","1,001 to 5,000",Palo-Alto,Palo Alto,CA,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/fe91d2a9-5160-4178-9df4-e7308fed187f?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

75,1479.0,Senior Principal Data Scientist,Symantec Corporation,3.8,445.0,"good place. it was fun, good people. anymore than that, we can discuss in person.I am currently employed at Symantec.  They have acquired Blue Coat and most recently Life Lock.   I enjoy the people and time at Symantec.    Their is an onsite cafeteria serving gourmet/healthy food.All of the pro's and con's of high tech, but better than most.  Company has undergone a lot of change in past few years.  Expect more, given state of industry.Had great camaraderie with coworkers and people reporting to me.  We pushed each other to try the impossible, to ask the ""what if..."" questions, to expand our knowledge.Working with Symantec was a great experience. The team environment was very supportive and encouraging. I had the best years of my career at Symantec.Symantec has been great with accommodations that I needed.What I learned during my 20 years:- Security practices- Tracking suspicious computer/network behaviors- Watching for individual/personal behaviors to watch out for abuse of network/corporate resources.- Backup & Server availability.great place to work for unfortunately my department was outsourced to Pune India,The people or coworkers were all team players and always helped out  to get the job done.benefits all were goood ones.Too many chiefs in this place and they all have their own agendas. The minions are great and a lot work towards growth which a lot of their bosses support which is a great thing but a lot also prevent this from happening.I learned I don't like sales. But the inside sales organization was fun. The people are mostly fun. They tend to change the pay structure a little too much.Great company really learned a lot working in a team collaboration was wonderful experience if i get chance work again Good place to learning new technologies	Information Technology analyst with over 7+ years of experience implementing, configuring, analyzing, customizing, maintaining and administering ERP software systems.While my experience at Symantec was overall positive, some of the management will throw you to the wolves to produce good numbers while ignoring your skills.  Workers are viewed--beyond what is acceptable--as expendable.  Training is minimal.  No effort is made to mine your talents.That aside, the camaraderie is collaborative, and the culture allows one to add significantly to one's skillset.It is a good company to work for, very amazing experience. I enjoyed my work experience in here with my collegues. Enjoyed most of my workSymantec currently rates very low job security wise. The Symantec -Veritas split and acquisition of Blue Coat have made things volatile and chaoticThe management themselves are confused about what's happening and this does have a baneful impact on the employees. The chaos has holistically impacted the full timers and contractors and many are being laid offGood Company, undergoing transformation. Good times ahead with new acquisitions and investment partners joining in.Chilled out work culture with good work / life balance.Compensation is not great though.Not highly recommended for career enhancement.If you are not working for the latest company that they have acquired, watch your back.  Your job is headed to the cheapest place they can outsource it to.Veritas was purchased by Symantec. The majority of my employment was during the Veritas years. There was plenty of opportunity for overtime. As a matter of fact, it was required. I learned much during my employment here.Now that the Symantec/Veritas experiment is over, it will be interesting to see if the stand alone Veritas can return to former greatness.  Will need to adapt better to the cloud.Great place to work.  It is unfortunate that the Veritas Springfield site was chosen for a shut down after the split from Symantec.  I loved my job and the people I worked with.The company was great to work for.  They were extremely flexible with work from home options. They took great care of their employees.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,Mountain View,CA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/9779b64a-2eff-4e00-9495-7c19b66a126d?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Management and co workers are all so friendly and there are very strong core values that allow you to advance and learn from your weaknesses to better yourself as an employee.Intuit has good work culture and an egaged employee force. It is trying to become fast paced and more technology focused. There is focus on developing the products the right way.I drove one of the largest programs at Intuit over a year that I was a consultant there. I had a chance to work with really smart people. The downside of working atIntuit was that the management system over there is very inefficient. A lot of time wasted in meeting rooms and directors really don't know wich direction to move forward.A typical day at work will include helping customers place their orders for their small businesses. Working at Intuit is a very rewarding career.Great company to work for, benefits are great when you are a full time agent. Even seasonal's were treated with the same respect. The management was not the best within training, and you were led on about advancement opportunities. Training was not enough for the type of job you were doing But overall the company is great and so are the managers, just needs to learn to manage time better and to be more direct with advancement opportunities instead of lying just to keep people on board,Great job, Great co-workers, Great Management. This is by far my favorite job. There is honestly no complaints I have about this company or my day to day work task.","5,001 to 10,000",Palo-Alto,Mountain View,CA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/3c9361f3-3378-4068-aff0-0a392f78704f?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The company and culture is one of the best I have ever worked at.  No only does your direct team have the ability to work with each other to work on a requirement, team members from other divisions are also willing if called upon.  I love the social part of Intuit. They have a few company parties throughout the year that really gets teams mingling.  The CEO and others are visible and talk with everyone.  It's like I said, unlike any other company I have worked with!Intuit is great work place and very good culture.They build great products and good work life balance.Compensation is very competitive as well.Not very much political Red tape.Intuit has good work culture and an egaged employee force. It is trying to become fast paced and more technology focused. There is focus on developing the products the right way.Most incompetent team members got a promotion this year. The smart, hard working ones leave regularly. Top-bottom culture, where managers like to micromanage and engineers obey the hierarchy more than anything.Intuit was a great place to work. However things re very slow and management is poor. Too many middle managers with constant change seem to distort company objectives and goals. Not so concerned about employees as they portray themselves to be. Benefits are great! Some of the best that I have ever had. It seems like people who work there enjoy it and want to work there. I wish there was more of a unique and distinct culture that would set it apart in a better way - a livelier way.It's a great place to work. It's a good fit for me and the skill sets I have.  The culture/environment of this company is a good one. I  have learned much while working here, and have applied myself and taken the initiative to improve processes, efficiency and accuracy of what we do by developing QuickBase apps for inventory management of the Data Centers, creating Data Center and Rack Planning Diagrams, Temperature Maps and various other advanced spreadsheet/graph reports for the company.  I've installed UCS/bare metal, Hadoop, NetApp and EMC systems, etc.  Besides server installs & decomms I acquired more experience in the Facilities side with PDU""s, CRACs, Cooling Towers, Sensaphone Alerts, Leak Detection, Alarm systems, etc.I've provided information and documentation for the auditors in regards to asset management, drive erase compliance, e-waste, etc. And I've got to work with Sys Engineers, Networking, DevOps and Hosting Operations staff along the way.  The only reason I'm seeking new opportunities is because I am a contractor here with no benefits.7 year employee, moved out of state, would still be there if I could! Awesome benefits & high base $$ plus commission, great people, in depth training, good support from trainers & supervisors.Management ignores many things that occur. Supervisors lack knowledge and only promote friends. Knowledge is ignored. Managers ignore employees that want to expand their knowledge for the benefit of the company.benefits and people mak ethe job such a good place to work as well as managements willingness to help you succeed at your goalsGood new college graduate job, good people, and decent work life balance.  Management enjoyment is dependent on your manager like any other roleGreat place for retirement. Stay away if you* want to grow (develop) your career* enjoy fast paced and competitive environment* are a team player* want to make a difference* believe in changeIntuit was a wonderful place to work. Everyone was very supportive and encouraging. Management always pushed everyone to do their best to give employees their best shot advancing.Intuit allows the employees to be paid for doing charity work as well. Many opportunities to do individual and group.A typical day included working with many customers with their payroll and any related questions or issues. Helping others and others helping you when needed. A great conferring of knowledge.When the location where I worked closed Intuit was very helpful with job assistance and making sure the transition was easy as it could be.Truly a work hard and play hard place to work. The employees were energized and goal oriented. It was not just get the job done, but get it down right.I wish I still worked there, great culture, very smart and professional people, great compensation and benefits. Publicly traded and locations nation-wideThere were good benefits and a good salary. But when Intuit acquired Demandforce, there was micromanagement. Overall, I would recommend the company to somebody else.Typical day at work, answer phones. Some calls last several hours. While I did learn a lot independently, the management support was taken away after restructure, and I was told I asked too many questions. The coworkers are nice, and probably the best part of the job. The hardest part of this job is the expectation to be perfect, outgoing at all times, and to maintain good scores when there is not enough support to satisfy the client. The most enjoyable part is definitely your coworkers.Call center location with multiple business units allows flexibility to move around and work on different projects.

81,1485.0,Data Scientist,BNY MELLON,3.6,1600.0,"great company with great benefits. Definitely recommended. It typical day of work depends on the department you work for.Overall one of if not the best job I have ever worked for the pay rate just doesn't meet my family responsibilities. The hours are great the benefits are good as far as life insurance and vacation days and 401K but the medical and dental deductible is outrageous it doesn't meet the single family requirement. You have to work another job just to pay off deductible and copayment for medical and dental visits.The job itself is fine. It can have days where it's challenging but mostly repetitive. Most difficult aspect is working with other internal teams, especially those outsourced to India who do not understand questions being asked or speak English very well. Advancing your career can be very difficult. Most do not receive promotions for hard work. Instead, you have to move departments or try and get an offer outside the company and hope to be offered a promotion to stay. Raises are terrible and I've been on what they call the 'exceeds expections' category most years (highest review for merit increases). Expect no more than 1-2.5% raise/year. The company is so focused on cutting expenses they have outsourced so many jobs and make cuts a few times/year. They also do not replace positions when someone leaves, unless it's an absolute necessity, so many teams are left very short staffed and therefore overworked.Working at this place for 10 years and have to say it has changed in so many negative ways.1.) Management has poor communication with the people under them or at the same level. 2.) The raises decreased immensely and health benefit cost are now higher.3.) They continue on letting go of hard workers while keeping poor workers to remain in the company.4.) New trainees come on the floor and are here no more than 6 -12 months because the pay and management is so bad and upper management doesn't recognize that so many workers on floor are unhappy and stressed due to lack of help and lack of management communication.This job is ok for High School graduates or college graduates to get their foot in the door in the career world, but definitely not a good long term career place.The Asset Management Operations team of executives does not value or attempt to retain existing workers.  Payroll kept low by hiring new workers directly from college.  Once they are trained and working well, they face limited chances of advancement or salary increases.  Morale remains low, as workers realize their productivity will not be matched by recognition or compensation.  The teams do support each other, for they wish to retain their job until they can move on.  Established professionals hired from outside are given take it or leave it offers.Fast-paced enhancing my agility and bringing to the surface skills I was unaware I possessed.  I did not enter the organization playing the Acoustic Guitar, Keyboard and Producing Music.  My gifts and latent talents were brought out and developed during my employment.  I've done Administrative Assistant work for over 20 years in various industries and I believe it's time to use my natural gifts and talents and work in an industry where I can be of service to Humanity.This firm afforded me the opportunity to fully utilize my financial degree which made me the well-rounded professional I am today.  I gained analytical experience, managerial experience, client management experience, and both internal and external compliance/regulatory experience.Chicago site management and supervision is the worst very unprofessional and care nothing about the employees. Everything is based on company need regardless of the employees situation they may be having with other life responsibilities other then the job. The rules are very unfair also. Chicago site also is very diverse but the management isn't specially with the African Americans.A steady busy day to day work load.  Resolving issues. Mentoring and is a subject expert matter to co-workers.Over the years I've learned the investment's ins and outs, financial tools and vendors systems, writing SQL statements to pull data from the database, Eagle STAR and PACE system. Hardest part of the job was the lack of job security due to lay-offs over the recent years.Most enjoyable part of every day is knowing I can help resolve issues for our clients,  Guiding and answering questions my teammates have.  Fortunate to have friendly coworkers and report to a flexible manager.Mediocre company with poor benefits, advancement, salary and leadership.There seems to be a lack of vision and forward thinking. Most initiatives are either knee-jerk or reactionary. Much too much time spent on putting out fires and addressing regulatory issues.The asset management operations team of executives does not retain existing workers. Instead, hires new workers directly from college. Once they are trained and working well, they face limited chances of advancement or salary increases. The best part of the job is getting to know our internal and external customers.Not much room for advancement. Pay is not competitive.Raises are next to nothing, if you're lucky to get anything. You have to be thankful they give you anything.I was fortunate to work on a team that allowed to work from home sometimes, so I didn't have to go to that hole (Brooklyn) that often; a lot of people aren't so lucky.BNY Mellon is a great company to work for.  Everyone is usually friendly and easy to work with.  The management can award you for your efforts however can be easily overmissed. Low compensation compared to other companies in the industry in the area.This company is very political.  If the managers like you then you have a shot.  I worked there for almost fifteen years and as let go because I made a mistake.  They are in a lay off status and will get rid of you any way they can.  They do not look out for the employees but only for the company.  The pay is low for the work being done.  The benefits suck.Nice company but when it comes to advancement at times it is not all what it seems. Work force has become more of do with less associates, but have more work. Expectations take over a normal working day.Typically we have the daily schedule and work routines, everyone are assigned to certain clients/funds unless someone else is out for work. We are managing/processing the funds for our client and providing any services upon for requests. overall the company and the team are good but just the manager managing skills need to improve.BNY Mellon can provide you with a steady, challenging lifetime career in a modern, clean, friendly work environment.  The company strives to provide their employees with competitive salary and benefits.BNY Mellon is a very large company with plenty of different opportunities. For that reason, I believe it is a great place to start with directly out of college. There is a high degree of lateral moblity, however, this is not the case as far as upwards mobility is concerned,I worked here many years and my experience throughout the bank has been nothing short of  great.  I've met a lot of people in my time at the bank and have remained friends.Low compensation, no job security and hard to advance.  You can work hard but little recognition only good thing is coworkersEmployees are not paid enough. They go above and beyond and their work is usually met with just praise and not enough monetary rewards. This provides a lack if incentive.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,Palo Alto,CA,2016-11-06T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/245aaa2b-ba67-447b-842b-ee704d3d762a?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=13,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I wouldn't recommend for anyone that is not used to being in a fast paced setting. Overall, it was a great assignment job.Typical day was a 10 to 12 hour shift with 3 to 4 overtime for every other day. I maintained 400 production tools process flows and adjustments for the majority of the time. The rest of the time would be dedicated to meetings and management of passdown logs. I learned a lot from samsung. Physics, quantum mechanics, chemical engineering and so much more. It was the job I loved just because of the amount of things to do and learn. The culture was very segregated engineers and techs would be separate from production and house services that caused a lot of political infighting but things got done. Most of the management had a very high attrition rate and was replaced often. Mostly due to the lack of advancement. The pay raises were there but there was no upward movement in the company. The hardest part of the job was the balance of the information and its application to the production. You had to be able to see things down to the submolecular level to figure out how you needed to fix any given situation while trying to figure out how it would affect the rest of the production line as a whole. The best part was when you figured it out. That realization when you can hold your own with some of the brightest minds in the world when it comes to something you can't even see.I did a few months work at the San Jose Campus location prior to its rebuild. The management is great in the Sales department as they take care of their employees and contractors equally when I was there.I love to work in Samsung and i like to grow very fast but some conditions is preventing to achieve to my goal.

The work environment was intense and stressfulI love what I do when I work for Samsung but trying to move up in the company takes a really long time. There are no benefits for part timers and everything is focused on full timers.

Would like to understand some of their policies better, not every inderstandableManagement and coworkers were fun to work with, and all materials were provided.

Great benefits and compensation but those things are changing. Every location is differentFriendly, cheerful, but rather rude when getting to know a new client.  Lots of turnover in employees.  Mediocre management, some training.Great financial experience. The position helps an individual learn all things banking, report development and financial. There is always room for growth for those looking for it.We work hard and help the community, that is what Umpqua Bank is all about. From handing out Ice Cream at our local schools to painting a woman shelter, Umpqua a fully dedicated to it's community and employees.Very fun place to work. Good life work balance. Works with people's life and schedule chanhes. Very competitive pay. Positive people including managers and Co workersEvery job has its down side however, it's important to find the positives for a happy work life. At Umpqua I have found the good, made a few wonderful friends, and been awarded freedom to venture out for personal growthh in the company. This company has a low turnover rate and is on Forbes best companies to work for list (impressove for a bank). Overall, I have been happy with my work life here at Umpqua.More than adequate training, coaching and opportunity to make more money by referrals, shadow credit and overall satisfaction with customers.Over the phone Customer ServiceOn line help and researchBusiness online bankingCommercial Credit card assistanceDebit card and disputes researchUmpqua Bank is a great company to work for. They have a diverse and inclusive work culture with a strong commitment to the people in our communities.Umpqua believe in promoting from within and encourage it's employee to look for new opportunities within the company.I was employed with Umpqua through Elwood Staffing Agency for  four months. A typical work day started with getting a prioritized list of loans that needed Loan Estimates and Closing Disclosures executed that day. I learned how to generate  Loan Estimates and Closing Disclosures for home buyers. Following lending guidelines our duty was to insure loan terms,taxes and general fees are calculated correctly.The management team had daily meetings to insure we followed lending guidelines  to the letter.The daily management support was lacking due to pending layoffs. My Co-workers were very supportive and helpful. The Hardest part of the Job was watching the restructuring of departments and  veterans being laid off while your trying to obtain a permanent position. The best part of the job was completion of the disclosure on time which meant a home had been purchased or a refinance was complete.I really enjoyed this job. I didn't like the banking part. The regulation of banking is not fun, but the job itself, and the company is pretty great. They have a HUGE help desk, so you never feel alone, or uninformed. The turnover is quite high, however; which makes it very hard to focus, and get on trackA wonderful place to work.  Very light and professional atmosphere.  All employees are hard working and happy.  I am very happy to have experienced Umpqua Bank.Umpqua Bank was a nice place to work.   I enjoyed working with the staff. I did work  from a remote site that made it a little difficult in communicating with processing and the new TRID program.Due to department consolidation the Bank has re-structured it's operations in the Mountlake Terrace area. Otherwise, a great place to work~Great place to work, management welcomed input on how to improve processes and the whole office helped to get the job done.Umpqua bank is a great place to work. I was a contract employee and was always treated as an equal. I had hoped to be a FTE but the budget did not allow it at this time.I loved working at the bank.  This was a great position to interact with many different types of people and situations.  The support staff was amazing and very much a team!  Loved problem solving and helping customers and families make the right decisions for themselves financially.A typical day at work consists of working with several loan officers on loans.  Pipelines can be upwards to 50 loans and closing 2/3 of the pipeline on a monthly basis is expected.Hardest part of the job is trying to get it all done as quickly as possible. Never seems to be enough time in the day.Underwriters and Closing department great to work with.  Everyone has a Team attitude.Management needs some polishing.  Feeling under valued is common amongst the regions processors.Pay and benefits are very competitive.Don't work in the IT group, they don't believe in nor follow the rest of the company culture. However, no matter where you work, it's about who you know. The entire company is about who you know and who likes you. People do mean well and try very hard to help the community as a whole, that is rewarded.This company has a lot of potential; however, it lacks positive leadership and organization to bring it all together.  Office politics, favoritism,  negative reinforcement and poor management tend to overshadow the positive aspects of working at this place.

High energy, focused, and innovative - it was an academic experience in and of itself.I worked as a contract writer for Healthtap.com nearly one year ago, and though I completed their workload prior to their given deadline, they failed to pay me (even with multiple email and phone call reminders) for over three months past the pay-by date. They were highly disorganized and often changed my writing assignments after I completed them, forcing me to go back and re-write entire articles because they changed the topic at the last minute. They took long periods of time before responding to any emails or queries, and lacked communication about assignments and articles.HealthTap is a great place to work if you wish to solve problems that affect people's lives in a way that matters probably more than any other- by taking care of their health.

It was such a blessing to be a part of that community.Great Challenging place to work. Extremely smart people.Fast-paced, creative and high potential company.Lots of opportunities.Relaxed work atmosphere with flexible work hours which is great for students or someone looking for a part time job. Work can at times be tedious requiring extended work hours to meet goals without compensation. Management was receptive to employee concerns, but in terms of actual change it was minimal. The company in itself has a bright future ahead, but this position has limited opportunity to grow as an individual.Pay is not based on how many hours you work but based on how much data/leads you find. Sometimes the area we have to look in is exhausted and we can't find anymore leads. Even if we search for hours to find a couple, we do not get paid for those hours but for the couple we have found.Manager is very strict and believes that Houzz matters more than school even during midterms and finals week.Growing company, still a start up so lots of gray areas within jobs. Sometimes interns are asked to do one off jobs due to the start up nature. Very good company morale however.I am a contractor although the company culture is amazing. They thrive on creativity and listen to every ones suggestions. they provide meals and take care of their team members.Houzz is a fast-paced startup that has built it's culture on the amazing people they continue to hire.  As they continue to grow they have maintained that small family feel while promoting the brand worldwide.Started working at Houzz right after I finished my undergrad and was really excited to work with a developing company and brand. However, it was very tele-marketing centered and felt like my 4 year degree wasn't getting used. In talking to management, there didn't seem to be potential to grow, even if you came in early, stayed late, and tried to take on more responsibility. Some people were amazing to work with, others not so much (a lot of people on power trips).

Great small business concept.The job overall was excellent, The management was nice and down to earth. They treated their employees with respect. When I started there I had zero experience with that type of work. They taught me everything and helped me when I struggled. My co-workers where nice and had a warming welcome daily. They where fun to be around and work was enjoyable. The most enjoyable part was when i delivered the pizza and seen the awesome customers. The day would start off with clocking in and getting the bank money. Grabbing your car top sign to start the day off and prepare to take deliverers. Usually there was dishes so they took priority, Because without dishes there is no movement. Wiping out pans, grading cheese, mopping floors and helping out with make line was nearing the end. At the end of the day we'd take in our signs and give in our money and get our cut from the tips and call it a night.Love to work and be at Slice's.

It was fun to see how everything meshed into a giant enterprise that we tried to keep afloat. I was part of various SWAT teams dispatched to either plug leaks or develop new processes to improve the overall lethargy that develops with any large organization, as it tends to entropy, per natural law. Frequent change and renewal were the keys to continued success.work with advancement but never a pay raise; worked as a family where everyone was able to help each other; hardest part of job when someone expected to get a complete refund for shipments that they received 1-2 years ago; most enjoyable when able to help someone when the computer messed up and to make them extra happy!Awesome job.  Great pay, very fun people to work with. I was an inside account rep, worked closely with our partners in helping our clients solve their technical needs.  Terrible CEO.  Would fly in and promise there is nothing going on and then lay off 20 people for no reason the next day.  Seen it happen many times until it happened to me right before Christmas when i was the TOP ISR in the west coast.

HP/HPE have fantastic work cultures with world class practices around diversity and inclusion, work/life balance, ethics, and career advancement. Work is engaging and challenging.  Employees are rewarded for exemplary performance.  HP/HPE foster highly engaging work environments that foster teaming and productivity.HP is a great place to work.  Management respects individual contributors, and places a high value on employee recognition.  I would recommend HP to anyone as a great place to work.  There is opportunity for training and advancement.  The HP way is still alive an well with many managers, which means work life balance and flexible work schedules.Working at HP/HPE has provided me the opportunity to expand my knowledge and skills and adapt them to different environments and scenarios.  The working environment has changed dramatically due to a profound reorganization, however, HP/HPE has been very good to me.  The groups I have worked with have been staffed by great people, my direct management has always been open and supportive, and the hardest part is leaving the company at this point.  HPE has merged/divested with another company and, subsequently, all groups have been decentralized resulting in a massive budget cuts and workforce reduction.The company has provided me a free hand to manage my responsibility in a specific site assignment.Daily quality and safety inspections and reporting.Weekly quality meetings and preparatory meetings of segment of work.Completed work segment pre-final and final inspections.Daily updating of red line drawings.The company managers also provided me full support in any site work issues and resolutions.What a great company Hewlett and Packard created.  The HP Way.  The essence that the employees' brainpower was the company's most important resource.  This once magnificent company is a shell of it's former self through 236+ acquisitions and over 50 spinoffs. The people were the most intelligent, focused, hysterical team players I've ever had the privilege of working with.Typical day consisted of attempting to help customers on the contract via remote connection. Most customers were expecting a technician to come onsite. Metrics for the job went up while the number of tickets that were able to be pulled from the queue went down. Customers generally did not know their own company's internal policy and would want to argue, thus most tickets from the queue would be sent to a field technician to explain to them first hand. The workload and policies became even more frustrating as time progressed as the red tape involved became more cumbersome to work with, our closure numbers needed to increase and our number of tickets that were received decreased. It became a lose-lose situation rapidly.Moving away from work at home flexibility even in the technology space, only in strategic locations like Plano, TX; Pontiac, MI; Colorado Springs, CO; Atlanta, GA; etc.Work life balance is a challenge given layoffs and additional workload inline with strategy to resource labor cost by switching from highly skilled resources to mid/lower skilled resources.I spend about half of my day using Excel spreadsheets to prepare a route to stop by as many printers that need serviced. I have learned many different things about laser printing since the start of this job. My team lead and my boss were my two biggest motivators in getting my certification. The majority of my co-workers are nice, respectful people. There are a few that act rather unprofessional when they become stressed. The most difficult part of my current job, is really not even difficult. Covering 2.8 million square feet on foot 5 days a week is physically tiring, but it is a mental cake-walk. I love working with the many different models of printers and all other platforms of technology in such a large call-center environment.Worked as phone support to schedule a time for the Wal-Mart store and the HP service tech to be on site to change out the main store server.  Needed to make sure the equipment arrived with all the parts in good condition and was available for the HP tech to install. Helped with packing, shipping and tracking of equipment. Enjoyed the physical part of the job the best. Assisted with Project Manager with getting project done in time as needed.Elite, Care Pack, and Support 1 representative.

Troubleshooting over the phone to properly diagnose issue and effectively replace parts, set up services, and repair in a time efficient manner. Maintaining customer satisfaction at all times. Communicating with customers using email and making outbound calls. Utilizing all available sources for proper diagnoses on all calls. Maintaining cases and make sure cases are closed properly and on time. Time management efficient.HP had a nice work environment. Everybody was very similar in attitude and aptitude. We would all work very well together on our team at least. We had a gym on campus where we worked out together. A few cafeterias to choose from for lunch, lots of nice restaurants and entertainment nearby etc.Entered and maintained provider applications, contracts and updates into the system and provider information into credentialing database. Communicating effectively and courteously both orally and in writing and demonstrate empathy in difficult interpersonal situationsVerified potential and existing Provider’s licensure, liability insurance, and BNDD, CDS and DEA certificate.Very productive, a stress free work place, great relationship with co-workers really nothing negative about anything regarding working with HP.I had a very productive client base, excellent sales opportunities, established an excellent relationship with my customers, my work day was very enjoyable.Develop new business, work with existing accounts, and minimize lost business to achieve profitable sales growth and special objectives. Seek and qualify prospects in accordance with company account stratification goals. Research customer business needs and develop a mix of products and service to meet needs. Evaluate market trends and recommend products to customers, based on business needs and goals. Informed of market conditions, product innovations, and competitors products, prices, and sales; share information with customers as part of value-added services provided. Create customers for life""Contract side of things""No communication what so ever. Everything is done at the last minute. Everyone plays the blame game and won't take responsibility for themselves. Management is a joke. Always asking to get a new project done within an impossible time frame. No promotions given no matter how long you work there and how hard you work. What I learned after working here is how not to properly manage people and have good time management. The most enjoyable part of the job was leaving it.Management is losing focus and to many layers of it, not enough workers in the trenches.  I enjoy the work I do and the coworkers that I have, however the open door policy will lead to your demise.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,Palo Alto,CA,2016-10-11T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/5e6e61b6-c7d8-47ed-9d5e-9816771441fd?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=27,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

102,1506.0,Haskell Data Scientist,TARGET,3.8,19100.0,"This helped me pay for my college and it was nice working there. Woulnd not go again and would prefer more on time managers.Hired out of college to be an ETL (assistant store manager). Very intense training, and information overload for 6 weeks. Expected to perform and manage every single day. Weekends, holidays, overnight, early morning shifts are all fair game. Expected to work on average 50 hours/ week (but it's a salaries position so you will probably work more). Promoting is difficult. It's highly political so superior relationships with those above your boss are a necessity. It's a great position for someone looking for a lot of on hand management experience. However, it's retail, it's a lot of managing damage control, cleaning up after others (call-ins, actual mess on the sales floor). Not very rewarding.Almost everyone in management are unfair and show no respect to employees. Advancement comes only by how much management likes you. It's not based on your work or experience. There is a lot of he say she say at the Rock Hill store and others will believe it whether it's based on fact or opinion. It used to be a fun place to work and almost everyone got along but with the new management people only seem to be looking out for themselves and turning on each other just to get ahead. It's sad.I was a cashier for a year and a half and it wasn't bad. The minimum wage was $8 an hr when I was hired but it had been raised to $10 before I quit earlier this year.The hardest part of the job was selling the Target RedCard to customers and it was pretty much the only way to get recognized as a cashier. Benefits are good, and they include holiday pay and (I think) insurance. The reason I quit was because there weren't any opportunities for me to change positions the entire time I worked there and it felt like everyone else was moving up except me. Management was okay but not the absolute best. The best part was working with the customers. If I went beyond their expectations, they voiced it and it would make me feel great.Target is a very decent place to work. They offer a very reasonable wage and have decent benefits like health insurance and 401K. The work is very physical and it be overwhelming at first but eventually you acclimate and get into a rhythm. The shifts are divided into either 10 or 12 hour days with 2 paid breaks. The people are generally easy to get a long with and many of the on shift supervisors are good with communication and helping resolve yours and the business needs. One downside is during the busy seasons they usually force mandatory overtime, meaning you will have to work an additional day or sometime two days, and it can stretch on for weeks or even months at a time.target is literally one of my favorite stores so when i got the job opportunity i was thrilled. The team members i worked with were very nice and friendly and it seemed like this was going to be a great experience up until a couple months ago when i started to realize that the retail world is full of lazy and drama filled people. the management treats the workers as if they are slaves and demand things that they can handle on their own, Also when problems are brought to hr confidentially they are shared amongst other people within the building which is pretty crazy because if you don't even feel comfortable going to hr then thats a problem within itself. The raises are a pretty good amount when they come around but it makes you wonder if its worth it when the management isn't up to par.A typical day at work involves interacting with a multitude of guest personalities.  Assisting people with problem solving has been mostly enjoyable, sometimes not.  Management seems more interested in reaching corporate goals than in the individual workers. My co-workers are mostly fun, energetic, reliable and helpful.  The hardest part of the job is reaching goals of signing guests up for Target RedCards.  It seems like an intrusion to most people.  The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing I have saved people the most money possible through coupons, apps, sale ads, etc.  If they are also using one of Target's cards, that's bonus savings.I loved my job! I was a senior team leader, but because I didn't have a degree I couldn't advance to the next position, even though I had been ther for 15yrs and had done everything in that store. The pay was great, the benefits were great, the management in the last 3 yrs was awful! No compassion for their team members. No loyalty just numbers! This Target in particular lost what it meant to take care of your team. Their purpose as a company was just the bottom dollar. I wish I could have advanced in the company but it just wasn't meant to be.the work was good, worked well with other flow team members.  Team leads came and went on a regular basis.  Upper management did not communicate with all ream members, especially the night crew.  When new team leaders came in they were not notified that I have some medical limitations such as the inability to climb ladders, carry more than 50 lbs, can not stand still long periods of time, and have difficulty working more than 32 hours a week.  This is due to an injury to my right leg and knee, including insertion of titanium rods.  This caused friction and an even more hostile environment when I reminded them of my limitations.The motto at my store was always fun, fast, and friendly service, and the majority of the management and staff seemed to follow suite. Despite having large tasks and very busy and stressful days, the management and team always seemed to keep things to a realistic level, understanding that everyone was working hard and continually trying to lift our spirits. It was a much different feeling than other retailers I've worked at, where the management would usually just callously list goals and be unhappy when/if those goals weren't met. People are more than just efficiency machines at Target, they're people again.This was my first ever job. It was interesting learning new things. But management is corrupt. While I worked hard to earn my place other people were being recognized because they were friends. Everyone else got an amazing raise while I got a penny as a raise. You must think I didn't do my job well to earn a raise. I beg to differ. Lets just say if you aren't best friends with management or agree to kiss... you know where I am trying to get. You wont be able to move up in the company. Which is unfortunate since I do love the company and what it stands for. Corporate needs to take a look at who they hire as their management.This was a great place to work. I was a cashier, and I loved the work environment. The team leaders are so nice and I became very close with the people I worked with. And the company treated us well too. There was a break room with food available a few days a week. Schedule is flexible also, I worked approximately 30 hours while attending college. Pay is ok, I believe that the minimum cashier wage was raised but I could be wrong. The hardest part of the job was obviously dealing with the occasionally unreasonable customer, and there were times when the computers would glitch, but that all comes with any job. The best part was the sense of family and support among the team members and management. I would recommend this job for anyone, whether you want a part time job or a career there is opportunity for advancement and the hours are flexible!i specialize in planograms signing and packing out  freight i enjoy it makes the day go quick. i get along very well with my coworkers we are one team one dream we help each other .management there are very rewarding people that recognize you often for your accomplishments and are willing to help you develop to become the very best at your goals.the hardest part of the job is when the hours get cut mine typically do not i am a presentation team member and play very important roll on the salesfloorI dont know if is my store. But there's zero recognition from management. There's no advancement besides getting cross trained. We work hard and get expire food as compensation for our work. Again, may be my just my Target. Good friendships.Work starts at 22:00 and finishes when the work is done. Usually heavy workloads pulling items from backroom onto sales floor. After pulls are complete we either help flow team stock store or stay in the backroom back stocking product. I learned to move with a sense of urgency while staying accurate and organized. Management likes to micro manage but seems necessary for certain individuals. Hardest part of job is being on your feet constantly moving all day and trying not to be overwhelmed by the workload. Most enjoyable is being apart of a team.Horrible culture at West Jefferson DC. I had 30+ managers, 10+ Senior Managers and 5+ General Managers in 12 years. The compensation is good and makes you feel like you are trapped there. They used to have a good core team, but have run most off and replaced a lot of people with temps. Revolving door for employees. At one point I knew almost everyone that worked there, but only knew about 15% when I departed. There is not an attendance policy, OM can give you corrective action for missing 3 or 4 days in a year and do nothing to someone who misses 3 or 4 days per month. You only receive 1 15 minute break and a 25 minute lunch for a 10 hr shift. You are not allowed to leave the premises, and have to get special permission to even go to your car. You have to accrue vacation time weekly, but if you leave or get fired you lose it, even though you earned it. Just be prepared to work like a dog for 10 or 12 hours per day.Was expected to be perfect and never make a mistake.  0 support from managers.My career at target started out fantastic, I was given support from all of my coworkers and the management, but the longer I was there the support fell, they put a lot of pressure on two people, and I am in college so when I put in the days that I could not work my hours were dropped way below what i was expecting, they only put me on with minimum shifts. Almost trying to get me to leave. Well they won that battle I am actively looking for a new job. I would not recommend working for target unless you are willing to devote your life to target.A typical day at work will include work center management, performance management for part time staff, and full time management staff. I've learned how to operate a very complex work center that focuses on driving results. Management staff is very talented and understand collaboration to meet goals. The hardest part of the job is the work-life balance when employed as salary. The needs of the business sometimes will affect your off-time. The most enjoyable part of the job is developing other leaders and promoting those that have worked so hard to get there.The job it self is good, mon-Fri 6 to 230pm. Work can be challenging but depends on how good you are trained. Biggest down fall is Management. They do not care about the team members, they preach about development but it's all talk. They tend to promote a pretty faces over experince, exact words from HR-ETL, which hurts the moral of the team. They talk about fairness but they pick and choose who they reprimand I'm order to get the results they want.  No one is happy that works there, they Work hard for poor yearly compensation and a note that says you did good. Hours for normal team members are always cut back. The place is a joke.I worked for Target for six years. By the time I took my leave, I had been cross-trained in every area of the store, learned how to close down registers, and cover manager's shifts when they couldn't come in. I enjoyed my time there and it had its ups and downs as any job might. My only regret was that there was little opportunity to move up while working there. I was given the blessing of knowledge and learned many skills that were not easy to obtain, however though I was trained to cover manager shifts and close the store, I would never see myself promoted. It is because of this I had decided to leave and chose to focus my work into school instead.Target expects a lot out of it's leadership teams and focuses on constructive feedback and recognition to develop their teams. Compensation is fair although ETL and STL work/life balance is compromised and is largely dependent on the condition of the store you're assigned to. Personal accountability is also a necessary quality to having a successful career with the company.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,Sunnyvale,CA,2016-09-16T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/0b893594-aa50-4ea3-b060-7482d170d791?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

It typical day of work depends on the department you work for.The hours can be a bit long.  The pay is below market for similar jobs at other companies.  The people you work with makes the job tolerable, but even they can become a bother sometimes.  I chalk that up to the frequently demanding nature of the job. To be honest, there is a lot to learn to the point that you could leverage your experience into other jobs elsewhere.  I work with a relatively small team, so you can get your hands into a bit of everything.  A warning though: don't stay to long or else you run the risk of being pigeon-holed into a position like this for the rest of your working career.Productive, Good community engagement. Flat Management structure.Great work culture. Limited upward mobility. Very considerate co-workers. Management style disparate.Excellent learning opportunities. Authority does not commensurate with responsibility.No comment.  I have not worked there in 10 years.  They got out of the retail sector because they were not good at it.  They were not willing to make the necessary investment to be successful.  The CEO at that time has since passed away so I can't approve of the current CEO.The best thing about this job is the challenges and you are kept busy, no need to watch the clock. Has a very detailed training program. I was part of the class when 911 occurred and was taken out of training after 2 weeks and put right to work. Allowing me to get on the job training and did not have to return to class training.Never had a permanent job as I was only in training for six months and still never got a permanent job after that. Training was hard but very knowledgeableDefinitely a second family atmosphere.  Supportive management and helpful colleagues, locally, nationally, and internationally.  Cross training and online learning/continuing education keeps employees motivated.Onboarding was done incorrectly.  There was no one to train me for 4 months.  I kept asking if I could help anyone, sometimes they had work, sometimes they did not.  After four months began to be more involved.  Still did not get the proper training.BNY is a very large company. The groups  vary greatly in management goals and style. Each individual's mileage may vary. I have met some very amazing people in my time at BNY and am thankful for all i have learned in my time there.we will learn a lot about the financial world and work with great people but there are not a lot of opportunities to growth within the company.best advice learn as much as you canFast-paced enhancing my agility and bringing to the surface skills I was unaware I possessed.  I did not enter the organization playing the Acoustic Guitar, Keyboard and Producing Music.  My gifts and latent talents were brought out and developed during my employment.  I've done Administrative Assistant work for over 20 years in various industries and I believe it's time to use my natural gifts and talents and work in an industry where I can be of service to Humanity.My day was dealing with checks coming from every banks. I learned how the banking system operate and to minimize risks concerning decision making on the checks.Good place to begin a career. The hands-on training is completed very well by the organization. Additionally, the environment is fairly laid-back for a bank.You can come in to work and people will greet you with a good morning and smile and tell you to have a good day. They also help you when you have questions.Employees are not paid enough. They go above and beyond and their work is usually met with just praise and not enough monetary rewards. This provides a lack if incentive.Talking customers about their monetary progressions and declinations. I learned that banking hours have no variance for life's mishaps. The hardest part of the job is keeping a schedule that is permitting..Talking to people who get approved by the bank for monetary gain.One of the best companies I have ever had the pleasure to work for.  This company recognized and fostered individual strength and encouraged growth for it's employees.If your looking for a job that will take you back to cliques of high school BNYM is the place for you.

From the day I started everyone has been pleasant and inviting. As a consultant I have never felt like an outsider.  This company is very good at communicating to it's employees things that are going on within the Company.  Every week they have a get together so that groups can share what is going on in their areas. Communication is something this company does very well.The CEO is very personable and inviting as is all the management I have dealt with. The employees seem happy to be working at Logitech. Keep doing what you are doing Logitech!~Logitech is re-branding itself as a more youthful place and it is working. The company is well-known but small enough to allow for a larger & more impactful role. Compensation packages remain slightly below average for the Bay Area and the location is not prime for those seeking to live in SF. Culture is excellent.Logitech is a great place for a positive and friendly corporate culture that works pretty hard but also allows room for work life balance and provides a lot of opportunity for personal growth and improvement. That being said, as a business they are stuck in the past using old processes and they have a huge issue with working together across departments or fixing organizational issues. Despite being a globally distributed business with over 120 offices worldwide they haven't seemed to figure out how to work efficiently and effectively as a global business and the process keeps tripping everything up. There was a lot of talk constantly in the two years I was there about progress and change and moving forward with new ideals but at the end of the day nothing ever changed.Typical days work includes overall management of processes on behalf of the #PL provider.

Was fun working with the team in Banglaore and Pune.The overall work culture of the company has changed in recent times. The company is no more driven by values. Most of the times you will get good managers but with laterals joining the company values have gone for a toss. Now culture is moving towards keep your boss happy and company has stopped addressing employees concerns.Infosys has got the best campuses among IT organizations in India. You would love Infosys campuses and facilities in India but you won't be able to utilize them due to stringent project timelines or longs waiting.Infosys used to be a great workplace but the size has caught up and too much of politics between teams/managers make it not desirable for top talent any more.Very high visibility to various technologies and exposure to try and learn new technologies.

It typical day of work depends on the department you work for.The hours can be a bit long.  The pay is below market for similar jobs at other companies.  The people you work with makes the job tolerable, but even they can become a bother sometimes.  I chalk that up to the frequently demanding nature of the job. To be honest, there is a lot to learn to the point that you could leverage your experience into other jobs elsewhere.  I work with a relatively small team, so you can get your hands into a bit of everything.  A warning though: don't stay to long or else you run the risk of being pigeon-holed into a position like this for the rest of your working career.Productive, Good community engagement. Flat Management structure.Great work culture. Limited upward mobility. Very considerate co-workers. Management style disparate.Excellent learning opportunities. Authority does not commensurate with responsibility.No comment.  I have not worked there in 10 years.  They got out of the retail sector because they were not good at it.  They were not willing to make the necessary investment to be successful.  The CEO at that time has since passed away so I can't approve of the current CEO.The best thing about this job is the challenges and you are kept busy, no need to watch the clock. Has a very detailed training program. I was part of the class when 911 occurred and was taken out of training after 2 weeks and put right to work. Allowing me to get on the job training and did not have to return to class training.Never had a permanent job as I was only in training for six months and still never got a permanent job after that. Training was hard but very knowledgeableDefinitely a second family atmosphere.  Supportive management and helpful colleagues, locally, nationally, and internationally.  Cross training and online learning/continuing education keeps employees motivated.Onboarding was done incorrectly.  There was no one to train me for 4 months.  I kept asking if I could help anyone, sometimes they had work, sometimes they did not.  After four months began to be more involved.  Still did not get the proper training.BNY is a very large company. The groups  vary greatly in management goals and style. Each individual's mileage may vary. I have met some very amazing people in my time at BNY and am thankful for all i have learned in my time there.we will learn a lot about the financial world and work with great people but there are not a lot of opportunities to growth within the company.best advice learn as much as you canFast-paced enhancing my agility and bringing to the surface skills I was unaware I possessed.  I did not enter the organization playing the Acoustic Guitar, Keyboard and Producing Music.  My gifts and latent talents were brought out and developed during my employment.  I've done Administrative Assistant work for over 20 years in various industries and I believe it's time to use my natural gifts and talents and work in an industry where I can be of service to Humanity.My day was dealing with checks coming from every banks. I learned how the banking system operate and to minimize risks concerning decision making on the checks.Good place to begin a career. The hands-on training is completed very well by the organization. Additionally, the environment is fairly laid-back for a bank.You can come in to work and people will greet you with a good morning and smile and tell you to have a good day. They also help you when you have questions.Employees are not paid enough. They go above and beyond and their work is usually met with just praise and not enough monetary rewards. This provides a lack if incentive.Talking customers about their monetary progressions and declinations. I learned that banking hours have no variance for life's mishaps. The hardest part of the job is keeping a schedule that is permitting..Talking to people who get approved by the bank for monetary gain.One of the best companies I have ever had the pleasure to work for.  This company recognized and fostered individual strength and encouraged growth for it's employees.If your looking for a job that will take you back to cliques of high school BNYM is the place for you. Hours are sometimes flexible.Low compensation, no job security and hard to advance.  You can work hard but little recognition only good thing is coworkersThis is a large bank they had five Branch offices in Los Angeles and were in business for over 25 years , unfortunately in 2008 the bank decided to merge with US Bank corporation and sold the business to them. 321 employees were laid off with a  packageNice company but when it comes to advancement at times it is not all what it seems.

119,1523.0,Data Scientist,CA Technologies,3.8,432.0,"Too many layers of management that are greatly disjointed from the overall teams.  Poor communication and no training=stress.  Lots of it.  Constant change. Unrealistic goals and  strategies.   GREAT people and culture, though.  Flexible schedule is admirable makes for better production.Love CA Technologies and their work/life balance. You do not accrue vacation or sick time so time off is subject to manager approval. A good manager will allow plenty of time off. Finance department has half day Fridays over the summer (Memorial day - Labor day).CA is not growing and retention rates are high so opportunities to advance are limited.Everyday was busy -- negotiating contracts with outside clients, reviewing, writing and closing large software deals.  Constantly learning new information through research and dialogue with stakeholders.  My co workers were absolutely great -- very supportive. We worked well as a team.  Hardest part of the job, or should I say challenging part of the job was finalizing a contract to the satisfaction of the client and bringing value to the deal. The most enjoyable part of the job was working and negotiating the deal in order to finalize a good contract between the parties.Overall an average place to work. Sometimes felt that there was just enough work to keep everyone occupied but not enough down time to develop better ways to make things run smoother. The environment is, at times, hostile. This place is not for the thin-skinned. There is a serious lack of training materials provided by the management.Wonderful experience, great people, great people development, great W2 potential, huge customer base, wonderful resources, unbelievable Club Trip destinations, leverage points galore to make business happen.I have worked with better,  more caring people, but very seldom.From the day I hired on they made me feel like family.  I would still be there today if the management (which had just changed just before I was layed off) would have done their homework to see what I did.  The amount of money they saved by laying me off pailed in comparison to the money they invested in my training.The working environment is structured in more of the standard office cubicle layout than other typical software companies in Silicon Valley. Had lots of virtual meetings.The management team has a very clear vision, the company is constantly changing to meet this vision.The team I work with are great professionals and always willing to help.Work and life balance is very good as long as you plan ahead there should be no issues at all !!The only way to advance at CA is to self-promote and manage up.  Workers who keep their heads down and get the job done are routinely overlooked, overworked and taken for granted.Great place to work with lots of opportunities to advance. Large company with great benefits, including 5 weeks of paid time off to start. Layoff every year to weed out poor performers.Very fun culture, preaching hard and dedicated work that is incentivized by casual Friday bagels, quarter beer o'clock Thursdays, and company wide awareness projects. The sales atmosphere has a very high turnover rate, due to constant change to sales strategy. (Some people around the office joked about  CA meaning ""Change Always""). Management is mediocre at best, promoting leaders that are not necessarily competent, but are noticed by top management (who are not around often enough to see the actual day-to-day employee work ethic).Ability to make a lot of money - no cap on commission up to 35,000 on top of salary, which is definitely a blessing.Internal promotion is a possibility as long as you (once again) get noticed by top management. In this environment, networking trumps competence any day.Co-workers are great, friendly and helpful.While at CA, I learned several different programs; policies and communication skills. The hardest part of my job was dealing with a team located in different time zones. The best part of my job is the people I work with.I started working at CA Technologies as an intern right out of college. I always felt welcome amongst my team and was given the opportunity to take on new tasks and responsibilities rapidly. This definitely helped me grow in my career, and I got to me some excellent people on the way. However, I have my doubts about the company's long term vision and every year there is the threat of layoffs. CA Technologies gave me an excellent foundation to continue my career as a software engineer.CA Technologies is undergoing a tremendous transformation since the acquisition of Rally Software. The business is being significantly more innovative and proactively engaging it's employees for feedback.I consider CA  great place to work, and believe it is good choice for most people.There's great job security here and I love what I do.  They give you a lot of opportunity to grow as a person and in respect to your professional career.  Everyone is super nice and has the up-most respect for one another - very collaborative workplace.Great Work Environment, They have an site montessori daycare and gym. You'll learn a vast knowledge of different software that they develop and supportMore training would benefit employees and managers.Everyone is pleasant to work with but very seriousQuiet atmosphereNot run as a technology company.  Too many layers of management.   A collaborative environment where everyone is looking out for themselves.No vision in technology. Focused on old mainframe run rate business.I learned first hand  the duties of a Security Operations analyst. I learned how to handle different alerts and asking for help when I was stuck. Management and the team members are great and helped when they can.Days are busy with many different responsibilities to attend too.There is a constant influx of new technology and ideas to better the workplace.Stressful place to work. Moving up is difficult and management is old school. Typical corporate machine. Frequent and grueling over time, but depending on the group you are in you are usually rewarded that time back.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,Santa Clara,CA,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/30917066-13bd-4afd-924c-ff0e38c18f2a?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

121,1525.0,Data Scientist_Intern Evergreen,Intel Corp.,4.2,2000.0,"This is a great company with excellent management. Incredible technology and great leadership. I was part of one of their acquisitions and they are a company that rewards the people that are willing to work like it's their company.Intel probably has the biggest challenge now to find it's purpose in a a world where the PC is become less relevant.  I wish them the best of luck.What can you say? It is Intel!! This company takes care of its employees like none other.  Job training was top of the line. You did not have a supervisor, you had a facilitator .Former employees of Intel of Puerto Rico still consider themselves as one big family. We had such fun doing our jobs making for excellent quality products. Everyone had a sense of pride and responsibility that was greatly compensated with gifts to include extra cash bonuses. Great, great company.I have learned so many new  technical things which i don't know,here management is very good and coorperative,co-workers are very friendly most enjoyable part of the company is work culture.Am working at Intel mostly very busy everyday, The fun part that my Boss and my coworkers are very friendly and team work. we always sit down trying to solve the issue to make thing right.Good place to work if you can stand for long periods of time good to employees clean and respectful Environment. People were nice.Intel as great benefits; flexible work environment. Lots of room for growth and advancement. But it depends on you and your manager as to what you get out of your career.Intel senior management has good intentions but the culture doesn't support the proliferation of their ideas.  Middle and lower management are generally poorly trained and that can impact your career unless you are savvy enough to maneuver around them.  But there are some real gems working at Intel, the benefits are great, and the opportunities can be rather exciting.A productive working environment. You could transfer from within the company. Learned new jobs.  Met new and worked with a diverse working force. Good benefits.My experience at Intel has been a very positive one. This is a company that gives one the opportunity to maintain a great work-life balance and at the same time, exposes you to opportunities for innovation. The management is helpful and always looking for solutions to any problems the employees might have - in some cases even personal ones  in order to create a healthy work atmosphere. The work itself is the most fun part and so is working and ideating with the team.Intel hires a hardworking and dedicated workforce which is the best part of working there. What learned there will certainly help me be successful in my next job.Intel really did provide training and growth opportunities within their organization. They cared about the companies success. They had cubicles that had large windows so you didn't feel so confined, opportunities to support local charity events and tuition reimbursement. Great company!Intel was a great company to work for 10 years ago but in recent times the quality of the systems were significantly degraded due to poor management and prioritizing move to low paid and unskilled work force outside of USA at the high cost to USA workers forced out of our jobs after training non USA workers.In Intel I have learned how to manage the issues and the way to interact with employees to get things to get it done, intel is the safety nil work place and management the hardest part was vendor managing, the more enjoyable part of my work was event setups.Intel is not a steady place to work if you are looking for a life time career. Employment depends on the economical and political environment of the times.The company has huge potential, but engineering organizations lack ability to create good leaders.Numbers are valued more than people within development and HVM engineering organizations.Intense, fun, leading edge of technology, always pushing the envelope. Free coffee/soft drinks, fruits, gym on site and many great benefits. Constant work/life balance issues.It is a good place for hardware development or mid-managment level. more challenging for software development because the culture is so different and behind.Depending upon which group you report into, if you want to be challenged, Intel's the place to be. Some days will require long hours. In many ways, the manufacturing world continues to be like the 1970s.Intel provides a very competitive working environment and good opportunities for challenging assignments and advanced opportunities.  People work hard and are compensated accordingly.An excellent company to work for. A great culture within the company. Being able to take pride in working for the no 1 semiconductor chip manufacturer in the world.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,Santa Clara,CA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/f2764a36-e179-42fb-936c-3f422c6a8b26?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=18,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
122,1526.0,Senior Data Scientist - Product Analytics,"Netflix, Inc.",3.8,247.0,"My typical day at work was pretty simple if all went well. My job was to answer questions, comments, and concerns with the website and the product we were providing as well as assisting with devices customers where using. It was a new challenge for each call and that was what kept it fun for myself. You would have a few bad eggs of course, but that rarely slowed down the pace of the day overall. Management told you how you could improve on your calls, and co-workers would talk to you during breaks about what they do when you run into a sticky situation. The hardest part about the job was having a rush of callers that gave us no breathing room in between to collect ourselves again. This, however, is standard with most jobs involving customer interaction. Also, compared to the number of customers they have, we were only helping a very small percentage of the overall user base. In short, the customers that called were the ones that definitely needed our help.Typical day at work is coworkers greeting me as I walk in the call center and customers eager to speak to me to have their issues resolved. I learned that it's easier to sympathize with a customer than to argue. Hardest part about the job is staying confident in yourself when you have angry customers criticizing you for mistakes that may have been on their part. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people and creating new friendships.Taking on a queue of thousands of calls on a daily basis taught me patience and fast problem solving skills, both are things I carry with me each day. It was a really team player type of environment I had the chance to work closely with management daily which taught me leadership skills. The most enjoyable part of my job here had to be talking to my customers giving them a great experience with each call made my day.NetflixCS claims to be different from any other call center environment in many ways. The problem is that, with every development, there are several setbacks. NetflixCS has outsourced many departments and has shown little interest in promoting or retaining talented employees. As with many other similar customer service jobs, they simply do not care, and are just as happy to replace you as they are to hire you. Simply having acceptable compensation and benefits does not a good work environment make.Love waking up to go to work. Very relaxed work environment with flexible seating arrangements. Teams were very intimate and team leads worked with agents one on one week after week to improve in areas that were lacking. For every holiday and new release there was a celebration including food and games.This was a great job in the fact the the co-workers and the atmosphere were relaxed, and overall friendly. However, they gave little opportunity for in house promotions though originally promised all promotions would be in house. Training provided was proficient, but could have been stronger as the company later changed it's customer care requirements. The benefits at this job were amazing, and overall I would definitely recommend this company to anyone ow that they have fully established the needs of the company and customer care required as well.I enjoyed listening to music while I worked on the machines. When I first started working there it was fun people were tired but for the most part happy. Shortly after I was hired they started laying off and firing most of the employees. They also kept changing and getting rid of supervisors and managers. It was also very difficult to progress even though they said there was room for growth.Autonomy, great compensation and the opportunity to work with the best of the best.  This is an opportunity of a lifetime! Only problem is they spoil you and makes it impossible to find anything else that compares!This is one of THE best places that I have ever had the opportunity working at. The work atmosphere is unlike any other. They are such a welcome, caring, fun, and open group of people. This is a place where you can literally be yourself, not feel judged, and just have an amazing time at work. They teach you, uplift you, and help you reach your goals in all aspects. I have learned so many things, and I am happy that I was able to work their because I think they have made me a better person overall, and I can take the skills that I learned there, and put them into my life.The crew and trainers who I was set to work with were great. I unfortunately had to leave Netflix due to medical problems, but was pleased with the amount of training I received. I never once met or saw my direct boss, but saw my trainers on a constant basis. The work was relatively slow paced, which left a lot of room for no productivity.Typical day at work is answering lots of calls and talking with lots of customers from different locations. Things I have learned is how to help customers around their accounts. Management and co-workers are very awesome. Awesome part of the job are breaks and free lunches.Worse place ever as it was all temporary from the very start.. so they have 3 interviews they make you jump thru after you go thru the hardest hiring process as far as applying and awaiting an interview period?? I think I didn't hear a response for about 6-7 months later?? The management was so poorly picked and orcustrated that I would highly doubt Netflix CS survival here in Utah.. I bet now they hire the lower bracket of individuals with actual experience and knowledge about tech support that their turnover ratio has to be a record high.. the supervisor I had was very demeaning and condescending and passive aggressive like he had an agenda to ruin folks lives, cause nobody on my team is there anymore as I still communicate with all of them!!Worked the shipping and receiving office. Hours 9 am to 5:30. Unloaded daily deliveries of all DVD'S.  Then the second half of the day I shipped out the Netflix swag for all 55 Hubs ( shirts to hats etc)enter all shipment into a excel spreadsheet and sent daily tracking numbers to the managers. Once delivered enter the data and tracking into a spreadsheet that was sent out weekly. Also took care of all the in house mail coming into the hub. We worked as a team always open discussions together. Loved the company.I worked for netflix for almost 2 years. It gave me the chance to help build a company. I was one of the first agents to work for netflixcs. While working there I sawany changes happen over the 2 years. I also had the chance to help build the company's culture and grow larger.The job is not a difficult job, but it is very redundant and the constantly want improvement even when improvement is not easy. It is hard to come in to the same thing every day and it gets to the point you dread hearing the beep in your ear letting you know a call is coming. Most customers calling in are angry about things you cannot control such as being unable to take certain payment methods by phone or content you can't put on for them. you get at least one angry customer a day typically on average and it is difficult on your self esteem and it is an emotionally draining job. THAT is what makes it difficult not the job at hand itself.This is definitely a great and fun place to work. I love video games and tech so working at this call center was really fun. Getting to know new releases and playing with the different devises that you could load the app ontoProvide exceptional customer service and problem solving by responding to all inbound calls, assist customers with new and existing accounts, website navigation, and account billing. Be an active listener who can show empathy and patience. Work in a fast paced, high volume, changing, and non-scripted environment while learning and strives to gain new knowledge about product and service changes.Shifts are unstable and you have to be willing to change your schedule during shift bidding.

126,1530.0,Junior Data Scientist,"Cisco Systems, Inc.",4.1,1800.0,"energetic environment, start up vibeone of the first ""internet"" companies because of its BBN historyno sure how it has changed over the years; company was being considered for an acquisition when I leftIf you have a good manager at Cisco, it can be a great place to work.  Generally liked my co-workers and almost everyone was helpful.  The ""People Deal"" that HR introduced was a good idea, but really lacked accountability and ability to execute between manager and employee.  The salary and benefits at Cisco are really good, but it's lost it's mojo as evidenced by the yearly lay-offs.During my time at Cisco I worked with some of the brightest and most collaborative individuals in the industry.  I have worked with colleagues, partners and customers that have become life long friends and business partners.  I supported national and global partners with a practice around cloud both private and public offerings.I was a federal sales account manager during my time at Cisco. I supported both the DoD and Civilian side of the federal government. I had the opportunity to work with all five branches of the military. I learned a great deal both about the sales infrastructure for a technology company and about how the military operates from a sales and security point of view. I greatly enjoyed my time there and hope to one day return to that work when my personal life affords me that opportunity. I would highly recommend this work to a motivated individual open to learning all about the technology world and the ability to travel weekly.This company does not slack off with monetary rewards for dedicated service and provides whatever is needed to get the job done.  Working with others in any group in the company is highly encouraged and supported if required.  However, upper management is severely distanced from the workers in the trenches and with excessive bureaucracy, new products can only be added to the portfolio through acquisitions.  The excess jobs requires a rebalance and restructuring annually with a reduction of 5% to 20% of the worldwide workforce.A typical day in IT at Cisco, starts early and ends late, you are always connected.  Is extremely fasted paced, with a steep learning curve, however that can be fun for a while.  Hardest part of the job was the politics, favoritism at the junior to middle management level is difficult to stomach as they have turned favored individual contributors into managers, which doesn't always translate to good management.  Most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with.Cisco offers exposure to plenty of new technology, but often with little training.  The option to work from home was a huge plus.  The constant acquisitions seem to disrupt the product pipelines as they keep changing what is offered to customers.  Things always move very quickly and keeping up is a constant challenge.I have worked at Cisco for over 10 years.  The company has been very good to me as it has given me opportunities to grow, stretch, and explore the world through my work.  As the IT industry shifts and changes, Cisco must continue to innovate and stretch its muscles to stay ahead of the competition.I have enjoyed my time at Cisco and hope to be able to contribute for another 10 years.This company is great. I love my managers and my team. They have a direct interest in my well being with the company.I also love the office setup and vibe. Everyone is super helpful and attentive.I really appreciate that the company allows flexibility in your workday and unlimited PTO. My co-workers are easy to work with, and I feel supported by team leads. I only wish the pay was a bit higher. Because of this, I doubt if I will be able to work here for very long. But for the time being, I'm enjoying learning new things and picking up a few skillsJordan • 11 minsCisco is fundamently nothing more than a VC/banking company that would prefer to outsource all work to contractors and or AP region.  As soon as it is able to will lay you off.  it has NO loyalty to employees and the HR ""people deal"" is a joke.  Since when is it hard to have a review program that focuses on your performance against goals and metrics without stack ranking you?A typical work day would involve testing and then meeting team members within and other teams. I learned a lot of testing tools and how to get inter dependent team work done in time. The work environment was always positive and friendly. The hardest part of the job was to get the overall picture of the test schedule and the most enjoyable part is you could go as far as you can to build prototypes.I worked at Cisco for many years in many capacities.  I met many wonderful people from all walks of life.  I learned that work was not the only priority at Cisco and in this culture I made great connections.  As a Lobby Ambassador, I was the face of Cisco midtown.  As the Executive Assistant I was the right hand woman of the Operations Director and as the Business Analyst to the sales team, I was an important part of team strategical planning.  The easiest part of the job was the friendships I forged-most difficult was understanding that at the end of the year or quarter the pressure is on and don't take anything personally.  Overall, I learned a lot and wouldn't change the experience for the world.I've worked for Cisco for almost one year and have enjoyed all the people I've worked with.  My manager is easy going and has the attitude of ""as long as the work get's done, I don't care about what hours you are in the office"".  I am able to work from home at least 2 days a week (more if my manager is traveling).  I would stay and convert to a Cisco employee if it were an option.CISCO is a good place to work as long as you realize your contract may end at any time. But they do provide a very laid back culture and an easy going management style.,I learned that CISCO is a work from home friendly workplace.My co-workers on average were very easy to get along with and helpful with needed information.The hardest part of the job was making human connections.My typical day at Cisco was all about collaborating and building great products.  As a PM, I worked closely with Engineers and UX designers to create a better WebEx administration experience.  I also got to play a major role to move us towards a more data-driven culture using metrics and analytics.  I learned more about analytics technologies and best practices.  Cisco is a great place to work.Cisco is filled with great people that make up the unique culture.  It is a big company and sometimes hard to get things done but overall Cisco is a good place to work. They give you the tools to work from anywhere in the world. The C Suite and VPs are going through some changes and the reverberations can be felt at all levels.  It will take some time and strong leadership to get through this and come out ok.I have been working at Cisco Systems full-time (For nearly 2 years). Continued Limited Restructures are causing talented individuals to be let go. Lack of strong senior leadership in some areas and poor decisions are being made.you typically start off with a day of thinking how you can increase the top-line and bottom-line revenue, and make your job relevant to the product(s) in a BG you support by marketing the product to the public domain in which this product is relevant, and then put action behind it to make it happen.The hardest part of the marketing job is when the product is actually a so-so one but you need to make it into a super-star product.My work experiences at Cisco as a self-employed contractor were excellent. Enjoyed working with smart global team members, constantly learned new things and made valuable contributions. Most contract roles have migrated to lower cost areas or to preferred suppliers.There are lots of politics involved in working here which can make or break your career depending on who you know or how ""liked"" you are.  Depending on which business unit you land in you may or may not have resources for personal development.  One benefit is that your direct manager is required to help you progress in the company.Very Political EnvironmentTo be successful it's better to say what VP(S) and directors want to hear rather than sharing ideas and truth's that would make product better Decisions are based on favoritism and not technically founded.TTM decisions are made at the expense of customers at times with plans to solve issue in downstream releases.

Good talent and people willing to help each other out. If I could change one thing is that there are too many ""bosses, not enough workers""... Too many managers and directors making poor decisions.Pay is excellent, but work/life balance is non-existing. With major sites in China, expect to work many nights because of the time difference.People and culture are among the best I've encountered in my experience. Benefits have improved in the past couple of years. Interesting technology to work with.  People and culture are among the best I've encountered in my experience.

My manager and other team members were very cooperative. I learned a lot of things during my internship period.Work everyday was the same but there were times where the department would be blasted with late updates and issues, making the day crucial on top of all my daily duties. Company provided great healthcare and fun events for employees with amazing prizes. My fellow co-workers were the best, I think that's what made it hard when I left here because working there for almost 5 years, people there became family. The company outsourced and was moving to another building, so there were ongoing changes and new projects without providing any training. I had to manage doing projects on my own with limited information, also trying to finish up with my personal work on top of that with no approved overtime.

There was some very hard-work to do for weeks at a time, but on other days there was too much free time.I had 2 different positions there and the people I interacted with were great. The work was fulfilling, the salary and benefits were good too.Innovative technology, with a high % of innovative type A personalities leading at all levels of the business. Also, many, many, great people in numerous areas of the company. Basically, a innovative global leader that is always on, which has it's upside and downside.Troubleshooting problems, review the preventive task and perform the necessary task to keep the equipment running.  Working hard to make sure the equipment is running at the highest level possible.my typical day consists of preparing barrels to be shipped or ensuring there is space in the warehouse for deliveries.  I load or unload trucks as they come/go.I've held a job at varian/AMAT for 5 years. I worked hard and have been compensated consistently. I became full time after a year and have been given and taken all opportunities presented. This company values their employees who are dedicated and hard workers.People very friendly! Great environment for working and enjoin your work time. I have a lot of friends there and I really miss them.I would say thank you to my leaders, my supervisors. Thank you for trusted me and supported me in all the projects I had done. Thanks for the handshake everyday, boss.

Management is always here to better you and get you to the places you want to be.Great company culture which allows for personal creativity and problem solving. Generally a laid back atmosphere.Opportunities to work in many different locations.The work always offers a challenge and more to do and learn, but learning is hindered by a lack of institutional learning.  Each department reinvents the wheel for so much of what they do.  This is exacerbated by management requiring such a high volume of work (typical day is 12 hours or more).Great company to work for.  The culture was highly bright and it was a joy to speak with all levels of management.  The work/life balance could use some improvementsThe corporate culture is 'Silicon Valley' - a flat management style where results matter.  There are no 'silos':  the workers are expected to go anywhere and interact with anyone, without restriction, to accomplish their objectives.  Managers are there to clear roadblocks.In return for an unfettered work environment, the workers are evaluated on their performance - and if the performance is excellent, they are richly rewarded.  If their performance is not excellent, they should be looking around for another job.  The industry is cyclical, and layoffs occur roughly every 18 months or so.  Regardless if you are a worker or a manager, if you do not demonstrate consistent, superior performance, you should be looking around for work elsewhere.Because Applied is the #1 global manufacturer of capital equipment, the expectations are sky-high.  Competition is fierce, and Applied competes on a global basis.  Applied sells their products worldwide because they are the best in the world, with the fastest time to market.  The typical product horizon is released in 90 days or less - the longest is 6 months, and that is rare.  This is generally not the environment for a work/life balance - the emphasis is on being #1 with rapid deliveries.  On the plus side, working at Applied is the opportunity to demonstrate superior performance in a world-class organization.I have learned that in there are many people with disabilities that are not life disabling / threatening. Whether it be from pain or from inability to perform an action properly and safely and these people benefit from a trainer and massage therapist.Great people, good mentors. I was brought up to speed and given many opportunities and ownership. There are many learning, training, and career development opportunities available.it is a nice company with a good environment for learning and growing .i have learned too much stuff during i am working on this company .A great warehouse job. I learned a lot from this company. With this job you are required to have t pay attention t detail to ensure that your work is accurate.Every day is something new. You come in and see what is in store. I have learned a lot over my 18 months with the company, including Oracle and SAP. My boss and his boss were amazing! Easy to talk to guys with a laid back and appreciative attitude. Co-workers are average. You will have the ones you like and do not like, but at the end of the day, you are a family. Hardest part is letting go when your contract expires, but the going away lunch is amazing! Most enjoyable is the catered lunch and fun at the end of each quarter and the 2 gyms on site with fitness classes.knowledgeable co-workersfun place to workplenty of overtimeincrease you skill setdevelop new trouble shooting skillsThe work time sometime is flexible. Many people work there over 15 years. And most people are nice, but people don't talk much between different groups.

Handling newbies is very fulfilling for me since I am a frustrated educator/trainer/director. I was able to grow and learned a lot from this job. I was able to test my capabilities and patience in terms of handling different kinds of people and culture since I am dealing with different types of people in terms of my customers and colleagues and clients.This June, our UK account was sent back onshore.

Performance Evaluations - included responsible for IAP (Improvement Action Plan) and DAP’s (Development Action Plan) for improving the performance of team members below SLA’s.10 hr. shift, learned how to deal with customer. Management had a lack of people skills, coworkers were friendly and helped you out when was needed. Hardest part: work under pressure to sale products. Most enjoyable part: facilities, activities.24/7 Customer gives their employees a work-life balance environment. As they believe that a happy and satisfied employee is a productive employee. They will be able to give better results and meet their daily goals if they do not feel overworked and restricted.As [24]7 is my first job, I have learnt how to help the customers in resolving the queries and we do have fun time at work like games etc. My team leader and my co-workers who are much more tenured than me helps me in giving the exact solving for the work.

This div. is run by the EVP of Marketing and she has created a working environment based on the belief that we will get our work done without being controlled or lorded over. In the end it makes for happier employees who achieve big results, accomplishing more than some of the…Culture of a frat house. Lots of favoritism shown towards certain employees. Great learning experience, as you are taught and provided with extremely beneficial feedback. Very forward-looking company.Gartner provides an excellent work life balance.  If you are driven to move up you control your own destiny.  Hard work is acknowledged.Great waterside location. Bad traffic in Stamford, CT.A bit hard to advance as they bring in talent from outside. Very smart people everywhere, hard working, but short hours. At 5:30 everyone is gone except for a few who don't want to leave.Excellent corporate culture and benefits. Challenging environment but opportunities to meet with the brightest IT experts and with interesting and important customers.There is a chance for great camaraderie if you're in the right group. The company is respected in its field and looks great on paper. The team I was in was a well oiled machine until a new manager came in and changed everything, now they are just limping along and all looking to get out (or for the older ones, make it to retirement under the radar). Nice cafeteria. Train shuttle. Nice campus on the water.Great company to start your sales career, they have an amazing training program. This is not your traditional sales job, you will be required to stay up to date to the changes in IT and the industries you cover. You will notice the organization will provide you will a lot of training and resources to be successful in your role. If you're not able to get the flow within the 1st 90 days you will be re-trained and given up to a year to perform or at least have the right mindset. The typical sales cycle last about 2 months if you're doing the right things, you have to be really consultative in selling a username and password. Aligning the problem your're trying to solve to the resources that Gartner provides it's clients. The most enjoyable part of working at Gartner are the smart and responsbile people you work with, everyone seems to be excited to work there. Especially at the End of a Quarter and the EOY. Great company, but a lot of growing pain like weak territories. you are strongly at the will of the accounts you're put into - mainly Healthcare and Financial Verticals make the most money at Gartner! so fight for that or a High Tech role! in SMBField Sales - everything is the same - you are at the will of the economyDepending on the office you work at, freedom around time management and creativity serving business activities can be really pleasant.Fair work-life balance, many truly amazing co-workerThe company has been turning more and more into a corporate ""execute only"" place over timeGartner is a wonderful company to work for.  There is a good work/life balance and the people are wonderful!  My manager was wonderful.  The team was great and super collaborative.  The deadlines are tight but the work gets done.The company is great to work for. Some amazing caliber folks, some not. The work life balance if you have the right manager is great. Mobile work force but depending on your manager, can be micromanaged. Policies aren't set across the board and there's a lot of room for manager's discretion. I had a great manager for a number of years and then another one that I struggled with.This company has so much potential.  The business units are good with the Great Managers, but are a horrible place to work if you have a bad Manager.  Expected to take work home, they do not value Life/Work Balance.You are fresh out of college and have no idea of what professionalism looks like. The recruiters at this company are the best sales people. The career advancement opportunities are minimal at best and picked purely off of popularity and not performace. It is only an inside sales company, there are not any outside sales positions available in the SMB market.Gartner is a fun company that is very youth driven. You will get to work with exciting technology companies and your opportunity for advancement can be realized rather quickly if you are close to the right people. That being said, several people who are not necessarily qualified to be in management get promoted. Having a good manager will make or break your career at Gartner. The only other major drawback is having to move to Fort Myers, Florida.Gartner is one of those companies that people strive for, everyone seems to want to work there. However, they are not very employee friendly. I saw multiple friends get fired without warning and without reason, especially on the sales side. Very little room for growth or advancement if you want to do anything other than sales.Gartner hires people slowly and promotes quickly putting less than best people into management.  However, they have a great environment for people right out of college.Great place for a new grad to learn sales and corp culture.  Lots of great leaders and opportunities to grow.  They have a cafeteria, gym, and other attractive perks for their employees.  Call center sales atmosphere.surrounded by smart and fun people.coworkers are supportive.salary and benefits are ok.tough to grow up in the organization unless you have good contacts.Great brand name and respected company among customers and competitors.  Good work/life balance in most cases, there is a lot to do but freedom in scheduling the work.If you are looking to begin a career in sales or technology, go for it. Just know the environment can be a bit overwhelming if you are a loner or independently driven. They have a heavy ""everyone in"" collaborative work environment which is good for some not for all. Finally, Fort Myers is a city best suitable for my grandma to retire from teaching. Very slow town so be cautious.A typical day at work would consist of me going into the office at 8am. I would unpack my company laptop at my desk and the start working on projects that I have been assigned for the associates that our team of Computer Financial Consultants manages. That includes getting information on clients, putting in data to salesforce, Excel spreadsheets, emials, and personal projects for the associates, ect. I also manage all the associates expenses . Which I make a report and find receipts which they send and send it to FL where the main headquarters is . I make travel arrangements for the associates daily. Car service arrangements too. Keep a filing system. Also a inventory system for the office. I fax and copy all important documents. I pick up most important phone calls from clients and associates as well.","1,001 to 5,000",Palo-Alto,Santa Clara,CA,2016-10-05T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/39c59bb2-5d6d-49bb-99e5-1455b427253d?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

I worked here for almost five years.Agilent was a temporary position that allowed me to explore the world of technology. It allowed me to use my IT education to assist in helping customers. Coworker in particular spent 70% of time on Facebook, Facetime and talking on cellphone (no exaggeration) which was distressing to see especially when as a new worker I had to go to her when a question arose and had to wait till she finished.This job help me understand the importance of handling material and delivering chemicals in a timely need matter. A typical days job requires you to, cycle count weekly reagents, SAP transactions, working with buyers, planning weekly pick-ups with the vendor.Agilent is a good place to work and corporate management has secured a competitive edge in many of the products that are manufactured. The facilities are excellent.Acquired by Modis.  Talented and innovative technology professionals—and the companies they work for—drive today's rapidly evolving IT industry. At Modis, we help the industry continue to advance by connecting the best tech talent with the most rewarding companies—creating a win-win situation.Agilent is a solid company with good prospects.  They have made some good business moves in the divestitures.  The management is experienced and and seem to be executing on a good strategy.I thoroughly enjoyed my position and the interfacing with other division people that went along with my responsibilities.  An excellent place to seek employment.Great job which involves sales of chemical analysis equipment. The job entails calls and faxes to get service contracts. For the equipment that we sell and make the quota each month for total revenue.I was fresh out of college when I started at Agilent and the team took me on with open arms.  This was a great place to learn and develop my career, as the entire company was welcoming and helpful.Though the work itself can become a little tedious, this is a wonderful place to work. The culture at agilent is amazing, and all of the employees are always ready to help with anything.The variety of work assignments for this position made it an interesting and dynamic job.  There was always something new to learn and manage, whether it was information driven or technology driven.  The diversity of assignments and the opportunity to work with a global team made it a great experience.Not competitive in today's market, claims wants to be a leader in the life sciences arena. Has a long way to go!I love my job my job with Agilent and look forward to many years of employment within the company. The company has a great work life balance..Good company to work for with a nice, clean, temperature controlled environment with a good work/life balance. Competitive and comparable salaries and benefits to other companies in the area.productive and fun workplace with ping pong tableI had a great work life balanceGreat coworkers and work environmentHaving too many levels in organization, slow pace, silo culture.Agilent is making good move to change the business environments to words chemical devices. that seems where the future going.Typical work day was taking service call from customers.  Equipment serviced was HP servers, storage units, disk arrays and network equipment.  It was a tuff job because of all the travel but a good experience over all.Agilent is a left behind branch of HP.  Its continuous struggle to modernize it's culture is plagued by the old HP residual culture which supports large unaccountable layer of bureaucracy that suppresses innovative spirit.  Having a great idea is not good enough and often innovator is intimidated by those who is not accountable for any relevant task.  This company culture reminds me of communism, job security means 100% brown-nosing your superior and learn how to hide in plane site with lessez-fair.  Agilent needs new leadership blood, same people cannot improve its old culture because they don't know what to change to.  Agilent needs to redefine itself form ""Old HP"" image, it needs at least to be ""New HP"".Technical marketing was a rather laid back environment. It included supportive management and had a plethora of resources and mentors to help out with any questions, concepts, or issues. While I worked there most of the employees were probably in their 40's and up, and had families. Overall the company was enjoyable, but the work I did wasn't really something I wanted to continue doing.I love working for Agilent total respect for its managers and everything else. The harder I worked the more benefits I receieved.It is a great company to work with if you have already developed a career.

Requests would come in on daily basis from multiple clients and a queue manager would assign them out based on availability.The people who work for ServiceNow are amazing.  Highly intelligent, hard working, and team supporting.  If you need help, they are there for you!The challenge is this:  Billable hours are the mantra in Professional Services.  You are constantly pushed to make your billable hours, but you have limited or no control over what is sold.  If you are not meeting your billable hours, which varies in requirements from quarter to quarter based on what Sales ""says"" they are going to close, you are constantly reminded that you have not met your quota.Though there is never an overt ""threat"" that you will be let go if you don't meet your hours, there are enough ""reminders"" that make you feel insecure.If you are technical at ServiceNow, this is not a problem.  There is always more than enough work.  If you are non-technical (process, organizational change, governance), this is a constant challenge.  ServiceNow, despite individual groups attempts to change the culture, is a ""Software House"" -- platform is king.The job always kept you on your toes, the best part being the communication and collaboration among team members.The level of transparency among the peers and managers is also worth praising.Working at ServiceNow is like drinking out of a fire house. Very bright folks. Everyone is driven and carries their own weight. Never a dull moment. Lots of restructuring making it difficult to have job security and advancement.Fast paced culture, going thru the typical growing pains, very good product development.

The culture is incredible and the product is solid. Im truly inspired regularly through working with different teams and collaborating on what can be done! I'd highly recommend working here:)ServiceNow is an excellent young company with potential.  If you are a valued member of ServiceNow your job is secured.  During my time here I have seen a lot of turnover in other departments.  You can be here one day and gone the next week. This is the only discouraging thing about SNC.I love this company and I love the people. They are by far the best people I've worked with after 15+ years in high tech. Everyone will roll up their sleeves and pitch in to help get the job done. People are open, honest and transparent (in my experience). By far the best company I've worked for in high tech - the benefits and pay are world class! I've learned what it really means to have a true team and see these people in action together. The hardest part of the job is learning a completely new SaaS platform around ITSM. There is also a lot of change here and if you don't handle change well, it may be tough for you. I personally deal with change really well so that's probably part of the reason I am so happy here. The most enjoyable part of my job has been working with such great people. My co-workers are the best!!Great company culture, dog-friendly, perks are amazing. Hands-on, collaborative work across departments. Have fun on a daily basis and above all get stuff done!Great company with high Growth. Excellent product line. The company is going into a transformation process to support new product lines and new startegies. Sometimes too US centric in startegies and decision making..Great place to work, people are amazing and some of the smartest people I have met. Only there for a 6 month contract.Training could have been better, and longer.  Got used to drinking from the firehose.Hardest part of the job was trying to keep up to requirements during training.Best part of the job was at 5pm I got to leave it until the next day.ServiceNow is a toxic culture where inexperienced management is trying to lead without having a vision or strategy...This may be well and good if they left the rank and file alone to do their jobs- unfortunately for all the employees management is constantly imposing their changing direction and capricious policies on them. There are little to no processes in the company and the Program management office lacks direction so nothing gets accomplished. Nice employees in general- high turnover rate as everyone is trying to get outSNOW is a great place to work.  The atmosphere lends itself to professional advancement.  SNOW was like my second home.  My collegues are people that I still share life with. Great for college graduates and expereiced professionals alike.Wonderful work life balance and great dev team and outstanding sales people. Great benefits and pay. Executive Team top notchAwesome leadership and vision. The product is one that you can be confident in, and truly represents a next level of service for the United States Government. The Federal team is experienced, driven, and highly successful. The market is receptive and the team has made some significant movement forward in the last year alone.Company has grown too fast, infrastructure still needs a lot of work. Many employees confused as to who is responsible for what. Management tends to micro manage.Co-workers are friendly and helpful, learned a lot about ITSM, hardest part of the job was how quickly management expects you to ramp up without assistance.Hard time with work/life balance when you are traveling all over the world.ServiceNow provides you with all of the tools you need to succeed.

At the end of the call, we would email general information on the appropriate software vendors that would match their needs. We would then turn the notes we took on that call and sell it to the software vendors as a qualified lead for them to set up a webinar demo of their software.I learned how to stay patient with sales and look at the outcome of an entire quarter rather than focus on weekly or bi-weekly goals.Management was great at teaching you the necessary skills needed to perform well and they were patient to make sure you understood everything fully.I enjoyed the competitive environment, the above average pay, and the co-workers were all very responsible and hard working.The hardest part of the job was the monotony. The calling process was aggressive, calling prospects up to six times a day from different phone numbers.Software Advice is a great place to work. It's also a hard place to work.

Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop.

175,1579.0,Data Scientist 1,The Clorox Company,4.1,290.0,"It was a fast job you had 2 move real fast and keep up. Good personality up there but they really do care about you up i liked the job.They look down on the good workers and praise the lazy workers. They believe that whatever they wanted to do was ok, didn't really care too much about how the workers feel. Didn't appreciate the hard work and dedication I put in.Load and unload trucks with forklifts, pallet jacks, or cherry pickers with Clorox products. Conducted inventory control. Managed and reviewed customer orders/requests and manually enter data of orders.Coordinated with shipper’s customer service representatives on exceptions, rush orders and order changes.It was easy money. No one on your back. laid back supervisors. Great environment clean enviornment. Really enjoyed my time there keep count of your pointsIt's an ok place to work. I moved while I was working there so the commute turned into a hassle for me. 82 miles 1 way. Not their fault.When working 4 10s a week I put up with it because I had 3 days off.Then my hours changed to 4 9s M-Th  and 4 hrs. on Friday. I tried it for about 3 months but after a while the 164 mile round trip wore on me so I put in my notice.The Clorox Company is an excellent place to work.  There is a perfect work / life balance. Good atmosphere, Safe environment, Excellent health benefits.Clorox (unlike any other company) has a positive, engaging and inspiring work environment.  You can work hard but you can also find time to play. Management encourages you to learn more and to consider advancement.  Excellent place to work but benefits are not offered to everyone.It is a traditional company with more than 100 years of history.  To advance in this company, one needs to be in the ""in group"" with the few senior managers.Keeping all safety procedures and rules enforced. Stocking and handling hazardous chemicals.  Very busy tidy work place, always new employees.The day always starts off good at Clorox. There are lots of people with different backgrounds and ages who are there to help anyone that just started the job. The thing that i loved most about this job was that they always had things for you to do. I learned that Clorox does not only ship clorox products but others as well, and that taught me once again uu cant judge a book my its cover.  At this job i also learned more about my personality as well as my future. Because the job had many people  that i got to meet and grew alone with them, I had a better understanding of what life is really about.Its a very good first job for new comers. It definitely prepared me for a warehouse workplace. The pay rate started off fair, and became excellent after a while. I liked it. My co-workers were the best.Wonderful work life balance, managers are very knowledgeable.  Work is always challenging and exciting. Co-workers are always pleasant and engaging.Unfortunately, the plant closed. I enjoyed my time working for Clorox. I learned a lot and felt like I truly contributed to the company. The pay was great and I loved the hours. I appreciated how safety conscience the plant was.It's not one of the best places to work but if you need something fast it's ag guaranteed job but the hardest part of the job is standing in the heat for that long it's a lot of drama there sothe Lee's you talk the Less you talk to people the betterClorox cares for their employees and that is shown through the people you work with. The people you work with here are irreplaceable. The culture and work environment are outstanding.Good company, a fun place to work.  A ton of visibility to upper level management.  Very friendly work environment, I would recommend.  They compensate the interns very well.I love working at Clorox and would continue if I could pursue my ideal role from my current location.   Unfortunately, such an opportunity does not exist in my current location. Next steps for me would mean continued heavy travel and / or another move for my family and me.My first job was at The Clorox Company, and they do great job of teaching you how to transition from college to a work environment. A typical day deals with a lot of meetings, phone calls, and some lab time. Most managers are strong people developers who truly want you to succeed. Coworkers are friendly and the work environment promotes collaboration allowing you to talk to anyone at any level at any time. The hardest part of the job is that when you're in a position you have to stay in that position for about 2 years before they will rotate you. Most enjoyable part of the job is how rewarding it is to see the products you've worked on in stores.Great place all co workers treated you like family. Learned so much while working there. Great benefits from helping you out with school and time off if needed.Worked as a team member. Ran machinery, assembly, and fork truck. There was only one other women on the shift that I worked at so I missed getting to talk to someone that had the same interests as I did. I had a hard time sleeping during the day because I had  sons at home at that time. The lack of sleep really got the best of me.Need to be able to work independently and with others that included diverse leadership styles to include:Extreme detailed, clear written and oral communication skills, taking ownership of a project from beginning to end, define current and future processes, work in an extremely fast pace environment, high quantity and quality of work needed","5,001 to 10,000",Palo-Alto,Pleasanton,CA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/a4001451-22ef-4124-b429-1d8f85feb58b?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=2,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

177,1581.0,Aster Presales Data Scientist,Teradata Corporation,3.7,38.0,"Working at Teradata introduced me to working in a fast pace office setting by teaching me how to handle stress and meeting deadlines and special projects without impacting my work quality or professional demeanor.Overall, Teradata is a great company to work for during my time there.  Unfortunately the division I was working for was sold and there was a reduction in force.If you aren't hired in as management you won't get good raises and the bonuses have decreased dramatically over the years. Training isn't a regular issue here and if you get any it must be on your own time. They offer virtual jobs, so this is the only true perk to Teradata.It seems the corporate policy is to hire at a low income and keep it low with very small annual raises if you even get a raise.Teradata Corporation is a proven leader in its field of data warehousing, with very effective personnel staffed throughout from entry level up through the executive suite. In my part of the organization (sales and marketing), there is a heavy reliance on a national / international network of far-flung resources, many who work remotely from their homes.As such, the culture is based around multiple daily conference calls and heavy use of email. It makes for a great work-life balance, and yet our productivity as a company proves that people remain focused on executing their responsibilities with focus and rigor.The hardest part of life at Teradata for me, however, has been the company's very flat structure and limited opportunities for career advancement and growth. Compensation is relatively competitive, though, which serves as a partial offset.Voted one of the best 25 companies to work for.Teradata Labs, the company's development arm, is based in San Diego (approx 1,500 employees)...with approx 10,000 employees worldwide.Bad Company. they don't care for their Employees. No Extra pay For Extra Hours worked. No Assistence provide for any Certifications. Higher Management is never reachable.My day consists of updating our current ERP system by fixing code, writing new code, testing, and creating Oracle forms. On top of upgrading the ERP system, I support the current system by helping the business users solve errors or problems they come across. My manager is great. He's very laid back as long as our work is completed in the time it's allocated to. Upper management could be better but still good people. The hardest part of my job is juggling all the work that's given to me in a given day. We are a $5 Billion company and our ERP team only consists of 14 people. Between supporting the current system and upgrading to Oracle E-business suite R12, time has to be managed well. The most enjoyable part of the job is staying busy.Responsible tracking and auditing travel & expenses for over 30 countries globally which is cultrally interesting and challenging. We have a good group of people and great contacts within the other department internally and globally. Hardest part is at times the language barrier, but we work with it and in the end it works. But, this can also be the most enjoyable, learning about all other parts of the world. All in all a great company!The company is great but going through changes, not all changes are good though. The management is a bit older and can find it hard to relate to the younger workers.Good technology, great coworkers. Lots of new strategic acquisitions in the big data space. Long work days due to large account base.Company trying to move in new direction.  Making the right decisions to shed low return assets.Lots of very good technology.The people I worked with are some of the smartest I have ever known. Managers are the best I have had the plaesure to work for.challenged with Hadoop and Cloud analytics offerings -> slow to no growth;  would be best to merge/ sell company;  selling marketing analytics is only firs step..Teradata has been one of the best companies I have worked for.  The people are outstanding.  I love what I do and I hope to carry this love for financial planning and analysis to my next employment.Great history but currently transitioning to a SaaS world and struggling.  Most likely an acquisition target at this point.The project I am working on Marketing Analysis application. A great team to work with and exposure to lots of technology within the big data Marketing Analytic.If you have a decent managers in the office, things will be good, if you don't its gonna make your work life suffer, don't expect much.  There is a park near by that you can scream atthe end of your work day but its closed during the winter.  Most managers in IT seem rather level headed, but something is changing in the air.I enjoy working here at Teradata.  However, I feel that I have reached my full potential and fell there is no longer any advancement for me here.Interesting company. Gone through a lot of changes since I worked there.Great company to work for and management sets the goals and let its people perform the work.  Company provide the tools to accomplish what they ask of its people.Across the board, Teradata, its culture, its vision and values, its excellent employees ranked highest in my work experience.",,Palo-Alto,San Jose,CA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/1208c3de-9fe0-42cd-8042-cf43eab5fd9c?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

I learned first set of skills on my career path and get involved with state of art technologies. Work & life balance here is fantastic, our work is usually well scheduled that most of us find comfortable working here.Great work space and awesome co-workersWorked with Adobe ElementsManagement was great, let you do your own thingGreat Co-workers still associate with them todayNever experience anything hard about my job, if I had to say anything it was trying to get things out on timeLoved that I had my own office and never over workedGreat experience for the resume but little opportunity for career growth. The annual reorganizations confuse corporate strategy and are very disruptive to productivity.Your peers will help the best they can, but management doesn't spend any time onboarding the knowledge you need for your position. Management also doesn't spend any resources furthering your knowledge with Adobe Solutions or the industry. Their is a wiki, but it is poorly managed. Good luck finding the tools you need to actiquitedly do your job.Fun and Innovative place to work with great benefits including high quality cafeteria and gym.Everyone there is willing to take time to meet with you.Efficiency in sales, multi-tasking, and endurance is a must. The environment, management, and flexible hours for education are amazing. This job is not for the light of heart. Retention is low due to excessive stress and mental capacity required of the representative.The business was great, the customers were great, the employees were great, but the management didn't pay me as a manager, even though I got promoted as one.I worked for an amazing HR specialist and she taught me so many skills to take with me. They were very encouraging and motivated me with everything I've done.Adobe is a great company to work for. It not only offers good benefits but also has a wonderful culture. I was given a real project with real responsibility and was able to sink my teeth into the day-to-day life of this career. The pay was great, the benefits are great and everyone I worked with, from interns to senior executives, were lovely. A great place to work.Receiving calls and taking care of customers.  Multitudes of different computer programs to assist and complete customers requests.  The management is lacking in this business not very professional as to say the least.  Co-workers are the balance between management and daily duties.  They are what makes working for a company worthwhile and what making comes to work satisfying.  The hardest part of the job is to have to listen to people yelling, using profanity and being expected to take it as part of the job.  Not being able to interrupt and let the other person know you are here to help and to try and assist to the best of your ability.  The most enjoyable part is when a customer compliments you on a good job and making certain they have the best experience necessary to have them return to your company and the company acknowledging how wonderful you are doing with the company.  It's not always easy but colleagues as well as those wonderful customers makes it a joy to go to work and do the best that you can possibly do and go home at the end of the day with a smile on your face and a song in your heart for a job well done.It is a great place to work.  I enjoy the co-workers and also the job.  There is free soda on tap.  There is also a gym that you could work out.  It is a relaxing place to work and they try to make you feel comfortable.Security enior Program Manager responsible for maintaining and updating existing and new Knowledge Management systems and processes in support of more thanWorking with great people on interesting campaigns is at the heart of Adobe's culture.  Managers are usually accessible and often work side-by-side with their teams.  Co-workers keep everything interesting.The hardest part of the job is determining where to put one's energy, as there are continual streams of new technologies and methodologies to explore.The best part of the job is, again, the sense that everyone is working together for a greater good.i hate that i have to enter this same review multiple time because the system identifies this as another job.. I worked there for about 5 years i outlined the in my resume however the system doesn't recognize duplicate entriesI've worked here for over 10 years and LOVE it. I've always had great co-workers and work with very smart people.  The company has a lot of benefits for the employees and their families.Adobe is a great place, great people, and excellent work/life balance.The atmosphere is mature. It is common to see that a large number of employees have been there 10, 15, 20 years and have no intention of moving to any other company. Everyone I met had great attitudes and energy and were pleasant to be around. Working at this company was truly a unique experience.I really liked the company and the products. I did not like my manager because she was extremely liberal and feminist and forced her beliefs down my throat. Overall, I was unlucky to be on the team I was placed on, but the company was great and I would have loved to switch to a different team and remain with Adobe.Workload really depends on the team and position.Adobe has great company perks like the gym and free software products for employees.Beautiful, fun place to work, great work space, great benefits, nice people to work with, wonderful atmosphere, excellent cafeteria and gymProgressive and leading edge in Software development. Very much Employees oriented company. A great company to work for. I would love to come back to Adobe systems.A great place to work, but the workload is heavy compared to other companies I've worked at making work/life balance more difficult to achieve.The people (very professional and friendly) and work environment (very clean) and small perks such as Peets coffee and healthy snacks are the best attributes in my experience.I was able to gain some new valuable skills in a short time there and made some great new connections within the team and with other teams.Inter-team communication is very good.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,San Jose,CA,2016-11-05T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/57fbc508-d8bb-4b54-aa94-8938b3fdb01b?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Good personality up there but they really do care about you up i liked the job.They look down on the good workers and praise the lazy workers. They believe that whatever they wanted to do was ok, didn't really care too much about how the workers feel. Didn't appreciate the hard work and dedication I put in.Load and unload trucks with forklifts, pallet jacks, or cherry pickers with Clorox products. Conducted inventory control. Managed and reviewed customer orders/requests and manually enter data of orders.Coordinated with shipper’s customer service representatives on exceptions, rush orders and order changes.It was easy money. No one on your back. laid back supervisors. Great environment clean enviornment. Really enjoyed my time there keep count of your pointsIt's an ok place to work. I moved while I was working there so the commute turned into a hassle for me. 82 miles 1 way. Not their fault.When working 4 10s a week I put up with it because I had 3 days off.Then my hours changed to 4 9s M-Th  and 4 hrs. on Friday. I tried it for about 3 months but after a while the 164 mile round trip wore on me so I put in my notice.The Clorox Company is an excellent place to work.  There is a perfect work / life balance. Good atmosphere, Safe environment, Excellent health benefits.Clorox (unlike any other company) has a positive, engaging and inspiring work environment.  You can work hard but you can also find time to play. Management encourages you to learn more and to consider advancement.  Excellent place to work but benefits are not offered to everyone.It is a traditional company with more than 100 years of history.  To advance in this company, one needs to be in the ""in group"" with the few senior managers.Keeping all safety procedures and rules enforced. Stocking and handling hazardous chemicals.  Very busy tidy work place, always new employees.The day always starts off good at Clorox. There are lots of people with different backgrounds and ages who are there to help anyone that just started the job. The thing that i loved most about this job was that they always had things for you to do. I learned that Clorox does not only ship clorox products but others as well, and that taught me once again uu cant judge a book my its cover.  At this job i also learned more about my personality as well as my future. Because the job had many people  that i got to meet and grew alone with them, I had a better understanding of what life is really about.Its a very good first job for new comers. It definitely prepared me for a warehouse workplace. The pay rate started off fair, and became excellent after a while. I liked it. My co-workers were the best.Wonderful work life balance, managers are very knowledgeable.  Work is always challenging and exciting. Co-workers are always pleasant and engaging.Unfortunately, the plant closed. I enjoyed my time working for Clorox. I learned a lot and felt like I truly contributed to the company. The pay was great and I loved the hours. I appreciated how safety conscience the plant was.It's not one of the best places to work but if you need something fast it's ag guaranteed job but the hardest part of the job is standing in the heat for that long it's a lot of drama there sothe Lee's you talk the Less you talk to people the betterClorox cares for their employees and that is shown through the people you work with. The people you work with here are irreplaceable. The culture and work environment are outstanding.Good company, a fun place to work.  A ton of visibility to upper level management.  Very friendly work environment, I would recommend.  They compensate the interns very well.I love working at Clorox and would continue if I could pursue my ideal role from my current location.   Unfortunately, such an opportunity does not exist in my current location. Next steps for me would mean continued heavy travel and / or another move for my family and me.My first job was at The Clorox Company, and they do great job of teaching you how to transition from college to a work environment. A typical day deals with a lot of meetings, phone calls, and some lab time. Most managers are strong people developers who truly want you to succeed. Coworkers are friendly and the work environment promotes collaboration allowing you to talk to anyone at any level at any time. The hardest part of the job is that when you're in a position you have to stay in that position for about 2 years before they will rotate you. Most enjoyable part of the job is how rewarding it is to see the products you've worked on in stores.Great place all co workers treated you like family. Learned so much while working there. Great benefits from helping you out with school and time off if needed.Worked as a team member. Ran machinery, assembly, and fork truck. There was only one other women on the shift that I worked at so I missed getting to talk to someone that had the same interests as I did. I had a hard time sleeping during the day because I had  sons at home at that time. The lack of sleep really got the best of me.Need to be able to work independently and with others that included diverse leadership styles to include:Extreme detailed, clear written and oral communication skills, taking ownership of a project from beginning to end, define current and future processes, work in an extremely fast pace environment, high quantity and quality of work needed","5,001 to 10,000",Palo-Alto,Pleasanton,CA,2016-08-26T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/f636c4a2-c285-407b-94fe-430db75ad819?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=14,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

I enjoyed interning at VMware also because of the great project planning experience I acquired through my internship.Very beautiful work environment, great cafeterias, happy people. Tides shifting due to Dell/ EMC merger causing big budget cuts and business re-structuring.A growing company with a lot of talent employees.A rapid growth company.Glad to share the adventure with the rest of the employees.Great team work.It's a life, work balance company.Most talent leaves due to the chaos of the environment due to poor management. Great coworkers great company and leading edge technology otherwiseTypical day starts with scrum call with offshore team members, followup any action items. Attend status meetings with release teams, work with team members on various project efforts related to testing, automation, and working with the other segments of the scrum.awesome benefits and incredible career launching pad for young professionals. A ton of product information to learn but self-paced video and online training program makes it's easy to keep up.Good team work.Management was nice.Due to diversity in culture the company hosted different festivals of different culture which was fun.spacious workplace and good parking spotstoo large of an org for them to focus on smaller groups. innovation lacks . A lot of buyouts and merges and aquisitions .Work culture is good but not appreciated for work that you do .I am looking for a challenging and interesting position in a growing environment.Working in the company should be fun and use my skill and experienceCheck numerous incoming emails, schedule daily work and prioritize accordingly, meet with supervisor, attend meetings to take notes, publish notes according to manager's needs; highlight action items with time commitments, answer calls, filing, work on projects outstanding, schedule meetings for the managers, check manager's emails and print out as needed, create project files for follow-up.What I learned was to be self-motivated and independent worker according to the needs of management and projects. Keep ongoing priorities log for reporting purposes. A highly multi-tiered management structure with a moving organization according to business changes and needs. It was necessary to have great co-worker communication and participation skills at all times. The most difficult part of this job was the amount of walking to be done between buildings while the business changed and grew rapidly. There were over eight other offices spread out on several city blocks until the campus was consolidated. We used golf carts and bicycles to make the time more convenient into one large campus. It was necessary to attend all meetings and obtain instructions and information from your manager. There were company-wide software tools to learn, that didn't always parallel or match standard industry practice but mostly useful to the company. We produced many PowerPoint organization charts for the continuous change and growth especially at meetings large or small.I worked diligently to meet and resolve employee issues with the Travel & Expense process so that reimbursements took place timely  more... for both employee and for accounting. There was a huge backlog of expenses that employees refused to use the existing system, until I was able to provide a usable training program that refined the process. I gave class training and worked one-on-one until the backlog was resolved, Afterwards I was assigned to a different  department within the company.I really enjoyed the company philosophy to grow and train their employees with higher level education or seminars. The employees were given many perks such as onsite organic snacks and drinks, local exercise classes and gym, to name a few. I felt the company valued their employees and supported them especially with invited family celebrations throughout the year. Product launches and celebrations were the norm and happened frequently to keep company morale high and focused. Families were recognized as important part of the employee's life such as during pregnancy or needed time off, a sufficient program for Family Leave was instituted.  lessGood place to start career. It has good reputation, relatively high salary and good intern programs. I wish I could work with it after graduate.Great people, smart ideas, good cultural foundation, but clumsy acquisition and new strategy implementation makes cross functional organizational operations unsteady.Each day at VMW brings with it new challenges which motivates a person to continuously improve and grow from a career perspective. There are multiple opportunities provided for those who would like to expand their skill sets through programs set up specifically targeted for self development.Work life balance is a challenge, however the people that I work with makes it that much more enjoyable.VMware is a great company as a full time permanent employee.  If you are contract employee you are treated as such.  You do not receive the same benefits as a full time employee but are expected to perform and follow all the same requirements as a full time employee.VMware was incredibly flexible and very strong in terms of benefits. Well respected technology and a comprehensive solution suite.Really good company to work for.  Micromanagement is a problem in some groups (like everywhere).  Executive management is great, but Sr. and middle management not so hot.I can take up any job as challenging .I will complete all the work on time .Once i give them commitment .It Will be done before the deadline based on the commitmentThe environment is GREAT and the people are great. There are a lot of project to challenge one and I learned a lot from the projects. The training culture of the company is GREAT as well.There is no typical day as we refine and change business plan according to new market developments, emerging competitive threats and technology required for execution.  At any given time, I could be forecasting market growth, understanding target markets to understating how the technology works and how we can use it to our advantage.  Thinking of the possible is an every day thing -- while trying to develop the financials and models that make it successful -  business models, sensitivity analysis, financial analysis, international expansion plans,etc. Most enjoyable part of work is seeing the strategy turn into execution and finally, delivery of resultsVMware is hands down the best company I have had the opportunity to work for in the 20+ years I have spent in HR and Recruiting. The top reason being that this company really believes in working smarter than harder and the flexibility you are trusted with to do your job in the best way you know how make you feel valued from day one.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,Palo Alto,CA,2016-10-26T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/4d87c586-f781-425a-935d-2e2f0a889ce6?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

202,1606.0,Data Analytics Developer,Samsung SDSA,3.9,10.0,"strong Korean culture is something that can be adjusted a little as a global company. respectful relationship between upper management and subordinates.I was a contractor when for a 1 month project after 3 weeks staying at Samsung my Supervisor decided to hire me a contractor Helpdesk Technician. until after 1.5 yrs, i got promoted to be come a system administrator / service deck specialist.You experience different things, experienced different task that can help you improve your skillsyour team are very friendly and they motivate you to improve and challenge yourself to do better.Best: Work independently and proper training.Worst: Very long contract position, I was not offered salary and benefits when they told me I would.I have worked with Samsung SDS for more than 5 years. I managed all Technology solutions and a team of 10 support technicians and engineers for their North American and Canadian Contact Centers. I managed multiple simultaneous customer projects for local center improvements as well as call flow and applications support and changes. Our team is responsible for monitoring real-time operations as well as Data Center services.Environment is professional, many stuff to learn since you are responsible for most of the things, flexibility to do home office, sometimes working hours exceeded 12 hrs a day as per project requires.Good people with a od company culture; very strong job security!It has been very energetic working environment with good leadership and challenging projects...The typical day at work consists of a lot of excel work. I manage 3 Warehouses (where the Samsung products are stored and shipped out of) so I run my daily batch reports with the new loads that shipped out the day before. I am in charge of making sure that the carrier's invoice is matched with what Samsung is saying it should be -- based on the contract. Within 10 months with the company, I was chosen by my manager to join and lead a group of people for a special logistics project. After 2 months of hardcore training, the project fell through due to complications with the headquarters. The group that I was supposed to lead were fortunate enough to transfer over to different departments and I am now helping with other miscellaneous tasks within the office -- more report analysis/reporting to my manager. The hardest part of this job is that I feel that there is no opportunity to advance. Because of Samsung's cultural background, I feel that work ethic and performance cannot provide the advancement and reward that any hard working employee should receive. I will always be grateful for the amazing opportunity to work for a Fortune 500 Company right after undergrad, but I believe that any hardworking individual should be rewarded. It is going to be really hard to leave my co-workers behind as they have been there to guide and assist me with reports, daily work, or simply everyday-life-advice. I will always remember my daily 3:30PM walks with my department girls. In summary, I believe that my hard work ethic and ability to exceed expectations should be recognized and  more... rewarded.  lessResearching cutting edge technologiesCommunication between USA and KoreaDiversified employeesOffices in San Jose and New JerseyA typical day was mostly attending support tickets to fix bugs in the application.

217,1621.0,"Applications Scientist, Bioproduction and Development",pall corporation,3.4,115.0,"I worked in a microbiology lab where where i validated drugs from pharmaceutical companies for their antibacterial properties. I learned more about microbiology lab than i did in college. I partook in interviews and building the team for the lab. The dynamic between myself and my coworkers facilitated the completion of our assignments. Hardest part of the job is meeting the time framed that has been put in placed while trying to validate a drug that became unpredictable. I enjoyed the company of my coworkers on and off work.Worked part time for this company. Rude and unprofessional.  No respect between employees and management. Employees have no respect for each other.  Employees do what they want! Needs Management to step up to the plate and Manager each department. HR really needs to get involved and resolve many issues.Micro Managed by a bully, my advice is stay far away until they figure out he is the problem - people don't quit the company they quit the manager and this guy is why I quit along with a ton of other managers.company is good. pay is good. people are good. management should be little better. the overtaking of Danaher is bad, its making people loose job. Pay is good but could be better.Purging previous years' invoices to make room for the current years' invoices,  placing purged invoices  in alpha/numeric order, placing them in the archives. Training for SAT was sporadic, some coworkers were memorable.There was plenty of work to keep you busy threw the night. Co-workers were enjoyable to be around. Management was exceptional. Plenty of hours to get over time.Tight Security at the compoundLearned about the Japanese culture, Workshops provided to help you get acclimated to the environmentSales and Marketing trainingNice company to work forPall gave me the opportunity to enter the Quality Control Career and working with great team members I was able to acquire skills to further my career.Typical manufacturing shop.   good group of guys, some worked, some slept. Management restructured often, which left everyone running around cause no one knew anything. Promised training to advance and increase pay, never happened. Boss had his favorites, and was a slug.The Job was not that bad but everything was built in house. No parts were ever there.. most of the stuff was made in house and still not on the shelf..I develop new membranes or methods out of new materials. In this work, high inventive and technical skills are necessary combined with quick adaption to problems. Additionally, collaboration between groups (chemistry/development) is essential.Critical thinking and time management are important to decide when a research idea is not feasible.Worked as a shipping/receiving clerk and learned more of receiving/shipping process. Management worked well with its co-workers. Co-workers worked well together as a team. Most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers.This Place is a Joke! They only hire people without experience. A typical work day is watching everyone walk around and gossip. you are not trained properly. Management have their favorites, and have no idea what they are doing. Co-workers are Phony. The hardest part of the job was not getting rewarded for your hard work. The most enjoyable part of the job was the day I left. Well since they just sold the place I'm sure it will not last to much longer. Good Luck!Business is business Pall Corporation is a outstanding Corporation.Long working hours for everyone but overtime is a plus unless you are salary based.I learned we have great hard working people in great places.My coworkers are one of the greatest part of working at Pall.The hardest part of the job is working long hours for overtime to make what is annually promised to me, which leaves me with no  life balance.The most enjoyable part of the job is to hear my supervisors complimenting my hard work and dedication does not go unnoticed.If all you want is mandatory overtime and loss of winter shutdown due to management keeping an impossible production schedule. Then this is the place for you. I have never been in a company that thought so badly of management, that the day I started training I was told to run as fast as I can and never look back.Annual raises are measley and it doesn't matter if you slack off or work hard.  They are the same for just about everyone.They give you a ""promotion"" by changing your title and increasing the work load with hardly any pay increase.Help me get out of here!Fast pace work with heavy machines that curragate pleats in materials to develops industrial filters. Worked with a great group of people. The management style was open and flexible to all.  The hardest part of the day was during inventory checks and the most enjoyable part was when inventory check was completed.The Port Washington site is an amazing facility. Both the people and the architecture are continually inspiring creative thinking. Engineers and scientists are continually encouraged to generate ideas for inventions as part of performance reviews and all ideas are considered in making products that wow customers. Overall, it is a great company for the advancing engineer.Pall Corporation demands a professional work environment, and it's employees largely adhere to these standards willingly. Work amenities are well above-average. Stock program, 401k, Health Benefits are all high quality.There has been an ongoing organizational restructure for the past three years which makes nearly every employee's position transient. The nature of a transitional environment leads to job insecurity, and issues adhering to long-term organizational goals. This has subsequently hurt the creation of a true team-oriented work environment, due to employee's fears of losing their own occupations, and the revolving-door nature of the organizational charts.Pall is a good place to work if you are self sufficient and are able to understand dynamics. Not sure what lies ahead for Pall but I suppose it could be good for some.  They have a great work/life balance as long as you do your job.Great place to work. I learned a lot of skills that will help me with my future. Management team communicates well, but could be better with the directives.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,Sunnyvale,CA,2016-11-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/c3a60a72-d695-44fc-8ea6-b55999beb696?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=9,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The benefits are also awesome and they have a good work life balance. The free food is excellent, lots of choices, healthy and tasty.Yahoo! is a great company to work for.Great benefits and perks, the culture is awesome, and there's always lots to do.I would recommend this company to everyone!Amazing place to work if you don't mind a lottery style management system. The coworkers and work place was amazing, at least when I worked there, but hey lay offs and cut backs can diminish a place. I felt challenged on the job and successes were meaningful as you helped to turn businesses successful.Changing metrics turned it from an interesting place to work into a grindhouse.Metrics changed months after I was hired.The highest paid ""non-essential"" staff was let go.Help to support Yahoo customers via chat and email support only. We were doing phone support but that has been downsized.I worked as a contractor at Yahoo, and only for the amopunt of time that Yahoo limits for contractors. Because of my technical background I also got involved in creating pages for mobile search.Yahoo interviewed me for full-time employment because of my high productivity/output, it did not go through, however, because of the proximity in time to the lay-off in 2016 for which the people interviewing had no knowledge was going to happen.Work/Life balance leans much more on the Work side. Nearly everyone you work with is passionate about what they do and are supportive of each other. The people are what make the environment enjoyable.Typical day: Constant flow of requests for various design either pre-sales or post-sales that SHOULD have a one week turn around due date but have to be done in a day. Two at the most. A typical workload would be about 5 projects at the same time. Dealing with sales and tech AND the big client.management: All the designers are managers. Always begin a project with a kick off call; including the necessary team from other properties and verticals. From beginning til deliverable or launch date.hardest part: short deadlines or if the client isn't being fast in their responses and excess number of changes.enjoyable part: getting it done without a hitchWas a fantastic workplace for the first 3 years. The last year has been very depressing and seeing half the company get laid off was very disheartening. All so board members could take home a fatter paycheck.When I joined the company, there were great people, a ton of industry leading technology, and a sense of camaraderie as we tried to turn around an industry icon.Unfortunately, Yahoo never figured out its ""one thing"".  The one constant at the company was no product was ever finished.  Yahoo had a ""ship and forget"" mentality, and across all of the CEOs I worked for that never changed.Despite all of this, I really enjoyed my experience there.  It was a fantastic training ground for learning how to execute in challenging and dysfunctional environments.  Those product leaders who could work well with others, fight without ego, and drive towards a common goal were able to deliver despite everything else going on.Few other places offer the scale, impact and global reach of the products we worked on.  However, the past year has shown a significant, and fatal, decline in leadership, culture, and opportunity.Workplace with lot of opportunities to work on systems of large scale spanning several key areas. I had a chance to work with several intellectuals at this organization",,Palo-Alto,Sunnyvale,CA,2016-09-03T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/c9236de0-4d6d-4f70-9098-a7aeb298c480?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

229,1633.0,"Scientist, Antibody Engineering",Theranos,3.5,18.0,"enjoyed my time with this company, typical work week. Management was great, fun co-workers. great job over all now I am on to better opportunities.I liked working for this company. I was involved in many projects and they had technology new to me. Unfortunately legal lssues made this company lay off many employees.Theranos has a start-up feel to the company and many people have to opportunity to create and engage in projects that they may have never done before. I have grown as a laboratory professional greatly from the experience Theranos has provided me.This job was a great job for entry level applicants and provided experience and advancement to my career. The upper management recognized potential and grows the people that showed drive.The environment was positive and we worked together to help each other succeed.  The typical day included performing venipuncture techniques to collect samples from guests, and preparing them for lab analysis.  The position was very enjoyable and management was very supportive.Good work culture. Nice place to work. Start up culture, very talented people highly motivate and product driven company. 9:00AM-6:30PM official work hoursWorking with Theranos had a great environment and great co-workers. I would gladly work with them again if operation in Arizona took place. I appreciated what my supervisor did as for his job incorporated. He was a great supervisor.By-far this has been the best company I have worked for. The employees here are amazing! A group of people who want to show up to work each day to provide the best experience for our guests and help in every way we can.unfortunately to secretive and lied to so many people.  Should have been a great thing for the patients who could have benefited from this fabulous thingI love the fact that my employer is an understanding one.  I go to school and they work with me on that.  I really appreciate everything they do.  Great place to work.This company is a high demand company that challenges you every day. It is a high energy culture with great people to work with and competitive benefits and pay.Sit in a room all day with nothing to do. Very low volume for patients. Favortism shown by management. No room for advancement.This is a great company with a lot of potential. But management shows favoritism towards individuals and it greatly noticed. The hours are constantly changing and over time is mandatory. You sit by yourself in a room for 8-12 hours. You are lucky to get 1 day off. Youdon't have a life while working here. On a positive note the pay is decent. You get to be part of a new and expanding company and interact with lots of different people.The company does not communicate well. There is basically no room for advancement and they hire in batches. There are no ""coworkers"" you work alone inside a room and your lucky to see 5 patients a day.  The hardest part of the job is sitting in a room for nine hours six days a week literally doing nothing productive.Very good company to work with and they provide free food breakfast, lunch and dinner.People here are very nice and creative, the working environment is also very energetic. However, the management team doesn't always have a clear goal and makes some bad decisions.Commute is too far. Should be an excellent company to grow with if their management is more professional, not too much political issues.Long shifts, six some times seven days a week. Decent pay but, no room to grow. Sit in a room alone with nothing to do, lucky to see 5 patients a day.",201 to 500,Palo-Alto,Palo Alto,CA,2016-08-18T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/9ff40f4e-2911-4071-bc73-d4729c629587?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=21,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

232,1636.0,Director Biostatistics,Pharmacyclics,2.8,14.0,"No longer the company that I was happy at a few years back.  Lots of Micromanagement from the new management.  Poor culture and bullying going on within different groups.Extremely supportive managers provided guidance as well as pushed us to succeed all while promoting team work. It was evident from the start that the company cared for your well being.I accepted a position moved my family out here after a less than stellar interview. I was promised that they would make up the lower pay rapidly with job promotion if I produced results. Within less than six months I had senior directors thanking me for the stellar job. The promised promotion to make up for the loss I took, never happened and over a year later never will happen.Line managers lie to your face, gossip behind your back, spread inconsistencies ( aka lies), and talk to other try to hunt down personal information to manipulate. This is appalling. Never have I seen this in a work environment to the degree. It is unprofessional boardering of discrimination lawsuits. I am just waiting to move on at a different company. Others have switched departments as frequent as every year just to get away for the rude and clueless upper management.Managers take credit for employee work. No class when it comes to talking to people. They just dont care. Culture does not promote  open communication. No growth, lack of promotion/raise unless you kiss-butt or are buddies with the manager.Fun, fast paced, great team and management. Recently acquired company, most enjoyable part was seeing everything come together on the Events team.Culture of fear. Lack of leadership at most levels. Not a fun place to work for most. Lots of people are leaving, which is why so many jobs are available. Expect more of this.Greatly improved since new management took over.  There are great people working there and the drug is amazing and doing great work.Was a great place to work. Very close to my house. I got to meet great people and they are still my friends. They had a company wide lay off after clinical trials failed.Great product--a home run.  Culture--Toxic.  Exec. Team lead through micromanagement, fear and intimidation.  Amateurs at building a collaborative, high performance team.  Very political.  Compensation and promotions are out of the blue no rhyme or reason.  If COO likes you and you suck up enough, you will have two promotions and large increases in one year.  Everyone can work their tail off and never get promoted.  Very uneven rewards and no recognition.  No work life balance.  It's all work.  Leaders are rude and they don't deserve the titles or compensation they have.Typical Day: Many meetings to set up and take down, up to 1-4 per day all between 11:30- 1, and upwards of 20+ attendees. What I learned:  I learned patience is all one has when dealing with crazy timelinesManagement: Management takes care of their own, they were all AMAZING.  Although in any place there may be some which can be difficult to please. Co-Workers:  Best co-workers ever, many whom will stay with you during rough seas.  Never saw so many people work as hard as they do, co-workers and the powers that be. Hard part of job: Seeing the stress on peoples faces, and wanting to do anything to help relieve their stress, but I am not a qualified scientist or Dr, so I would support in any way I could, especially by making sure they eat or drink to keep going.Enjoyable part of job:  The FDA approvals and the importance of their new drug Imbruvica.  It is extremely rewarding to be on that crazy train to see the end results.Everyone below Manager level is paid Hourly.This means half of the company..!Typical day usually requires some sort of testing whether it be KF, disso, assay/impurities, or GC. PCYC was willing to train me from the beginning so i learned everything from cGMP documentation, how to run LC's, to audit readiness, etc. Management in QC is excellent, other departments may vary. Colleagues in the Quality department are great. Teamwork is crucial. Hardest part of the job is getting over how urgent everything is. Everything always seems to be most urgent and due ASAP. The most enjoyable thing about the job is knowing my work has contributed to helping patients.Employees: stressed out and confusedManagement: arrogant, selfish and incompetentProjects: disorganized and un-realCulture: 'push you around', 'sink and drown',Questionable ethical standard, or lack thereof, and decisions made by untrained individuals.","501 to 1,000",Palo-Alto,Sunnyvale,CA,2016-07-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/36585b01-8cbb-47e1-8edd-cd71485e33fd?mescoid=1500153001001&jobPosition=24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

So, I can't really comment to much on the corporate workings, but it does appear everyone is happy.Managed, administered and maintained cost and requirements database.  Trained Users on the system.  Worked with military, government and contractor personnel.Advancement is a little tough with senior positions exclusively filled externally. Work life balance doesn't exist for field personnel.

We made sure that our products was made like how it was suppose to. At the end of the day it was great to see that we accomplish our goals.Great place to work.  Many things and options for employment.  Seeing things built in a manufacturing plant reminds one that we do still make things in the U.S.I was responsible for converting 2D product concepts into color 3D representations, as well as any 2D graphics, Video Editing or web design that is required to be completed. My boss is great to work with and has reasonable dead lines.I enjoyed my co-workers and boss It was the same thing everydayHardest part was my commuteI did not appreciate how being that this was a temp agency, managers had their favorites and if you are not known like that, you are likely to one of the last picked to go on an assignment. Maybe if an employee is absent or they don't have enough crew then you will get picked. I believe everyone deserves a fair chance.Fun, small company. Not sure how to culture has changed after SAIC buyout.""We help all people live healthy lives"" is what they claim to be their motto, but they left out the part UNLESS you are a BD employee. If you have car trouble and over an hour late it counts the same as night coming at all: so might as well just take an entire day.Work was not that hard but not flexible if you need time off for emergencies.Coworkers back stab so be careful who you trust.Pros it's Monday - Friday for MOST departments.The company got bought by SAIC and I made a good bit of money.

240,1644.0,Autonomous Vehicle Research Scientist - Technology Scouting,Ford,4.3,2300.0,"Enjoyed opportunity to self manage and work independently. The position of ""accounting specialist"" required travel through out the North and Southeast US. I enjoyed doing needs analysis in each of the auto dealerships and to customize the accounting software to meet the expectations  of dealership management.Days are normally 10 hrs day and 1st shift starts at 2 AM and sometimes last until 2 pm seven days a week. as a supervisor you must keep employees pumped up to get great production. The end result of good quality is always a plus.Loved the job. Wish I hadn't of messed up during my 30 day probation period. If I cannot find a better workplace before my yearly peiod to wait to reapply I plan on going back to work for TAC for sure!I liked working here. I was able to be able to do a little bit of everything. I helped out with the warranty department, I filed all thee paperwork form the previous days work as well as I was able to work with the guests and service advisers.Direct manager is not experienced enough for the role he stepped into witch desegregated work experience. made day to day very tedious and stressful. overall organization and owners we pleasantit been very nice and amazing job ,coworker really nice, every body know his or her job , the management really good and they always looking for new driver .Professionally patrolled to check for irregularities and to inspect protection devices and fire control equipment. Prepare logs and reports as required for informational purposes Respond to incidents of fire, medical emergency, bomb threat, flooding, inclement weather and other job related incidents.A very interesting, fun place to place.  As long as the work was getting done in a timely manner, you were free to talk while doing your work, which made the time go fast and streefree.db2 to write queries, business objects and crystal reports for reporting and opportunities to automate and/or improve an existing process.  Can make recommendations for action plans or streamlining to improve business performance.A very hard job . I found a niche in the paint department and did well . Because we had a strong Union we achieved advancements in pay and benefits.  With a bad economy in the Bush years the union lost power and the worker doing my job today is making the same money that I made in 2002 . The benefits have been eroding also . The retirees are paying higher prices on the benefits that they earned and have slowly lost . Well established company, I worked almost thirty-four years there and my father worked over forty-nine years.You get to meet great people and work with them as well.  great training programs and they are willing to do what it takes to get the job done.I have worked for Ford for 31 years and achieved more than my dreams could have imagined. I have met many people from around the world and have worked and launched various products in many of the plants in the United States. I have enjoyed coming back to do contract work as I am always glad to see many people again and work with them during launch. I greatly appreciated my time with the company.It's a nice job to have if you are a full-time employee!  With going from tpt to sts it's kind of hard deciding if you want to keep the job.  Or the fact that you just keep wondering if you will ever get hired in full-time!It was one of my early job. Learned a lot while being productive. Will work again if I had a chance to work there. Support after hours was sometimes difficult (laptop provided by company was a bit slow) but overall it was great.I worked for Cat Drive Away a company that's affiliated with Ford Motor Company. Fast and steady place to work. Very laid back and easy money... I loved working there and the people was very outgoing.Ford is a great family company with a knowledgable staff and a great work/life balance. The only downside is that all roads lead back to Dearborn / SE Michigan.Working at Ford was a good job. I enjoyed working with the other employees. Shifts were on a rotating bases, usually every three months your shift would be rotated. Lots of overtime.A typical day at work included monitoring equipment and automation and responding to problems with machinery.  It was very rewarding to diagnose issues and plan and execute resolutions.Being at a dealership you are exposed to the ins and outs of the car world and it being car make specific you end up learning everything about that make.  And as far as training is concerned the possibilities are endless, unfortunately working for a dealership does have a lot of drawbacks, mainly the drama of a high school world and there is a lot of political stuff involved, everything is based on time down to how you get paid.It was great place to work. But they changed their main focus on pharmacology. Providing PBM services and outsources IT services.Great benefits package but with what all you have to endure and deal with, it's no wonder that the pay and benefits package is what it is.  Some company personnel is great while others can be difficult to have to work under.  You will live inside this place and if you have a family, you will hear about their lives thru text on breaks.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,Palo Alto,CA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/e30a81b6-53c9-4f1b-8d60-6ad8c114d27c?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=32,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

280,1684.0,Senior Scientist - Analytical Chemistry,Georgia-Pacific,3.6,968.0,"Learned a lot and became a more well rounded maint. man because the troubleshooting required me to think on my feet and being the only one on shift I didn't have a way to pass the buck.Excellent workplaceGood benefitsGrowthEqual opportunityFast paceFairFair payTeam workerTeam playersSafe workplaceCompetitive benefits package. Supports various skills training for employees. Long term satisfied employees, low turn over rate.It's very easy to use and fun. I think that I will be using this frequently. I'm excited very to find employment thru this app. I will recommend this app to all my friends and family.The typical day of work was constant. Always something to get accomplished and work on. I learned several new trades while helping maintenance department. The hardest part of the job was the work environment. The workers do not work well with others.Plant closed down so not really much I can say. Too many management changed at the end. That was the downfall, employes worked hard and did there best.Good name, great company. Great people to work WITH.Overall this was a great place to work, just needed a better management structure. Alot of favoritism and nepetism in key places.The hardest part of the job was dealing with the management.Certain rules only apply to certain employees at certain times. The most ejoyable part of the job was the job itself.I have enjoyed my work experience there. I always came to work with only the intentions to do my job. I got along with everybody because I mostly stayed to myself. I enjoyed making my own money.Work is not hard at all and compensation is wonderful management from plant manager down to shift leads are the biggest downfall of the job.  They way people are treated here is ridiculously sad.With out a doubt, one of the worst companies I have ever worked for.  A number of times they have forgotten to buy raw materials for the machinery.  They are big on grandiose plans, but in the end, nothing materializes.  They union drags their feet renegotiating the contract, not the company.  The plant is run very lean, but management treats themselves to expensive lunches every Friday.  Run, don't walk away.Could be more generous around holidays for employees too boost moral for more positive production numbers for the following year,incetives for milestones . Safety needs to be of more importance. To keep business thriving safe work plant is great for business.great place to work. it was a very safe and productive place to work. I would recommend this place to others.  I really don't know what else I can say about it.Very Hot summers, Very Cold Winters. Unorganized in management. Company is very strict on safety procedures. Many opportunities for raises. Co-Workers are friendly.Hard To Advance In This Company , Management needs a little work and understand the hard work that the employees put in also it should be more of a flexible scheduleIts were I started in a industrial environment, learned alot from my Co workers and was able to advance in my mechanical career.Dirty, hot, fiberglass everywhere, management doesnt care about you or how many days you work or hours and cry if you ask for a day off if you worked a 6 week day. If you are new theyll make you do everything just because they have seniority issues and think just because they been there for a few year they dont have to do there job. I was maintenance with ATS worst company to work for i would not recommend this either of these companies for a long term career just stepping stones. Oh and also would tell you to hurry up on your 30 min lunch break when ypu had no breaks all day.Management will twist you any way they want then kick you to the curb when they are through with you. The most unhappy workforce i have ever seen in my life, everyone is over worked to the point of numbness. Probation for 90 days, do not be sick or miss even an hour for anything or you are gone.You never know from one day to the next what your schedule is.Very productive and fun to work for.I learned that some of the chemistry that I learned in high school applied to the job.Management was great. They work with you to ensure you,re getting trained for all task being performed. The co-workers were easy to get along with and we enjoy working together. The hardest part of the job gauges, valves, and all the product being made and where they're stored. The most enjoyable part of the job was our product improvement team brainstorming along with R&D to improve our product and reduce batch time. Also the company picnics were great. Everyone bring their family and we get to know each other.You work for your pay check and thats it. they could care less about you. Supervisors only care about being the top dog in production. employees do not get scheduled breaks you ""break when you can"" which sometimes means you just dont get one.Good interaction with peers, limited with upper management.Business development with IT options.Co-workers were mostly very conscientiousExcessive meetingsDifficult to get consensus on decisionsWorking with customers and production facilities was most enjoyable.Union Job but no sick day, have to work all holidays, inclement weather if not you get a point against you after 4 points you get suspended even with doctor's note.  There is so much work that the trainers are really unable to train new people properly.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,HAYWARD,CA,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/4ce18792-1bf7-44cd-8785-db0f8253db87?mescoid=1900245001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

297,1701.0,Sr Clinical Scientist,St. Jude Medical,4.0,225.0,"SJM is good company to work for I'm glad I got the opportunity to work and get to work in the quality group, it was new to me and I picked up new skills.Everyone is normally in a good mood and easy to talk to. Communication barriers in the department that I work for are not an issue and neither has it been with other departments. Management in some areas could learn to loosen up in order to allow their employees to maximize their full potential and abilities. Other than that, compensation is decent, the people are great, the company is solid and there's a cafeteria if you happen to forget that morning to bring your lunch.Average payLong hoursNo bonus for sr. engineers and under.Its basically a meat grinder.No one tells you you that you have to work long hours. However the expectations for delivery of projects will compel you to work long hours. Additionally, if you meet or exceed your goals for the year don't expect a promotion unless you are in RD.Management is flexible when and how you put in your hours for work. There is ample opportunities to advance within the company, but you are not compensated well when you are promoted. There is also no type of bonuses program. The benefits are excellent though.Management can get very unorganized and sometimes unprofessional. Don't expect too much on pay increases when converting from temp to full time St. Jude employee. They offer good benefits but PTO sucks. A lot of opportunities for over time.Worse place I have ever worked. Management is a joke they have their picks. You are not given the respect you deserve. And you make one mistake even if you are training you never hear the end of it. Low salary also 10.00 for first second and third 11.00 that is hired on. Tempts. Make 9.25.The St. Jude Medical Hackettstown, NJ location was a wonderful place to work. The people were very kind, fun loving and hard working. We all worked very well together, as a team. I did find that the IT department is structured in such a way that advancement at satellite offices is difficult. Most days at work - the first 5 years - I would make sure the backup were successful, test restores, assist users, install new systems - both client & server, patch servers, and ensure that the manufacturing IT operations were running smoothly. At times the FDA would show up and we would quickly set up front room/back room scenarios for auditing exercises. I would also remove viruses and ensure that all users had the latest antivirus on their machines. We used a help desk system called Remedy daily and that made it easy to keep track of tickets. I enjoy helping people very much.A typical day at work is processing medical device report forms by correlating in groups or with field specialists such as sales representatives and health professionals. I have learned a lot about the human heart and all the possible adverse outcomes. I have also learned that there are many different devices and products out there that can treat those adverse outcomes. St. Jude Medical has taught me to have more empathy and patience with my co-workers. It taught me to teach myself how to provide an enjoyable environment in an every day office. The hardest part of the job was witnessing many co-workers come and go since we had a strict budget for the department. Many different managers and directors have also had their share of time with the department. Other than the workload and the strict budget, this job is very enjoyable in the sense that you really get a feel for what it is to practice team work.The employees and management team are very genuine and supportive. The culture is very positive and it is a fun environment. New ideas are encouraged and implemented.Great job, learned a lot and promoted several times, so advancement is possible. Your always busy with good work environment. The hardest part of the job was working with the doctors, but the more you work with them, the more you understood.Overall I would not recommend working there. Too much politics and managment has no vision for the future. New engineers are hired based on capabilities, rather than on experience.The environment is diverse and humane with conditions that foster professional growth. The sense of job security is ever present although the recent acquisition may put a damper on that. The company is solid and treats people wellWorking at St. Jude Medical, I have learned a lot about the medical device industry. I have come to enjoy the greatness of making devices that can save lives. But at the location I worked at, I did not like my management team. Due to the fact that I worked for two different Production Leads, I was stretch very thin and cross-trained in many positions which I had no issue with. Although I was able to complete tasks for both teams, the leads did not have good communication which led to misunderstandings and unnecessary panic at times. The hardest part of the job was definitely the lack of communication between leads and their employees. There were a lot of employees who would have enough productive work for half the day while there were a handful of operators who had to be extremely productive the entire week to complete their tasks. Another hard thing about this workplace is how sly they are to making experienced employees train employees with more seniority and then promotes the senior employees into the trainer of those respective positions, which is completely unjust to all of the experienced employees who work so hard to learn and perfect their techniques for their position.I would not recommend anyone to work here if they wished to have a long-term job because I do not see enough employee appreciation within the company, not just from the department I worked in. I know this because I have worked with engineers, techs, and other employees from different departments and they, too, had their share of unappreciative experiences with this company.Responsible for opening the office. Check voicemail to see if any therapist called out if so then work on moving cancelling the patient appointment. Answer phone calls direct them to the appropriate area. Check patients in, collect co-payment, schedule appointments. Register new patients. Call insurance to verify benefits, obtain authorization for treatment . Balance money at the end of the shift.I worked for SJM full time from 1995 to 2004 and the culture has stayed the same, hard working but trying to have fun at work. I have worked for some of the other large med device company's and would rate SJM as the best. Would like more consistency on how contractors are converted to full time.I can't vouch for positions outside of IT, but management is pretty flexible. Bad weather? Kids sick? Working from home is typically not a problem. I find all of my teammates likable.A typical day at work for me consisted of receiving, issuing, and ordering inventory stock.I learned the value of teamwork. My job was dependent on everyone around doing what they were suppose to do, and we did it successfully.The hardest part of the job was dealing with surprised FDA and International audits.The most enjoyable part of the day was lunch time, you get to hang out with co-workers and friends.it is a good place to develop one's career. on job training is available which makes it suitable for full and part time employees. clean environment too.Assembly line. Trained and worked in multiple stations when completing medical device. Hours worked were Monday - Thursday from 4:30 pm to 2:30 am.I would work for  St Jude again, but always try to be prepared for the position to be relocated somewhere within the U.S. or offshore.Management is really not strong. they are not on the same page, its not a united place where every one will work together as a team. They do not hire the right people for the higher chairs of the company.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,Sunnyvale,CA,2016-10-29T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/49d95e65-7112-4107-9f93-95fd80d32a67?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=19,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

337,1741.0,Process Development Chemist,Air Liquide US,3.8,563.0,"They were kind of stiff not very friendly people yet I was not there that long. I learn how to do footnotes for audit. It was an overall okay place. Don't really remember much.Air Liquide is a great place to work for, my time was cut short to to reduction of force at Bayport complex. I understand the decision since Air Liquide purchased the AirgasMy work at Air Liquide was contract so I can't speak about the benefits.  There were several employees who have been there 16+ years so I'm sure they were fine with their benefits.I love working for htis company. The people and atmosphere were great. I am somewhat disappointed there was no option for permanent hire. I would deifinitley work with them again in the futureOnce a very solid company to work for that prided itself on employee relations. After the buyout, they have slowly moved their top figures in who have no minds of their own. Everyone is just trying to exist while not ruffling any feathers even if it may be valuable to the company. Cronyism has consumed this place and will ultimately suck the life out of you.Air liquide is a very safe company to work for. I got a lot of experience driving those big tankers,my manager was always polite.I learned a lot about cryogenics and loading up those tankers and filling those tanks.Great Company to work for. Going in the wrong direction with the merger into Air Gas, Benefits / Compensation all dropped off dramatically. Supervisor willing to bust your balls, but give you his shirt off his back.I do not want to include a review. Air Liquide is a good place to work I guess the benefits are good. Hydrogen is fun. I once saw a rabbit thereA nice commute. Air Liquide offered great leadership and scheduling to their employees as well as a great benefit package.A typical day at work is fairly simple, calling/emailing customers and helping them with their accounts. I learned how to use different systems on a computer and learned more on how to use a computer and using office. The management is very fair and helpful. My co-workers are delightful people to work with and keep to themselves. The hardest part about my job is to just focus on one thing rather than multiple. The most enjoyable part about my job is that I finish things before my deadline and like to take on new projects when possible.This company likes to engineer everything and is almost too concerned with safety. They are very lean with their money, dumping a lot of work on employees before considering adding head count. If you are driven, smart, an engineer, and can play office politics, you will excel in this company.Was a production tech for 8 years before I finally had enough. There is zero work/life balance. As management sees it, they own you. They run bare bones personnel. Averaged 1300 overtime hours per year the last  4 years. Pay was severally behind the rest of the industry. Benefits became fewer and fewer each year. Maintenance was non-existent. Equipment was always going down. Numerous 36 hr. straight shifts getting the plant back up and running. Thankful everyday I was able to get away from there and find a great job.Became adapt at project management in a short period of time while being given the lead on various capital projects.  Also gained engineering knowledge relevant to each project.  Grateful to be given lead project responsibility and learned a great deal about customer interaction as well as internal interaction within the the course of a project at an early stage in my careerVery poor managment...the work is not all that hard...learning process takes many years. In would not recommend working for this company to anyone.I like working for Air Liquide. They need to work on their communication with employees. The company just went through a merger with Airgas and they have not done a good job at communicating what is going on with our jobs.Nice company and easy going coworkers.  Fast paced and heavy workload. Enjoyed customers and helping everyone out. I learned different to track orders. Also learned the different natural gases supplied by Air Liquide. Hardest part was learning the different sizes of containers. The enjoyable part was learning new things.Air Liquide has provided an excellent opportunity to grow with a multinational company. It has given me a chance to learn a diverse set of technical and interpersonal skills.There was always something new and challenging.  There was always something to learn.  Using our work loading to accomplish daily work orders.  Accomplishing the hardest, most difficult task and achieving outstanding results.If you dare , Air Liquide's management has run there company in the ground the constant waist that has gone on for years has led to management turnover .The day They hire you is the day They begin to Fire you. Driver pay is UNcertain. Air Liquide purchased AirGas. Everything will change. Except Safety Choking the ever loving life out of you. Driver is the the catch all for everyone else not doing their own job. 14 hour days are common. Then your asked to work extra. Life? What Life?  Only Management is allowed a life.AL is a good company as a whole, however I had a negative experience mostly due to my direct supervisor and upper management.  I received very little training and no support from my direct supervisor.  He was oftentimes a hinderence to meeting deadlines.  Even though upper management say they have an open door policy, this is far from the truth.  His open door is open only to his small group of friends.  He didn't want to hear anything I had to say.","1,001 to 5,000",Palo-Alto,Fremont,CA,2016-12-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/8d9dcec7-f617-4396-a3a0-2ade83e75e18?mescoid=1900259001001&jobPosition=24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

342,1746.0,Jr. Biologist/Scientist,ARCADIS,3.6,101.0,"I love the people I work with. Aggressive billable hours goals can be tough to get used to if you haven't worked as a consultant before.Strong global company with the desire to do great things. First part of the climb was, to pay off all senior staff to leave the company and hire Collage students. Effects, the company lost clients and senior knowledge. Next up was to hold back and stop yearly merit increases... when moral was already low from previous actions, it just dipped lower. Each deparment has their own personnel challenges. No company is going to give their money away, but this one will try to give up as little as possible on it's staff, even if you do more than expected (above and bound).After 23 years of my service, Arcadis fired me while I was out on disability recovering from my liver transplant. They then started to force out any senior members who had 20+ years of experience. This was a cost saving measure to purge all the high end salaries. Many of the furloughed employees were from the original G & M firm who helped Arcadis grow from 10,000 to over 55,000 people. We in the Southeast provided most of the revenues to finance their expansion. We were rewarded with pink slips. My advice is to join the company for experience and leave for a better job as soon as you can. Loyalty is not a word in the Arcadis vocabulary.My overall experience has been good. I like what I do, and where I do it, I love the fact that I serve a purpose to the American public. Management has been very helpful in helping to adjust to the different areas and scope of work. The hardest part about this job is the travel. I loved it at first. Now I just need to be at home more with my family. My co-workers have all on the most part been one of the best parts to my job. Most of them are in the same boat as I. This make relationships easy to relate to.Poor company to work with.  I was with the firm for many, many years and it has gone down hill since the merger with Malcolm Pirnie.  The merger was poorly managed, the leadership team let the smaller purchased company come in and change how a well managed company was run and it FAILED.  Morale in most offices is very bad, there is no loyalty, management talks of a ""transformation plan"" that has falsified KPI's.  Bonuses have gone down, down, down every year since the merger with Malcolm Pirnie.  The hires they make into leadership and business development roles are very poorly vetted, business revenue is not improving year after year.  I think this company needs to start from scratch and get back to basics and should start by getting rid of all of the Malcolm Pirnie employees still left in the firm.Huge turnover. Management is horrible with money, so they are constantly looking for younger people who will do the same work for a fraction of a good wage. Laid off after thirty years of loyalty and hard work because their poor work can't maintain clients. It used to be a good company but they fired all of the people who made the company work. Good luck in this shrinking industry.The pay and benefits have been great, but the hours are terrible.  I have no time for life outside of work.  Management seems to want to help you succeed, and will pay for any continued educationWas an acquired firm but was a great place to work! Great people and culture with room for advancement. Wished the company was able to maintain the workforce.Flexible work schedule, Great people, but stability and advancement opportunities are poor. For similar role with a competitor, the salary is low as well.The position was not advertised as the actual position required. My expertise was in Project Accounting, not Governmental Contract Accounting.Ok, very large company with many offices and international locations. Felt too large and impersonal. Okay place to start careergreat opportunity to learn and for professional development,  My co-workers are team spirited and work well together.- Work for this company for 8 yrs since I was 19.- Company is willing to teach and groom new trainees- Friendly co-workers- Not doing redundant work every week- Hardest part about the job was learning new, tedious, and critical work that needed to be completed as soon as possible. - The most enjoyable part about the job was learning new and intense work on a daily basis.Communication is very poor. As a new employee the burden is shifted to me to figure out what projects I'm on or I am notified less than a day before that I'm on a job. We're supposed to have project meetings which I'm never involved in, but am expected to know what was discussed. Finally, the way expense reporting and billable hours work is horrible. Lets just say that if I work over 40 hours, but 8 of those hours were to overhead and not a project well I just wont get paid for those 8 hours. At least they are flexible with career paths and letting you decide what type of work you'd like to learn.Where to begin? From the beginning a lot of promises were said but never followed up on. Me and fellow colleagues helped build up a new process for a project we were collaborating on globally and were literally used and abused. Once the project was completed management dropped our hours from 50% for example and expect people to stay busy of be threatened with layoff. A lot of blackmailing goes on if you are not of the big boys club or one of their favorites. A lot of favoritism occurs and management likes to speak to people like dirt. Also they expect you to work 10 hours without an outside social life. They also treat women like its 1950. If you are married and have children they make you feel guilty about having to leave work after 8 hours. It is like working on a slave ship for very low pay, I would avoid this company by all means.A typical work day is continually putting out fires.  I rarely knew in the morning what I would be working on in the afternoon, but I always knew I would be busy.Ever since the company became publicly traded on the stock market job security and morale plummeted.Please understand the majority of these perfect positive reviews of Arcadis are fake. This is a company that tries so hard to impress their competitors and stakeholders that they neglect the well-being of their employees. Arcaadis is seeing a lot of decline - don't believe the heresay of acquisitions/partnering and how strongly they are positioned. They aren't. Staff is dwindling and most major competitors know they are a joke in the industry. What you should focus on is the mass exodus of employees, bipolar management, micro-managers, no office morale, extremely low pay, no sick days, no bonuses, and NO WORK. Layoffs are constant here because Arcadis just cant win.Billability is truly the only thing that matters at this company.  You can be the most brilliant, talented, well-liked person imaginable, but if you suddenly, through no fault of your own, find yourself less billable than someone who just processes storage boxes all day, then you go, and they stay.  Your timesheet is either your ticket upward or the nail in your coffin.As much as they try, the divisional walls at the company will never be taken down.  If a certain division is in need of a skill, and you have that skill, you may never find each other.  People are laid off all the time who could probably have been kept quite busy elsewhere, but management is unaware of how to make that happen.The most difficult part of the job is the heavy focus on billabilty and finding work for one's self. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to interact with new clients and other contractors on a daily basis.Company is very driven around business development. Projects are very impressive to work on. The PMCM division is  still working on developing standard procedures. Advancement seems to be promotion to project manager as well as take on business development role concurrently.I enjoyed working with the Project Managers from all over the US and Canada as well as Brazil, Chile, & Peru.

348,1752.0,Analytic ML Developer,Ericsson,4.1,2800.0,"The company's internship program is great. Work life balance is also good. Co Workers are very helpful and approachable.The most hardest part of the job is to understand the product.I enjoyed working at Ericsson as they were proactive and forward thinking. Teamwork approach and management was excellent. We put in long days but the end results for our customer paid off well.- Devilry , customer satisfaction, flexible and self authorized at my work. - Focus on customer and lead.- Manage my daily work with little intervention from my manager. - Remotely managed and diverse co-workers from the glob.- Full responsibility in selling and managing multi million projects.- Result oriented, time management, acknowledged.I loved my job. Just no Job Security, no advancement. Tried getting a transfer. Not easy. Old manager was easier to work for. Once getting a new manager. He only cared about himself and not his workersI was fortunate to work with really amazing people. The people in the organization makes this one of the best places to work for.Started my first job with MNC. it had a great experience.Learned new things and willing to learn much more.Good atmosphere and got the opportunity to work with good and professional people.Through +12 year of working inside telecom industry "" GSM , data transmission and FTTXdelivery projects "" make me gain technical knowledge and management skills , member ofnational and international organization team works , share different challenge and successstories , all aim me to build my work experienceI worked at this job for 19 years. worked as a technician back when it was nextel-sprint. once ericsson took over the maintenance contract for sprint things spiraled down fast. many jobs were outsourced to India and most senior techs were let go so they could hire young fresh techs just out of school for way less pay. just a sad thing we see now with businesses here in the usa.Maintenance Program Manager driving periodic software deliveries, achieving above the target WLA performance and concluding escalations from Customers and Stake Holders.Working in lean and agile software cross functional team, achieved continuous delivery of maintenance releases  with high quality, on-time delivery and with allocated budget.Leadership team member of Bug tracking tool migration activity (change management)  and successfully planned and migrated Bug tracking activities from ExtraView to  MHWEB (Ericsson) across multiple global operation teams with out impacting day to day operations of 2000 developers and testers.Work at Ericsson is demanding but exciting in that there are multiple avenues to grow and develop across several wireless technologies.During my time at Ericsson, I worked with outstanding people maintaining wireless networks and deploying next generation technology while challenging was also exciting to learn new skills.The hardest part was learning and adapting quickly in order to support our customers. I enjoyed have the flexible hours and time, work life balance was acceptable.Decent pay for the work, excellent learning experience.  Allowed me to work the hours that I liked and allowed me to go to other depts to learn what they did as wellEricsson had excellent products, but was missing the market moves toward lower cost R&D, and was drawn into the 5G race too far in advance of the market.  The Chinese continue to take share and Ericsson is scrambling to address cost overhead.The management is too focused on the short term and should have seen the longer term trends long in advance of the current bad results.  Co-workers are well qualified but out of touch with the customer.Hardest part of the job was to sell good business with flagging product line up.Most enjoyable part of the job was hitting the marks with products that had the attention of Sweden.To get anything done here takes way too long.  Our customers have spoken, our employees have complained.  The job culture is not conducive to the work they are trying to accomplish and it has shown in lost contracts and lost sales. On top of all that, there are at least one or two layoffs a year so you're always on the chopping block.As with most large companies trying to do more less. Technology and industry is changing and the company is trying to keep up. Layoffs are constant and staff development is poor.When not thinking about the problems of having only one customer that everyone's job depended on, this was a great company to work for.  Co-workers, were a joy to work with as were many of those I was not directly working with.However - because the presence of Ericsson in the US was almost completely dependant upon their Sprint contract, the ground we were on was always shaky.  In the end, it was the contract that ended most of our jobs.Leader in the wireless broadband area.  Company performs many trend researches and has great vision.  For example, Ericsson talked about Connected Society with billions of connections long before IoT became the buzz word.  Company offers a lot of online learning materials to employees.At Ericsson and I must say the benefits and the experiences that I got from the work I was engaged are probably second to none.  I reported to a very engaging and skilled director that served as a mentor for me and helped me grow.  The one thing that I did always dislike is that every year there were layoffs.  It is difficult to keep motivated when you know that around 4th Quarter there will be a culling of the heads in the office.  This may have been unique to the Overland Park Office and not as frequent in PlanoLove working for Ericsson, learn many things, how to manage capital   assets, how to manage other employees to build core switches in a live environment, how to work with implementation managers on meeting deadlines and ensuring job was up to specs at all times. A typical day at work was usually very long. The most enjoyable part was when we all work together to accomplish the same goal, plus meeting new co-workers.A typical day at work consisted of logging onto computers and phone. Outlook was a daily tasks of checking emails and responding to customers. Ran reports and attended monthly meetings. Hardest part was waiting on other vendors and teams to provide eta's to give to our customers if units were not locally at the warehouse due to damaged or lost.Ericsson's home office was in Sweden and cell phones were just coming into view. Many visitors came to office and many presentations were made regarding this new product.Good company, great benefits, coworkers very professional, work environment and schedule flexibility are great. Needs improvement: too many layers of management.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,Santa Clara,CA,2016-09-21T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/6c9d852b-df17-44d9-bb97-fd300c2e2ceb?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=35,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Very good people though, loved working with them.Work-life balance good, fairly low stress environment, but if you don't fit a certain personality type, you will be relegated to bottom of the performance ""calibration curve"" and will get poor ratings and generally be ignored by management in favor of the teacher's pet types. Visibility is supreme at PayPal, and counts for more than results. So if you aren't a self-promoter, you will fade into obscurity.PayPal is a fast paced call center where a lot of hard working talent gets lost in the shuffle and menial busy work. Each day consists of handle anywhere from 30-70 contacts from customers via phone. There is very little down time and the scheduling is inflexible. Those who get ahead know someone, are willing to make big sacrifices to their work life balance, or get lucky. Turnover is very high and management holds onto apathetic supervisors just because they've been there a while. The benefits and bonuses make up for how difficult it is to keep a positive attitude at such menial work.PayPal was an excellent place to work. The culture was diverse and the management was spectacular. I was a contract employee working as a Talent Acquisition Coordinator. My day to day duties consisted of onboarding new hires, acting as an onboarding ambassador. I scheduled interviews for potential applicants throughout the country. My coworkers were so helpful and like a family, we were true teammates. The hardest part of the job would be to schedule interviews on and off site for sometimes up to eight people throughout the country. Many of the executives had very hectic schedules. The most enjoyable part was interacting with my teammates who were all offsite but especially dealing with my coworkers on site as well as working closely with the applicants.Over, it was a good place to work. The co-workers and workplace environment made it easy to work. Great benefits, company parties, and team-building events were a plus. The only drawback was having to meet unrealistic goals and metrics. Metrics are based on comment cards sent into customers. If customers are unhappy with the company, and not you directly, you still get penalized. Some micro-managing with upper Management. Can be stressful at times. Calls consisted mostly with payments and account status. Speaking to co-workers in the Philippians can be frustrating. If you have no problem with meeting metric, then this job is for you.PayPal has wonderful values, PAC committees that gather employee feedback, holiday pay, sick pay starting 2016 (a benefit that was given after a PAC committee review), health care, 401K, ESOP, Flex Spending, Management takes an active roll in employee development. Family friendly (Company Parties). Beautiful grounds, Secure building, Clean Restrooms, Clean mothers room, Charitable business, happy work-floors (There are tough days, but they applaud your crowing achievements). You can really build your career with PayPal.Excellent benefits and work/life balance. Inclusive culture with a progressive mindset. There has been steady growth over the years and the outlook for PayPal is excellent.The company is in a good posistion for growth and dominance in this market sector. Key partnerships are essential after splitting from ebay. Lots of change and there are many levels of management. As they grow I would anticipate a lot of flucuation in the continued future.I used to love working at PayPal but within the last few years it has become extremely apparent that once you hit 10 years or so they suddenly need to ""reduce headcount"" and you are out the door. Great place to start but make sure to keep options open once you've been there a while.New company since split from eBay - still feeling the growing pains. Enjoyable, but frustrating job since upper management made decisions without considering input from hands-on experts.I worked here and gained good experience in Customer Service over the phones. I worked in the call center and it was a controlled environment with strict time constraints to be adhered to and so forth.  If you want to move up here, best advice is to take initiative early and build rapport with your managers or otherwise be pinholed as just another worker.  I considered this to be just a stop in the road but stayed longer than I planned.  This was an overall good place to work and I would do it again under different circumstances.Great training program. I train a lot of the new team members. Management is supportive and invites input from workers. I have enhanced my skills as a communicator and trainer. Not eating to much in the awesome cafeteria is difficult. I enjoy interacting with Paypal clients to resolve they're issues.I really enjoyed working at this company. I worked with a great group of people and my supervisors and manager were nice and willing to work with me. I hardest part of the job was meeting the time allowed for each call.Good place to work for full time employees. Offers great benefits, good work life balance and good growth opportunities.Could have better policies for high performing consultants to get converted into full time employees.PayPal never seems to reach their potential.  Tenured, senior high performing employees routinely shown the down at or near their 10th anniversary, especially white males.  Absence of grey beards, and older women too, negatively impacts the ability of PayPal to understand the marketplace. Lack of business acumen in the management ranks is detrimental (most people managers are in their first jobs ever.) The management style is to keep employees afraid, which negatively impacts morale.  Entrepreneurial spirit is severely disciplined. PayPal is devolving vs evolving. Look for a buyout/sale/downward trajectory as their market awareness is poor (Level 2 insider.)What started out as a close family type of atmosphere grew to be corporate and all about making the most money. Great benefits and the people in the trenches are what makes this place great but the culture needs to change and improveGreat place to work benefits start first day.  Lots of training and testing but, with it.  Opportunities for advancement .  On site restaurant great food.  Answering customers phone calls and or emails.  Lots of reading from knowledge base.The company has good benefits, great work culture, very supportive, fun management and continuous training and productive fun work environment.I love the whole culture at PayPal. The training was wonderful. The culture is welcoming and warming. Co-worker supportive and helpful. Management there when you need them. The openness and honesty is the most enjoyable par.My review of this company is awesome.  The managers are great and they are willing to help in any way to help you succeed to get your goal.  Awesome companyPay Pal Was Soo Amazing They Believed In The Upside Down Pyramid Form. From The CEO To The Less Tener Agent The Paypal Culture Is Beyond Phenomenal.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,San Jose,CA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/ec82441d-e4de-4d24-9e76-38a246befa6f?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

475,1879.0,Analytics Software Developer,IBM,4.0,12500.0,"Great work life balance, however due to IBM being so big, it can be quite challenging to be visible enough to move one's career ahead.Recommendation is to create a summary document each month listing your accomplishments. Review it monthly with your manager and save it for your end of year self review. Have to make yourself known to manager as well as other decision makers throughout the organization.Just getting hired here is not enough. You have to apply to internal projects to work, so your mileage may very depending on your skill set, your competency, and an array of factors. My project is interesting and challenging enough for me, but some of my more able coworkers have gone months without being able to get on a project while the less skilled one are on project by luck. Team structures come with the typical perks and frustrations as one can reasonably expect. Managers are eager to help; shame they help too many people and can be hard to pin down at times.Overall it is your typical office setting. It's decent work for entry level work.Learning and taking on new challenges is something I always looked forward to having in my work day.  Loved learning new software and tools and being able to share my knowledge and skills with co-workers.1) Typical implementation of Google Re-Captcha, UPS monitoring tool for datacenter monitoring was really a challenge. After completion of these task I got appreciation from managers.2) Learned a lot from technical and architecture perspective3) We worked as a team to accomplish these achievement on schedule.4) Maintenance activity to stabilize backend system in job was typical.Good place to work. Worked as substitute teacher. Had a few problems at the start, but overall the experience was enjoyable. No problems at the end, The pay was well.I've never encountered so many talented people in one place. I've enjoyed collaboration with the teams I've worked with.This job required extensive travel and long hours.  Executives will stab you in the back first opportunity they get.  Don't trust them.  Working with customers was rewarding and provided much satisfaction.  Co-workers were awesome and I will miss them.  Constantly changing organization structure and constant expansion of required skills and knowledge made keeping up with job demands difficult.  Never felt appreciated for effort put into this job.Poorly Managed and has little hope of success.  Very large and has a poor character.  Hard to see how they will be successful, as the Senior Management only cares about themselfs.was a great place to work but in recent years they have been moving IT jobs overseas and laying off long time employees. Still some great people thereI didn't learn anything from IBM I was moved from Centurylink to IBM doing the same work with the same pay. I loved the work I did until it was outsourced to India. I was given a chance to find a job within IBM but with my skills was unable to find anything and was then released. The management is not very helpful when they need things it is a hard process to get help with anything most of what I would need I had to figure out on my own.Very nice pace to work and everyone works as a team which is hard to find but it is a family type of enviornment. I think that the company is just gong to be expanding.it was the best shop  to work in, we had all the answers for manfrane capacity, to many meetings also free laptops for emplyees to use, great history at all ibm sitesMy shirt would begin at 8am, i would take calls from mortgage customers and call out to mortgage customers for home mortgage payment.  Every call different due to dealing with new person new personality.  On every call you advise customers importance of maintaining healthy payment habits.Co workers assist if you need assistance on a call. this job has taught me how to manage life expenses and how to prioritize different aspects of life.Working for IBM was like family oriented so being  there was like home away from home everyone I worked there with was like down to earth people they didn't mind pitching in to help when you needed help.- a typical day a work: work on automation process and tooling- what I learned: critical thinking and problem solving- management: flexibility- co-workers: friendly and professionalThis company is pretty bad not going to lie. Contractors do not get hired on unless you can some how manage to make it 10 years as a contractor. I would not suggest applying unless you have a 4 to 8 year degree.I traveled 2 hours to work by the company provided bus. I learned how to proficiently use access, powerpoint and outlook. I had a great boss and my coworkers were nice as well. The hardest part about this job was the 5 hour round trip daily commute.typical day at work is receive  Inbounds /Outbound calls help assisting loan payments escrow question loss mitigation questionsCompany seems to continually Re-Org., shift directions.No job seems secure and most of the (FTE) employees there know it.    There is little value is placed on contractors. It appears management views it is easy to discard the contract labor, based on what direction they (sr. management)  are pursuing.The focus of work or tasks seems to shift based on upper management decisions. The work environment (culture) suffers because of it.  It is not an inspired work environment.   Not a company I would recommend.You get to start your job with peers your age so it's very easy to integrate and feel being part of the company at work. People are generally nice and willing to help out. Work load is light for entry level job but responsibilities will increase as you move up in chain. Since it's a big corporation, the vertical advancement is there but slow. Most of the time you get to rotate to another role between 8 months to 15 months horizontally.In IBM's current desperation to turn around revenue trends, it has become a very hard place to work. Everyone is measure against their ability to directly contribute to that revenue top line and that leaves IBM constantly trying to pivot to the next big thing and leaving other projects and people tossed aside.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,SAN JOSE,CA,2016-11-15T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/6daad95b-edc7-493e-b9f4-810fcc83a0de?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=22,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Though it was very predictable and gratifying, I missed the opportunity to have more creative outlets.I performed line maintenance support for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance on Bag fabricators, Fill/seal rotary fillers, Bag overwrap machines, Continuous Sterilizer and Packaging equipment. I completed plc program changes for installation on weekends, I completed all necessary paperwork. this included Cad drawings, ECR's, Printouts of electrical drawings, backups of the plc programs. I worked with production management, engineering, and maintenance personnel. The most enjoyable part of my job was the satisfaction that I earned the respect of all the people that I worked withThe project brought together multiple departments to work on resolving an issue created with a system implementation.  Working with these people helped everyone learn about other departmentsHard working people in need of some management change. Style of management in need for a better strategy to succeed. Too many foreigners trying to fit in a complex culture. Talent and expertise overshadowed by outspokenness.Good pay and benefits.  Too many meetings. Good management.  Flexible with life issues. Co-workers were good. Team environment was good. Time off was good.A great company to work for. Being able to go home everyday knowing you are helping a company that save lives is one of the best feelings in the world.the working environment is good with knowledgeable staff and good management. Sometimes employees are asked to do very difficult tasks in an unreasonable amount of time. and there are some employees that are very cliqueish management will get rid of you if they feel you're damaging their percentages so attention to detail is key.The Rocky Mount site, under Abbott Labs, was a great place to work.  Employees were dedicated to providing quality products to meet customer needs.The company itself is good but the management working in our country is very much biased and the compensation given to the employees is well beyond the expected.Great work place and opportunities foe employee skills enhancements. leader in Pharma companies.

Training and procedures is a must for all.I loved tis job. the only issue was the shifts. They were short on people so a lot of workers were working 12 hour shifts multiple days out the week.I enjoyed working for this company. Overall it's generally a good place to work. liked the people that I worked with they liked being there. The number one reason people stay is because of the benefits for the pension plan and insurance.It is a positive environment to work and prosper in. Communication is very vital at Abbott and they do it well. They are very good about working with your personal schedule and lifeIt was really nice working therepeople there are very friendlyI learned a lot while working thereCo-Workers are pretty freindlyI enjoy each and every moment Management is very goodThere was no typical day at workI really enjoyed my time at Abbott Laboratories, which was the catalyst for expanding my engineering ""toolbox"" and learning different aspects of the business.I love my job and I love how Abbott balances family and work life. The management is amazing and makes sure that if you want to learn and grow in your career then opportunities are given.The people are very helpful and knowledgeable.   I would love to work with Abbott again. The facility has a full gym to work out and the cafeteria is open at night.Terrible to move from temp to hired. Worked as a temp for almost a year and there were no opportunities to get hired in. They were cutting jobs when I went elsewhere.I learned to processed and inspect various stents. I was certified with different machinery and tooling. I enjoyed working with people who speak different languages.

517,1921.0,Autonomous Vehicle Research Scientist - Technology Scouting,Ford Motor Company,4.3,2300.0,"Enjoyed opportunity to self manage and work independently. The position of ""accounting specialist"" required travel through out the North and Southeast US. I enjoyed doing needs analysis in each of the auto dealerships and to customize the accounting software to meet the expectations  of dealership management.Days are normally 10 hrs day and 1st shift starts at 2 AM and sometimes last until 2 pm seven days a week. as a supervisor you must keep employees pumped up to get great production. The end result of good quality is always a plus.Loved the job. Wish I hadn't of messed up during my 30 day probation period. If I cannot find a better workplace before my yearly peiod to wait to reapply I plan on going back to work for TAC for sure!I liked working here. I was able to be able to do a little bit of everything. I helped out with the warranty department, I filed all thee paperwork form the previous days work as well as I was able to work with the guests and service advisers.Direct manager is not experienced enough for the role he stepped into witch desegregated work experience. made day to day very tedious and stressful. overall organization and owners we pleasantit been very nice and amazing job ,coworker really nice, every body know his or her job , the management really good and they always looking for new driver .Professionally patrolled to check for irregularities and to inspect protection devices and fire control equipment. Prepare logs and reports as required for informational purposes Respond to incidents of fire, medical emergency, bomb threat, flooding, inclement weather and other job related incidents.A very interesting, fun place to place.  As long as the work was getting done in a timely manner, you were free to talk while doing your work, which made the time go fast and streefree.db2 to write queries, business objects and crystal reports for reporting and opportunities to automate and/or improve an existing process.  Can make recommendations for action plans or streamlining to improve business performance.A very hard job . I found a niche in the paint department and did well . Because we had a strong Union we achieved advancements in pay and benefits.  With a bad economy in the Bush years the union lost power and the worker doing my job today is making the same money that I made in 2002 . The benefits have been eroding also . The retirees are paying higher prices on the benefits that they earned and have slowly lost . Well established company, I worked almost thirty-four years there and my father worked over forty-nine years.You get to meet great people and work with them as well.  great training programs and they are willing to do what it takes to get the job done.I have worked for Ford for 31 years and achieved more than my dreams could have imagined. I have met many people from around the world and have worked and launched various products in many of the plants in the United States. I have enjoyed coming back to do contract work as I am always glad to see many people again and work with them during launch. I greatly appreciated my time with the company.It's a nice job to have if you are a full-time employee!  With going from tpt to sts it's kind of hard deciding if you want to keep the job.  Or the fact that you just keep wondering if you will ever get hired in full-time!It was one of my early job. Learned a lot while being productive. Will work again if I had a chance to work there. Support after hours was sometimes difficult (laptop provided by company was a bit slow) but overall it was great.I worked for Cat Drive Away a company that's affiliated with Ford Motor Company. Fast and steady place to work. Very laid back and easy money... I loved working there and the people was very outgoing.Ford is a great family company with a knowledgable staff and a great work/life balance. The only downside is that all roads lead back to Dearborn / SE Michigan.Working at Ford was a good job. I enjoyed working with the other employees. Shifts were on a rotating bases, usually every three months your shift would be rotated. Lots of overtime.A typical day at work included monitoring equipment and automation and responding to problems with machinery.  It was very rewarding to diagnose issues and plan and execute resolutions.Being at a dealership you are exposed to the ins and outs of the car world and it being car make specific you end up learning everything about that make.  And as far as training is concerned the possibilities are endless, unfortunately working for a dealership does have a lot of drawbacks, mainly the drama of a high school world and there is a lot of political stuff involved, everything is based on time down to how you get paid.It was great place to work. But they changed their main focus on pharmacology. Providing PBM services and outsources IT services.Great benefits package but with what all you have to endure and deal with, it's no wonder that the pay and benefits package is what it is.

Great benefits and stock options.Great place to work, manufacturing would not be ideal for anyone trying to achieve work life balance or advancement.,Intuitive is a great compant to work for and I have 12 years of yenure",,Palo-Alto,Santa Clara County,CA,2016-05-20T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/009d7899-e9da-4320-869b-ae0945136931?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

641,2045.0,Analytical Chemist,Imerys,4.2,37.0,"Everyone around here have worked together a long time. Great place to work with family. The only downside is working swing shiftCorporate human resources personnel are nepotistic and show favoritism to their drinking buddies. To succeed at corporate level, you may have to spend time charming with and boozing with corporate HR. Bonus points for being female.great workplace with great co workers and bosses.hardest part of job was the swing shifts.most enjoyable part was learning new things.IMERYS is a good job and I would recommend it to anyone that is starting a career in the accounting field. The people at this company are really nice they are very generous at month end.Fun colleagues, supportive management. Room for growth and improvement. Fantastic team work throughout company and caring towards the environment as well as the community. Able to participate in community services.Typical day was always changing. One day would be creating risk assessments and maintenance schedules the next would be experimenting with the grinding parameters to modify the final product. Management was always supportive, intelligent and easy to get along with. Everyone working with or over you was very intelligent and they all excelled at finding tangible solutions to the multitude of problems associated with a new plant design.The hardest part of the job was creation of safety paperwork as it could be tedious. The most enjoyable part of the job was really everything else- operations, maintenance, experimentation, lab work ect. Really wish this position had not been cut short by the paper mill we were stationed at.I really enjoyed my time with Imerys. Currently work just has gotten slow so i must find another way to provide for my family.I learned how to operate most of the equipment i now know how to operate. The management is satisfactory but the HR department is too slow to fix any issues that come up. My co-workers were a blast to work with. There were never issues to comment on. The hardest part of working there is to try to move up the ladder.Generally it,s a good place to work but not like it was in the past.Management is still good get alone with co-workers well the most enjoyable part of the job is doing my job right.It's a wonderful location, great co-workers and management is tops!A typical day was always based on safety. Safety was very big with this company, they treated there workers well. Co-workers got along very well and I could tell that most of them where very good friends.Imerys was an excellent company to work for especially if you like to be busy. The management is tough but very fair. I learned a lot about IFS and Microsoft AX administration. I also figured out an extremely useful method of deployment through self study which is encouraged at Imerys. I felt that I was a valued member of the team. The hardest part of the job was navigating elements of office politics. The most rewarding part of the job was the respect of your peers when you solved a difficult problem.Imery's is an excellent Company to work for. Great Management and even better employees.There were no days during the course of my employment at IMERYS that were the same as it relates to a typical day.  To clarify my role, I would have to say that I was more of a fireman or EMT.  Constant emergencies, primarily due to lack of accountability and not adhering to the procedures.  The task I was assigned to do was to remedy the kind of environment that I described above.  With a new accounting system, we were going to be able to track cost via the system, as opposed to paper and manual journal entries.The difficulty was not being able to change the culture that was set on doing things the old way and refusing to change.  This was the hardest part of the job.The most enjoyable part would have to be the people I was able to help and teach.  Being able to help others with doing simple spreadsheets, formulas, tables, etc. that would say hours out of their week.  Seeing the relief they felt was worth every difficult day I experienced.Imerys, a minerals company out of France, has operations all over the world including north Georgia. My plant mined for marble rock and processed that rock into dust, used for thousands of applications. With this dust comes well...dust, everywhere. My job was to keep the machines that made all the different products clean and free of dust. An ongoing and dis-heartening struggle was my job. However, my co-workers and my supervisor made it a good place to work. There was always a need for my position and we made sure to fill it. Management could use more communication and oversight with employees, but all in all still a good company and a place I would recommend employment.Reliable workplace great for benefits strong team behind youLarge company with good remuneration and benefits. Learned process control/process discipline. Very customer-focused company. Good, knowledgeable co-workers, always there to help when needed,Long hours, Saturday work mandatory but the excellent work environment made long hours go by.   Typical day at work:  Safe and fun    What you learned:  New system    Management: Very approachable     Your co-workers:  Good people    the hardest part of the job:  NA    the most enjoyable part of the job:  Been part of itThis is the right place for you.  It's a typical office environment.  The company is headquartered in France so many times there are international visitors.  The majority of the staff are age 30 and up.  Some people are very happy here, while others are disappointed by the lack of advancement.  There is definitely job security.

651,2055.0,Senior Biostatistician/Statistical Programmer,stryker,4.0,429.0,"Stryker Orthopedics gave me a great opportunity to learn about Orthopedics. I spent seven years as a Stryker employee. During that time they were very helpful in teaching me all aspects of Orthopedic medical equipment distribution. During my time at Stryker I was able to grow as an employee and was awarded two promotions. I would highly recommend Stryker as a place to work!The system that was in place was antiquated for and adp product and they were not utlizing the full spectrum of the original package they paid for. They also were paying for upgrades that did not have to be done as they are not a fortune 500 company and it was way more expensive then it should have been but they were leading this project with hr director who had no know ledge of payroll systemsthe people were very nice and I enjoyed the work load expectancy for such a demanding company. Also the training on the type of work was very diligent and concise with what we were dealing with.I had a great experience with Stryker. Its a wonderful company with a supportive team. Your days are incredibly long and its not a typical sales job. It is very service heavy. You will learn a ton and feel incredibly accomplished.Stryker is a stable and secure company in Kalamazoo, MI. If your looking for a job with benefits, then this is a good place to work.Start at 6AM and built basic hospital beds. Medium paced work environment, and laid back. Management was wonderful. Hardest part was big orders and a certain deadline. Most enjoyable part was the people and the environment.Stryker is a great company to work for and the upper management and staff are very professional, friendly and willing to help new employees. Overall, the company offers a lot and it provides an opportunity to develop and learn new skills. The company promotes a great job culture.Stryker is a solid company that is growing everyday.  The culture of people plus benefits makes this a great place to work and grow.  They are part of the Healthcare Industry that will always have great job security.Pretty easy job.  the hardest part is working with needy doctors and hospital staff.  the compensation is great for fresh out of college students.  this is a good stepping stone for any medical sale positionStryker is a rapidly growing company. They purchased Bechtold and merged the company together. There is a lot to learn and there is no shortage of work. What you will also get a micromanaging and cuts on overtime. Management has also gone through change and its not lick the old Stryker. It's starting to feel like whats more important is the micromanagement of employees and cut backs.Each employee seeks to drive one another. While it is competitive there is cohesiveness among employees. All are expected to work and achieve outside their current role and develop themselves.Sales staff worked well with office employees.  Management was open to communication with support staff.  The typical day included answering incoming calls from both customers and sales force, data entry, filing and other administrative duties.Very bureaucratic. Hard to get anything done fast. Upper level management is tough to get in touch with to get anything done. Earning potential is very very good. Doubtful many people would put up with the work without the pay. The ones that do well in this business work from 6 in the morning until 7 at night. Working in the OR and not behind a desk is a great benefit if you hate working in a cube like me.Large company so very slow decision making processes but very overall a wonderful company to work for.  They are progressive and always expanding.This is a great place to work the work is easy the people are friendly I look forward to being here and learning more about the company and what they have to offer I also think this would be a great places to work 30+ yearsI really like this job, First thing good for my health, because health is better , I can work better , Future is good, Environment is also good.distribution is one team. like family member.This is a productive and fun work environment. Co-workers become like family. Management has a very hands on approach to working with everyone and they believe in promoting from within.hard work and interesting tasks, excellent treatment the employee with very good security, good supervision, a lot of teamwork, sold good variety of foodCoordinated team and resolved the difficulties which we faced during validating the products and trained the workers about the measurement systems etc.It was good experience. I met a lot of very nice people. I would definable work there again. Very good company. Filled with opportunity, growth and chances.Stryker is really all about the people.  It is staffed with very hard working people who uphold a culture of ethics and compliance while meeting a demanding work load.  Stryker repays its employees with generous benefits and salary.  Employees know they are appreciated for their hard work.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,Fremont,CA,2016-11-30T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/6e64f4d2-878f-493c-b376-066c6cc1a5c1?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

700,2104.0,Toxicologist,Chevron,4.1,1200.0,"At the Colfax location, you deal with rude customers, a lot of heavy lifting and busy work. The coworkers are great but the management favors certain workers and cuts them a lot of slack while being hard on the rest.Great place to work and develop. Job is flexible, opportunity to travel. Could be less hierarchical and while some places are micro managed others allow for plenty of breathing roomVery good company I enjoy working for with amazing benefits, wonderful pay and excellent structure.  Truly the best company I have ever worked for.We were a small team of people working together. There was never a lack of communication or any problems. the cash registers worked well, i had good hours and decent pay. A lot of times I would be able to get off early because of hard work and was treated as good as i was at my job.Its a ok place to work during the day. It gets scary sometimes at night because u never know whats going to happen but it was also due to the location i was in. I loved seeing the new faces and also my regulars that came in. The owner was a very lovely person. I enjoyed conversation with her.A typical day at work was very repetitive with working with customer sales and store cleanliness. Clerks learned how to handle cash and customer service as well as stocking the shelves for future purchases. The management team was very willing to work for their employees. Most of the co-workers were willing to accomplish their job effectively.It was a great and laid back shift. The people who I worked with were great and it was just a relaxed environment. When it was bought out however, it just wasn't the same and u was forced to quit because of upset between myself and the new ownerWhen I worked as a contractor for chevron I was surprised about the instability of the work environment.  During my time there I slowly saw benefits I was promised be taken away with the instability of the field of work.  Over time the things I had appreciated about the job disappeared and I was left with the realization that this is no longer a company I would like to work for.* A typical day at work is helping the customers with their every needs.* Management was very friendly and productive.* The most enjoyable part of the job was that i got to help my customers.Abundant opportunities to be exposed to, and be involved with exciting subsurface opportunities across the globe. Highly skilled workforce, open to sharing their work and mentoring othersExcellent workplace culture, stressing safety, performance, and inclusionIt's a cool company to work for bein that I been there a whole year and the work and life balance is really suitable. Depending on the area, life and work balance differs along with pay.It's a private owned gas station but the  owners are amazing they treat you like family, they always try to help in anyway they can weather is be personal or work related. The customers are so friendly and nice.I enjoyed working with the onsite manager. I think they should appreciate employees more and the good things they do. They need some incentives for employees. Overall it was alright.Great work environment, Team orientation and lots of team efforts. Great work culture to work for and a balance work and life style. Team motivation. Team FocusIt's a workplace with lots of talented and nice people, fun to work at.  Generally the Company provides employees opportunities to grow and find their best interest to suit for business.Chevron is one of the BEST companies I have had the pleasure to work for. Very close staff. Everyone pulls for each other. The benefits are great. My hours are perfect. Unfortunately this BU is closing down and going to Questa Mine site. There the project will go into reclamation. I have learned so many skills with Chevron and they always encourage me to learn more. My supervisor is great and my coworker are assume.It was great working there. Great pay and you see celebrities every now and then. It stays fast pace during the summer and spring. But during the winter and fall, it's slow.I have worked here for 2 years now and have become very familiar with the company, and what is expected with the company. I have worked as management here and feel the company has provided me with great opportunities to excel and further pursue my career.Chevron is a very fast paced environment that requires attention to detail and team work skills. In my five years of employment with this company I learned most of the skills I know and use today. The hardest part of any job is to not complete a task and leave it for the next shift to complete this happens quite often in this company because everyday there are new task and deadlines to be met.I enjoyed working at the Chevron because there was so much to do. It wasn't your typical gas station. Attached was the A&W restaurant which I also worked whenever I was scheduled there. My managers were however lazy, except for one, which led to hostility among other employees.This company is great to work for. It offers competitive pay and advancement opportunities. The owner cares about the well-being of his employees. the company offers incentives.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,San Ramon,CA,2016-10-06T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/ba9cf4c5-7721-4919-b6a5-10cee92ce23a?mescoid=1900254001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

719,2123.0,Material Scientist Intern,TE Connectivity,3.9,569.0,"I'm a productive person who is focused on my quality of work and work at a steady pace. I time myself so I will know how long it will take to get a specific job done.I love overtime and only take days/nights off when absolutely necessary. I am able to work as a team or individually.TE Connectivity, as a whole, is a great company to work for with nearly unlimited opportunities for advancement!  (I've experienced this on a personal level.)That being said, it has the same issues that every other world-wide corporation has, particularly clueless management.  As with most large corporations, there are far too many ""Professional Managers"" that get hired from outside and do not understand what they are even managing.....they only know metrics, spreadsheets, and dollars, but couldn't answer the first question about what any given employee does in a day.Apart from this, TE always has an open ear for constructive criticism or ideas for improvement.  As stated initially, if you want to move forward with the company, you can; it just may take a little extra effort!Times have changed and company is more focused on hiring from the outside as opposed to promoting from within.  The people that have been there awhile are good people and work hard but are extremely under appreciated.The job gave me great experience working under a Manager. The site under TE took advantage of temporaries, which included myself, by never making us full time employees in their company. Not until Commscope bought the site that we were then able to become full time employees. Being a temp for three years with no vacations or benefits was a big draw back.Company offers great benefits. Also 3 shifts, and they are global so if you are willing to travel the world this is a great company to do so. TE makes connectors for all electric parts.fun workplace and nice coworkers. I work 5 days a week . very motivated people. great boss . good benefits. very busy companyA typical day at work involves sitting in one spot all day performing the same mind-numbing procedure every day. Communication between management and employees is seriously lacking. There are rewards for meeting production goals like money, food, and fun events.TE Connectivity is a decent company. I personally don't like Customer Service so I hate the job, though my management team is good. The Product Information Center has a lot of job security, though don't apply if you don't like Customer Service; it's a call center.A typical day was productive. I learned a lot about blueprints and stamping presses. The management and co-workers we're fair. The hardest part was getting along with everyone. The most enjoyable was knowing my family was provided for.Over all it was a good place to work, but there is a high turn over and several RIF's over my 8 years there. During the time I was there two new plants in Mexico were build and opened, this caused jobs in the US to be relocated.TE Connectivity has a very competitive salary and great locations to work. They taught me a lot about having a career and a day-to-day life of being an employee.Some people should have been shown the door years ago, and others work extremely hard after over 30 years of service to the company.  There are very many layers of management, and more are being added.  There are 60,000 employees, and directing and managing that many employees is not a task every company is up for. The CEO said he wanted to do right by the employees they were laying off, and it seems that they have been, so that's nice.  Let's face it, the company is famous for layoffs in the local area. There is so much room for growth inside of the IT organization in the future, because there are people that would love to optimize and fine-tune it and blow away expectations.  But for now there is just do more with less.  They also don't want to hear what the employees have to say.I am surrounded by hard workers who are knowledgeable and love to laugh, and like long walks by the beach.Work day is very busy and can be unexpected work from day to day, especially depending on the time of year.  Annual enrollment is a extremely busy time.  I am responsible for all funding in benefits area including Health & Welfare and Retirement both 401(k) and Pension. I am the point of contact for employee questions when our benefits center needs information verified or approved.I found TE to be a reasonably pleasant place to work. However, there always seemed to be layoffs going on at any given time. I didn't know anyone who felt secure about their job. It seemed like no matter how driven you were, or how good your work was, you were always on the chopping block.It seemed to me that instead of building and keeping a team of people at the top of their game who would help to make the company profitable and capable of meeting customer needs, it is a company being run by accountants who's only concern is the budgetary goals of the current quarter. Just my two cents.we are just now half way through our fiscal year and have had week long furloughs 5 of the 6 months. the job is good but I would like a full time job not part timeSad to say it is not a great company to work for.  No communication.Pay is not good for the work that is required.  The facility I worked closed but not one time did we get a visit from Upper Management to at least communicate to us or even ask for people to stay with the company.  The Site Manager at the facility was not forthcoming with information and very unfair in treatment of some of the employees It is sad that this company took a group of hard working employees and let them go without even a handshake.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the great people I worked with.  They were AWSOME.Campus Management is fairly consistent.  Immediate Supervisor is knowledgeable and helpful and interested in those who report to him.  As with any large company, communication is a challenge and we could do better in that area.  The most enjoyable part of my job is finding and fixing clerical/numerical errors that affect the outcome of the information that keeps our work centers operational.Great place to work ,but moving out of country,So sad to see it go . This company was around in NC and SC providing jobs for over 40 yrs.My shift was a week end shift which gave me lots of time for my family.My coworkers were great teemmates.The worst part was the 45 min,drive after comp,moved to SC from NC. My skills as a machinist in tool and die and in injection molding is the best tool given to me to support my family.good place to work.. good atmosphere.good relationship between employee and management. will consider a life time career if offered the opportunity.Wonderful place to work. Great people who work together to get things done. TE is very good about promoting from within, which I`m a firm believer in that. Hardest part of this position is component shortages, and getting them here asap. I enjoy the fact that we have an "" engagement team "" that plans dinners, parties, heart walks, etc., that we can participate in. And programs set up to help the community. Many regrets that the facility is closing.The years of downsizing made it worrysome if you will have a job.  Many of the jobs were sent to Mexico and China.  The company is very high tech and produce quality product, but the job security made in tough.  Raises were far and few between.. Our department, and other depts. went seven years without a raise.",,Palo-Alto,FREMONT,CA,2016-10-27T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/677280ce-cede-4ff7-a2f0-147b441b3bfe?mescoid=1900260001001&jobPosition=21,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
