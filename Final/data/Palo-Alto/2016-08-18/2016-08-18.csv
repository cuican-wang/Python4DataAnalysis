229,1633.0,"Scientist, Antibody Engineering",Theranos,3.5,18.0,"enjoyed my time with this company, typical work week. Management was great, fun co-workers. great job over all now I am on to better opportunities.I liked working for this company. I was involved in many projects and they had technology new to me. Unfortunately legal lssues made this company lay off many employees.Theranos has a start-up feel to the company and many people have to opportunity to create and engage in projects that they may have never done before. I have grown as a laboratory professional greatly from the experience Theranos has provided me.This job was a great job for entry level applicants and provided experience and advancement to my career. The upper management recognized potential and grows the people that showed drive.The environment was positive and we worked together to help each other succeed.  The typical day included performing venipuncture techniques to collect samples from guests, and preparing them for lab analysis.  The position was very enjoyable and management was very supportive.Good work culture. Nice place to work. Start up culture, very talented people highly motivate and product driven company. 9:00AM-6:30PM official work hoursWorking with Theranos had a great environment and great co-workers. I would gladly work with them again if operation in Arizona took place. I appreciated what my supervisor did as for his job incorporated. He was a great supervisor.By-far this has been the best company I have worked for. The employees here are amazing! A group of people who want to show up to work each day to provide the best experience for our guests and help in every way we can.unfortunately to secretive and lied to so many people.  Should have been a great thing for the patients who could have benefited from this fabulous thingI love the fact that my employer is an understanding one.  I go to school and they work with me on that.  I really appreciate everything they do.  Great place to work.This company is a high demand company that challenges you every day. It is a high energy culture with great people to work with and competitive benefits and pay.Sit in a room all day with nothing to do. Very low volume for patients. Favortism shown by management. No room for advancement.This is a great company with a lot of potential. But management shows favoritism towards individuals and it greatly noticed. The hours are constantly changing and over time is mandatory. You sit by yourself in a room for 8-12 hours. You are lucky to get 1 day off. Youdon't have a life while working here. On a positive note the pay is decent. You get to be part of a new and expanding company and interact with lots of different people.The company does not communicate well. There is basically no room for advancement and they hire in batches. There are no ""coworkers"" you work alone inside a room and your lucky to see 5 patients a day.  The hardest part of the job is sitting in a room for nine hours six days a week literally doing nothing productive.Very good company to work with and they provide free food breakfast, lunch and dinner.People here are very nice and creative, the working environment is also very energetic. However, the management team doesn't always have a clear goal and makes some bad decisions.Commute is too far. Should be an excellent company to grow with if their management is more professional, not too much political issues.Long shifts, six some times seven days a week. Decent pay but, no room to grow. Sit in a room alone with nothing to do, lucky to see 5 patients a day.",201 to 500,Palo-Alto,Palo Alto,CA,2016-08-18T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/9ff40f4e-2911-4071-bc73-d4729c629587?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=21,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
