143,1547.0,Services Data Scientist,"Agilent Technologies, Inc.",4.2,270.0,"I had the privilege of working with great people. Would recommend others to work here. I worked here for almost five years.Agilent was a temporary position that allowed me to explore the world of technology. It allowed me to use my IT education to assist in helping customers. Coworker in particular spent 70% of time on Facebook, Facetime and talking on cellphone (no exaggeration) which was distressing to see especially when as a new worker I had to go to her when a question arose and had to wait till she finished.This job help me understand the importance of handling material and delivering chemicals in a timely need matter. A typical days job requires you to, cycle count weekly reagents, SAP transactions, working with buyers, planning weekly pick-ups with the vendor.Agilent is a good place to work and corporate management has secured a competitive edge in many of the products that are manufactured. The facilities are excellent.Acquired by Modis.  Talented and innovative technology professionals—and the companies they work for—drive today's rapidly evolving IT industry. At Modis, we help the industry continue to advance by connecting the best tech talent with the most rewarding companies—creating a win-win situation.Agilent is a solid company with good prospects.  They have made some good business moves in the divestitures.  The management is experienced and and seem to be executing on a good strategy.I thoroughly enjoyed my position and the interfacing with other division people that went along with my responsibilities.  An excellent place to seek employment.Great job which involves sales of chemical analysis equipment. The job entails calls and faxes to get service contracts. For the equipment that we sell and make the quota each month for total revenue.I was fresh out of college when I started at Agilent and the team took me on with open arms.  This was a great place to learn and develop my career, as the entire company was welcoming and helpful.Though the work itself can become a little tedious, this is a wonderful place to work. The culture at agilent is amazing, and all of the employees are always ready to help with anything.The variety of work assignments for this position made it an interesting and dynamic job.  There was always something new to learn and manage, whether it was information driven or technology driven.  The diversity of assignments and the opportunity to work with a global team made it a great experience.Not competitive in today's market, claims wants to be a leader in the life sciences arena. Has a long way to go!I love my job my job with Agilent and look forward to many years of employment within the company. The company has a great work life balance..Good company to work for with a nice, clean, temperature controlled environment with a good work/life balance. Competitive and comparable salaries and benefits to other companies in the area.productive and fun workplace with ping pong tableI had a great work life balanceGreat coworkers and work environmentHaving too many levels in organization, slow pace, silo culture.Agilent is making good move to change the business environments to words chemical devices. that seems where the future going.Typical work day was taking service call from customers.  Equipment serviced was HP servers, storage units, disk arrays and network equipment.  It was a tuff job because of all the travel but a good experience over all.Agilent is a left behind branch of HP.  Its continuous struggle to modernize it's culture is plagued by the old HP residual culture which supports large unaccountable layer of bureaucracy that suppresses innovative spirit.  Having a great idea is not good enough and often innovator is intimidated by those who is not accountable for any relevant task.  This company culture reminds me of communism, job security means 100% brown-nosing your superior and learn how to hide in plane site with lessez-fair.  Agilent needs new leadership blood, same people cannot improve its old culture because they don't know what to change to.  Agilent needs to redefine itself form ""Old HP"" image, it needs at least to be ""New HP"".Technical marketing was a rather laid back environment. It included supportive management and had a plethora of resources and mentors to help out with any questions, concepts, or issues. While I worked there most of the employees were probably in their 40's and up, and had families. Overall the company was enjoyable, but the work I did wasn't really something I wanted to continue doing.I love working for Agilent total respect for its managers and everything else. The harder I worked the more benefits I receieved.It is a great company to work with if you have already developed a career. Products are amazing but internal infrastructure needs work.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,Santa Clara,CA,2016-09-30T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/5eea60b1-3e6a-411c-80ba-8e7f36db600c?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
