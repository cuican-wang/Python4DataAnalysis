70,1474.0,Staff Data Scientist,Tesla Motors,3.6,320.0,"Great Company to work for. They take good care of their employees. Everyday seems to go buy very fast, it's a fast paced work place. Many of people enjoy the atmosphere.First off , it is not Tesla Motors, It's Tesla Electric : Tesla Electric is a very young company in Sulphur , La. which has had it's growing pains but is coming into it's own. The work place is very friendly , yet professional, one of teaching and learning while putting out very high quality work in the residential and commercial electrical arena. I would reccomend Tesla to anyone wanting a high quality electrical finished product. Tesla Electric performs much bigger than it is.Geat place to work, the people are very experienced there talents. Helps you grow into a better, more reliable person. The hardest part is being there for 12 hrs and only get a 15 minute break but you get used to it. The work was very easy when you leaned it. The pack line was the easiest to work. The assembly line was tough but when you do it a lot it comes easier.great place to workgood managementsatisfactiongood learning experinancegood team supportplace to implement ideasgood cafateria n nice food n recreationGreat place to work !!!!!!!!!You can to learning and enjoy your job every day .My managers do excelent job too.The benefits is good .Working for Tesla was an opportunity of a life time and I miss it every day. It was awesome being part of something great to help improve our environment. However I was promised a lot when i took the job, but Tesla's management never followed through with there word. I also was injured off the job and Tesla would not modify my position temporarily until I healed and was just let go.The best work ethics I have ever seen. Most people would push for getting things done and are not very political. Work-life balance is poor (in Body in White at least), management would push for quick return but undermine sustainability of employees. Burned out employees will only stay for a year or two max. Great learning opportunity for employees, but because of the non-sustainable attitude, most employees would not last long.Tesla is a fast change place, and we are improving all the timeChallenges are huge all the timeGreen companyHi Tech CompanyGreat opportunity learning variety of skills. working here was a great experience and you get to meet different people everyday and the majority of people are all very nice, although you gain many skills and definitely have good income working there, if you want a job as well as a social life and be able to have time for outside of work activities or such especially if you are not a local to the area this would not be able to mix well together since the majority of people working here are required to work a maximum of 70 hours a week, about 12 hours a day.Highly Demanding and well respected job with little compensation and benefits. Tesla had so many great employees that were simply chased away due to Tesla's negligence.Great place to work with a nice balance of work and home. I worked four twelve hour shifts with three days off a week. Starting pay was $17.00 an hour with a raise every six months of about a dollar. However you are on your feet for just about your whole shift and some of the management can be hard to work with at times, but definitely a great job to be at.Regular 8 hour shifts with optional overtime. Management not the brightest but also not the worst. Overall you are given the tasks and are expected to complete them before the days end.The only issue is the amount of hours required to work there. There is no way to balance the work life and your personal life.I learned many valuable skills about working in a production environment by spending three years at the Tesla factory. The most enjoyable part of working there was being part of a growing company, and having a chance to see some cutting edge technology.Tesla is fast paced and dynamic.  Everyone is driven by the Mission which makes the work day easier to focus on the overall goal.  Brilliant people working towards a better future.Its a very good place to work , very good benefits  and pay. The only down side is that they have really long hours and hardly higher girls. My experience here was incrediblethe most enjoyable part was the staff. a typical work day consist of maning your post and placing parts on cars specific to the manifest instructions.Tesla Motors is by far the best place to work. Not only are you working for very luxurious vehicle company but also very technologically advance. Working for Tesla was very rewarding.Tesla is a exacly place start your carrier off pays very well and lots of overtime. If you do have alot time on your hands i recommend tesla motors for youThe management was a bit lazy and unorganized but the people that worked there were very kind. There are a lot of people who took the work for granted and gave up on the quality of work.Great company to work for, every day is a new experience, Co-workers are the best. The Hardest part of the job is you never know what is next for you.","1,001 to 5,000",Palo-Alto,Palo Alto,CA,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/fe91d2a9-5160-4178-9df4-e7308fed187f?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

119,1523.0,Data Scientist,CA Technologies,3.8,432.0,"Too many layers of management that are greatly disjointed from the overall teams.  Poor communication and no training=stress.  Lots of it.  Constant change. Unrealistic goals and  strategies.   GREAT people and culture, though.  Flexible schedule is admirable makes for better production.Love CA Technologies and their work/life balance. You do not accrue vacation or sick time so time off is subject to manager approval. A good manager will allow plenty of time off. Finance department has half day Fridays over the summer (Memorial day - Labor day).CA is not growing and retention rates are high so opportunities to advance are limited.Everyday was busy -- negotiating contracts with outside clients, reviewing, writing and closing large software deals.  Constantly learning new information through research and dialogue with stakeholders.  My co workers were absolutely great -- very supportive. We worked well as a team.  Hardest part of the job, or should I say challenging part of the job was finalizing a contract to the satisfaction of the client and bringing value to the deal. The most enjoyable part of the job was working and negotiating the deal in order to finalize a good contract between the parties.Overall an average place to work. Sometimes felt that there was just enough work to keep everyone occupied but not enough down time to develop better ways to make things run smoother. The environment is, at times, hostile. This place is not for the thin-skinned. There is a serious lack of training materials provided by the management.Wonderful experience, great people, great people development, great W2 potential, huge customer base, wonderful resources, unbelievable Club Trip destinations, leverage points galore to make business happen.I have worked with better,  more caring people, but very seldom.From the day I hired on they made me feel like family.  I would still be there today if the management (which had just changed just before I was layed off) would have done their homework to see what I did.  The amount of money they saved by laying me off pailed in comparison to the money they invested in my training.The working environment is structured in more of the standard office cubicle layout than other typical software companies in Silicon Valley. Had lots of virtual meetings.The management team has a very clear vision, the company is constantly changing to meet this vision.The team I work with are great professionals and always willing to help.Work and life balance is very good as long as you plan ahead there should be no issues at all !!The only way to advance at CA is to self-promote and manage up.  Workers who keep their heads down and get the job done are routinely overlooked, overworked and taken for granted.Great place to work with lots of opportunities to advance. Large company with great benefits, including 5 weeks of paid time off to start. Layoff every year to weed out poor performers.Very fun culture, preaching hard and dedicated work that is incentivized by casual Friday bagels, quarter beer o'clock Thursdays, and company wide awareness projects. The sales atmosphere has a very high turnover rate, due to constant change to sales strategy. (Some people around the office joked about  CA meaning ""Change Always""). Management is mediocre at best, promoting leaders that are not necessarily competent, but are noticed by top management (who are not around often enough to see the actual day-to-day employee work ethic).Ability to make a lot of money - no cap on commission up to 35,000 on top of salary, which is definitely a blessing.Internal promotion is a possibility as long as you (once again) get noticed by top management. In this environment, networking trumps competence any day.Co-workers are great, friendly and helpful.While at CA, I learned several different programs; policies and communication skills. The hardest part of my job was dealing with a team located in different time zones. The best part of my job is the people I work with.I started working at CA Technologies as an intern right out of college. I always felt welcome amongst my team and was given the opportunity to take on new tasks and responsibilities rapidly. This definitely helped me grow in my career, and I got to me some excellent people on the way. However, I have my doubts about the company's long term vision and every year there is the threat of layoffs. CA Technologies gave me an excellent foundation to continue my career as a software engineer.CA Technologies is undergoing a tremendous transformation since the acquisition of Rally Software. The business is being significantly more innovative and proactively engaging it's employees for feedback.I consider CA  great place to work, and believe it is good choice for most people.There's great job security here and I love what I do.  They give you a lot of opportunity to grow as a person and in respect to your professional career.  Everyone is super nice and has the up-most respect for one another - very collaborative workplace.Great Work Environment, They have an site montessori daycare and gym. You'll learn a vast knowledge of different software that they develop and supportMore training would benefit employees and managers.Everyone is pleasant to work with but very seriousQuiet atmosphereNot run as a technology company.  Too many layers of management.   A collaborative environment where everyone is looking out for themselves.No vision in technology. Focused on old mainframe run rate business.I learned first hand  the duties of a Security Operations analyst. I learned how to handle different alerts and asking for help when I was stuck. Management and the team members are great and helped when they can.Days are busy with many different responsibilities to attend too.There is a constant influx of new technology and ideas to better the workplace.Stressful place to work. Moving up is difficult and management is old school. Typical corporate machine. Frequent and grueling over time, but depending on the group you are in you are usually rewarded that time back.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,Santa Clara,CA,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/30917066-13bd-4afd-924c-ff0e38c18f2a?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Worked with military, government and contractor personnel.Advancement is a little tough with senior positions exclusively filled externally. Work life balance doesn't exist for field personnel.

Maybe if an employee is absent or they don't have enough crew then you will get picked. I believe everyone deserves a fair chance.Fun, small company. Not sure how to culture has changed after SAIC buyout.""We help all people live healthy lives"" is what they claim to be their motto, but they left out the part UNLESS you are a BD employee. If you have car trouble and over an hour late it counts the same as night coming at all: so might as well just take an entire day.Work was not that hard but not flexible if you need time off for emergencies.Coworkers back stab so be careful who you trust.Pros it's Monday - Friday for MOST departments.The company got bought by SAIC and I made a good bit of money. Other than that, I'd prefer to not discuess my old employer.",,Palo-Alto,Menlo Park,CA,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/53e9bc82-83c8-47f3-ac49-7cdaf656e916?mescoid=1900254001001&jobPosition=27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
280,1684.0,Senior Scientist - Analytical Chemistry,Georgia-Pacific,3.6,968.0,"Learned a lot and became a more well rounded maint. man because the troubleshooting required me to think on my feet and being the only one on shift I didn't have a way to pass the buck.Excellent workplaceGood benefitsGrowthEqual opportunityFast paceFairFair payTeam workerTeam playersSafe workplaceCompetitive benefits package. Supports various skills training for employees. Long term satisfied employees, low turn over rate.It's very easy to use and fun. I think that I will be using this frequently. I'm excited very to find employment thru this app. I will recommend this app to all my friends and family.The typical day of work was constant. Always something to get accomplished and work on. I learned several new trades while helping maintenance department. The hardest part of the job was the work environment. The workers do not work well with others.Plant closed down so not really much I can say. Too many management changed at the end. That was the downfall, employes worked hard and did there best.Good name, great company. Great people to work WITH.Overall this was a great place to work, just needed a better management structure. Alot of favoritism and nepetism in key places.The hardest part of the job was dealing with the management.Certain rules only apply to certain employees at certain times. The most ejoyable part of the job was the job itself.I have enjoyed my work experience there. I always came to work with only the intentions to do my job. I got along with everybody because I mostly stayed to myself. I enjoyed making my own money.Work is not hard at all and compensation is wonderful management from plant manager down to shift leads are the biggest downfall of the job.  They way people are treated here is ridiculously sad.With out a doubt, one of the worst companies I have ever worked for.  A number of times they have forgotten to buy raw materials for the machinery.  They are big on grandiose plans, but in the end, nothing materializes.  They union drags their feet renegotiating the contract, not the company.  The plant is run very lean, but management treats themselves to expensive lunches every Friday.  Run, don't walk away.Could be more generous around holidays for employees too boost moral for more positive production numbers for the following year,incetives for milestones . Safety needs to be of more importance. To keep business thriving safe work plant is great for business.great place to work. it was a very safe and productive place to work. I would recommend this place to others.  I really don't know what else I can say about it.Very Hot summers, Very Cold Winters. Unorganized in management. Company is very strict on safety procedures. Many opportunities for raises. Co-Workers are friendly.Hard To Advance In This Company , Management needs a little work and understand the hard work that the employees put in also it should be more of a flexible scheduleIts were I started in a industrial environment, learned alot from my Co workers and was able to advance in my mechanical career.Dirty, hot, fiberglass everywhere, management doesnt care about you or how many days you work or hours and cry if you ask for a day off if you worked a 6 week day. If you are new theyll make you do everything just because they have seniority issues and think just because they been there for a few year they dont have to do there job. I was maintenance with ATS worst company to work for i would not recommend this either of these companies for a long term career just stepping stones. Oh and also would tell you to hurry up on your 30 min lunch break when ypu had no breaks all day.Management will twist you any way they want then kick you to the curb when they are through with you. The most unhappy workforce i have ever seen in my life, everyone is over worked to the point of numbness. Probation for 90 days, do not be sick or miss even an hour for anything or you are gone.You never know from one day to the next what your schedule is.Very productive and fun to work for.I learned that some of the chemistry that I learned in high school applied to the job.Management was great. They work with you to ensure you,re getting trained for all task being performed. The co-workers were easy to get along with and we enjoy working together. The hardest part of the job gauges, valves, and all the product being made and where they're stored. The most enjoyable part of the job was our product improvement team brainstorming along with R&D to improve our product and reduce batch time. Also the company picnics were great. Everyone bring their family and we get to know each other.You work for your pay check and thats it. they could care less about you. Supervisors only care about being the top dog in production. employees do not get scheduled breaks you ""break when you can"" which sometimes means you just dont get one.Good interaction with peers, limited with upper management.Business development with IT options.Co-workers were mostly very conscientiousExcessive meetingsDifficult to get consensus on decisionsWorking with customers and production facilities was most enjoyable.Union Job but no sick day, have to work all holidays, inclement weather if not you get a point against you after 4 points you get suspended even with doctor's note.  There is so much work that the trainers are really unable to train new people properly.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,HAYWARD,CA,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/4ce18792-1bf7-44cd-8785-db0f8253db87?mescoid=1900245001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
