202,1606.0,Data Analytics Developer,Samsung SDSA,3.9,10.0,"strong Korean culture is something that can be adjusted a little as a global company. respectful relationship between upper management and subordinates.I was a contractor when for a 1 month project after 3 weeks staying at Samsung my Supervisor decided to hire me a contractor Helpdesk Technician. until after 1.5 yrs, i got promoted to be come a system administrator / service deck specialist.You experience different things, experienced different task that can help you improve your skillsyour team are very friendly and they motivate you to improve and challenge yourself to do better.Best: Work independently and proper training.Worst: Very long contract position, I was not offered salary and benefits when they told me I would.I have worked with Samsung SDS for more than 5 years. I managed all Technology solutions and a team of 10 support technicians and engineers for their North American and Canadian Contact Centers. I managed multiple simultaneous customer projects for local center improvements as well as call flow and applications support and changes. Our team is responsible for monitoring real-time operations as well as Data Center services.Environment is professional, many stuff to learn since you are responsible for most of the things, flexibility to do home office, sometimes working hours exceeded 12 hrs a day as per project requires.Good people with a od company culture; very strong job security!It has been very energetic working environment with good leadership and challenging projects...The typical day at work consists of a lot of excel work. I manage 3 Warehouses (where the Samsung products are stored and shipped out of) so I run my daily batch reports with the new loads that shipped out the day before. I am in charge of making sure that the carrier's invoice is matched with what Samsung is saying it should be -- based on the contract. Within 10 months with the company, I was chosen by my manager to join and lead a group of people for a special logistics project. After 2 months of hardcore training, the project fell through due to complications with the headquarters. The group that I was supposed to lead were fortunate enough to transfer over to different departments and I am now helping with other miscellaneous tasks within the office -- more report analysis/reporting to my manager. The hardest part of this job is that I feel that there is no opportunity to advance. Because of Samsung's cultural background, I feel that work ethic and performance cannot provide the advancement and reward that any hard working employee should receive. I will always be grateful for the amazing opportunity to work for a Fortune 500 Company right after undergrad, but I believe that any hardworking individual should be rewarded. It is going to be really hard to leave my co-workers behind as they have been there to guide and assist me with reports, daily work, or simply everyday-life-advice. I will always remember my daily 3:30PM walks with my department girls. In summary, I believe that my hard work ethic and ability to exceed expectations should be recognized and  more... rewarded.  lessResearching cutting edge technologiesCommunication between USA and KoreaDiversified employeesOffices in San Jose and New JerseyA typical day was mostly attending support tickets to fix bugs in the application. Hardly any team meetings.I was mostly working individually. Once I was familiar with the application, It was easy to work in here. It was a pretty laid back atmosphere. My co-workers were very sweet and helpfull. The hardest part of my job was not to get bored doing almost the same things.Overall teamwork environment .Assignments were well planned and taken care always .",,Palo-Alto,San Jose,CA,2016-09-29T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/7b085d8d-94a0-4d35-af61-2362d52706e1?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=29,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
