80,1484.0,Data Scientist - (Job Number: 00125153),Intuit Inc,4.2,478.0,"SaaS division backed up by a national financial software organization. QuickBase is easily recognized by the Intuit name and invests heavily in its employeesGreat company to work for, benefits are great when you are a full time agent. Even seasonal's were treated with the same respect. The management was not the best within training, and you were led on about advancement opportunities. Training was not enough for the type of job you were doing But overall the company is great and so are the managers, just needs to learn to manage time better and to be more direct with advancement opportunities instead of lying just to keep people on board,- Bold innovation happening in all facets of the company, not just in products.- The most amazing culture I have worked in my career.- Incredibly smart peers and humble leadership.- Lots of opportunities to learn and grow your career.- Awesome campus & employee benefits/perks.There are many tasks and challenges to manage working at Intuit.  The company and culture is one of the best I have ever worked at.  No only does your direct team have the ability to work with each other to work on a requirement, team members from other divisions are also willing if called upon.  I love the social part of Intuit. They have a few company parties throughout the year that really gets teams mingling.  The CEO and others are visible and talk with everyone.  It's like I said, unlike any other company I have worked with!Intuit is great work place and very good culture.They build great products and good work life balance.Compensation is very competitive as well.Not very much political Red tape.Intuit has good work culture and an egaged employee force. It is trying to become fast paced and more technology focused. There is focus on developing the products the right way.Most incompetent team members got a promotion this year. The smart, hard working ones leave regularly. Top-bottom culture, where managers like to micromanage and engineers obey the hierarchy more than anything.Intuit was a great place to work. However things re very slow and management is poor. Too many middle managers with constant change seem to distort company objectives and goals. Not so concerned about employees as they portray themselves to be. Benefits are great! Some of the best that I have ever had. It seems like people who work there enjoy it and want to work there. I wish there was more of a unique and distinct culture that would set it apart in a better way - a livelier way.It's a great place to work. It's a good fit for me and the skill sets I have.  The culture/environment of this company is a good one. I  have learned much while working here, and have applied myself and taken the initiative to improve processes, efficiency and accuracy of what we do by developing QuickBase apps for inventory management of the Data Centers, creating Data Center and Rack Planning Diagrams, Temperature Maps and various other advanced spreadsheet/graph reports for the company.  I've installed UCS/bare metal, Hadoop, NetApp and EMC systems, etc.  Besides server installs & decomms I acquired more experience in the Facilities side with PDU""s, CRACs, Cooling Towers, Sensaphone Alerts, Leak Detection, Alarm systems, etc.I've provided information and documentation for the auditors in regards to asset management, drive erase compliance, e-waste, etc. And I've got to work with Sys Engineers, Networking, DevOps and Hosting Operations staff along the way.  The only reason I'm seeking new opportunities is because I am a contractor here with no benefits.7 year employee, moved out of state, would still be there if I could! Awesome benefits & high base $$ plus commission, great people, in depth training, good support from trainers & supervisors.Management ignores many things that occur. Supervisors lack knowledge and only promote friends. Knowledge is ignored. Managers ignore employees that want to expand their knowledge for the benefit of the company.benefits and people mak ethe job such a good place to work as well as managements willingness to help you succeed at your goalsGood new college graduate job, good people, and decent work life balance.  Management enjoyment is dependent on your manager like any other roleGreat place for retirement. Stay away if you* want to grow (develop) your career* enjoy fast paced and competitive environment* are a team player* want to make a difference* believe in changeIntuit was a wonderful place to work. Everyone was very supportive and encouraging. Management always pushed everyone to do their best to give employees their best shot advancing.Intuit allows the employees to be paid for doing charity work as well. Many opportunities to do individual and group.A typical day included working with many customers with their payroll and any related questions or issues. Helping others and others helping you when needed. A great conferring of knowledge.When the location where I worked closed Intuit was very helpful with job assistance and making sure the transition was easy as it could be.Truly a work hard and play hard place to work. The employees were energized and goal oriented. It was not just get the job done, but get it down right.I wish I still worked there, great culture, very smart and professional people, great compensation and benefits. Publicly traded and locations nation-wideThere were good benefits and a good salary. But when Intuit acquired Demandforce, there was micromanagement. Overall, I would recommend the company to somebody else.Typical day at work, answer phones. Some calls last several hours. While I did learn a lot independently, the management support was taken away after restructure, and I was told I asked too many questions. The coworkers are nice, and probably the best part of the job. The hardest part of this job is the expectation to be perfect, outgoing at all times, and to maintain good scores when there is not enough support to satisfy the client. The most enjoyable part is definitely your coworkers.Call center location with multiple business units allows flexibility to move around and work on different projects. Good work life balance and benefits.The culture here is awesome. A lot is expected of you, with out management being overly aggressive. Great amenities, the site in san diego is real nice. Gym onsite open 24/7.  Great cafe.","5,001 to 10,000",Palo-Alto,Mountain View,CA,2016-11-08T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/fcba3b74-6822-4076-a348-5ca2ed9ba9d1?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
