85,1489.0,Pivotus Ventures - Data Scientist - Palo Alto - (KH20788),Umpqua Bank,3.8,91.0,"Fun company, great people to work with. They are turning towards a big bank model. Great benefits and compensation but those things are changing. Every location is differentFriendly, cheerful, but rather rude when getting to know a new client.  Lots of turnover in employees.  Mediocre management, some training.Great financial experience. The position helps an individual learn all things banking, report development and financial. There is always room for growth for those looking for it.We work hard and help the community, that is what Umpqua Bank is all about. From handing out Ice Cream at our local schools to painting a woman shelter, Umpqua a fully dedicated to it's community and employees.Very fun place to work. Good life work balance. Works with people's life and schedule chanhes. Very competitive pay. Positive people including managers and Co workersEvery job has its down side however, it's important to find the positives for a happy work life. At Umpqua I have found the good, made a few wonderful friends, and been awarded freedom to venture out for personal growthh in the company. This company has a low turnover rate and is on Forbes best companies to work for list (impressove for a bank). Overall, I have been happy with my work life here at Umpqua.More than adequate training, coaching and opportunity to make more money by referrals, shadow credit and overall satisfaction with customers.Over the phone Customer ServiceOn line help and researchBusiness online bankingCommercial Credit card assistanceDebit card and disputes researchUmpqua Bank is a great company to work for. They have a diverse and inclusive work culture with a strong commitment to the people in our communities.Umpqua believe in promoting from within and encourage it's employee to look for new opportunities within the company.I was employed with Umpqua through Elwood Staffing Agency for  four months. A typical work day started with getting a prioritized list of loans that needed Loan Estimates and Closing Disclosures executed that day. I learned how to generate  Loan Estimates and Closing Disclosures for home buyers. Following lending guidelines our duty was to insure loan terms,taxes and general fees are calculated correctly.The management team had daily meetings to insure we followed lending guidelines  to the letter.The daily management support was lacking due to pending layoffs. My Co-workers were very supportive and helpful. The Hardest part of the Job was watching the restructuring of departments and  veterans being laid off while your trying to obtain a permanent position. The best part of the job was completion of the disclosure on time which meant a home had been purchased or a refinance was complete.I really enjoyed this job. I didn't like the banking part. The regulation of banking is not fun, but the job itself, and the company is pretty great. They have a HUGE help desk, so you never feel alone, or uninformed. The turnover is quite high, however; which makes it very hard to focus, and get on trackA wonderful place to work.  Very light and professional atmosphere.  All employees are hard working and happy.  I am very happy to have experienced Umpqua Bank.Umpqua Bank was a nice place to work.   I enjoyed working with the staff. I did work  from a remote site that made it a little difficult in communicating with processing and the new TRID program.Due to department consolidation the Bank has re-structured it's operations in the Mountlake Terrace area. Otherwise, a great place to work~Great place to work, management welcomed input on how to improve processes and the whole office helped to get the job done.Umpqua bank is a great place to work. I was a contract employee and was always treated as an equal. I had hoped to be a FTE but the budget did not allow it at this time.I loved working at the bank.  This was a great position to interact with many different types of people and situations.  The support staff was amazing and very much a team!  Loved problem solving and helping customers and families make the right decisions for themselves financially.A typical day at work consists of working with several loan officers on loans.  Pipelines can be upwards to 50 loans and closing 2/3 of the pipeline on a monthly basis is expected.Hardest part of the job is trying to get it all done as quickly as possible. Never seems to be enough time in the day.Underwriters and Closing department great to work with.  Everyone has a Team attitude.Management needs some polishing.  Feeling under valued is common amongst the regions processors.Pay and benefits are very competitive.Don't work in the IT group, they don't believe in nor follow the rest of the company culture. However, no matter where you work, it's about who you know. The entire company is about who you know and who likes you. People do mean well and try very hard to help the community as a whole, that is rewarded.This company has a lot of potential; however, it lacks positive leadership and organization to bring it all together.  Office politics, favoritism,  negative reinforcement and poor management tend to overshadow the positive aspects of working at this place.  There is no formal training and little encouragement to advance within the company.  Some of the coworkers are combative but most are nice to work with.the department that I work in there is no positive reinforcement at all  and they wonâ€™t help the employees move around with in the bank","1,001 to 5,000",Palo-Alto,Palo Alto,CA,2016-10-26T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/8128f0e4-df96-4c92-92d1-291facd19409?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

High energy, focused, and innovative - it was an academic experience in and of itself.I worked as a contract writer for Healthtap.com nearly one year ago, and though I completed their workload prior to their given deadline, they failed to pay me (even with multiple email and phone call reminders) for over three months past the pay-by date. They were highly disorganized and often changed my writing assignments after I completed them, forcing me to go back and re-write entire articles because they changed the topic at the last minute. They took long periods of time before responding to any emails or queries, and lacked communication about assignments and articles.HealthTap is a great place to work if you wish to solve problems that affect people's lives in a way that matters probably more than any other- by taking care of their health.

Good location and very young and hip environment.Glendora High School is full of amazing people and great student athletes. It was such a blessing to be a part of that community.Great Challenging place to work. Extremely smart people.Fast-paced, creative and high potential company.Lots of opportunities.Relaxed work atmosphere with flexible work hours which is great for students or someone looking for a part time job. Work can at times be tedious requiring extended work hours to meet goals without compensation. Management was receptive to employee concerns, but in terms of actual change it was minimal. The company in itself has a bright future ahead, but this position has limited opportunity to grow as an individual.Pay is not based on how many hours you work but based on how much data/leads you find. Sometimes the area we have to look in is exhausted and we can't find anymore leads. Even if we search for hours to find a couple, we do not get paid for those hours but for the couple we have found.Manager is very strict and believes that Houzz matters more than school even during midterms and finals week.Growing company, still a start up so lots of gray areas within jobs. Sometimes interns are asked to do one off jobs due to the start up nature. Very good company morale however.I am a contractor although the company culture is amazing. They thrive on creativity and listen to every ones suggestions. they provide meals and take care of their team members.Houzz is a fast-paced startup that has built it's culture on the amazing people they continue to hire.  As they continue to grow they have maintained that small family feel while promoting the brand worldwide.Started working at Houzz right after I finished my undergrad and was really excited to work with a developing company and brand. However, it was very tele-marketing centered and felt like my 4 year degree wasn't getting used. In talking to management, there didn't seem to be potential to grow, even if you came in early, stayed late, and tried to take on more responsibility. Some people were amazing to work with, others not so much (a lot of people on power trips).

Great small business concept.The job overall was excellent, The management was nice and down to earth. They treated their employees with respect. When I started there I had zero experience with that type of work. They taught me everything and helped me when I struggled. My co-workers where nice and had a warming welcome daily. They where fun to be around and work was enjoyable. The most enjoyable part was when i delivered the pizza and seen the awesome customers. The day would start off with clocking in and getting the bank money. Grabbing your car top sign to start the day off and prepare to take deliverers. Usually there was dishes so they took priority, Because without dishes there is no movement. Wiping out pans, grading cheese, mopping floors and helping out with make line was nearing the end. At the end of the day we'd take in our signs and give in our money and get our cut from the tips and call it a night.Love to work and be at Slice's.

Management is always here to better you and get you to the places you want to be.Great company culture which allows for personal creativity and problem solving. Generally a laid back atmosphere.Opportunities to work in many different locations.The work always offers a challenge and more to do and learn, but learning is hindered by a lack of institutional learning.  Each department reinvents the wheel for so much of what they do.  This is exacerbated by management requiring such a high volume of work (typical day is 12 hours or more).Great company to work for.  The culture was highly bright and it was a joy to speak with all levels of management.  The work/life balance could use some improvementsThe corporate culture is 'Silicon Valley' - a flat management style where results matter.  There are no 'silos':  the workers are expected to go anywhere and interact with anyone, without restriction, to accomplish their objectives.  Managers are there to clear roadblocks.In return for an unfettered work environment, the workers are evaluated on their performance - and if the performance is excellent, they are richly rewarded.  If their performance is not excellent, they should be looking around for another job.  The industry is cyclical, and layoffs occur roughly every 18 months or so.  Regardless if you are a worker or a manager, if you do not demonstrate consistent, superior performance, you should be looking around for work elsewhere.Because Applied is the #1 global manufacturer of capital equipment, the expectations are sky-high.  Competition is fierce, and Applied competes on a global basis.  Applied sells their products worldwide because they are the best in the world, with the fastest time to market.  The typical product horizon is released in 90 days or less - the longest is 6 months, and that is rare.  This is generally not the environment for a work/life balance - the emphasis is on being #1 with rapid deliveries.  On the plus side, working at Applied is the opportunity to demonstrate superior performance in a world-class organization.I have learned that in there are many people with disabilities that are not life disabling / threatening.

You come in and see what is in store. I have learned a lot over my 18 months with the company, including Oracle and SAP. My boss and his boss were amazing! Easy to talk to guys with a laid back and appreciative attitude. Co-workers are average. You will have the ones you like and do not like, but at the end of the day, you are a family.

Keep ongoing priorities log for reporting purposes. A highly multi-tiered management structure with a moving organization according to business changes and needs. It was necessary to have great co-worker communication and participation skills at all times. The most difficult part of this job was the amount of walking to be done between buildings while the business changed and grew rapidly. There were over eight other offices spread out on several city blocks until the campus was consolidated. We used golf carts and bicycles to make the time more convenient into one large campus. It was necessary to attend all meetings and obtain instructions and information from your manager. There were company-wide software tools to learn, that didn't always parallel or match standard industry practice but mostly useful to the company. We produced many PowerPoint organization charts for the continuous change and growth especially at meetings large or small.I worked diligently to meet and resolve employee issues with the Travel & Expense process so that reimbursements took place timelyÂ Â more... for both employee and for accounting. There was a huge backlog of expenses that employees refused to use the existing system, until I was able to provide a usable training program that refined the process. I gave class training and worked one-on-one until the backlog was resolved, Afterwards I was assigned to a different  department within the company.I really enjoyed the company philosophy to grow and train their employees with higher level education or seminars. The employees were given many perks such as onsite organic snacks and drinks, local exercise classes and gym, to name a few. I felt the company valued their employees and supported them especially with invited family celebrations throughout the year. Product launches and celebrations were the norm and happened frequently to keep company morale high and focused. Families were recognized as important part of the employee's life such as during pregnancy or needed time off, a sufficient program for Family Leave was instituted.Â Â lessGood place to start career.

If you are contract employee you are treated as such.  You do not receive the same benefits as a full time employee but are expected to perform and follow all the same requirements as a full time employee.VMware was incredibly flexible and very strong in terms of benefits. Well respected technology and a comprehensive solution suite.Really good company to work for.  Micromanagement is a problem in some groups (like everywhere).  Executive management is great, but Sr. and middle management not so hot.I can take up any job as challenging .I will complete all the work on time .Once i give them commitment .It Will be done before the deadline based on the commitmentThe environment is GREAT and the people are great. There are a lot of project to challenge one and I learned a lot from the projects. The training culture of the company is GREAT as well.There is no typical day as we refine and change business plan according to new market developments, emerging competitive threats and technology required for execution.  At any given time, I could be forecasting market growth, understanding target markets to understating how the technology works and how we can use it to our advantage.  Thinking of the possible is an every day thing -- while trying to develop the financials and models that make it successful -  business models, sensitivity analysis, financial analysis, international expansion plans,etc. Most enjoyable part of work is seeing the strategy turn into execution and finally, delivery of resultsVMware is hands down the best company I have had the opportunity to work for in the 20+ years I have spent in HR and Recruiting. The top reason being that this company really believes in working smarter than harder and the flexibility you are trusted with to do your job in the best way you know how make you feel valued from day one.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,Palo Alto,CA,2016-10-26T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/4d87c586-f781-425a-935d-2e2f0a889ce6?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
