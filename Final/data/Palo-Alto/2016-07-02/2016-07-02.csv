164,1568.0,Sr Data Scientist,SanDisk,3.8,90.0,"Off-ste management makes it a little difficult to get good directionThe company had a great culture but after being purchased we have seen signs of many impending changes for the worst. We had fun activities as a staff and now due to unity instead of adopting the lively camaraderie it is being removed altogether. The gym was the best feature of working here but even that is unknown state and is up for altering with a severely incomparable substitute. Growth opportunities are scarce and reserved for suck-ups i guess like most companies, your hard work will go unnoticed....Daily builds are delivered and built up, Bi-weekly cycle counts. Orders are built upon demand.The Team has been together for 5 years and work very well together.I truly enjoy and respect my co-workers, they are the one thing I will miss about leaving SanDisk.The IT Management was great.  It was fun but lay offs seem inevitably due to the prices if flash storage.  Margins are always tough in semi conductors.  When things are good you get well rewarded but things can turn quickly.I have been working at Western Digital full-time. Learn a lot from the practical and challenge projects.The short-term product cycles created the organization, rewarding matrix and culture. Full of uncertainty, so it is hard to plan the long term.It was a great place to work. Management was really great. Most of all the people I work with are so nice and fun to work with. They are really helpful and nice bunch of people to work with.opportunities everywhere everyday while working on advance memory technologies.smart colleagues work together to achieve the goals.good managers for the supportIt is a nice workplace. Love the people I work with. Everyone is very supportive. I couldn't have asked for a better place to be.  Not sure of how the new culture will be since we got acquire recently.Very good experience to work with all new technologies and new versions in SanDisk, like EP 7.4&7.31 Upgrades from 7.0, SAP Fiori Implementation, HR Renewal and all others.SanDisk is a company focused on storage devices end to end. It is a nice place to work, I learned to manage projects and working in new markets, new technology.Seasoned Audit and Revenue professional with 12+ years experience across a broad spectrum of industries, complemented by a solid foundation of both public and private experience.good company, I will come back if they are hiring me, good location salary is comfortable, and Holiday Pay, no traffic at allMy life at Sandisk was a good one if I didn't care about growing or moving up the Chef world, I would of stayed. But since I wanted to grow and learn I had to leave and say good bye to a lot of good people that I got to know and worked with. I do go visit from time to time and I'm always welcomed by everyone at Sandisk.The team i was working is helpful. I can learn a lot from my manager and co-works. It is a great place to work and enjoy your life.No work-life balance.Challenging environmentUpper management okvery dynamicvery politicalgood paysmart peoplegood rotation programFun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but it is expected of a big companyHaving been only a contractor I cannot comment on benefits or other SanDisk related things.The management there is just fantastic. Very detailed work. Very professional group in the tech pubs department. I would work there again if called.Great workplace with a thriving corporate culture offers a lot of learning potential.  Friendly people and great place to learn.I am managing Linux and backup/recovery teams for Sandisk. The job responsibilities includes architect, manage systems of mission critical environments in the prod/dev/qa.Poor management.Very difficult to get work done, regardless of importance.A large number of layoffs of very competent people.Each week, take a moment to recognize the successes based on requirements, Engineering Spec, Product feature.Employers can invest in training you other skills.
