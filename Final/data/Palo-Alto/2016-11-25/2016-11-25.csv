The position of ""accounting specialist"" required travel through out the North and Southeast US. I enjoyed doing needs analysis in each of the auto dealerships and to customize the accounting software to meet the expectations  of dealership management.Days are normally 10 hrs day and 1st shift starts at 2 AM and sometimes last until 2 pm seven days a week. as a supervisor you must keep employees pumped up to get great production. The end result of good quality is always a plus.Loved the job. Wish I hadn't of messed up during my 30 day probation period. If I cannot find a better workplace before my yearly peiod to wait to reapply I plan on going back to work for TAC for sure!I liked working here. I was able to be able to do a little bit of everything. I helped out with the warranty department, I filed all thee paperwork form the previous days work as well as I was able to work with the guests and service advisers.Direct manager is not experienced enough for the role he stepped into witch desegregated work experience. made day to day very tedious and stressful. overall organization and owners we pleasantit been very nice and amazing job ,coworker really nice, every body know his or her job , the management really good and they always looking for new driver .Professionally patrolled to check for irregularities and to inspect protection devices and fire control equipment. Prepare logs and reports as required for informational purposes Respond to incidents of fire, medical emergency, bomb threat, flooding, inclement weather and other job related incidents.A very interesting, fun place to place.  As long as the work was getting done in a timely manner, you were free to talk while doing your work, which made the time go fast and streefree.db2 to write queries, business objects and crystal reports for reporting and opportunities to automate and/or improve an existing process.  Can make recommendations for action plans or streamlining to improve business performance.A very hard job . I found a niche in the paint department and did well . Because we had a strong Union we achieved advancements in pay and benefits.  With a bad economy in the Bush years the union lost power and the worker doing my job today is making the same money that I made in 2002 . The benefits have been eroding also . The retirees are paying higher prices on the benefits that they earned and have slowly lost . Well established company, I worked almost thirty-four years there and my father worked over forty-nine years.You get to meet great people and work with them as well.  great training programs and they are willing to do what it takes to get the job done.I have worked for Ford for 31 years and achieved more than my dreams could have imagined. I have met many people from around the world and have worked and launched various products in many of the plants in the United States. I have enjoyed coming back to do contract work as I am always glad to see many people again and work with them during launch. I greatly appreciated my time with the company.It's a nice job to have if you are a full-time employee!  With going from tpt to sts it's kind of hard deciding if you want to keep the job.  Or the fact that you just keep wondering if you will ever get hired in full-time!It was one of my early job. Learned a lot while being productive. Will work again if I had a chance to work there. Support after hours was sometimes difficult (laptop provided by company was a bit slow) but overall it was great.I worked for Cat Drive Away a company that's affiliated with Ford Motor Company. Fast and steady place to work. Very laid back and easy money... I loved working there and the people was very outgoing.Ford is a great family company with a knowledgable staff and a great work/life balance. The only downside is that all roads lead back to Dearborn / SE Michigan.Working at Ford was a good job. I enjoyed working with the other employees. Shifts were on a rotating bases, usually every three months your shift would be rotated. Lots of overtime.A typical day at work included monitoring equipment and automation and responding to problems with machinery.  It was very rewarding to diagnose issues and plan and execute resolutions.Being at a dealership you are exposed to the ins and outs of the car world and it being car make specific you end up learning everything about that make.  And as far as training is concerned the possibilities are endless, unfortunately working for a dealership does have a lot of drawbacks, mainly the drama of a high school world and there is a lot of political stuff involved, everything is based on time down to how you get paid.It was great place to work. But they changed their main focus on pharmacology. Providing PBM services and outsources IT services.Great benefits package but with what all you have to endure and deal with, it's no wonder that the pay and benefits package is what it is.  Some company personnel is great while others can be difficult to have to work under.  You will live inside this place and if you have a family, you will hear about their lives thru text on breaks.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,Palo Alto,CA,2016-11-25T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/5157dbfe-2bfb-4aa1-9c9d-a2123410a4f0?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=29,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
