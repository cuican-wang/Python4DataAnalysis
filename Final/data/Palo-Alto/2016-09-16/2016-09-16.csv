102,1506.0,Haskell Data Scientist,TARGET,3.8,19100.0,"This helped me pay for my college and it was nice working there. Woulnd not go again and would prefer more on time managers.Hired out of college to be an ETL (assistant store manager). Very intense training, and information overload for 6 weeks. Expected to perform and manage every single day. Weekends, holidays, overnight, early morning shifts are all fair game. Expected to work on average 50 hours/ week (but it's a salaries position so you will probably work more). Promoting is difficult. It's highly political so superior relationships with those above your boss are a necessity. It's a great position for someone looking for a lot of on hand management experience. However, it's retail, it's a lot of managing damage control, cleaning up after others (call-ins, actual mess on the sales floor). Not very rewarding.Almost everyone in management are unfair and show no respect to employees. Advancement comes only by how much management likes you. It's not based on your work or experience. There is a lot of he say she say at the Rock Hill store and others will believe it whether it's based on fact or opinion. It used to be a fun place to work and almost everyone got along but with the new management people only seem to be looking out for themselves and turning on each other just to get ahead. It's sad.I was a cashier for a year and a half and it wasn't bad. The minimum wage was $8 an hr when I was hired but it had been raised to $10 before I quit earlier this year.The hardest part of the job was selling the Target RedCard to customers and it was pretty much the only way to get recognized as a cashier. Benefits are good, and they include holiday pay and (I think) insurance. The reason I quit was because there weren't any opportunities for me to change positions the entire time I worked there and it felt like everyone else was moving up except me. Management was okay but not the absolute best. The best part was working with the customers. If I went beyond their expectations, they voiced it and it would make me feel great.Target is a very decent place to work. They offer a very reasonable wage and have decent benefits like health insurance and 401K. The work is very physical and it be overwhelming at first but eventually you acclimate and get into a rhythm. The shifts are divided into either 10 or 12 hour days with 2 paid breaks. The people are generally easy to get a long with and many of the on shift supervisors are good with communication and helping resolve yours and the business needs. One downside is during the busy seasons they usually force mandatory overtime, meaning you will have to work an additional day or sometime two days, and it can stretch on for weeks or even months at a time.target is literally one of my favorite stores so when i got the job opportunity i was thrilled. The team members i worked with were very nice and friendly and it seemed like this was going to be a great experience up until a couple months ago when i started to realize that the retail world is full of lazy and drama filled people. the management treats the workers as if they are slaves and demand things that they can handle on their own, Also when problems are brought to hr confidentially they are shared amongst other people within the building which is pretty crazy because if you don't even feel comfortable going to hr then thats a problem within itself. The raises are a pretty good amount when they come around but it makes you wonder if its worth it when the management isn't up to par.A typical day at work involves interacting with a multitude of guest personalities.  Assisting people with problem solving has been mostly enjoyable, sometimes not.  Management seems more interested in reaching corporate goals than in the individual workers. My co-workers are mostly fun, energetic, reliable and helpful.  The hardest part of the job is reaching goals of signing guests up for Target RedCards.  It seems like an intrusion to most people.  The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing I have saved people the most money possible through coupons, apps, sale ads, etc.  If they are also using one of Target's cards, that's bonus savings.I loved my job! I was a senior team leader, but because I didn't have a degree I couldn't advance to the next position, even though I had been ther for 15yrs and had done everything in that store. The pay was great, the benefits were great, the management in the last 3 yrs was awful! No compassion for their team members. No loyalty just numbers! This Target in particular lost what it meant to take care of your team. Their purpose as a company was just the bottom dollar. I wish I could have advanced in the company but it just wasn't meant to be.the work was good, worked well with other flow team members.  Team leads came and went on a regular basis.  Upper management did not communicate with all ream members, especially the night crew.  When new team leaders came in they were not notified that I have some medical limitations such as the inability to climb ladders, carry more than 50 lbs, can not stand still long periods of time, and have difficulty working more than 32 hours a week.  This is due to an injury to my right leg and knee, including insertion of titanium rods.  This caused friction and an even more hostile environment when I reminded them of my limitations.The motto at my store was always fun, fast, and friendly service, and the majority of the management and staff seemed to follow suite. Despite having large tasks and very busy and stressful days, the management and team always seemed to keep things to a realistic level, understanding that everyone was working hard and continually trying to lift our spirits. It was a much different feeling than other retailers I've worked at, where the management would usually just callously list goals and be unhappy when/if those goals weren't met. People are more than just efficiency machines at Target, they're people again.This was my first ever job. It was interesting learning new things. But management is corrupt. While I worked hard to earn my place other people were being recognized because they were friends. Everyone else got an amazing raise while I got a penny as a raise. You must think I didn't do my job well to earn a raise. I beg to differ. Lets just say if you aren't best friends with management or agree to kiss... you know where I am trying to get. You wont be able to move up in the company. Which is unfortunate since I do love the company and what it stands for. Corporate needs to take a look at who they hire as their management.This was a great place to work. I was a cashier, and I loved the work environment. The team leaders are so nice and I became very close with the people I worked with. And the company treated us well too. There was a break room with food available a few days a week. Schedule is flexible also, I worked approximately 30 hours while attending college. Pay is ok, I believe that the minimum cashier wage was raised but I could be wrong. The hardest part of the job was obviously dealing with the occasionally unreasonable customer, and there were times when the computers would glitch, but that all comes with any job. The best part was the sense of family and support among the team members and management. I would recommend this job for anyone, whether you want a part time job or a career there is opportunity for advancement and the hours are flexible!i specialize in planograms signing and packing out  freight i enjoy it makes the day go quick. i get along very well with my coworkers we are one team one dream we help each other .management there are very rewarding people that recognize you often for your accomplishments and are willing to help you develop to become the very best at your goals.the hardest part of the job is when the hours get cut mine typically do not i am a presentation team member and play very important roll on the salesfloorI dont know if is my store. But there's zero recognition from management. There's no advancement besides getting cross trained. We work hard and get expire food as compensation for our work. Again, may be my just my Target. Good friendships.Work starts at 22:00 and finishes when the work is done. Usually heavy workloads pulling items from backroom onto sales floor. After pulls are complete we either help flow team stock store or stay in the backroom back stocking product. I learned to move with a sense of urgency while staying accurate and organized. Management likes to micro manage but seems necessary for certain individuals. Hardest part of job is being on your feet constantly moving all day and trying not to be overwhelmed by the workload. Most enjoyable is being apart of a team.Horrible culture at West Jefferson DC. I had 30+ managers, 10+ Senior Managers and 5+ General Managers in 12 years. The compensation is good and makes you feel like you are trapped there. They used to have a good core team, but have run most off and replaced a lot of people with temps. Revolving door for employees. At one point I knew almost everyone that worked there, but only knew about 15% when I departed. There is not an attendance policy, OM can give you corrective action for missing 3 or 4 days in a year and do nothing to someone who misses 3 or 4 days per month. You only receive 1 15 minute break and a 25 minute lunch for a 10 hr shift. You are not allowed to leave the premises, and have to get special permission to even go to your car. You have to accrue vacation time weekly, but if you leave or get fired you lose it, even though you earned it. Just be prepared to work like a dog for 10 or 12 hours per day.Was expected to be perfect and never make a mistake.  0 support from managers.My career at target started out fantastic, I was given support from all of my coworkers and the management, but the longer I was there the support fell, they put a lot of pressure on two people, and I am in college so when I put in the days that I could not work my hours were dropped way below what i was expecting, they only put me on with minimum shifts. Almost trying to get me to leave. Well they won that battle I am actively looking for a new job. I would not recommend working for target unless you are willing to devote your life to target.A typical day at work will include work center management, performance management for part time staff, and full time management staff. I've learned how to operate a very complex work center that focuses on driving results. Management staff is very talented and understand collaboration to meet goals. The hardest part of the job is the work-life balance when employed as salary. The needs of the business sometimes will affect your off-time. The most enjoyable part of the job is developing other leaders and promoting those that have worked so hard to get there.The job it self is good, mon-Fri 6 to 230pm. Work can be challenging but depends on how good you are trained. Biggest down fall is Management. They do not care about the team members, they preach about development but it's all talk. They tend to promote a pretty faces over experince, exact words from HR-ETL, which hurts the moral of the team. They talk about fairness but they pick and choose who they reprimand I'm order to get the results they want.  No one is happy that works there, they Work hard for poor yearly compensation and a note that says you did good. Hours for normal team members are always cut back. The place is a joke.I worked for Target for six years. By the time I took my leave, I had been cross-trained in every area of the store, learned how to close down registers, and cover manager's shifts when they couldn't come in. I enjoyed my time there and it had its ups and downs as any job might. My only regret was that there was little opportunity to move up while working there. I was given the blessing of knowledge and learned many skills that were not easy to obtain, however though I was trained to cover manager shifts and close the store, I would never see myself promoted. It is because of this I had decided to leave and chose to focus my work into school instead.Target expects a lot out of it's leadership teams and focuses on constructive feedback and recognition to develop their teams. Compensation is fair although ETL and STL work/life balance is compromised and is largely dependent on the condition of the store you're assigned to. Personal accountability is also a necessary quality to having a successful career with the company.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,Sunnyvale,CA,2016-09-16T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/0b893594-aa50-4ea3-b060-7482d170d791?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
