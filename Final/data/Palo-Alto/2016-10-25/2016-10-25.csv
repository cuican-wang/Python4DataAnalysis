Have to carry coworkers' workload due to their limited skills and slow paceMany assignments were challenging but fun to work with.  Coworkers assigned to the projects were very supportive and respectful people.Every call was something new and different. Attached to a warehouse so the environment was very casual.The company has low moral and management is bad. No room for advancement and managers have a certain clique. Discrimination is a big part of the FMS dept.Typically daily work can be puzzling because there is a lack of focus on certain projects or program targets tend to shift. Co-workers are great, but work may push for long hours.At times schedule can be more than accomodatingly flexible.",,Palo-Alto,Sunnyvale,CA,2016-10-25T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/37f70eb2-59c2-462d-a06d-3458c79b5bd2?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=22,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
