111,1515.0,Data Scientist,The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation,3.6,1600.0,"great company with great benefits. Definitely recommended. It typical day of work depends on the department you work for.The hours can be a bit long.  The pay is below market for similar jobs at other companies.  The people you work with makes the job tolerable, but even they can become a bother sometimes.  I chalk that up to the frequently demanding nature of the job. To be honest, there is a lot to learn to the point that you could leverage your experience into other jobs elsewhere.  I work with a relatively small team, so you can get your hands into a bit of everything.  A warning though: don't stay to long or else you run the risk of being pigeon-holed into a position like this for the rest of your working career.Productive, Good community engagement. Flat Management structure.Great work culture. Limited upward mobility. Very considerate co-workers. Management style disparate.Excellent learning opportunities. Authority does not commensurate with responsibility.No comment.  I have not worked there in 10 years.  They got out of the retail sector because they were not good at it.  They were not willing to make the necessary investment to be successful.  The CEO at that time has since passed away so I can't approve of the current CEO.The best thing about this job is the challenges and you are kept busy, no need to watch the clock. Has a very detailed training program. I was part of the class when 911 occurred and was taken out of training after 2 weeks and put right to work. Allowing me to get on the job training and did not have to return to class training.Never had a permanent job as I was only in training for six months and still never got a permanent job after that. Training was hard but very knowledgeableDefinitely a second family atmosphere.  Supportive management and helpful colleagues, locally, nationally, and internationally.  Cross training and online learning/continuing education keeps employees motivated.Onboarding was done incorrectly.  There was no one to train me for 4 months.  I kept asking if I could help anyone, sometimes they had work, sometimes they did not.  After four months began to be more involved.  Still did not get the proper training.BNY is a very large company. The groups  vary greatly in management goals and style. Each individual's mileage may vary. I have met some very amazing people in my time at BNY and am thankful for all i have learned in my time there.we will learn a lot about the financial world and work with great people but there are not a lot of opportunities to growth within the company.best advice learn as much as you canFast-paced enhancing my agility and bringing to the surface skills I was unaware I possessed.  I did not enter the organization playing the Acoustic Guitar, Keyboard and Producing Music.  My gifts and latent talents were brought out and developed during my employment.  I've done Administrative Assistant work for over 20 years in various industries and I believe it's time to use my natural gifts and talents and work in an industry where I can be of service to Humanity.My day was dealing with checks coming from every banks. I learned how the banking system operate and to minimize risks concerning decision making on the checks.Good place to begin a career. The hands-on training is completed very well by the organization. Additionally, the environment is fairly laid-back for a bank.You can come in to work and people will greet you with a good morning and smile and tell you to have a good day. They also help you when you have questions.Employees are not paid enough. They go above and beyond and their work is usually met with just praise and not enough monetary rewards. This provides a lack if incentive.Talking customers about their monetary progressions and declinations. I learned that banking hours have no variance for life's mishaps. The hardest part of the job is keeping a schedule that is permitting..Talking to people who get approved by the bank for monetary gain.One of the best companies I have ever had the pleasure to work for.  This company recognized and fostered individual strength and encouraged growth for it's employees.If your looking for a job that will take you back to cliques of high school BNYM is the place for you. Hours are sometimes flexible.Low compensation, no job security and hard to advance.  You can work hard but little recognition only good thing is coworkersThis is a large bank they had five Branch offices in Los Angeles and were in business for over 25 years , unfortunately in 2008 the bank decided to merge with US Bank corporation and sold the business to them. 321 employees were laid off with a  packageNice company but when it comes to advancement at times it is not all what it seems. Work force has become more of do with less associates, but have more work. Expectations take over a normal working day.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,Palo Alto,CA,2016-05-25T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/6abfc463-c8ad-48e4-87e9-fc3d92208fe3?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
