641,2045.0,Analytical Chemist,Imerys,4.2,37.0,"Everyone around here have worked together a long time. Great place to work with family. The only downside is working swing shiftCorporate human resources personnel are nepotistic and show favoritism to their drinking buddies. To succeed at corporate level, you may have to spend time charming with and boozing with corporate HR. Bonus points for being female.great workplace with great co workers and bosses.hardest part of job was the swing shifts.most enjoyable part was learning new things.IMERYS is a good job and I would recommend it to anyone that is starting a career in the accounting field. The people at this company are really nice they are very generous at month end.Fun colleagues, supportive management. Room for growth and improvement. Fantastic team work throughout company and caring towards the environment as well as the community. Able to participate in community services.Typical day was always changing. One day would be creating risk assessments and maintenance schedules the next would be experimenting with the grinding parameters to modify the final product. Management was always supportive, intelligent and easy to get along with. Everyone working with or over you was very intelligent and they all excelled at finding tangible solutions to the multitude of problems associated with a new plant design.The hardest part of the job was creation of safety paperwork as it could be tedious. The most enjoyable part of the job was really everything else- operations, maintenance, experimentation, lab work ect. Really wish this position had not been cut short by the paper mill we were stationed at.I really enjoyed my time with Imerys. Currently work just has gotten slow so i must find another way to provide for my family.I learned how to operate most of the equipment i now know how to operate. The management is satisfactory but the HR department is too slow to fix any issues that come up. My co-workers were a blast to work with. There were never issues to comment on. The hardest part of working there is to try to move up the ladder.Generally it,s a good place to work but not like it was in the past.Management is still good get alone with co-workers well the most enjoyable part of the job is doing my job right.It's a wonderful location, great co-workers and management is tops!A typical day was always based on safety. Safety was very big with this company, they treated there workers well. Co-workers got along very well and I could tell that most of them where very good friends.Imerys was an excellent company to work for especially if you like to be busy. The management is tough but very fair. I learned a lot about IFS and Microsoft AX administration. I also figured out an extremely useful method of deployment through self study which is encouraged at Imerys. I felt that I was a valued member of the team. The hardest part of the job was navigating elements of office politics. The most rewarding part of the job was the respect of your peers when you solved a difficult problem.Imery's is an excellent Company to work for. Great Management and even better employees.There were no days during the course of my employment at IMERYS that were the same as it relates to a typical day.  To clarify my role, I would have to say that I was more of a fireman or EMT.  Constant emergencies, primarily due to lack of accountability and not adhering to the procedures.  The task I was assigned to do was to remedy the kind of environment that I described above.  With a new accounting system, we were going to be able to track cost via the system, as opposed to paper and manual journal entries.The difficulty was not being able to change the culture that was set on doing things the old way and refusing to change.  This was the hardest part of the job.The most enjoyable part would have to be the people I was able to help and teach.  Being able to help others with doing simple spreadsheets, formulas, tables, etc. that would say hours out of their week.  Seeing the relief they felt was worth every difficult day I experienced.Imerys, a minerals company out of France, has operations all over the world including north Georgia. My plant mined for marble rock and processed that rock into dust, used for thousands of applications. With this dust comes well...dust, everywhere. My job was to keep the machines that made all the different products clean and free of dust. An ongoing and dis-heartening struggle was my job. However, my co-workers and my supervisor made it a good place to work. There was always a need for my position and we made sure to fill it. Management could use more communication and oversight with employees, but all in all still a good company and a place I would recommend employment.Reliable workplace great for benefits strong team behind youLarge company with good remuneration and benefits. Learned process control/process discipline. Very customer-focused company. Good, knowledgeable co-workers, always there to help when needed,Long hours, Saturday work mandatory but the excellent work environment made long hours go by.   Typical day at work:  Safe and fun    What you learned:  New system    Management: Very approachable     Your co-workers:  Good people    the hardest part of the job:  NA    the most enjoyable part of the job:  Been part of itThis is the right place for you.  It's a typical office environment.  The company is headquartered in France so many times there are international visitors.  The majority of the staff are age 30 and up.  Some people are very happy here, while others are disappointed by the lack of advancement.  There is definitely job security.
