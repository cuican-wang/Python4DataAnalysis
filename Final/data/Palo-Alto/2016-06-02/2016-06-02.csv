110,1514.0,Lead Data Scientist,Infosys,3.9,5600.0,"This is not a place I would want to work for again.  The business practices were not up to par.  The only thing I learned while I was what not to do.Already published in previous mail . Best company to work with for any New college graduate. Highly motivated and skilled employees and companies polices are very employee freindlyNice and Good place to work.Met great people and a great time.Managers are approachable and tend to employees.Works can be repetitive on most normal days.The HR team gave me the flexibility to work form home and complete my assignment within the given time. Was fun working with the team in Banglaore and Pune.The overall work culture of the company has changed in recent times. The company is no more driven by values. Most of the times you will get good managers but with laterals joining the company values have gone for a toss. Now culture is moving towards keep your boss happy and company has stopped addressing employees concerns.Infosys has got the best campuses among IT organizations in India. You would love Infosys campuses and facilities in India but you won't be able to utilize them due to stringent project timelines or longs waiting.Infosys used to be a great workplace but the size has caught up and too much of politics between teams/managers make it not desirable for top talent any more.Very high visibility to various technologies and exposure to try and learn new technologies.  Good support and guidance from seniors.  Exposure and opportunity to work at various accounts and COE process.I enjoy working in IT filed, especially in the field of full stack web development. I have faced very friendly co workers in all the work places I worked till now. Especially my team leads and managers very friendly and they were my mentors too. My hardest part of the job!?I never figured it out but working on week ends was little difficult, though I enjoyed it.Its a great place which grooms you and provides you with a solid foundation that enables you to achieve higher goals in the life.Great launching pad.Infosys is a good company to work for. Great professional people to work with. The training it provides is world class. Company has the best in class infrastructures aswell.Good company to work with. More number of customers.  We get to work on many technologies. Better Training and management. Good Work life balance and benefitsThere should be a balance between work and personal life and all the good work should be noted and appreciatedShould consider employees ideas and provide full support in implementingNo growth prospects within the companyNo salary hikes Unstable top managementNumber of changes without any significant business impactPoliticsSilly processes for everythingI am not highly recommend to work on this company. I am not satisfied from Infosys with Compensations as well as higher level Management team.Skill management system - need to be improved, Projects not offering visibility to employees, Job security is good.Not much option for employees to choose projects.Good working culture, painful HR and tedious policies. Long working hours and inefficient senior management.It is good if you are on long term client assignments. For smaller duration assignments it is not goodGreat place to work and you get to learn new technologies each time. The growth is good as well . Fast paced organization and competitive work culture.Good Company to Work, lot of things to learn. You are free to work in any area which are interested. Lot of process within the companyGood Work Life balance, Career opportunity,Good work culture , good work colleagues.Biggest Indian MNC with a wide variety of software expertise and global presence .This is a good place to start a career. Very innovative on training to keep employes updated. good facilities overall. Not too much room for growth.Good Company. Low Salary but better than other Indian IT company. Nice management. Always keep updating your technical skills.
