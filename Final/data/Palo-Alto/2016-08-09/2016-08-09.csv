157,1561.0,"Data Scientist, Quantitative Platform Architect, Gartner Research, Santa Clara, CA or Stamford, CT L",Software Advice,4.0,2.0,"Typical day as an Advisor is spent responding to requests on price quotes, demoes, or general information on enterprise software. Prospects left information that we would use to get in touch and respond to request, gathering business information in the process. At the end of the call, we would email general information on the appropriate software vendors that would match their needs. We would then turn the notes we took on that call and sell it to the software vendors as a qualified lead for them to set up a webinar demo of their software.I learned how to stay patient with sales and look at the outcome of an entire quarter rather than focus on weekly or bi-weekly goals.Management was great at teaching you the necessary skills needed to perform well and they were patient to make sure you understood everything fully.I enjoyed the competitive environment, the above average pay, and the co-workers were all very responsible and hard working.The hardest part of the job was the monotony. The calling process was aggressive, calling prospects up to six times a day from different phone numbers.Software Advice is a great place to work. It's also a hard place to work. We work really hard, but it's a really supportive atmosphere where small, daily victories are recognized and celebrated. We've got a great group of people here, everyone's really fun to work with and always brings their A game.",51 to 200,Palo-Alto,Santa Clara,CA,2016-08-09T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/2094ef92-11a3-40ba-8c9f-1019f0ec4b4e?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=19,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
