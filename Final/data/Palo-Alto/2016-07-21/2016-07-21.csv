Deal with tricky customers, different vendors and banks that makes me learn how to interact with different kind of person. I report directly to President of the company who is successful businessman, learned lot of business and management strategy and concepts from him. Most of my co-worers are young professional, we get along well and learn from each other. The hardest part of the job was to communicate with co-workers from different countries (Columbia, Serbia and India), but this is only for the beginning year; now it becomes a benefit because we understand each other's culture more and we can learn from each other. The most enjoyable part of the job is to challenge myself, I need to handle different tasks and handle tricky customers and collaborate with other departments; it is a great opportunities for me to learn how to meet deadline, prior jobs and work with different person.",,Palo-Alto,Santa Clara,CA,2016-07-21T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/c4f88454-213f-4fe6-844c-58da33514952?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
