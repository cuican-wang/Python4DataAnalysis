298,1702.0,Metamaterial Optical Physicist,Rambus,4.0,5.0,"Good place to work. Great benefits and good work culture. Lots of restructuring going on, upper management is looking for diversification.High turnover rate in my opinion.  My division is still finding future growth direction.   My group directors has low visibility to what is going on with key project therefore his decision is not productive to the company.Excellent company to work for, great culture, environment, etc.   The Company really takes care of its employees.

719,2123.0,Material Scientist Intern,TE Connectivity,3.9,569.0,"I'm a productive person who is focused on my quality of work and work at a steady pace. I time myself so I will know how long it will take to get a specific job done.I love overtime and only take days/nights off when absolutely necessary. I am able to work as a team or individually.TE Connectivity, as a whole, is a great company to work for with nearly unlimited opportunities for advancement!  (I've experienced this on a personal level.)That being said, it has the same issues that every other world-wide corporation has, particularly clueless management.  As with most large corporations, there are far too many ""Professional Managers"" that get hired from outside and do not understand what they are even managing.....they only know metrics, spreadsheets, and dollars, but couldn't answer the first question about what any given employee does in a day.Apart from this, TE always has an open ear for constructive criticism or ideas for improvement.  As stated initially, if you want to move forward with the company, you can; it just may take a little extra effort!Times have changed and company is more focused on hiring from the outside as opposed to promoting from within.  The people that have been there awhile are good people and work hard but are extremely under appreciated.The job gave me great experience working under a Manager. The site under TE took advantage of temporaries, which included myself, by never making us full time employees in their company. Not until Commscope bought the site that we were then able to become full time employees. Being a temp for three years with no vacations or benefits was a big draw back.Company offers great benefits. Also 3 shifts, and they are global so if you are willing to travel the world this is a great company to do so. TE makes connectors for all electric parts.fun workplace and nice coworkers. I work 5 days a week . very motivated people. great boss . good benefits. very busy companyA typical day at work involves sitting in one spot all day performing the same mind-numbing procedure every day. Communication between management and employees is seriously lacking. There are rewards for meeting production goals like money, food, and fun events.TE Connectivity is a decent company. I personally don't like Customer Service so I hate the job, though my management team is good. The Product Information Center has a lot of job security, though don't apply if you don't like Customer Service; it's a call center.A typical day was productive. I learned a lot about blueprints and stamping presses. The management and co-workers we're fair. The hardest part was getting along with everyone. The most enjoyable was knowing my family was provided for.Over all it was a good place to work, but there is a high turn over and several RIF's over my 8 years there. During the time I was there two new plants in Mexico were build and opened, this caused jobs in the US to be relocated.TE Connectivity has a very competitive salary and great locations to work. They taught me a lot about having a career and a day-to-day life of being an employee.Some people should have been shown the door years ago, and others work extremely hard after over 30 years of service to the company.  There are very many layers of management, and more are being added.  There are 60,000 employees, and directing and managing that many employees is not a task every company is up for. The CEO said he wanted to do right by the employees they were laying off, and it seems that they have been, so that's nice.  Let's face it, the company is famous for layoffs in the local area. There is so much room for growth inside of the IT organization in the future, because there are people that would love to optimize and fine-tune it and blow away expectations.  But for now there is just do more with less.  They also don't want to hear what the employees have to say.I am surrounded by hard workers who are knowledgeable and love to laugh, and like long walks by the beach.Work day is very busy and can be unexpected work from day to day, especially depending on the time of year.  Annual enrollment is a extremely busy time.  I am responsible for all funding in benefits area including Health & Welfare and Retirement both 401(k) and Pension. I am the point of contact for employee questions when our benefits center needs information verified or approved.I found TE to be a reasonably pleasant place to work. However, there always seemed to be layoffs going on at any given time. I didn't know anyone who felt secure about their job. It seemed like no matter how driven you were, or how good your work was, you were always on the chopping block.It seemed to me that instead of building and keeping a team of people at the top of their game who would help to make the company profitable and capable of meeting customer needs, it is a company being run by accountants who's only concern is the budgetary goals of the current quarter. Just my two cents.we are just now half way through our fiscal year and have had week long furloughs 5 of the 6 months. the job is good but I would like a full time job not part timeSad to say it is not a great company to work for.  No communication.Pay is not good for the work that is required.  The facility I worked closed but not one time did we get a visit from Upper Management to at least communicate to us or even ask for people to stay with the company.  The Site Manager at the facility was not forthcoming with information and very unfair in treatment of some of the employees It is sad that this company took a group of hard working employees and let them go without even a handshake.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the great people I worked with.  They were AWSOME.Campus Management is fairly consistent.  Immediate Supervisor is knowledgeable and helpful and interested in those who report to him.  As with any large company, communication is a challenge and we could do better in that area.  The most enjoyable part of my job is finding and fixing clerical/numerical errors that affect the outcome of the information that keeps our work centers operational.Great place to work ,but moving out of country,So sad to see it go . This company was around in NC and SC providing jobs for over 40 yrs.My shift was a week end shift which gave me lots of time for my family.My coworkers were great teemmates.The worst part was the 45 min,drive after comp,moved to SC from NC. My skills as a machinist in tool and die and in injection molding is the best tool given to me to support my family.good place to work.. good atmosphere.good relationship between employee and management. will consider a life time career if offered the opportunity.Wonderful place to work. Great people who work together to get things done. TE is very good about promoting from within, which I`m a firm believer in that. Hardest part of this position is component shortages, and getting them here asap. I enjoy the fact that we have an "" engagement team "" that plans dinners, parties, heart walks, etc., that we can participate in. And programs set up to help the community. Many regrets that the facility is closing.The years of downsizing made it worrysome if you will have a job.  Many of the jobs were sent to Mexico and China.  The company is very high tech and produce quality product, but the job security made in tough.  Raises were far and few between.. Our department, and other depts. went seven years without a raise.",,Palo-Alto,FREMONT,CA,2016-10-27T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/677280ce-cede-4ff7-a2f0-147b441b3bfe?mescoid=1900260001001&jobPosition=21,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
