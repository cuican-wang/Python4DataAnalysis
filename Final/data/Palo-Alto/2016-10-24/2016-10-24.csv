If you are salary they will work you harder. Great advancement oportunityGreat people to work with and a good place to aquire technical skills. However, not a lot of options for advancement, and low compensation for the work required.Fluke is a great place to work if you enjoy working long hours and being in a non cutthroat fast paced environment. A lot of training and mindset is around Kaizen practice which is a great tool for other job markets. Advancement is accessible and they also have great benefits as well.Worked with lots of great people who were focused on solving problems, finding timely solutions and still having fun. Working at Fluke gave me the opportunity to wear many hats, use my strengths and improve my weak spots.I left to raise my 4 kids.Its a nice place to work, all colleagues are nice to work with. I learned a lot about temperature metrology. Fluke makes temperature baths and readouts, Nobody offers a more complete line of temperature calibration equipment than Fluke Calibration. From ITS-90 fixed-point cells to handheld temperature sources—combined with easy to use and extremely precise thermometry systems.Everyone knew their jobs well.Got to work using Oracal software shipping orders.Mangers worked well with employees.Nothing was hard at this job.Getting to work with a good team.Arrive to work daily, greet other employees, and prep for the day's work.Fluke calibration lab is large laboratory involved with electrical/electronic, temperature and pressure calibrators.Awesome Company.
