15,1419.0,Statistician,Robert Bosch LLC,4.1,1300.0,"Review prints find parts to build the machine. if needed I will make the parts. quote jobs talk with customers about there project and if satisfied over build. sometimes customers wants more than what was quoted at the start of the job.Worked for the company for nearly 20 years.  They use to walk the talk of the culture and importance of community.  They used to treat their employees like valuable team members.  Now, it has turned into a burn them and churn them, no matter how much a person has contributed to the success of the organization.Management changes every few years and the culture changes to reflect the beliefs and management practices of the current establishment.My position required leadership skills to direct the work force towards company goals. This included on time deliveries, customer interaction, and diplomacy. Other responsibilities included training of workers, both salary and hourly, and safety. It was a pleasure to work with, on the most part, professional people in their fields of expertise. This created a high expectation that the team would achieve daily and long range goals. I earned the respect from all levels of management.1. Bosch expect you to grow automatically, the training/follow-up feed back is severely insufficient.2. Bosch encourage you to work over time: it is not on the rule, but the task assigned to you definitely make you work over 50, even 60 hours per week, on an average Engineer;  3. Highly bureaucratic management.4. Lack humanistic care: my colleague's wife is during pregnancy at her 9th month, the company still assign him to German for 8 weeks! He miss the most important moment in his life! Similar things happened very often.5. HR is not nice to you, especially if you are a not US citizen: your green-card sponsorship, H-1 B are reluctant approve with delay.Relatively good compensation; Good to be a manager in BoschBosch is a non-profit organization, which means it's not publically traded and there are no share holders. It's a very diverse company, as well as the largest automotive supplier in the world.Bosch treats its employees well and there are many opportunities, especially for those with 4yr degrees.Wonderful experience while working for Bosch in Broadview, Illinois.  Excellent Leadership and ample opportunity for career movement.  Technical and operations training is world class.  The benefits at Bosch AANA, are great especially when compared to what other companies are currently offering.  The only reason I left is Bosch moved their distribution to Atlanta Georgia.Well structured company to work for. Great benefits. Great pay and fun people to work with. Management was awesome. Was respective very well. Made a lot of friends.Management not transparent to employees but decent work culture and good opportunity to learn.Decent compensation and very good work-life balance. Limited growth opportunities for employees.Don't recommend, they don't care about the employees only the profits and quantity of parts put out, long hours 7 day work week,lots of employee turnover* Fast paced and results driven environment* I Learned that you will never achieve true confidence or success without stepping out of your comfort zone.* I Worked with some of the most talented managers with strong engineering back rounds that were committed to success. They were always approachable and willing to share their knowledge.* My co-workers and I worked as one. We worked as a team and addressed problems in the same manner.* The hardest part of the job was learning how to get all supportive groups of inter-connected processes to work together and consistently live up to their end of the task.* The most enjoyable part of the job was making commitments to our customer and being able to deliver on those commitments.Good benefits and opportunities for advancement. Moving to a centralized theme wherever possible to provide consistency to employees.Good benefitsGood work environmentterrible communications between departments.little advancement possibilitiesA lot of escaltion/task forcethe majority of employees are waiting to retire and do not care about being productive. management seems to encourage this behavior. it's a wonder things get done.Management leadership skills are lacking. Its more of a dictatorship. You are treated like a number and not a person with a life and family outside of Bosch. The hardest part of the job is the mandatory weekends. Some months we can work of 21 straight days. The most enjoyable part of the job is the pay. Advancement is on a ""who you know not what you know' basis.I have learned a lot from this position regarding strategic planning of the product line, communication with different management levels inside and outside of organization and also i have learned that i am not a 100% office person. I like to travel outside the office, meat people and get challenged by their needs.So it's hard to get a real feel for the company culture/environment.  I work in a Ford facility which is much older and has an older work culture, however while on site at Bosch facilities my experiences were much better. They have to distance themselves from the customer, Ford, even if they're in the same building.A typical day at work for me was extremely rewarding. This was a 7 day operation that required a lot of team work. What I learned from here was my knowledge of heat treat and the importance of team work. The management staff that I worked with was top notch. Most of my coworkers were also top notch. The was really nothing hard about this job but hearing the news we were closing. The great working relationships that you build!!Typical day is mostly desk environment but it greatly depends on the product line one works in.   Being a large company many responsibilities are compartmentalized, however a position where interaction with multiple disciplines was most rewarding because it allows you to become a generalist.  At the same time, you could also become an expert in a specific component, so it's easy to find that this company provides opportunities across the board to fit the breadth of knowledge you're hoping to gain in a product/system.The typical day of work at Bosch starts early and ends late, but it's an enjoyable work environment with good people. I learned how to work hard for room and board, how to make lifelong friends and how to enjoy a salad buffet. Management was effective, and coworkers worked together fluidly. The hardest part was leaving. The most enjoyable parts were learning how to do my tasks more proficiently.( A typical day at work ) my crew and I reaching our daily quota          ( what I learn )  troubleshoot , calibrating , testing , rework                  ( management ) respectful and supportive ( co-workers ) , respectful and willing to lend a hand ,( hardest part of the job )  when machines would malfunction , ( most enjoyable part of job )  leading my guys helping and teaching as much as possibleTreated badly an terrible job security. They followed me to the bathroom an talked down to workers. i will never work there ever again an do not recommend it to anyone.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,"Palo Alto, CA",CA,2016-11-29T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/statistician-job-palo-alto-ca-ca-us-176850010.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
