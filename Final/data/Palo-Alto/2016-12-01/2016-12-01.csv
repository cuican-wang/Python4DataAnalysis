The clients are extremely interested in learning more about career solutions concepts.My coworkers were extremely nice they were generous with their knowledge that they would share at any given time.The hardest part of my job was trying to determine from a client's perspective what was the highest priority item to resolve. Sometimes the clients would come in very confused and in a hurry to get things done. But once I got the client to calm and discuss what was other most pressing needs, the solution became very evident.What I enjoyed the most about Korea solutions was learning new Technology before it even hit the market. We have the latest and greatest software her fingertips. Which may performing our job even easier.Good place to work. No pressure from management.Top level management is very supportive.They need to get more client and should not stick to one single client.Good to work , lot of thing to learn and grow.Management is ok.But facilities to employee can be more.Agree ya specialized in mobile application development.

25,1429.0,Research Scientist - Machine Learning,Bosch,4.1,1300.0,"Review prints find parts to build the machine. if needed I will make the parts. quote jobs talk with customers about there project and if satisfied over build. sometimes customers wants more than what was quoted at the start of the job.My position required leadership skills to direct the work force towards company goals. This included on time deliveries, customer interaction, and diplomacy. Other responsibilities included training of workers, both salary and hourly, and safety. It was a pleasure to work with, on the most part, professional people in their fields of expertise. This created a high expectation that the team would achieve daily and long range goals. I earned the respect from all levels of management.Bosch is a non-profit organization, which means it's not publically traded and there are no share holders. It's a very diverse company, as well as the largest automotive supplier in the world.Bosch treats its employees well and there are many opportunities, especially for those with 4yr degrees.Well structured company to work for. Great benefits. Great pay and fun people to work with. Management was awesome. Was respective very well. Made a lot of friends.It was a OK job just was some lo down employees there. Managers was OK just some of the employees constantly having meetings about who they knew was doin everything wrong.Good benefits and opportunities for advancement. Moving to a centralized theme wherever possible to provide consistency to employees.I loved working at Bosch . If you asked anyone about me you will have very good feedback. Bosch is a fast pace job and it's very easy. Everyone is very polite and positive.I needed more to do. They were trying to force me into another department in which I was uncomfortable with, because it required a lot of computer work. I am not computer savvy; I know bare minimum.I didn't quite like the environment. We have a certain time to get a lunch break or a mini break by the time we eat lunch you're almost late to complete your shift. The warehouse is extremely huge and you have to almost run to get to the front of the warehouse. But then there is that one thing that you cannot do and that is run.Worked for the company for nearly 20 years.  They use to walk the talk of the culture and importance of community.  They used to treat their employees like valuable team members.  Now, it has turned into a burn them and churn them, no matter how much a person has contributed to the success of the organization.Management changes every few years and the culture changes to reflect the beliefs and management practices of the current establishment.Typical day is mostly desk environment but it greatly depends on the product line one works in.   Being a large company many responsibilities are compartmentalized, however a position where interaction with multiple disciplines was most rewarding because it allows you to become a generalist.  At the same time, you could also become an expert in a specific component, so it's easy to find that this company provides opportunities across the board to fit the breadth of knowledge you're hoping to gain in a product/system.So far it is a great environment to work. You get well trained before being left on your own. There is opportunity to grow and advance if hired on permanently. The fact that you have to start as a temp instead of direct hire is kind of a negative due to the pay as a temp. You cannot live on $11/hr.  But if hired perm, the pay is well above average.I learned a lot about different parts. I liked my managers. I got along well with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was when our contract ended. I enjoyed going to work everyday to learn more, and meet new people.Don't recommend, they don't care about the employees only the profits and quantity of parts put out, long hours 7 day work week,lots of employee turnoverDidnt do too much but stacked tools onto a pallet. There was nothing much more to learn. The supervisors were good people and they always checked on you to make sure you was ok.I have learned a lot from this position regarding strategic planning of the product line, communication with different management levels inside and outside of organization and also i have learned that i am not a 100% office person. I like to travel outside the office, meat people and get challenged by their needs.good memories.German culture is great.willing to work in any where in Bosch ltd.Good food and increment is also good.Want to work in Germany and other parts of the world and  i want learn more quality about Bosch products.I did not enjoy working here. The salary was no where near enough to do everything they expect you to do. I was doing work a manager should've been doing.Very productive. I learned  the difference parts of the fuel injectors. Also there are different types of injection. Working for Bosch has been and experience for me because I have learned so many things about the fuel injections.Treated badly an terrible job security. They followed me to the bathroom an talked down to workers. i will never work there ever again an do not recommend it to anyone.great place to work would recommend to other people managment was great took time and cared about employees worked thirds","10,000+",Palo-Alto,Palo Alto,CA,2016-12-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/7731744b-3f8b-4299-9f27-f8b719df54b8?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

337,1741.0,Process Development Chemist,Air Liquide US,3.8,563.0,"They were kind of stiff not very friendly people yet I was not there that long. I learn how to do footnotes for audit. It was an overall okay place. Don't really remember much.Air Liquide is a great place to work for, my time was cut short to to reduction of force at Bayport complex. I understand the decision since Air Liquide purchased the AirgasMy work at Air Liquide was contract so I can't speak about the benefits.  There were several employees who have been there 16+ years so I'm sure they were fine with their benefits.I love working for htis company. The people and atmosphere were great. I am somewhat disappointed there was no option for permanent hire. I would deifinitley work with them again in the futureOnce a very solid company to work for that prided itself on employee relations. After the buyout, they have slowly moved their top figures in who have no minds of their own. Everyone is just trying to exist while not ruffling any feathers even if it may be valuable to the company. Cronyism has consumed this place and will ultimately suck the life out of you.Air liquide is a very safe company to work for. I got a lot of experience driving those big tankers,my manager was always polite.I learned a lot about cryogenics and loading up those tankers and filling those tanks.Great Company to work for. Going in the wrong direction with the merger into Air Gas, Benefits / Compensation all dropped off dramatically. Supervisor willing to bust your balls, but give you his shirt off his back.I do not want to include a review. Air Liquide is a good place to work I guess the benefits are good. Hydrogen is fun. I once saw a rabbit thereA nice commute. Air Liquide offered great leadership and scheduling to their employees as well as a great benefit package.A typical day at work is fairly simple, calling/emailing customers and helping them with their accounts. I learned how to use different systems on a computer and learned more on how to use a computer and using office. The management is very fair and helpful. My co-workers are delightful people to work with and keep to themselves. The hardest part about my job is to just focus on one thing rather than multiple. The most enjoyable part about my job is that I finish things before my deadline and like to take on new projects when possible.This company likes to engineer everything and is almost too concerned with safety. They are very lean with their money, dumping a lot of work on employees before considering adding head count. If you are driven, smart, an engineer, and can play office politics, you will excel in this company.Was a production tech for 8 years before I finally had enough. There is zero work/life balance. As management sees it, they own you. They run bare bones personnel. Averaged 1300 overtime hours per year the last  4 years. Pay was severally behind the rest of the industry. Benefits became fewer and fewer each year. Maintenance was non-existent. Equipment was always going down. Numerous 36 hr. straight shifts getting the plant back up and running. Thankful everyday I was able to get away from there and find a great job.Became adapt at project management in a short period of time while being given the lead on various capital projects.  Also gained engineering knowledge relevant to each project.  Grateful to be given lead project responsibility and learned a great deal about customer interaction as well as internal interaction within the the course of a project at an early stage in my careerVery poor managment...the work is not all that hard...learning process takes many years. In would not recommend working for this company to anyone.I like working for Air Liquide. They need to work on their communication with employees. The company just went through a merger with Airgas and they have not done a good job at communicating what is going on with our jobs.Nice company and easy going coworkers.  Fast paced and heavy workload. Enjoyed customers and helping everyone out. I learned different to track orders. Also learned the different natural gases supplied by Air Liquide. Hardest part was learning the different sizes of containers. The enjoyable part was learning new things.Air Liquide has provided an excellent opportunity to grow with a multinational company. It has given me a chance to learn a diverse set of technical and interpersonal skills.There was always something new and challenging.  There was always something to learn.  Using our work loading to accomplish daily work orders.  Accomplishing the hardest, most difficult task and achieving outstanding results.If you dare , Air Liquide's management has run there company in the ground the constant waist that has gone on for years has led to management turnover .The day They hire you is the day They begin to Fire you. Driver pay is UNcertain. Air Liquide purchased AirGas. Everything will change. Except Safety Choking the ever loving life out of you. Driver is the the catch all for everyone else not doing their own job. 14 hour days are common. Then your asked to work extra. Life? What Life?  Only Management is allowed a life.AL is a good company as a whole, however I had a negative experience mostly due to my direct supervisor and upper management.  I received very little training and no support from my direct supervisor.  He was oftentimes a hinderence to meeting deadlines.  Even though upper management say they have an open door policy, this is far from the truth.  His open door is open only to his small group of friends.  He didn't want to hear anything I had to say.","1,001 to 5,000",Palo-Alto,Fremont,CA,2016-12-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/8d9dcec7-f617-4396-a3a0-2ade83e75e18?mescoid=1900259001001&jobPosition=24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
