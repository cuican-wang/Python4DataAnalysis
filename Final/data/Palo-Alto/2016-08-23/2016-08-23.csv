108,1512.0,S&OP Data Scientist,Logitech,4.1,52.0,"I have been consulting at Logitech for the past 6 months and I can't say enough good things about this company. From the day I started everyone has been pleasant and inviting. As a consultant I have never felt like an outsider.  This company is very good at communicating to it's employees things that are going on within the Company.  Every week they have a get together so that groups can share what is going on in their areas. Communication is something this company does very well.The CEO is very personable and inviting as is all the management I have dealt with. The employees seem happy to be working at Logitech. Keep doing what you are doing Logitech!~Logitech is re-branding itself as a more youthful place and it is working. The company is well-known but small enough to allow for a larger & more impactful role. Compensation packages remain slightly below average for the Bay Area and the location is not prime for those seeking to live in SF. Culture is excellent.Logitech is a great place for a positive and friendly corporate culture that works pretty hard but also allows room for work life balance and provides a lot of opportunity for personal growth and improvement. That being said, as a business they are stuck in the past using old processes and they have a huge issue with working together across departments or fixing organizational issues. Despite being a globally distributed business with over 120 offices worldwide they haven't seemed to figure out how to work efficiently and effectively as a global business and the process keeps tripping everything up. There was a lot of talk constantly in the two years I was there about progress and change and moving forward with new ideals but at the end of the day nothing ever changed.Typical days work includes overall management of processes on behalf of the #PL provider. Monitoring and managing carriers ensure all compliances were adhered to. Creating and providing monthly scorecards to both 3pl and carriers .Liaison between corporate and olive branch.At Logitech I was able to work with many groups throughout my long career with them, from engineering to compliance to executive teams.Great culture to work in Logitech.you feel great to go day by day to your job.They have all the time events for the employers and have a great communication to all the employessThis is a company committed to excellence in every facet of day-to-day life and mission.

Like every place of work it has its own pros and cons. Overall, it is a place to learn new work experience.I just worked as a contractor here.All the people and the environment is great, all the members are nice and friendly. The company has a lot activities to encourage the creativity and the develop of different skills in the resources of the company.Great place to work.The company has a very bricks-and-mortar type feel, however, the new CEO is working hard to change the look & feel and culture of how business is conducted. Going to an open-office setup, committing the company more towards design, and trying to act more like a small company are just a few things he is doing to try to change how the company operatesThis is a company that is now being headed up by a new CEO. It is an exciting time as many chnages will surface. Key decisions will be made about product lines and groups.In the Compensation arena it's exciting because we are always developing areas to motivate and retain employees. One of the key projects I worked on this year was requesting an increase in shares from shareholders. It was quite interesting understanding all the organizations involved in this. We were successful in our request and I also learned and developed another skill of mine.•	Coordinate, support and resolve issues from UAT2 testing for procure to pay track of the R12 upgrade project.•	Worked on preparation of cutover document, preparation of pre cutover, cutover and post cutover activities.•	Resolved critical issues that are preventing the closure of the UAT2 P2P track.•	Managed and coordinated the entire source to settle track (Purchasing,iProcurement,Payable, Payment and Cash management) at the UAT2 with APAC and EMEA business team.•	Resolved many priority issues in a timely manner without delating the UAT2 schedule.Quick moving.
