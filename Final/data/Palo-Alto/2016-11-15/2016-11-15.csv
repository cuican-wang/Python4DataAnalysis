475,1879.0,Analytics Software Developer,IBM,4.0,12500.0,"Great work life balance, however due to IBM being so big, it can be quite challenging to be visible enough to move one's career ahead.Recommendation is to create a summary document each month listing your accomplishments. Review it monthly with your manager and save it for your end of year self review. Have to make yourself known to manager as well as other decision makers throughout the organization.Just getting hired here is not enough. You have to apply to internal projects to work, so your mileage may very depending on your skill set, your competency, and an array of factors. My project is interesting and challenging enough for me, but some of my more able coworkers have gone months without being able to get on a project while the less skilled one are on project by luck. Team structures come with the typical perks and frustrations as one can reasonably expect. Managers are eager to help; shame they help too many people and can be hard to pin down at times.Overall it is your typical office setting. It's decent work for entry level work.Learning and taking on new challenges is something I always looked forward to having in my work day.  Loved learning new software and tools and being able to share my knowledge and skills with co-workers.1) Typical implementation of Google Re-Captcha, UPS monitoring tool for datacenter monitoring was really a challenge. After completion of these task I got appreciation from managers.2) Learned a lot from technical and architecture perspective3) We worked as a team to accomplish these achievement on schedule.4) Maintenance activity to stabilize backend system in job was typical.Good place to work. Worked as substitute teacher. Had a few problems at the start, but overall the experience was enjoyable. No problems at the end, The pay was well.I've never encountered so many talented people in one place. I've enjoyed collaboration with the teams I've worked with.This job required extensive travel and long hours.  Executives will stab you in the back first opportunity they get.  Don't trust them.  Working with customers was rewarding and provided much satisfaction.  Co-workers were awesome and I will miss them.  Constantly changing organization structure and constant expansion of required skills and knowledge made keeping up with job demands difficult.  Never felt appreciated for effort put into this job.Poorly Managed and has little hope of success.  Very large and has a poor character.  Hard to see how they will be successful, as the Senior Management only cares about themselfs.was a great place to work but in recent years they have been moving IT jobs overseas and laying off long time employees. Still some great people thereI didn't learn anything from IBM I was moved from Centurylink to IBM doing the same work with the same pay. I loved the work I did until it was outsourced to India. I was given a chance to find a job within IBM but with my skills was unable to find anything and was then released. The management is not very helpful when they need things it is a hard process to get help with anything most of what I would need I had to figure out on my own.Very nice pace to work and everyone works as a team which is hard to find but it is a family type of enviornment. I think that the company is just gong to be expanding.it was the best shop  to work in, we had all the answers for manfrane capacity, to many meetings also free laptops for emplyees to use, great history at all ibm sitesMy shirt would begin at 8am, i would take calls from mortgage customers and call out to mortgage customers for home mortgage payment.  Every call different due to dealing with new person new personality.  On every call you advise customers importance of maintaining healthy payment habits.Co workers assist if you need assistance on a call. this job has taught me how to manage life expenses and how to prioritize different aspects of life.Working for IBM was like family oriented so being  there was like home away from home everyone I worked there with was like down to earth people they didn't mind pitching in to help when you needed help.- a typical day a work: work on automation process and tooling- what I learned: critical thinking and problem solving- management: flexibility- co-workers: friendly and professionalThis company is pretty bad not going to lie. Contractors do not get hired on unless you can some how manage to make it 10 years as a contractor. I would not suggest applying unless you have a 4 to 8 year degree.I traveled 2 hours to work by the company provided bus. I learned how to proficiently use access, powerpoint and outlook. I had a great boss and my coworkers were nice as well. The hardest part about this job was the 5 hour round trip daily commute.typical day at work is receive  Inbounds /Outbound calls help assisting loan payments escrow question loss mitigation questionsCompany seems to continually Re-Org., shift directions.No job seems secure and most of the (FTE) employees there know it.    There is little value is placed on contractors. It appears management views it is easy to discard the contract labor, based on what direction they (sr. management)  are pursuing.The focus of work or tasks seems to shift based on upper management decisions. The work environment (culture) suffers because of it.  It is not an inspired work environment.   Not a company I would recommend.You get to start your job with peers your age so it's very easy to integrate and feel being part of the company at work. People are generally nice and willing to help out. Work load is light for entry level job but responsibilities will increase as you move up in chain. Since it's a big corporation, the vertical advancement is there but slow. Most of the time you get to rotate to another role between 8 months to 15 months horizontally.In IBM's current desperation to turn around revenue trends, it has become a very hard place to work. Everyone is measure against their ability to directly contribute to that revenue top line and that leaves IBM constantly trying to pivot to the next big thing and leaving other projects and people tossed aside.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,SAN JOSE,CA,2016-11-15T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/6daad95b-edc7-493e-b9f4-810fcc83a0de?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=22,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
