126,1530.0,Junior Data Scientist,"Cisco Systems, Inc.",4.1,1800.0,"energetic environment, start up vibeone of the first ""internet"" companies because of its BBN historyno sure how it has changed over the years; company was being considered for an acquisition when I leftIf you have a good manager at Cisco, it can be a great place to work.  Generally liked my co-workers and almost everyone was helpful.  The ""People Deal"" that HR introduced was a good idea, but really lacked accountability and ability to execute between manager and employee.  The salary and benefits at Cisco are really good, but it's lost it's mojo as evidenced by the yearly lay-offs.During my time at Cisco I worked with some of the brightest and most collaborative individuals in the industry.  I have worked with colleagues, partners and customers that have become life long friends and business partners.  I supported national and global partners with a practice around cloud both private and public offerings.I was a federal sales account manager during my time at Cisco. I supported both the DoD and Civilian side of the federal government. I had the opportunity to work with all five branches of the military. I learned a great deal both about the sales infrastructure for a technology company and about how the military operates from a sales and security point of view. I greatly enjoyed my time there and hope to one day return to that work when my personal life affords me that opportunity. I would highly recommend this work to a motivated individual open to learning all about the technology world and the ability to travel weekly.This company does not slack off with monetary rewards for dedicated service and provides whatever is needed to get the job done.  Working with others in any group in the company is highly encouraged and supported if required.  However, upper management is severely distanced from the workers in the trenches and with excessive bureaucracy, new products can only be added to the portfolio through acquisitions.  The excess jobs requires a rebalance and restructuring annually with a reduction of 5% to 20% of the worldwide workforce.A typical day in IT at Cisco, starts early and ends late, you are always connected.  Is extremely fasted paced, with a steep learning curve, however that can be fun for a while.  Hardest part of the job was the politics, favoritism at the junior to middle management level is difficult to stomach as they have turned favored individual contributors into managers, which doesn't always translate to good management.  Most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with.Cisco offers exposure to plenty of new technology, but often with little training.  The option to work from home was a huge plus.  The constant acquisitions seem to disrupt the product pipelines as they keep changing what is offered to customers.  Things always move very quickly and keeping up is a constant challenge.I have worked at Cisco for over 10 years.  The company has been very good to me as it has given me opportunities to grow, stretch, and explore the world through my work.  As the IT industry shifts and changes, Cisco must continue to innovate and stretch its muscles to stay ahead of the competition.I have enjoyed my time at Cisco and hope to be able to contribute for another 10 years.This company is great. I love my managers and my team. They have a direct interest in my well being with the company.I also love the office setup and vibe. Everyone is super helpful and attentive.I really appreciate that the company allows flexibility in your workday and unlimited PTO. My co-workers are easy to work with, and I feel supported by team leads. I only wish the pay was a bit higher. Because of this, I doubt if I will be able to work here for very long. But for the time being, I'm enjoying learning new things and picking up a few skillsJordan â€¢ 11 minsCisco is fundamently nothing more than a VC/banking company that would prefer to outsource all work to contractors and or AP region.  As soon as it is able to will lay you off.  it has NO loyalty to employees and the HR ""people deal"" is a joke.  Since when is it hard to have a review program that focuses on your performance against goals and metrics without stack ranking you?A typical work day would involve testing and then meeting team members within and other teams. I learned a lot of testing tools and how to get inter dependent team work done in time. The work environment was always positive and friendly. The hardest part of the job was to get the overall picture of the test schedule and the most enjoyable part is you could go as far as you can to build prototypes.I worked at Cisco for many years in many capacities.  I met many wonderful people from all walks of life.  I learned that work was not the only priority at Cisco and in this culture I made great connections.  As a Lobby Ambassador, I was the face of Cisco midtown.  As the Executive Assistant I was the right hand woman of the Operations Director and as the Business Analyst to the sales team, I was an important part of team strategical planning.  The easiest part of the job was the friendships I forged-most difficult was understanding that at the end of the year or quarter the pressure is on and don't take anything personally.  Overall, I learned a lot and wouldn't change the experience for the world.I've worked for Cisco for almost one year and have enjoyed all the people I've worked with.  My manager is easy going and has the attitude of ""as long as the work get's done, I don't care about what hours you are in the office"".  I am able to work from home at least 2 days a week (more if my manager is traveling).  I would stay and convert to a Cisco employee if it were an option.CISCO is a good place to work as long as you realize your contract may end at any time. But they do provide a very laid back culture and an easy going management style.,I learned that CISCO is a work from home friendly workplace.My co-workers on average were very easy to get along with and helpful with needed information.The hardest part of the job was making human connections.My typical day at Cisco was all about collaborating and building great products.  As a PM, I worked closely with Engineers and UX designers to create a better WebEx administration experience.  I also got to play a major role to move us towards a more data-driven culture using metrics and analytics.  I learned more about analytics technologies and best practices.  Cisco is a great place to work.Cisco is filled with great people that make up the unique culture.  It is a big company and sometimes hard to get things done but overall Cisco is a good place to work. They give you the tools to work from anywhere in the world. The C Suite and VPs are going through some changes and the reverberations can be felt at all levels.  It will take some time and strong leadership to get through this and come out ok.I have been working at Cisco Systems full-time (For nearly 2 years). Continued Limited Restructures are causing talented individuals to be let go. Lack of strong senior leadership in some areas and poor decisions are being made.you typically start off with a day of thinking how you can increase the top-line and bottom-line revenue, and make your job relevant to the product(s) in a BG you support by marketing the product to the public domain in which this product is relevant, and then put action behind it to make it happen.The hardest part of the marketing job is when the product is actually a so-so one but you need to make it into a super-star product.My work experiences at Cisco as a self-employed contractor were excellent. Enjoyed working with smart global team members, constantly learned new things and made valuable contributions. Most contract roles have migrated to lower cost areas or to preferred suppliers.There are lots of politics involved in working here which can make or break your career depending on who you know or how ""liked"" you are.  Depending on which business unit you land in you may or may not have resources for personal development.  One benefit is that your direct manager is required to help you progress in the company.Very Political EnvironmentTo be successful it's better to say what VP(S) and directors want to hear rather than sharing ideas and truth's that would make product better Decisions are based on favoritism and not technically founded.TTM decisions are made at the expense of customers at times with plans to solve issue in downstream releases.  Compensation is very good as it includes high salaries, recognition awards, employee stock purchase plans, and restricted stock units","10,000+",Palo-Alto,San Jose,CA,2016-11-22T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/672a2f9d-9bc8-4717-b368-a81b82a0d55d?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
