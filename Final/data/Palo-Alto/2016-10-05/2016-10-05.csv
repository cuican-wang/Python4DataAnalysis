I worked under the Lost and Stolen department. This is a special department for offshore since we only handle customers with lost and stolen phone concerns.Working with T-Mobile is fun and a learning experience, I was able to share my skills and knowledge since I am one of the tenured representatives of the account. Handling newbies is very fulfilling for me since I am a frustrated educator/trainer/director. I was able to grow and learned a lot from this job. I was able to test my capabilities and patience in terms of handling different kinds of people and culture since I am dealing with different types of people in terms of my customers and colleagues and clients.This June, our UK account was sent back onshore.

They will be able to give better results and meet their daily goals if they do not feel overworked and restricted.As [24]7 is my first job, I have learnt how to help the customers in resolving the queries and we do have fun time at work like games etc. My team leader and my co-workers who are much more tenured than me helps me in giving the exact solving for the work.

142,1546.0,"Data Scientist, Quantitative Platform Architect, Gartner Research, Santa Clara, CA or Stamford, CT L",Gartner,3.9,97.0,"The company is headquartered in Stamford, CT, with many domestic and international office locations.Gartner specializes in research, advice, and consulting for CIOs, IT leaders, and technical professionals.The work environment is rigorous and challenging.There are work opportunities in research, sales, and events, among others.The culture is relaxed and friendly, lots of flexibility, some people come in really early and leave early, some come in late and leave later. This div. is run by the EVP of Marketing and she has created a working environment based on the belief that we will get our work done without being controlled or lorded over. In the end it makes for happier employees who achieve big results, accomplishing more than some of the…Culture of a frat house. Lots of favoritism shown towards certain employees. Great learning experience, as you are taught and provided with extremely beneficial feedback. Very forward-looking company.Gartner provides an excellent work life balance.  If you are driven to move up you control your own destiny.  Hard work is acknowledged.Great waterside location. Bad traffic in Stamford, CT.A bit hard to advance as they bring in talent from outside. Very smart people everywhere, hard working, but short hours. At 5:30 everyone is gone except for a few who don't want to leave.Excellent corporate culture and benefits. Challenging environment but opportunities to meet with the brightest IT experts and with interesting and important customers.There is a chance for great camaraderie if you're in the right group. The company is respected in its field and looks great on paper. The team I was in was a well oiled machine until a new manager came in and changed everything, now they are just limping along and all looking to get out (or for the older ones, make it to retirement under the radar). Nice cafeteria. Train shuttle. Nice campus on the water.Great company to start your sales career, they have an amazing training program. This is not your traditional sales job, you will be required to stay up to date to the changes in IT and the industries you cover. You will notice the organization will provide you will a lot of training and resources to be successful in your role. If you're not able to get the flow within the 1st 90 days you will be re-trained and given up to a year to perform or at least have the right mindset. The typical sales cycle last about 2 months if you're doing the right things, you have to be really consultative in selling a username and password. Aligning the problem your're trying to solve to the resources that Gartner provides it's clients. The most enjoyable part of working at Gartner are the smart and responsbile people you work with, everyone seems to be excited to work there. Especially at the End of a Quarter and the EOY. Great company, but a lot of growing pain like weak territories. you are strongly at the will of the accounts you're put into - mainly Healthcare and Financial Verticals make the most money at Gartner! so fight for that or a High Tech role! in SMBField Sales - everything is the same - you are at the will of the economyDepending on the office you work at, freedom around time management and creativity serving business activities can be really pleasant.Fair work-life balance, many truly amazing co-workerThe company has been turning more and more into a corporate ""execute only"" place over timeGartner is a wonderful company to work for.  There is a good work/life balance and the people are wonderful!  My manager was wonderful.  The team was great and super collaborative.  The deadlines are tight but the work gets done.The company is great to work for. Some amazing caliber folks, some not. The work life balance if you have the right manager is great. Mobile work force but depending on your manager, can be micromanaged. Policies aren't set across the board and there's a lot of room for manager's discretion. I had a great manager for a number of years and then another one that I struggled with.This company has so much potential.  The business units are good with the Great Managers, but are a horrible place to work if you have a bad Manager.  Expected to take work home, they do not value Life/Work Balance.You are fresh out of college and have no idea of what professionalism looks like. The recruiters at this company are the best sales people. The career advancement opportunities are minimal at best and picked purely off of popularity and not performace. It is only an inside sales company, there are not any outside sales positions available in the SMB market.Gartner is a fun company that is very youth driven. You will get to work with exciting technology companies and your opportunity for advancement can be realized rather quickly if you are close to the right people. That being said, several people who are not necessarily qualified to be in management get promoted. Having a good manager will make or break your career at Gartner. The only other major drawback is having to move to Fort Myers, Florida.Gartner is one of those companies that people strive for, everyone seems to want to work there. However, they are not very employee friendly. I saw multiple friends get fired without warning and without reason, especially on the sales side. Very little room for growth or advancement if you want to do anything other than sales.Gartner hires people slowly and promotes quickly putting less than best people into management.  However, they have a great environment for people right out of college.Great place for a new grad to learn sales and corp culture.  Lots of great leaders and opportunities to grow.  They have a cafeteria, gym, and other attractive perks for their employees.  Call center sales atmosphere.surrounded by smart and fun people.coworkers are supportive.salary and benefits are ok.tough to grow up in the organization unless you have good contacts.Great brand name and respected company among customers and competitors.  Good work/life balance in most cases, there is a lot to do but freedom in scheduling the work.If you are looking to begin a career in sales or technology, go for it. Just know the environment can be a bit overwhelming if you are a loner or independently driven. They have a heavy ""everyone in"" collaborative work environment which is good for some not for all. Finally, Fort Myers is a city best suitable for my grandma to retire from teaching. Very slow town so be cautious.A typical day at work would consist of me going into the office at 8am. I would unpack my company laptop at my desk and the start working on projects that I have been assigned for the associates that our team of Computer Financial Consultants manages. That includes getting information on clients, putting in data to salesforce, Excel spreadsheets, emials, and personal projects for the associates, ect. I also manage all the associates expenses . Which I make a report and find receipts which they send and send it to FL where the main headquarters is . I make travel arrangements for the associates daily. Car service arrangements too. Keep a filing system. Also a inventory system for the office. I fax and copy all important documents. I pick up most important phone calls from clients and associates as well.","1,001 to 5,000",Palo-Alto,Santa Clara,CA,2016-10-05T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/39c59bb2-5d6d-49bb-99e5-1455b427253d?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
