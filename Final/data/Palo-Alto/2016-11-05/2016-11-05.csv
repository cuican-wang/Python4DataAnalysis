180,1584.0,Senior Data Scientist,Adobe Systems Incorporated,4.2,223.0,"while there and being acquired through 2 aquisitions (allaire/macromedia), the big company feel and not being as known as in the smaller entities got tiresome.  when my office closed, it was a welcomed layoff, however, i still miss working there.I have amazing colleagues in Adobe, they are helpful and diligent. I learned first set of skills on my career path and get involved with state of art technologies. Work & life balance here is fantastic, our work is usually well scheduled that most of us find comfortable working here.Great work space and awesome co-workersWorked with Adobe ElementsManagement was great, let you do your own thingGreat Co-workers still associate with them todayNever experience anything hard about my job, if I had to say anything it was trying to get things out on timeLoved that I had my own office and never over workedGreat experience for the resume but little opportunity for career growth. The annual reorganizations confuse corporate strategy and are very disruptive to productivity.Your peers will help the best they can, but management doesn't spend any time onboarding the knowledge you need for your position. Management also doesn't spend any resources furthering your knowledge with Adobe Solutions or the industry. Their is a wiki, but it is poorly managed. Good luck finding the tools you need to actiquitedly do your job.Fun and Innovative place to work with great benefits including high quality cafeteria and gym.Everyone there is willing to take time to meet with you.Efficiency in sales, multi-tasking, and endurance is a must. The environment, management, and flexible hours for education are amazing. This job is not for the light of heart. Retention is low due to excessive stress and mental capacity required of the representative.The business was great, the customers were great, the employees were great, but the management didn't pay me as a manager, even though I got promoted as one.I worked for an amazing HR specialist and she taught me so many skills to take with me. They were very encouraging and motivated me with everything I've done.Adobe is a great company to work for. It not only offers good benefits but also has a wonderful culture. I was given a real project with real responsibility and was able to sink my teeth into the day-to-day life of this career. The pay was great, the benefits are great and everyone I worked with, from interns to senior executives, were lovely. A great place to work.Receiving calls and taking care of customers.  Multitudes of different computer programs to assist and complete customers requests.  The management is lacking in this business not very professional as to say the least.  Co-workers are the balance between management and daily duties.  They are what makes working for a company worthwhile and what making comes to work satisfying.  The hardest part of the job is to have to listen to people yelling, using profanity and being expected to take it as part of the job.  Not being able to interrupt and let the other person know you are here to help and to try and assist to the best of your ability.  The most enjoyable part is when a customer compliments you on a good job and making certain they have the best experience necessary to have them return to your company and the company acknowledging how wonderful you are doing with the company.  It's not always easy but colleagues as well as those wonderful customers makes it a joy to go to work and do the best that you can possibly do and go home at the end of the day with a smile on your face and a song in your heart for a job well done.It is a great place to work.  I enjoy the co-workers and also the job.  There is free soda on tap.  There is also a gym that you could work out.  It is a relaxing place to work and they try to make you feel comfortable.Security enior Program Manager responsible for maintaining and updating existing and new Knowledge Management systems and processes in support of more thanWorking with great people on interesting campaigns is at the heart of Adobe's culture.  Managers are usually accessible and often work side-by-side with their teams.  Co-workers keep everything interesting.The hardest part of the job is determining where to put one's energy, as there are continual streams of new technologies and methodologies to explore.The best part of the job is, again, the sense that everyone is working together for a greater good.i hate that i have to enter this same review multiple time because the system identifies this as another job.. I worked there for about 5 years i outlined the in my resume however the system doesn't recognize duplicate entriesI've worked here for over 10 years and LOVE it. I've always had great co-workers and work with very smart people.  The company has a lot of benefits for the employees and their families.Adobe is a great place, great people, and excellent work/life balance.The atmosphere is mature. It is common to see that a large number of employees have been there 10, 15, 20 years and have no intention of moving to any other company. Everyone I met had great attitudes and energy and were pleasant to be around. Working at this company was truly a unique experience.I really liked the company and the products. I did not like my manager because she was extremely liberal and feminist and forced her beliefs down my throat. Overall, I was unlucky to be on the team I was placed on, but the company was great and I would have loved to switch to a different team and remain with Adobe.Workload really depends on the team and position.Adobe has great company perks like the gym and free software products for employees.Beautiful, fun place to work, great work space, great benefits, nice people to work with, wonderful atmosphere, excellent cafeteria and gymProgressive and leading edge in Software development. Very much Employees oriented company. A great company to work for. I would love to come back to Adobe systems.A great place to work, but the workload is heavy compared to other companies I've worked at making work/life balance more difficult to achieve.The people (very professional and friendly) and work environment (very clean) and small perks such as Peets coffee and healthy snacks are the best attributes in my experience.I was able to gain some new valuable skills in a short time there and made some great new connections within the team and with other teams.Inter-team communication is very good.","10,000+",Palo-Alto,San Jose,CA,2016-11-05T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/57fbc508-d8bb-4b54-aa94-8938b3fdb01b?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
