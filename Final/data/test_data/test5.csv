1,"Data Scientist - growth, marketing research - San Fran!",CyberCoders,3.5,18.0,"As a selection representative you figure out how to construct your business starting with no outside help. You buckle down putting in 10-12 hour days, yet it will pay off in the event that you keep at it. Try not to enter this occupation supposing you can bear to be lethargic else you WILL fizzle. Great commission setup is fine for a few people however unquestionably not everybody. Youthful air and positive vibes all around.CyberCoders is a solid culture company. The people and most management are very strong and are willing to assist in any way possible. It is not a 9 to 5 so you definitely need to be ready to work long hours to be successful.Sink or Swim.  Management is very hands off, even if you do well you can get swept in layoffs.  Company is not going in the right direction and their approach is very bullish.  Plenty of potential clients/candidates would not work with me due to the ""stigma"" of working with Cybercoders.  It is truly a double edged sword.Fun culture and work environmentGreat money opportunityGreat growth opportunityUnlimited SnacksAbility to work remoteGreat company partiesAs a recruiter you learn to build your business from scratch. You work hard putting in 10-12 hour days, but it will pay off if you keep at it. Do not enter this job thinking you can afford to be lazy else you WILL fail. 100% commission setup is fine for some people but definitely not everyone. Young atmosphere and positive vibes all around.allstate is a fortune 100 company that is a great experience to gain professionalism and experience. Really fun coworkersAfter swearing myself of not returning to the staffing agency world, CyberCoders came along and completely changed my mind. Their approach and constant dedication on investment to staying ahead of the curve with regards to their technology and how they approach the best way to service both their clients and candidates has given me a place that I'm very happy to say I work for.There is plenty of opportunity for growth and the organization is not flat at all. The company as a whole is on a pretty exciting growth path as well.I managed a database of clients and candidates. I did all my own business development by cold calls, emails, linkedin inmails and referrals. I sourced for candidates and matched them with my client staffing needs. Negotiated pay and bill rates and coordinated interviews and placementsGreat place to work at! Company culture is great. Love the people and atmosphere.Like the saying goes""work hard play harder""!!CyberCoders is the leader in full-time technology staffing nationwide for a reason.   You are working with real people working with some of the worlds best companies providing life changing opportunities that help thousands of people grow their careers and income every year.  I read one review that said we were a Spammer and owned by Experian?  Not true.  We are not owned by Experian and your personal information isn't shared with any agency.  Our job requires many phone calls and many emails to insure we reach our targeted audience, but we are no more a spammer than Groupon or Travelzoo when you ask to receive exciting updates that match your specific interests. If you have applied for jobs and are not getting a response, there is no interview request.  You could still be a very good candidate, so followup with us and we'll do our best to make a match.  Hiring managers are very busy and find it hard to reply to every resume, so some go without a response unfortunately.  Internally, all employees of CyberCoders are treated very well with generous compensation packages as well as many in house treats and fun catered events.  The culture is fun and casual, providing recruiters with unmatched marketing and software tools to reach thousands of new passive talent everyday.Nothing feels better than helping someone find a new position and helping a trusted client fill an important need all at the same time.  Ultimately, recruiters are your friends and can help you.  Try us!I worked for Cybercoders for about 4-months. I had heard many good things about them over the years so I was excited to be offered a position to join the team. Unfortunately, from the day I started I saw a lot of red flags that reminded me a lot of another large, international recruiting firm (RHI) where I previously worked. CC has a churn and burn environment and they micromanage you - pulling up reports throughout the day on your activity. They have a TON of meetings - team meetings, company wide meetings, individual meetings - EVERY WEEK! Over the 4 months I was there people quit or were being fired practically every week. The 3 new people on my team that started the same day as I did, were gone within 4 months. Yes, they did have cool quarterly sales party's at an ocean front resort in Orange County. And a summer party that was a blast! But aside from that, the work environment was tedious. You had to achieve a certain # of ""CA's"" per week (Cyber Actions) that you earn by securing a new job order from a client, submitting candidates for open jobs and scheduling in-person interviews between your candidate and client. If you don't meet the required number of CA's, you must attend what I referred to as a ""dunce or disciplinary"" training session for each week you missed the mark...driving 1.5 to 2 hours from their Playa Vista location to Irvine for a 45 minute meeting. Basically, taking up your entire day of productivity when the reason you're having to attend this meeting in the first place is because of what they deem your lack of productivity. Unfortunately,  more... if you have several job orders open with different clients for the same type of position, the candidates you submit only counts for 1 CA, even if you submit the same candidate to 5 different clients. So you're constantly scrambling to meet your CA numbers. A lot of people found ways to trick the system into thinking they earned CA's in order to avoid disciplinary action. WE ARE THERE TO WORK, not to surf the net or mess around so treating us like children is unnecessary.I placed four full time placements within the first 4 months I was there at a profit of almost $100k for the company, but when I called in sick one day when I was supposed to attend one of these disciplinary meetings in Irvine, I was called that very morning and told ""this isn't working out"". Yes, I was fired. I was shocked and surprised. I reminded my manager that we had just met a few days prior and he said I was doing well and making good progress. I could tell he was annoyed I had called in sick rather than drive to Irvine. He just repeated himself ""this isn't working out"". I do not recommend Cybercoders to fellow recruiters. It's a cut throat, micromanaging, churn and burn environment. Plus, you're on a draw, so you may as well just work as an independent recruiter rather than share your profits with the company because you're responsible for 100% of your own salary anyway.  lessOver the years I've seen many many jobs from Cybercoders for which I felt I was well qualified, but have never landed so much as a phone screen when applying through them.Cybercoders reason for being is to insert themselves between you and any prospective employers and extort money from those who might find you a promising candidate. Your interest or potential suitability for a job makes no difference to them, your resume won't leave their computers unless they think they can get a commission out of it. It takes more legwork, but try to filter out Cybercoder ads, target job searches to only return actual employer generated positions and send them your resume directly. You won't get every job you apply for, but at least you don't have to meet some anonymous recruiter's commission checklist before employers see your resume.CyberCoders is becoming a giant staffing firm the industry - and rightfully so! They are surrounded with so much talent from everyone in the organization.Excellent recruiting environment.  Collaborative, excellent management with top-notch tools.One word Resume Farmers! Read many reviews were people were contacted by their 'recruiters"", recommended the candidate apply for the job via their link and never to be heard from again.A good supportive company and they provide pay reflective of the level of experience of the candidate.CyberCoders is very unprofessional.Money hoardersthey will call you all the time just to make the quota",NA,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-12-01T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/data-scientist-growth-marketing-research-san-fran!-job-san-francisco-ca-us-176931443.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

3,Data Scientist,The Judge Group,3.4,82.0,"The recruiter always called me back whenever i had any questions during the time of the contractTypical day at work was very much unsatisfying.I learned that you can't trust this organization at all.Management treats you like a dog!Co workers are back stabbers.Hardest part of the job was never being thanked for all the hard work you do.Can't say I enjoyed working for this company at all!!!no work life balance and compensation is low for the amount of stress and hours you have to put in. Every day you have to come in and work on the same jobs over and over. Recently, they decided to stop using LinkedIn and Indeed as well, making recruiters lives harder.I only worked for Judge briefly. I started in the month of January and by resigned by May. I quickly realized how much I despised this place. By February I began looking for a new job. The office I worked in was very tiny (the size of a small closet). I worked with 3 other people in this closet. The girls I worked with were very mean and extremely rude. They would talk about you the second you walked out of a room and would stop the moment you returned. They were fake nice when you would try to talk to them. I never in my life felt so alone and excluded. I made every attempt to get along with them but they simply wouldn’t have it. I was often pulled into HR to discuss my work attire. There was a strict dress code there but only for certain people. I was in trouble for wearing black suede boots and a military style jacket yet my coworker was permitted to wear a denim jacket and cowboy boots. A lot of the women there would also wear micro miniskirts where I could see more than I wanted to yet my dresses were too short according to HR cause they didn’t cover my knees. The place was very “clicky”. It was like being back in High School. You were either a popular kid or a nerd. I tried to fit in but was pushed out every time I tried. It was very hurtful. I couldn’t get out of there fast enough! And if you like to have time off from work, forget about it! This company does not allow anyone to take unpaid time off and the accrual rate of time off is a joke. Your 1st year you get 3 days! Also, the benefits are probably some of the worst I have ever seen. For a large company,  more... they have horrible health benefits. You will literally be working there for just benefits but never get to use them because the deductibles are so high.  lessGreat company, great people to work with. There is a ton of opportunity to earn a good living if you work hard and dedicate yourself. There is a great work life balance and a work hard play hard culture. Very good opportunity for people who want to learn how to be a recruiter and do it well. Very strong support system and grade A training program. This company will provide you with all the tools to be successful.I enjoyed working as a private contractor. My assignment was in clinical suppoort, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I have learned a great deal about health maintenance, gap remediation and medication uses and indications as well as diagnostic testing indications. I was disappointed that I was not brought on permanently to the position I was at. I was promised a position, but the organization suffered massive budget cuts.a lot of turn around not too much job security, hardest part of the job is to build your client data base. management lacked a bitLove this company, the only problem is the Medical benefits, other than that it's awesome! This is a family oriented Company.Onsite management needs improvement, high turnover in leadership resulting in job security for potential growth with job siteLoved the position I was in and really enjoyed working with the group of people I was with.  I learned quite a bit regarding Healthcare that I hope to use in the future.  I was very disappointed when I was told that the company I was working with did not want to keep me on past my 6 month contract date after I was pretty much convinced that I would be kept on through the next contract with the same company.Most of the branches are pretty ok at judge, but working for healthcare in the corporate office (conshy) is extremely stressful.  In the past year alone they have gone through two internal recruiters which you would think is a bad sign since now the managers themselves are doing the internal recruiting.  Some account managers are very high strung, and those who run the office treat the recruiters like a number.  Most recruiters have to bend/break the rules to meet quotas mainly out of fear for being yelled at.  These recruiters work extremely hard, and at least 45 hours a week not including all the work from home to keep up with the cycle.They say the pay scale is competitive, however it is pretty basic compared to other firms, honestly 32,000 (about 13 bucks an hour...) after you get your bachelors is really low.  I feel like they are taking advantage of students coming right out of college. The commission plan is ok but its very rare to make anything noticeable in commission until after six months. The promotions they run are fairly difficult to hit, one recruiter out of thirty might get a small gift for hitting a quota. As recruiters we've been yelled at, and cursed at for things that we cannot control such as a candidate taking another job, not showing for their interview despite telling us they would, etc.  Again kicking you while you are down.  Since they try to motivate by fear, most people are too scared of losing their job to report anything.  If you are recently graduated and have few other options, then get some experience there and get out.  Hardest  more... part of the job - hitting the quota.Most enjoyable part - the recruiters and recruiting managers are nice people, but they are being taken advantage of.  The Judge family and executives seem like genuine people, though you dont hear much from them.  lessgood first job out of college. not a lot of room for growth though. hours are long but you can make money at this job if you work hard. its a lot of luck so you need to be resilient.Good environment,great co-workers and manager.A very good place to learn and work with different technologies.Fast paced environment .Good company to work for.  I like the fact that they pay weekly.  The beginning pay process I think may need some attention, and the fact that you have to track time in the assigned company's system, and also in Judge's system is a bit cumbersome and always involves coordination, etc.I would definitely recommend this company for the college graduate or anyone who is in the market of looking for a job. They look to fit you with the best job to fit your experience.Good communication, responsive to employee inquiries, fair pay. Managers respond to inquiries concerning, job assignments, hours of work and pay issuesThis office has a great work environment! Everyone is wonderful and the director is the best. It is best to be confident in what you say and be prepared to make a lot of phone calls. You must definitely enjoy talking to people to succeed here!The company is focused on metrics more than anything, and if you aren't hitting your numbers consistently then you're hearing about it.  There are a lot of jobs to be worked on, but the environment sometimes isn't very fun.  There is a lot of turnover and it doesn't show much stability.  Seems like the only successful people are those who have been there for 5+ years, junior recruiters have a hard time growing.A lot of shady stuff happens at this company.Contractors get bad pay & benefits so it is not worth the time.People are cattle not humans to this place. The more they can push through without the real experience for the job doesn't matter as long as that person stays employed so the recruiter can get their money.This is a place that gives good recruiters a bad name. Most seem like failing sales people that can't make it at a real sales job.Worked from home on Insurance company's national project.  LOVED being a telenurse.The Judge Group was wonderful to work with -  Very Responsive, Well Compensated.  Would DEFINITELY work for them again!Good company to work for.Benefits were not viable once you figured the cost of buying into the 401-k and insurance plans.Pay rate was excellent allowing for purchasing healthcare and other services on your own.No support in finding a new position once the current position came to an end. They said if we found one that was available they would be happy to submit us. Despite that, I would work for them again. They seemed to be an honest straight forward company to work for.",201 to 500,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-11-25T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/data-scientist-job-san-francisco-ca-us-176710549.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

7,"Senior Scientist, T-cell Directing Therapies in South San Francisco, California","Pfizer, Inc.",4.2,1900.0,"A typical day at work - checkin with your team on any issues affecting the working environment for the scientist and set priorities to get the facility back up to standards.What I learned - I learned to be a leader on a few projects and take on some responsibility on improving energy efficiencies. My co-workers were great, we had a softball league that we participated in.The hardest part of the job was when the company had to reduce staffing.Great benefits, great coworkers, and emphasis that all contribute to ""helping to made medicines""  which will in turn make a positive impact in the world. Emphasis on a ""healthy Pfizer"" - free flu shots for colleagues,  fitness center on site.After I graduated form the Pharmacy School, I work for Pfizer as a medical rep., as the policy in Saudi Arabia mandated to have healthcare background. The workplace, the system is exceptional and you well interact with the finest workforce in the industry among the companies. The firm policy is strict, either internally or at the market, the resources you have to achieve your goal are the best among other companies. However, the advangates come with a price, as the market leading position of Pfizer in the market required an exceptional performance in utilizing the resources provided to maintain the leader position, in which it will too tough at the begging, but it will be easier and funnier when you acquire the experience.I enjoyed the work and I excelled quickly. However, the culture and particular consultant that I worked under was a micro-manager and did not allow for lunches, breaks, nor open communication among fellow team members. I learned how to navigate within a new database and how to work with the procurement team and other licensing departments. I used skills and techniques in order to update, renew, sell and support Pfizer clients and vendors with their newer software launch program.I was familiar with their software set up for the most part and ticketing system due to the many different applications that I used on a regular basis with my previous place of employment.I did a great amount of database clean up and worked to update the licensing information and manage the software contracts of the different clients and vendors that worked with and for Pfizer.The most difficult task of my everyday was overcoming the poor moral of the environment and the level of micro management that existed.Don't get me wrong.. I can handle some of the toughest scenarios and I have had my fair share of bosses in Corporate America that had some level of micro management. However, this woman and this consultant took it to new extremes. It was unhealthy overall and I should have been more cautious when she said that her turn over was high. None the less, I respect the nature of the position and I am flattered to have been chosen to work on her team and represent this company. I am grateful for all experiences that are put in my path, be it good, bad or indifferent.I believe  more... that nothing is coincidence anymore, rather what you choose to make of the situation. I am a firm believer that attitudes and behaviors drive success. This was the biggest hurdle within this situation. Therefore, out of respect for the team and my future.. I did not want to waste time pursuing a position that wasn't going to be a good fit and a permanent career move.  lessI worked remotely for the entire contract there. I had some travel involved, but not excessive. Due to expectation of evening change windows, it gave me flexibility to take time during the day to complete other activities.I loved my job and everything that came with it. I was a very dedicated worker and did my best with every assignment I was given.Very friendly and great place for learning      had a positive experience working at Bioclinica. I had great team and very supportive colleagues. I enjoyed working with my client.Pfizer is a great place to work it is a great environment to grow gain valuable knowledge and they always put family first and completely understand the difficult balance for family and work.A typical day consist of ISO Training, emails, and keeping the equipment running. Often the equipment is ran as close to its failure rate as possible to maximize production but at the cost of downtime to the equipment. I learned how these medicines are made and the importance for each and every one of them. I also learned that the challenges changed every day and that being able to adapt was crucial!Management has a few good ones within the fold but they are stifled by their upper management. Most of management is willing to listen at what you say, but often not willing to do anything to change it until it is well past its time to do so. There seems to be a buddy system amongst certain areas of management to keep the same contract companies when their are better ones out there.My co-workers were the best part of my career here. We worked well as a team to complete task. whether these task were in our specified area or not. We built bonds that ensured to one another that we had each others back.The hardest of part of my job was being hand tied by management. (i.e Not being able to fix equipment when it needed it but only to patch it up.) Management is the hardest part of the job.The most enjoyable are the family/ friend bonds that were created over time that allowed myself and my co-workers to grow. We accepted or challenges day in and out. The stress at times was high but we always got through it together!Excellent environment for innovation and research. Friendly and helpful colleagues and management. Most enjoyable part of job is constant learning. Typical day spent in lab and at desk.Often 16 hour shifts, every other day.In clean room for 2 hrs out to ours.Many SOPs constantly updated and reviewed.A lot of training, but not proper training. Poor decision making on management.Great learning experience, however the company has limited growth opportunities. Also the company is infamous for laying off colleagues and cost cutting.Goals are clearly identified and you can cross train in other jobs.Great mentoring program due to large talent pool. Good sense of job satisfaction and make great friends while overcoming the challenges of a highly regulated industry.I work at Pfizer for sixteen years with an excellent group of people. It was a great team work environment and outstanding leadership that encourage every employee to develop their skills and advance their careers.Very productive place to work  enjoyed working  with the people on my shift we had very good teamwork  The work environment was very enjoyable and peacefulNice place to work. No work was ever too physically demanding and I worked with a lot of experienced and helpful individuals. I learned a lot about production while I worked here and would recommend it to just about anyway. The hardest thing about the job was just learning to get into a rhythm of checking everything  on the machine to make sure everything was running ok. I did enjoy everybody I worked with though.Difficult to navigate the multi-layered, old school corporate ways in order to identify best path for career growth.  The culture can change from team to team.Was only with PFE for a short time, but my impression is that at the time PFE ws a ""my way or the highway"" company in their absorption of Pharmacy. We had many talented people and excellent process that they did not even consider when they purchased Pharmacia.Great life/work balance. Challenging work within a great corporate culture with perks of a fabulous cafeteria, gym, lovely offices and lots of collaboration amongst colleagues.I do not want to make a comment on this company, therefore, I wont say anything bad about it.

9,"Staff Scientist, (Accelerator Directorate, Accelerator Diagnostics Department Head)",SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory,4.3,10.0,"SLAC is a wonderful place to work.  SLAC is a DOE laboratory operated by Stanford University, meaning employees get the perks of being Stanford staff and can also enjoy being part of the global accelerator community.  Employees generally stay around for many years, even decades, since they love the work, publishing papers, and attending international conferences.  Operating an accelerator 24-7 creates a job culture where people want to work long hours and often don't notice they're working late when they're working together to setup the beam for an experiment.However, affordable housing and childcare is difficult to find in the area, pushing more young families to commute long distances or move on to other laboratories.  The waiting lists for infant care often exceeds a year and long commutes put a substantial strain on the work-life balance.Used to be a great place to work and be immersed in pure science. The lab is compartmentalized into fiefdoms which are all different from each other. The best-funded division is LCLS and has a lot of potential.number of smart people to work with;  enjoy the work, but budget is unstable; origination changed frequently; in-consistent management;people are busy, don't have much time to chat.Great place to be exposed to desk work and business work. It is also a great place to get exposed to the financial part of a company.Great opportunity to work with a wide range of employees in developing new horizons in science provide profession growth and life balance.Stanford University is a beautiful place to work. Benefits are excellent. The company is very diverse and it was enjoyable working   with other people from around the globe.My typical day at work includes both office work ad experimental hands-ons. Learned a lot during my past four years here and enjoyed it! People are in general easy-going, proficient, and helpful here. The hardest part of my job is the flexible and sometimes unpredictable work hours.It is a good environment to come to work everyday. I've learned new things which the physicists had discovered during their experiences such as new atoms. My co-workers are very friendly. We have  gone out for lunch and talked about our social life. We have had a big gym in the lab. We can sign up for exercise classes or do on our own time during break, lunch, or after work. The hard part of the job is the funding from the government. If the DOE will not give us enough funding there will be some laid off. Over all, it is a nice place to work.It were many interesting projects. The team work was very fruitful, people were friendly and supportive.It was good time!I Enjoyed working there; people are nice and mostly cooperative. It has a decent benefits package. Commute to work is not difficult. For most of the positions, hours are flexible.",NA,San-Francisco,Menlo Park,CA,2016-11-09T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/staff-scientist-accelerator-directorate-accelerator-diagnostics-department-head-job-menlo-park-ca-us-175747345.aspx?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
10,Associate Scientist III,Experis,3.8,301.0,"Good experience.  Professional and helpful.  Submitting time sheet is easy.  They have employee appreciation days.  They work well with you when you need time off.Great company culture, mangers experienced in developing teams and meeting client goals.  The co-workers work as a cohesive team and help team members meet their goals.High stress with metrics and lots of changes. Pay cuts and layoffs and taking away of benefits really has left me angry and overall I'd give them a 3 or 4 star.Great company, better than average pay.  Really good people to work with, interesting projects, professional environment, exciting clients to work with.so many clients and productive work. Management is reachable and good to work with them.Average Compensation with Poor Benefits.No relocation allowances and no paid leaves.I have enjoyed working as a Financial Consultant for Experis.  I am their employee, and have all the benefits of a full time position, and can be choosy about the positions that I accept.I was able to work remotely (at home).  Not a lot of support.  All issues, you could get a bottom box for not waking someone's dog in California.  Over all a good company to work for.Experis owns a far-reaching staffing system assisting both local and enterprise partners in IT, Engineering and Finance environments. With the power of the ManPower brand behind it, Experis is a global force in the market.Since Experis IT is a vendor for Microsoft Studios games division, there are many down times at the company which means important people are let go from their position with no other reason than, 'Your project is coming to a close and we don't have anywhere to move you.' This is understandable to get rid of the excess work force that had ramped up during project heavy times, but they get rid of cornerstones of the company on a regular basis. The direct management of the game testing company is pretty solid - they are approachable, helpful, and always open to feeback - be it good or bad. Experis management, outside of our facility, does not understand the gaming industry and bases peoples performance on their bug output, without taking anything else into consideration.The atmosphere at Experis is a very fun and laid back atmosphere. The people that tend to work there, though some of them are quite young, are almost always a joy to be around. Coworkers are what make this place into a fun environment (that and the testing of video games). The people that you directly work with and relationships that can form because of that are most enjoyable parts of the job.One of the hardest parts of the job is that we are almost never given any sort of design/requirements documentation. We must files issues and reverse engineer documentation based on the bug resolutions (Fixed, Won't Fix, By Design, External).Another tough part of the job is that the developers almost never hit their milestone acceptance dates which creates backed up work in a Waterfall environment. Constant  more... risk and mitigation planning is what gets us through the times when delivery dates are not met.A typical day at work for a QA Engineer contains but is not limited to:Running bug triage to appropriately prioritize bug fixesEngineering tasksMentoring testersWriting test specs and test cases for deliverablesReporting to partners for transparent coverage detailsExecution of tasks createdRisk assessmentClarifying or expounding on results of testingRegression testing  lessI would say its a decent company to start your career or during early phase of your career.This firm has a decent clientele and one can get some diverse experience.Every Monday I would receive a list of new hires from JPMorgan Chase (nationwide; about 100 users per week) and would organize them into an Excel spreadsheet. I would then order software and applications required to perform their job. I learned great data analysis skills as well as organizational skills and time management. My co-workers were always very positive and motivational.Good job, good company to work for. I enjoyed working for Experis, prompt pay process. I was a consultant on a contract site and not directly at Experis.I was always treated with great respect and given every opportunity to express any personal issues with a placement and helped professionally by building my skills to advance in my professional career.A lot of things you cannot control but they are very understanding when it comes to that part of the job.But overall a great companyExperis Finance has provided a rich variety of work experiences for a consultant in finance and accounting, as well as internal audit. It is a fairly flat organization. They are not at the cutting edge of technology, in that it has to be well-established before adoption for their consultants. Local management is very competent in leading their practice.I was hired for a temporary assignment. Scion Dental was the client. The assignment was fine. Manpower- I had a neutral experience. somethings were inconsistentThis company is amazing. Excellent benefits, excellent recruitment. Worked with the Office 365 Ambassador Team and learned more than I could have imagined.Flexible working hoursFlexible scheduling environmentGood salarydesirable work loadThis experience stretched me in the realm of customer service and supportI really enjoyed my time there.  They were easy to get along with.  Flexible with appointments, and genuinely cared about getting me more work.I enjoy what I do everyday- that is helping people find work and building client relationships to help them win in the changing world of work.I have learned the way that many Engineers work and how short term it is with their projects.  If you work smart and hard, you will earn the compensation you want and deserve.","10,000+",San-Francisco,Redwood City,CA,2016-11-22T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/associate-scientist-iii-job-redwood-city-ca-us-176536917.aspx?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=6,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The people I work for and my colleagues are so much fun and I appreciate the opportunity to work with each one of them. I also love the Fiestas that Novartis through for Employees.•	Establish, maintain and develop strong relationships with customers and key decision makers within the practices;•	Implement current marketing strategies and initiatives;•	Manage the territory's assigned operating budget; ensuring timely expense management;•	Ensure all pricing and contracts are in-line and executed pursuant to company policy and procedures;•	Maintain accurate customer profiles and provide new customer data/sales data into company database; and•	Seamlessly communicate with the corporate sales team and account managers.High Tech , too mulch overtime ,very little appreciation, Management constantly shiftimg, 12 supervisors in ten years ,half of them come in and try to make a name for themselves. High integrity , people constantly getting fired, great 41k.Great work/life balance.Great atmosphere, campus and decent pay.I would absolutely come back to work again.  Excellent internal growth.Good company moral.I worked with the legal team.  I was given assignments that were tedious and repetitive.  I knew that no one else wanted to do this type of work, so because I love this type of work, it was a fun job.great company. had a good career run with them. great training and salary plus compensation. worked there for 14+ years and progressed in my career. launched  several great drugs and had great sales success.Wonderful and positive atmosphere with great people who enjoy coming to work on a daily basis, made this an incredible place to work. Family oriented environment.a good company, friendly work environment, career training opportunities. Decent benefits, work/life balance is OK.Traditional big pharma company which allows for numerous job opportunities to top performers. It also allows for a work environment of steady changes. The bad is generally less pay then the smaller companies as well as the small fish in big ocean feel.Many changes with moving to a BPO offshoring delivery for Fianance Procurement and HR.  Much transition but company trying to keep opportunities available and work life rewardingThis is a great company.  There's a lot of room for growth.  All that I have learned has been beneficial in other jobs I have had in my career in Manufacturing Production Department.As a Senior Lead Administative Assistant to the Group, I was responsible for the group of Administrative Assistant to the Department.  We use to meet once a month to discuss different aspects of their jobs.Depends on what group you are in.  Some understand the current culture and provide opportunities for growth, but others do not.  It can be really slow to get ideas moving forward if at all.I started with Sandoz and continued through to the evolution of Novartis, and truly enjoyed launching a new product every 18 months in the early days. Great training and support structure.Thrive in a collaborative setting and dynamic work environment.  Appreciate having that environment at Novartis, with many development opportunities available.I had a large territory, so there was no work life balance.Had several good managers that were realists.  Understood the territory and would do what they could to help me succeed.Hardest part of the job was overnights.  Home for 2 weeks, on the road for 2 weeks each month.What made the job enjoyable were the success stories from the physicians that I called on when they would tell me that my drug changed somebody's life for the better.High demanding job and still able to maintain a life/ work family balance. Comrade, relationships and ability to work together on projects keeps the workplace interesting.Interesting work; excellent pay and benefits; diverse work; currently tight expense management; diverse suite of products; focused on being an employer of choiceNovartis is a very successful company which is mainly attributed to its emphasis on innovation, research and development, retaining top talent as well as focus on safety and quality. The company is extremely focused on delivering results and the place can be intense sometimes. However if one is comfortable under pressure and is geographically mobile, the opportunities for growth are ample.Good market level compensation. 4 major layoffs over past 6 years. no promotions. Lots of great people.At the end personal experience depends on manager and department. I was lucky one.Micromanagement at its worst.  You can never trust anyone here because they will stab you in the back for personal gain.  Managers are bullies and know how to dictate only.","10,000+",San-Francisco,San Carlos,CA,2016-11-21T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/senior-quality-control-associate-chemist-job-san-carlos-ca-us-176492976.aspx?mescoid=1900306001001&jobPosition=6,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Apex systems failed to properly contact me when my contract ended.I was very pleased with this service.   They landed me a job that I enjoyed and the pay was great.  The associate was really great.  He called often to check on me and make sure things were going wellMy contract with Apex was very productive. The company gave good instruction on how to complete your daily job tasks. My co-workers and I got along with each other very well, we supported each other. The job was not hard at all, matter of fact it was a very easy job. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing so many cities and States.After fourteen years of military service all I can say is that it was worth it.  They really take care of their soldiers and their families.  It is really a family oriented military now.  better than it was beforeCo-workers were amazing people to work with.  The company itself doesn't value it's employees unless the employee is making money for them.  They only want metrics.They made the contracting process easy.  Once I started working for the contracted company I didn't have much interaction with Apex.  Didn't have to worry about much, Apex handled everything.Working for Apex is an awesome experience. Having representation onsite at the clients location is an added value. They have exceptional training courses and provide a pleasurable work experience.Computer day varies depending on the level or issue that has to be taken care of with the customer. Some days where slow but mostly busy all the time.The workplace is nice. A good mix of stressful and calmness. The other contractors are also very enjoyable which shows a good hiring process.They don't have the abitly to get you in a job full time and are not ganentee a place with the employer they put you with.They are contract company so when your contact is up you are done.I enjoyed working for Apex. Again this is a recruiting outfit and the interaction day to day is limited.  They paid adequately and the recruiters were friendly.This company pays a great compensation for both hours and mileage. They are a contract service, so the down fall is when your contract is over, you have no more work, unless there is another company needing you in your area. I was sadden when my contract was over, the hardest part was I was doing computer work for State Farm, and had to drive all over Louisiana.I got injured on the job!!!!! and got the run around lied to !!!!! They do not care about you if you get hurt they just fire you and ignore phone calls and emais .  Very unprofessional would not recommended working for themA decent company to work for.  Traveling is about 75% of the time.  There were many times when no work was available.  Scheduling can be difficult as it is through the military.this place please stay away from them they lie and blackball everyone and their pay sucks you work in a unhealthy work environmentWork in aggressive environment to thoroughly test the application. Able to learn new software and procedures. Apex presented opportunity with growth potential.Nice company to work for, good and understanding management, they value employees and try all possible best to make sure you're  happy with your job•	Break / Fix Windows XP /7 operating system repair services•	Track issues through Vantive & Remedy ticket system•	Reimage of PC•	Blackberry Setup & Configuration •	Configuration via Lotus Notes, Outlook Setup•	Used Active Directory to change passwords and add software to client's account•	Deployment and Installation (Laptops and Desktops)You still experience college life while slowly transitioning into a semi-professional environment. Can be very cliquish but still a fun place to work.""They"" say you will be reimbursed for your expenses within 2 weeks. Not my experience, More like 3 weeks and you better make sure before you order that the restaurant has a point of sale machine that prints itemized receipts, has a good ribbon in the machine and you can get a good scan of the receipt. Really? No handwritten receipts are acceptable. So, local money to restaurants without these things is not reimbursable.This is on a $3+ BILLION HP contract with the Navy. Oh and BTW. They only pay 8 hours of travel each way so if they send you across the country and it takes 12 hours, you will be paid for 8.Depending on your HP supervisor, you will get 8 hours if you get their numbers for the day or you will get the hours you worked. Efficiency is not rewarded on a random supervisor basis.Worked at Dell as contract employee.  Poor hours, weekends and benefits were nearly non existent.Dell was hard to work with because of the Dell culture and metrics involved.
