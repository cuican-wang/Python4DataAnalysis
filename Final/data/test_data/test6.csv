1,"Data Scientist - growth, marketing research - San Fran!",CyberCoders,3.5,18.0,"As a selection representative you figure out how to construct your business starting with no outside help. You buckle down putting in 10-12 hour days, yet it will pay off in the event that you keep at it. Try not to enter this occupation supposing you can bear to be lethargic else you WILL fizzle. Great commission setup is fine for a few people however unquestionably not everybody. Youthful air and positive vibes all around.Fun culture and work environmentGreat money opportunityGreat growth opportunityUnlimited SnacksAbility to work remoteGreat company partiesCyberCoders is a solid culture company. The people and most management are very strong and are willing to assist in any way possible. It is not a 9 to 5 so you definitely need to be ready to work long hours to be successful.Sink or Swim.  Management is very hands off, even if you do well you can get swept in layoffs.  Company is not going in the right direction and their approach is very bullish.  Plenty of potential clients/candidates would not work with me due to the ""stigma"" of working with Cybercoders.  It is truly a double edged sword.allstate is a fortune 100 company that is a great experience to gain professionalism and experience. Really fun coworkersAs a recruiter you learn to build your business from scratch. You work hard putting in 10-12 hour days, but it will pay off if you keep at it. Do not enter this job thinking you can afford to be lazy else you WILL fail. 100% commission setup is fine for some people but definitely not everyone. Young atmosphere and positive vibes all around.I managed a database of clients and candidates. I did all my own business development by cold calls, emails, linkedin inmails and referrals. I sourced for candidates and matched them with my client staffing needs. Negotiated pay and bill rates and coordinated interviews and placementsCyberCoders is becoming a giant staffing firm the industry - and rightfully so! They are surrounded with so much talent from everyone in the organization.Great place to work at! Company culture is great. Love the people and atmosphere.Like the saying goes""work hard play harder""!!CyberCoders is very unprofessional.Money hoardersthey will call you all the time just to make the quotaA good supportive company and they provide pay reflective of the level of experience of the candidate.I worked for Cybercoders for about 4-months. I had heard many good things about them over the years so I was excited to be offered a position to join the team. Unfortunately, from the day I started I saw a lot of red flags that reminded me a lot of another large, international recruiting firm (RHI) where I previously worked. CC has a churn and burn environment and they micromanage you - pulling up reports throughout the day on your activity. They have a TON of meetings - team meetings, company wide meetings, individual meetings - EVERY WEEK! Over the 4 months I was there people quit or were being fired practically every week. The 3 new people on my team that started the same day as I did, were gone within 4 months. Yes, they did have cool quarterly sales party's at an ocean front resort in Orange County. And a summer party that was a blast! But aside from that, the work environment was tedious. You had to achieve a certain # of ""CA's"" per week (Cyber Actions) that you earn by securing a new job order from a client, submitting candidates for open jobs and scheduling in-person interviews between your candidate and client. If you don't meet the required number of CA's, you must attend what I referred to as a ""dunce or disciplinary"" training session for each week you missed the mark...driving 1.5 to 2 hours from their Playa Vista location to Irvine for a 45 minute meeting. Basically, taking up your entire day of productivity when the reason you're having to attend this meeting in the first place is because of what they deem your lack of productivity. Unfortunately,  more... if you have several job orders open with different clients for the same type of position, the candidates you submit only counts for 1 CA, even if you submit the same candidate to 5 different clients. So you're constantly scrambling to meet your CA numbers. A lot of people found ways to trick the system into thinking they earned CA's in order to avoid disciplinary action. WE ARE THERE TO WORK, not to surf the net or mess around so treating us like children is unnecessary.I placed four full time placements within the first 4 months I was there at a profit of almost $100k for the company, but when I called in sick one day when I was supposed to attend one of these disciplinary meetings in Irvine, I was called that very morning and told ""this isn't working out"". Yes, I was fired. I was shocked and surprised. I reminded my manager that we had just met a few days prior and he said I was doing well and making good progress. I could tell he was annoyed I had called in sick rather than drive to Irvine. He just repeated himself ""this isn't working out"". I do not recommend Cybercoders to fellow recruiters. It's a cut throat, micromanaging, churn and burn environment. Plus, you're on a draw, so you may as well just work as an independent recruiter rather than share your profits with the company because you're responsible for 100% of your own salary anyway.  lessOver the years I've seen many many jobs from Cybercoders for which I felt I was well qualified, but have never landed so much as a phone screen when applying through them.Cybercoders reason for being is to insert themselves between you and any prospective employers and extort money from those who might find you a promising candidate. Your interest or potential suitability for a job makes no difference to them, your resume won't leave their computers unless they think they can get a commission out of it. It takes more legwork, but try to filter out Cybercoder ads, target job searches to only return actual employer generated positions and send them your resume directly. You won't get every job you apply for, but at least you don't have to meet some anonymous recruiter's commission checklist before employers see your resume.One word Resume Farmers! Read many reviews were people were contacted by their 'recruiters"", recommended the candidate apply for the job via their link and never to be heard from again.Excellent recruiting environment.  Collaborative, excellent management with top-notch tools.CyberCoders is the leader in full-time technology staffing nationwide for a reason.   You are working with real people working with some of the worlds best companies providing life changing opportunities that help thousands of people grow their careers and income every year.  I read one review that said we were a Spammer and owned by Experian?  Not true.  We are not owned by Experian and your personal information isn't shared with any agency.  Our job requires many phone calls and many emails to insure we reach our targeted audience, but we are no more a spammer than Groupon or Travelzoo when you ask to receive exciting updates that match your specific interests. If you have applied for jobs and are not getting a response, there is no interview request.  You could still be a very good candidate, so followup with us and we'll do our best to make a match.  Hiring managers are very busy and find it hard to reply to every resume, so some go without a response unfortunately.  Internally, all employees of CyberCoders are treated very well with generous compensation packages as well as many in house treats and fun catered events.  The culture is fun and casual, providing recruiters with unmatched marketing and software tools to reach thousands of new passive talent everyday.Nothing feels better than helping someone find a new position and helping a trusted client fill an important need all at the same time.  Ultimately, recruiters are your friends and can help you.  Try us!After swearing myself of not returning to the staffing agency world, CyberCoders came along and completely changed my mind. Their approach and constant dedication on investment to staying ahead of the curve with regards to their technology and how they approach the best way to service both their clients and candidates has given me a place that I'm very happy to say I work for.There is plenty of opportunity for growth and the organization is not flat at all. The company as a whole is on a pretty exciting growth path as well.",NA,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-12-01T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/data-scientist-growth-marketing-research-san-fran!-job-san-francisco-ca-us-176931443.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

3,Data Scientist,The Judge Group,3.4,82.0,"The recruiter always called me back whenever i had any questions during the time of the contractTypical day at work was very much unsatisfying.I learned that you can't trust this organization at all.Management treats you like a dog!Co workers are back stabbers.Hardest part of the job was never being thanked for all the hard work you do.Can't say I enjoyed working for this company at all!!!no work life balance and compensation is low for the amount of stress and hours you have to put in. Every day you have to come in and work on the same jobs over and over. Recently, they decided to stop using LinkedIn and Indeed as well, making recruiters lives harder.I only worked for Judge briefly. I started in the month of January and by resigned by May. I quickly realized how much I despised this place. By February I began looking for a new job. The office I worked in was very tiny (the size of a small closet). I worked with 3 other people in this closet. The girls I worked with were very mean and extremely rude. They would talk about you the second you walked out of a room and would stop the moment you returned. They were fake nice when you would try to talk to them. I never in my life felt so alone and excluded. I made every attempt to get along with them but they simply wouldn’t have it. I was often pulled into HR to discuss my work attire. There was a strict dress code there but only for certain people. I was in trouble for wearing black suede boots and a military style jacket yet my coworker was permitted to wear a denim jacket and cowboy boots. A lot of the women there would also wear micro miniskirts where I could see more than I wanted to yet my dresses were too short according to HR cause they didn’t cover my knees. The place was very “clicky”. It was like being back in High School. You were either a popular kid or a nerd. I tried to fit in but was pushed out every time I tried. It was very hurtful. I couldn’t get out of there fast enough! And if you like to have time off from work, forget about it! This company does not allow anyone to take unpaid time off and the accrual rate of time off is a joke. Your 1st year you get 3 days! Also, the benefits are probably some of the worst I have ever seen. For a large company,  more... they have horrible health benefits. You will literally be working there for just benefits but never get to use them because the deductibles are so high.  lessGreat company, great people to work with. There is a ton of opportunity to earn a good living if you work hard and dedicate yourself. There is a great work life balance and a work hard play hard culture. Very good opportunity for people who want to learn how to be a recruiter and do it well. Very strong support system and grade A training program. This company will provide you with all the tools to be successful.I enjoyed working as a private contractor. My assignment was in clinical suppoort, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I have learned a great deal about health maintenance, gap remediation and medication uses and indications as well as diagnostic testing indications. I was disappointed that I was not brought on permanently to the position I was at. I was promised a position, but the organization suffered massive budget cuts.a lot of turn around not too much job security, hardest part of the job is to build your client data base. management lacked a bitLove this company, the only problem is the Medical benefits, other than that it's awesome! This is a family oriented Company.Onsite management needs improvement, high turnover in leadership resulting in job security for potential growth with job siteLoved the position I was in and really enjoyed working with the group of people I was with.  I learned quite a bit regarding Healthcare that I hope to use in the future.  I was very disappointed when I was told that the company I was working with did not want to keep me on past my 6 month contract date after I was pretty much convinced that I would be kept on through the next contract with the same company.Most of the branches are pretty ok at judge, but working for healthcare in the corporate office (conshy) is extremely stressful.  In the past year alone they have gone through two internal recruiters which you would think is a bad sign since now the managers themselves are doing the internal recruiting.  Some account managers are very high strung, and those who run the office treat the recruiters like a number.  Most recruiters have to bend/break the rules to meet quotas mainly out of fear for being yelled at.  These recruiters work extremely hard, and at least 45 hours a week not including all the work from home to keep up with the cycle.They say the pay scale is competitive, however it is pretty basic compared to other firms, honestly 32,000 (about 13 bucks an hour...) after you get your bachelors is really low.  I feel like they are taking advantage of students coming right out of college. The commission plan is ok but its very rare to make anything noticeable in commission until after six months. The promotions they run are fairly difficult to hit, one recruiter out of thirty might get a small gift for hitting a quota. As recruiters we've been yelled at, and cursed at for things that we cannot control such as a candidate taking another job, not showing for their interview despite telling us they would, etc.  Again kicking you while you are down.  Since they try to motivate by fear, most people are too scared of losing their job to report anything.  If you are recently graduated and have few other options, then get some experience there and get out.  Hardest  more... part of the job - hitting the quota.Most enjoyable part - the recruiters and recruiting managers are nice people, but they are being taken advantage of.  The Judge family and executives seem like genuine people, though you dont hear much from them.  lessgood first job out of college. not a lot of room for growth though. hours are long but you can make money at this job if you work hard. its a lot of luck so you need to be resilient.Good environment,great co-workers and manager.A very good place to learn and work with different technologies.Fast paced environment .Good company to work for.  I like the fact that they pay weekly.  The beginning pay process I think may need some attention, and the fact that you have to track time in the assigned company's system, and also in Judge's system is a bit cumbersome and always involves coordination, etc.I would definitely recommend this company for the college graduate or anyone who is in the market of looking for a job. They look to fit you with the best job to fit your experience.Good communication, responsive to employee inquiries, fair pay. Managers respond to inquiries concerning, job assignments, hours of work and pay issuesThis office has a great work environment! Everyone is wonderful and the director is the best. It is best to be confident in what you say and be prepared to make a lot of phone calls. You must definitely enjoy talking to people to succeed here!The company is focused on metrics more than anything, and if you aren't hitting your numbers consistently then you're hearing about it.  There are a lot of jobs to be worked on, but the environment sometimes isn't very fun.  There is a lot of turnover and it doesn't show much stability.  Seems like the only successful people are those who have been there for 5+ years, junior recruiters have a hard time growing.A lot of shady stuff happens at this company.Contractors get bad pay & benefits so it is not worth the time.People are cattle not humans to this place. The more they can push through without the real experience for the job doesn't matter as long as that person stays employed so the recruiter can get their money.This is a place that gives good recruiters a bad name. Most seem like failing sales people that can't make it at a real sales job.Worked from home on Insurance company's national project.  LOVED being a telenurse.The Judge Group was wonderful to work with -  Very Responsive, Well Compensated.  Would DEFINITELY work for them again!Good company to work for.Benefits were not viable once you figured the cost of buying into the 401-k and insurance plans.Pay rate was excellent allowing for purchasing healthcare and other services on your own.No support in finding a new position once the current position came to an end. They said if we found one that was available they would be happy to submit us. Despite that, I would work for them again. They seemed to be an honest straight forward company to work for.",201 to 500,San-Francisco,San Francisco,CA,2016-11-25T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/data-scientist-job-san-francisco-ca-us-176710549.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

7,"Senior Scientist, T-cell Directing Therapies in South San Francisco, California","Pfizer, Inc.",4.2,1900.0,"A typical day at work - checkin with your team on any issues affecting the working environment for the scientist and set priorities to get the facility back up to standards.What I learned - I learned to be a leader on a few projects and take on some responsibility on improving energy efficiencies. My co-workers were great, we had a softball league that we participated in.The hardest part of the job was when the company had to reduce staffing.Great benefits, great coworkers, and emphasis that all contribute to ""helping to made medicines""  which will in turn make a positive impact in the world. Emphasis on a ""healthy Pfizer"" - free flu shots for colleagues,  fitness center on site.After I graduated form the Pharmacy School, I work for Pfizer as a medical rep., as the policy in Saudi Arabia mandated to have healthcare background. The workplace, the system is exceptional and you well interact with the finest workforce in the industry among the companies. The firm policy is strict, either internally or at the market, the resources you have to achieve your goal are the best among other companies. However, the advangates come with a price, as the market leading position of Pfizer in the market required an exceptional performance in utilizing the resources provided to maintain the leader position, in which it will too tough at the begging, but it will be easier and funnier when you acquire the experience.I enjoyed the work and I excelled quickly. However, the culture and particular consultant that I worked under was a micro-manager and did not allow for lunches, breaks, nor open communication among fellow team members. I learned how to navigate within a new database and how to work with the procurement team and other licensing departments. I used skills and techniques in order to update, renew, sell and support Pfizer clients and vendors with their newer software launch program.I was familiar with their software set up for the most part and ticketing system due to the many different applications that I used on a regular basis with my previous place of employment.I did a great amount of database clean up and worked to update the licensing information and manage the software contracts of the different clients and vendors that worked with and for Pfizer.The most difficult task of my everyday was overcoming the poor moral of the environment and the level of micro management that existed.Don't get me wrong.. I can handle some of the toughest scenarios and I have had my fair share of bosses in Corporate America that had some level of micro management. However, this woman and this consultant took it to new extremes. It was unhealthy overall and I should have been more cautious when she said that her turn over was high. None the less, I respect the nature of the position and I am flattered to have been chosen to work on her team and represent this company. I am grateful for all experiences that are put in my path, be it good, bad or indifferent.I believe  more... that nothing is coincidence anymore, rather what you choose to make of the situation. I am a firm believer that attitudes and behaviors drive success. This was the biggest hurdle within this situation. Therefore, out of respect for the team and my future.. I did not want to waste time pursuing a position that wasn't going to be a good fit and a permanent career move.  lessI worked remotely for the entire contract there. I had some travel involved, but not excessive. Due to expectation of evening change windows, it gave me flexibility to take time during the day to complete other activities.I loved my job and everything that came with it. I was a very dedicated worker and did my best with every assignment I was given.Very friendly and great place for learning      had a positive experience working at Bioclinica. I had great team and very supportive colleagues. I enjoyed working with my client.Pfizer is a great place to work it is a great environment to grow gain valuable knowledge and they always put family first and completely understand the difficult balance for family and work.A typical day consist of ISO Training, emails, and keeping the equipment running. Often the equipment is ran as close to its failure rate as possible to maximize production but at the cost of downtime to the equipment. I learned how these medicines are made and the importance for each and every one of them. I also learned that the challenges changed every day and that being able to adapt was crucial!Management has a few good ones within the fold but they are stifled by their upper management. Most of management is willing to listen at what you say, but often not willing to do anything to change it until it is well past its time to do so. There seems to be a buddy system amongst certain areas of management to keep the same contract companies when their are better ones out there.My co-workers were the best part of my career here. We worked well as a team to complete task. whether these task were in our specified area or not. We built bonds that ensured to one another that we had each others back.The hardest of part of my job was being hand tied by management. (i.e Not being able to fix equipment when it needed it but only to patch it up.) Management is the hardest part of the job.The most enjoyable are the family/ friend bonds that were created over time that allowed myself and my co-workers to grow. We accepted or challenges day in and out. The stress at times was high but we always got through it together!Excellent environment for innovation and research. Friendly and helpful colleagues and management. Most enjoyable part of job is constant learning. Typical day spent in lab and at desk.Often 16 hour shifts, every other day.In clean room for 2 hrs out to ours.Many SOPs constantly updated and reviewed.A lot of training, but not proper training. Poor decision making on management.Great learning experience, however the company has limited growth opportunities. Also the company is infamous for laying off colleagues and cost cutting.Goals are clearly identified and you can cross train in other jobs.Great mentoring program due to large talent pool. Good sense of job satisfaction and make great friends while overcoming the challenges of a highly regulated industry.I work at Pfizer for sixteen years with an excellent group of people. It was a great team work environment and outstanding leadership that encourage every employee to develop their skills and advance their careers.Very productive place to work  enjoyed working  with the people on my shift we had very good teamwork  The work environment was very enjoyable and peacefulNice place to work. No work was ever too physically demanding and I worked with a lot of experienced and helpful individuals. I learned a lot about production while I worked here and would recommend it to just about anyway. The hardest thing about the job was just learning to get into a rhythm of checking everything  on the machine to make sure everything was running ok. I did enjoy everybody I worked with though.Difficult to navigate the multi-layered, old school corporate ways in order to identify best path for career growth.  The culture can change from team to team.Was only with PFE for a short time, but my impression is that at the time PFE ws a ""my way or the highway"" company in their absorption of Pharmacy. We had many talented people and excellent process that they did not even consider when they purchased Pharmacia.Great life/work balance. Challenging work within a great corporate culture with perks of a fabulous cafeteria, gym, lovely offices and lots of collaboration amongst colleagues.I do not want to make a comment on this company, therefore, I wont say anything bad about it.

9,"Staff Scientist, (Accelerator Directorate, Accelerator Diagnostics Department Head)",SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory,4.3,10.0,"SLAC is a wonderful place to work.  SLAC is a DOE laboratory operated by Stanford University, meaning employees get the perks of being Stanford staff and can also enjoy being part of the global accelerator community.  Employees generally stay around for many years, even decades, since they love the work, publishing papers, and attending international conferences.  Operating an accelerator 24-7 creates a job culture where people want to work long hours and often don't notice they're working late when they're working together to setup the beam for an experiment.However, affordable housing and childcare is difficult to find in the area, pushing more young families to commute long distances or move on to other laboratories.  The waiting lists for infant care often exceeds a year and long commutes put a substantial strain on the work-life balance.Used to be a great place to work and be immersed in pure science. The lab is compartmentalized into fiefdoms which are all different from each other. The best-funded division is LCLS and has a lot of potential.number of smart people to work with;  enjoy the work, but budget is unstable; origination changed frequently; in-consistent management;people are busy, don't have much time to chat.Great place to be exposed to desk work and business work. It is also a great place to get exposed to the financial part of a company.Great opportunity to work with a wide range of employees in developing new horizons in science provide profession growth and life balance.Stanford University is a beautiful place to work. Benefits are excellent. The company is very diverse and it was enjoyable working   with other people from around the globe.My typical day at work includes both office work ad experimental hands-ons. Learned a lot during my past four years here and enjoyed it! People are in general easy-going, proficient, and helpful here. The hardest part of my job is the flexible and sometimes unpredictable work hours.It is a good environment to come to work everyday. I've learned new things which the physicists had discovered during their experiences such as new atoms. My co-workers are very friendly. We have  gone out for lunch and talked about our social life. We have had a big gym in the lab. We can sign up for exercise classes or do on our own time during break, lunch, or after work. The hard part of the job is the funding from the government. If the DOE will not give us enough funding there will be some laid off. Over all, it is a nice place to work.It were many interesting projects. The team work was very fruitful, people were friendly and supportive.It was good time!I Enjoyed working there; people are nice and mostly cooperative. It has a decent benefits package.

10,Associate Scientist III,Experis,3.8,301.0,"Good experience.  Professional and helpful.  Submitting time sheet is easy.  They have employee appreciation days.  They work well with you when you need time off.Great company culture, mangers experienced in developing teams and meeting client goals.  The co-workers work as a cohesive team and help team members meet their goals.High stress with metrics and lots of changes. Pay cuts and layoffs and taking away of benefits really has left me angry and overall I'd give them a 3 or 4 star.Great company, better than average pay.  Really good people to work with, interesting projects, professional environment, exciting clients to work with.so many clients and productive work. Management is reachable and good to work with them.Average Compensation with Poor Benefits.No relocation allowances and no paid leaves.I have enjoyed working as a Financial Consultant for Experis.  I am their employee, and have all the benefits of a full time position, and can be choosy about the positions that I accept.I was able to work remotely (at home).  Not a lot of support.  All issues, you could get a bottom box for not waking someone's dog in California.  Over all a good company to work for.Experis owns a far-reaching staffing system assisting both local and enterprise partners in IT, Engineering and Finance environments. With the power of the ManPower brand behind it, Experis is a global force in the market.Since Experis IT is a vendor for Microsoft Studios games division, there are many down times at the company which means important people are let go from their position with no other reason than, 'Your project is coming to a close and we don't have anywhere to move you.' This is understandable to get rid of the excess work force that had ramped up during project heavy times, but they get rid of cornerstones of the company on a regular basis. The direct management of the game testing company is pretty solid - they are approachable, helpful, and always open to feeback - be it good or bad. Experis management, outside of our facility, does not understand the gaming industry and bases peoples performance on their bug output, without taking anything else into consideration.The atmosphere at Experis is a very fun and laid back atmosphere. The people that tend to work there, though some of them are quite young, are almost always a joy to be around. Coworkers are what make this place into a fun environment (that and the testing of video games). The people that you directly work with and relationships that can form because of that are most enjoyable parts of the job.One of the hardest parts of the job is that we are almost never given any sort of design/requirements documentation. We must files issues and reverse engineer documentation based on the bug resolutions (Fixed, Won't Fix, By Design, External).Another tough part of the job is that the developers almost never hit their milestone acceptance dates which creates backed up work in a Waterfall environment. Constant  more... risk and mitigation planning is what gets us through the times when delivery dates are not met.A typical day at work for a QA Engineer contains but is not limited to:Running bug triage to appropriately prioritize bug fixesEngineering tasksMentoring testersWriting test specs and test cases for deliverablesReporting to partners for transparent coverage detailsExecution of tasks createdRisk assessmentClarifying or expounding on results of testingRegression testing  lessI would say its a decent company to start your career or during early phase of your career.This firm has a decent clientele and one can get some diverse experience.Every Monday I would receive a list of new hires from JPMorgan Chase (nationwide; about 100 users per week) and would organize them into an Excel spreadsheet. I would then order software and applications required to perform their job. I learned great data analysis skills as well as organizational skills and time management. My co-workers were always very positive and motivational.Good job, good company to work for. I enjoyed working for Experis, prompt pay process. I was a consultant on a contract site and not directly at Experis.I was always treated with great respect and given every opportunity to express any personal issues with a placement and helped professionally by building my skills to advance in my professional career.A lot of things you cannot control but they are very understanding when it comes to that part of the job.But overall a great companyExperis Finance has provided a rich variety of work experiences for a consultant in finance and accounting, as well as internal audit. It is a fairly flat organization. They are not at the cutting edge of technology, in that it has to be well-established before adoption for their consultants. Local management is very competent in leading their practice.I was hired for a temporary assignment. Scion Dental was the client. The assignment was fine. Manpower- I had a neutral experience. somethings were inconsistentThis company is amazing. Excellent benefits, excellent recruitment. Worked with the Office 365 Ambassador Team and learned more than I could have imagined.Flexible working hoursFlexible scheduling environmentGood salarydesirable work loadThis experience stretched me in the realm of customer service and supportI really enjoyed my time there.  They were easy to get along with.  Flexible with appointments, and genuinely cared about getting me more work.I enjoy what I do everyday- that is helping people find work and building client relationships to help them win in the changing world of work.I have learned the way that many Engineers work and how short term it is with their projects.  If you work smart and hard, you will earn the compensation you want and deserve.","10,000+",San-Francisco,Redwood City,CA,2016-11-22T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/associate-scientist-iii-job-redwood-city-ca-us-176536917.aspx?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=6,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Excellent internal growth.Good company moral.I worked with the legal team.  I was given assignments that were tedious and repetitive.  I knew that no one else wanted to do this type of work, so because I love this type of work, it was a fun job.great company. had a good career run with them. great training and salary plus compensation. worked there for 14+ years and progressed in my career. launched  several great drugs and had great sales success.Wonderful and positive atmosphere with great people who enjoy coming to work on a daily basis, made this an incredible place to work. Family oriented environment.a good company, friendly work environment, career training opportunities. Decent benefits, work/life balance is OK.Traditional big pharma company which allows for numerous job opportunities to top performers. It also allows for a work environment of steady changes. The bad is generally less pay then the smaller companies as well as the small fish in big ocean feel.Many changes with moving to a BPO offshoring delivery for Fianance Procurement and HR.  Much transition but company trying to keep opportunities available and work life rewardingThis is a great company.  There's a lot of room for growth.  All that I have learned has been beneficial in other jobs I have had in my career in Manufacturing Production Department.As a Senior Lead Administative Assistant to the Group, I was responsible for the group of Administrative Assistant to the Department.  We use to meet once a month to discuss different aspects of their jobs.Depends on what group you are in.  Some understand the current culture and provide opportunities for growth, but others do not.  It can be really slow to get ideas moving forward if at all.I started with Sandoz and continued through to the evolution of Novartis, and truly enjoyed launching a new product every 18 months in the early days. Great training and support structure.Thrive in a collaborative setting and dynamic work environment.  Appreciate having that environment at Novartis, with many development opportunities available.I had a large territory, so there was no work life balance.Had several good managers that were realists.  Understood the territory and would do what they could to help me succeed.Hardest part of the job was overnights.  Home for 2 weeks, on the road for 2 weeks each month.What made the job enjoyable were the success stories from the physicians that I called on when they would tell me that my drug changed somebody's life for the better.High demanding job and still able to maintain a life/ work family balance. Comrade, relationships and ability to work together on projects keeps the workplace interesting.Interesting work; excellent pay and benefits; diverse work; currently tight expense management; diverse suite of products; focused on being an employer of choiceNovartis is a very successful company which is mainly attributed to its emphasis on innovation, research and development, retaining top talent as well as focus on safety and quality. The company is extremely focused on delivering results and the place can be intense sometimes. However if one is comfortable under pressure and is geographically mobile, the opportunities for growth are ample.Good market level compensation. 4 major layoffs over past 6 years. no promotions. Lots of great people.At the end personal experience depends on manager and department. I was lucky one.Micromanagement at its worst.  You can never trust anyone here because they will stab you in the back for personal gain.  Managers are bullies and know how to dictate only.","10,000+",San-Francisco,San Carlos,CA,2016-11-21T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/senior-quality-control-associate-chemist-job-san-carlos-ca-us-176492976.aspx?mescoid=1900306001001&jobPosition=6,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
12,SAS Programmer,Apex Systems,3.8,313.0,"Boston Medical Center was a great company to work for. Apex systems failed to properly contact me when my contract ended.This company pays a great compensation for both hours and mileage. They are a contract service, so the down fall is when your contract is over, you have no more work, unless there is another company needing you in your area. I was sadden when my contract was over, the hardest part was I was doing computer work for State Farm, and had to drive all over Louisiana.Worked at Dell as contract employee.  Poor hours, weekends and benefits were nearly non existent.Dell was hard to work with because of the Dell culture and metrics involved.  Call center work.•	Break / Fix Windows XP /7 operating system repair services•	Track issues through Vantive & Remedy ticket system•	Reimage of PC•	Blackberry Setup & Configuration •	Configuration via Lotus Notes, Outlook Setup•	Used Active Directory to change passwords and add software to client's account•	Deployment and Installation (Laptops and Desktops)""They"" say you will be reimbursed for your expenses within 2 weeks. Not my experience, More like 3 weeks and you better make sure before you order that the restaurant has a point of sale machine that prints itemized receipts, has a good ribbon in the machine and you can get a good scan of the receipt. Really? No handwritten receipts are acceptable. So, local money to restaurants without these things is not reimbursable.This is on a $3+ BILLION HP contract with the Navy. Oh and BTW. They only pay 8 hours of travel each way so if they send you across the country and it takes 12 hours, you will be paid for 8.Depending on your HP supervisor, you will get 8 hours if you get their numbers for the day or you will get the hours you worked. Efficiency is not rewarded on a random supervisor basis.Nice company to work for, good and understanding management, they value employees and try all possible best to make sure you're  happy with your jobLove the benefits at Apex. Work environment can be stressful at times as there are many personalities to work with. I have learned and am still learning many new things at Apex. The hardest part of work at Apex are the deadlines and having short staff.My contract with Apex was very productive. The company gave good instruction on how to complete your daily job tasks. My co-workers and I got along with each other very well, we supported each other. The job was not hard at all, matter of fact it was a very easy job. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing so many cities and States.Friendly co-workers, excellent communication between employees and management, and a low stress work environment. Your recruiter will be on hand to answer any questions concerning monetary negotiations or problems encountered in the workplace. Managers in the building always encourage gaining knowledge by asking questions and they are completely committed to resolving any issues that may arise. Co-workers and managers alike are extremely friendly and helpful.Working for Apex is an awesome experience. Having representation onsite at the clients location is an added value. They have exceptional training courses and provide a pleasurable work experience.I got injured on the job!!!!! and got the run around lied to !!!!! They do not care about you if you get hurt they just fire you and ignore phone calls and emais .  Very unprofessional would not recommended working for themThey made the contracting process easy.  Once I started working for the contracted company I didn't have much interaction with Apex.  Didn't have to worry about much, Apex handled everything.Seems like location culture varies. New Jersey location is cut throat.  Little to no communication after you're placed.  Position turned out to be nothing as contracted. Several times the pay was messed up. No follow up until the last minute for extension on contract.  They don't fight for you, pretty much will lie and just do what the client wants. If you have a good profession and are looking for a good fit, this is not the agency to get it done. Its all about the money. Pay is low balled unless they are desperate to place someone in a company they are trying to get as long term clients.  Worst experience to date.Computer day varies depending on the level or issue that has to be taken care of with the customer. Some days where slow but mostly busy all the time.They don't have the abitly to get you in a job full time and are not ganentee a place with the employer they put you with.They are contract company so when your contact is up you are done.I was very pleased with this service.   They landed me a job that I enjoyed and the pay was great.  The associate was really great.  He called often to check on me and make sure things were going wellA decent company to work for.  Traveling is about 75% of the time.  There were many times when no work was available.  Scheduling can be difficult as it is through the military.After fourteen years of military service all I can say is that it was worth it.  They really take care of their soldiers and their families.  It is really a family oriented military now.  better than it was beforeGreat place to work coming out of college - surrounded by people you age, fast paced and fun environment.Secure position with lots of room for advancementWork always comes home with you though and can quickly become highly stressfulCo-workers were amazing people to work with.  The company itself doesn't value it's employees unless the employee is making money for them.  They only want metrics.I enjoyed working for Apex. Again this is a recruiting outfit and the interaction day to day is limited.  They paid adequately and the recruiters were friendly.","1,001 to 5,000",San-Francisco,Oakland,CA,2016-11-21T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/sas-programmer-job-oakland-ca-us-176517978.aspx?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

The managers are really nice and outgoing, I pretty much get along with everybody. The hardest part sometime might be with a customer that won't let you do your job and them arguing with you. The best part I think is just working with my co-workers and helping out a customer that needs help with an item.this company is fun and it teaches you that you shouldn't be afraid to talk to people. Also that everyday you work that you are never doing the same thing. the people that work there are amazing people they make me work hard.There is never a dull moment and there is always a constant buzz in the atmosphere.

19,"Senior Data Scientist - Twin Cities, MN or Boston, MA",UnitedHealth Group,3.7,4300.0,"Work with a great team and manager. Love working autonomously, but can get lonely. Compensation is ok. Do not make near the median income for the metro area I live in.  Health benefits are not great .The job is virtual/work from home and I have found it a good place to work.  However, since it is work from home, they are strict about you always being at your computer unless you're on a break.I have been working at UHG for some time. The work environment is excellent.  It is a big company and not all departments have the same culture. The salary and benefits leave you wanting.The pay is minimal. The over time is manadatry.The company is very large. Over last 5 years the company has gone to a work at home platform. Very hard to find a manager unless you are being corrected.Would love to work for them again but of course under new management. Loved what I did. Loved all my previous supervisors, team lead and managers.It is an ok place to work.  There is nothing spectacular to say, you log on the computer, you work, you go to lunch, you log back in, you work some more, you log out and go home. You come back the next day and you do the same thing. The end.no cell phones on the floor you have to lock away your purses and cell phones in a locker and you can not use paper at all on the call center floor. it is like you are in jail. however it pays the bills.Answer anywhere from 60-80 inbound calls on a daily basis assisting health care providers for claims, pre-certification, and benefits.Most enjoyable part of my job is learning something new each day.Good culture of people, the training for the position was really bad.  Did not cover anything that we actually do; so not prepared once we got started.  Very punitive in nature regarding these issues.  Employee accumulates ""defects"" for items they were not trained on; they call it a ""coaching opportunity"".Fun eventful work days. They gave free food for lunch of your from any stand in the stadium. great team work. i learned a lot i didn't know about basebal.lDuring my current project, I've met with many employees from many different backgrounds. Everyone I met was great to work with and passionate about the work they do.UHC Oldsmar is all about your call numbers not about its' employees.Management at best is very young with no experience. It's a good old boy network and if they like you your are not written up with below standard numbers or the days you miss don't count toward your attendance. If you like being a robot this JOB is for you.... If you don't kiss a** you will not be in the click!I love the culture within the company,there is room for advancement as well as competitive pay. I have acquired many skills within the company and the continuous innovation.This job was the stepping stone into my bookkeeping background. I worked directly for the accounting supervisor and the CFO.Very positive company, with a great benefit package.I loved my job with this company. I had a great support system and excellent work/family balance. I had a family illness and was able to work through all my crises.Could be a great place too work.  Not a clear focus on the marketplace direction. Hard to accomplish goals with monthly management changes.  good coworkers.  Ability to work from home, which limited the amount of commute time.seems difficult at first but as you start to understand it becomes easier. great place for advancement if you can make it thru the first year.the job itself is a great career, it is a fantastic feeling knowing i made a difference in someones life.  I enjoy helping families in need and doing everything i can to solve their issue.Worked as a Hadoop developer in United Health Group for nearly 2 years as a fulltime employee in offshore Hyderabad, India location. It is indeed a wonderful experience and team is well managed.It was a professional work environment, where they do take the best care of you possible. Individuals were always friendly and welcoming.Great Company! Always working to improve and implement better Service for the Customer. Compassion is very big in this company.

24,Sr. Scientist,Sanofi US,4.1,1400.0,"Fast paced environment with quickly changing priorities. Most employees are friendly an contribute to a comfortable work culture.A typical day at work was very productive and challenge due to the professional culture that requires us to be the front runner in the pharmaceutical business. I learned the strategic, and logistics planning of the Pharmaceutical industry. My upper management were very supportive of getting all the latest technology and education training by proving opportunities within the company and outside the company. My co-workers were very professional and team players. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with the Bridgewater township in some of our critical construction and or renovation project. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interactions with the scientific community and the support team.Checking emails for urgent matters was the first thing I did every morning. I learned to prioritize and what it means to work as a team.  Working along side management help me to grow professionally and it gave me the confidence that I needed to push myself to levels I did not think I could achieve. The people I worked with not only were my partners at work but we became a family.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the reorganization of the company.  A lot of changes came very quickly and we had to adjust to new faces and new responsibilities.  Our strength was how we all came together and embraced the changes.  The work, changes and obstacles will always be there but when you have a group of people that are willing to work as a team it makes coming to work enjoyable.Stressful environment with a constant scare of layoff. Professional training is provided to some who are close to management. Management mostly cares about their own benefits and do not value hard work. The hardest part of the job to deal with mediocre management. The best part of the job is to work with  professional Genzyme people that are still working for Sanofi.Sanofi is a great pharmaceutical company that takes pride in the concern for their employees, in patient care, and development and marketing of cutting-edge drugs. Overall, Sanofi is a great place to work with many benefits and continued educational possibilities.Fantastic benefits and extremely flexible work/life balance.  Overall great company to work for. Financial forecast process can be painful dealing with French corporate office.Sanofi is a big Pharmaceutical company which bought Genzyme back in 2010, office in Cambridge is still have liberal mentality even though the Sanofi French methodology of work try to be injected.Vacations are good and 8 hrs daily work is enough to finish the daily tasks .The majority of the packaging staff were really great people to work with. That was a great perk of the job. Job and safety training were a plus with this company. They stayed on top of ensuring their employees were trained and knew proper procedures for safety. The downside was the pay was not commensurate the the labor and responsibilities. However, the benefits provided by the company were fairly good. Some of the Management staff really made it a difficult place to work while a few others were some of the best I've ever worked for. Overall, management just didn't balance out as somewhere I would consider staying long-term. Because of the issues with some of the Management, morale tending to be very low among most of the subordinate staff and there were no real checks and balances in place for employees who felt they were being treated unfairly.Started my career in Pharma at Sanofi-Aventis. It was a great working environment. I enjoyed working with my team and always felt appreciated.  The benefits and salary were great as was the location of the company.Sanofi is a great place to work but the company is in transition and people are a little uncomfortable at this time. As a result, people are starting to look for other opportunities.Company is under new leadership and as such, massive reorganization. The intent of the reorganization was sensible but has not always been executed as intended and significant  job elimination has occurred. High hopes that they will fine tune things and reach their potential.  Enjoyed working there.Multiple challenges and fast paced environment. A place you can learn many skills and be well rewarded. Great colleagues and opportunities.Sanofi is an excellent place to work.  Good work/life balance and salary. I recommend this company to others seeking a challenging environment.I have been at this company for 10 years.  The only item in which I have is the pay. If you have been in the company a long time the pay is low.  Besides that, it is a great company and excellent benefits.Love what the company does for the world. However, it's hard to move ahead at times. Great benefits, and vacation time, etc.Working At Snaofi was nothing short of eye opening to the business world for me and how things should be run at every company. Every employee there was exceptional, kind, and so helpful to a college student like me who was just learning the ropes of how to become part of a proper working environment with the big dogs. It allowed me to give new meaning to the word professional environment. Sanofi Pasteur in Swiftwater, PA was an institution. Each aspect of the company was tightly regulated and everyone moved with a sense of purpose to achieve common goals through collaborative efforts. I learned so much that summer at Sanofi. Every day i would wake up looking forward to work because each day would hold new challenges and inspire new ideas in me about how to improve myself and become a better than the old me.A multinational corporation that has a lot of different business units.  Company consistently has high senior executive turnover.The Job Work and Life Balance are great.

27,Principal Statistical Programmer (Home Based),PAREXEL International Corporation,3.6,243.0,"Excellent organization with work life balance and career development.Provides good benefits in terms of health and other aspects.Parexel is a CRO.  My job consisted of regulatory review, submitting protocols to IRB.  I reviewed invoices for payment.  I enjoyed working with sites and co-workers to help get a protocol started in a timely manner.  We worked at a fast pace and always willing to help each to make the project successful.The people at the company are great.  co-workers are very supportive. Management is bad. Productivity is measured by numbers which is fine except management keeps changing what is important and defining goals that are loaded with buzzwords but are fundamentally useless on a day to day basis.  Learning is OJT which is fine. there is always a budget crisis.  But the people are really great and the sense of humor at non management levels is enjoyable.Good work place to begin once career, the management try their best to ensure that everyone imbibe the Parexel culture. working here really gave me the opportunity to learn a lotWhen you arrive in the morning, you check emails for any updates or any critical changes in the DB. You get to learn very quick how to be proactive for the good management of the DBThe job is very demanding, although you do not need to have a specific professional formation. It is a huge company so that you learn to work along with people from all over the world. The environment is very nice, and mostly young people from 20-30 years old work there.I worked there for years and decided to leave after my last review.  I was held back from promotion for not completing something that wasn't included in my goals.  There workload is heavy, it's difficult to get promoted and the department goes through frequent reorgsManagement of clinical category (Patient Recruitment); responsible for strategic oversight and management of supplier relationship management, spend/savings targets, MSA negotiations, score card and rate cards. Strategic Sponsor Partnership management over 3 main Partnerships - Procurement Lead.PAREXEL is a good place to work however there is limited career growth opportunities.  Also there is a decline in senior management oversight, leadership & support within Quality but overall a good starting point for experience.PAREXEL has a good work and fast paced environment. Learn many aspects of Early Phase Clinical Research. Diverse work group and opportunities to travel nationally and internationally.They do offer training in new departments. It is a very educational company for new young college students. The staff is very friendly.Company is growing rapidly and hiring many new employees. Great co-workers! Work life balance is not a priority for management.Co-workers are very helpful.  The team mindset is relatively active in most projects.  Unfortunately, transitioning to a more challenging study is very difficult.I have worked for PAREXEL for four years and have gotten good employee reviews. I have applied for over forty positions internally and have been turned down without notice or feedback. I brought it up to my manager's attention, and also HR's attention. all they had to say is keep up the good work. On the other hand people in my department with ONLY high school diploma or less than a year of relevant experience get promoted to manager or Team lead. The company mission states merit based excellence. HOWEVER, it is not merit based its who you know.Overall a daily work day was full of productivity contacting sites and retrieving, and reviewing regulatory document for IRB submission, and approval. Managing my time which allowed me to stay in top of my sites to achieve patient enrollment to clinical trial. I find being a part of an industry which support improving the quality of life for patient less fortunate is very rewarding.Over all Parexel was by far the greatest job I have had.I would have liked to have turned it in to a career, but with the company restructuring and moving to PA. there was no other option but to seek employment else where. but on a typical day our teams focus was on customer satisfaction. Ensuring all orders are picked, pack and shipped out accurately.professional  coworkers, standard process. and nice place to self development.  exposure to different theraputic areas.I started out as a temp with PAREXEL.  I was allowed to work independently and always made my deliverables in a timely manner.  Having worked with PAREXEL for over 16 years it was and is an excellent company to work with.  Although timelines were tight, the moral was great and I highly recommend this company to anyone.  Management is great.Global CRO with excellent personnel who strive to make a difference. Talented senior management. This company provided my first introduction to Oracle E-Business Suite and Hyperion applications.Excellent company to work for. Have never had any concerns to mention.

People, and culture was great and there was great teamwork.Alkermes has an exceptional work life balance and compensation but very poor leadership at the Director level. The company does not promote collaboration between groups and in fact reprimands employees who desire to learn about and meet other key stakeholders that may affect your work. The company in my experience has inadequate training programs that are job specific and expects you to perform at a high level with zero to no training or guidance regarding your Job. The business has a culture of working in silos with strict restrictions on being able to communicate with other people across the organization. Be aware that when you interview for the company the team sells the opportunity to collaborate and bring new ideas, but when you do they may come at the cost of your continued employment. The company is still developing new process and is still junior in this area.Great company in its infancy before becoming a major CNS player.  I currently promote Aristada Injection to all Institutions, CMHC's, and private practice psychiatrists in the Worcester/Western, Ma area.it is a great place to work, with great people. very fast paced and willing to help people move up into higher positions if they have the skills.A great company helping to improve peoples lives!A great culture as well!aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaI was a contract employee at Alkermes.  It was close to home and although it was NOTHING like what they described, it was a good job.  Both the staffing company and the internal management I interviewed with stated it was a lab type job, but it was really a manufacturing-general labor type job that had nothing to do with the degree I received.  Because I was a contract (temporary) employee, I received no vacation or sick days, no benefits, was not allowed to partake in the small raffles (VIP parking spot, vacation day, baskets, etc.), and did NOT receive a shift difference in my pay even though I worked 2nd (afternoon) shift.  I was recently let go because so-called internal moves; this had been planned for a week, yet I was not informed until Saturday, a weekend day we are not scheduled to work, and also informed that my locker would be cleaned out and sent to me.  My supervisor was not consulted in this matter and therefore could not even break the news to me.  Although this may be a great company to work for if you are fortunate enough to be a full time employee, the temporary employee status is definitely not one to recommend, and since 90% of their company is hired through the same staffing company on a temporary basis, I wish every contract employee there the best of luck and hope they do not get what I did not deserve.I enjoyed working at Alkermes.  I learned a lot about the Pharmaceutical Industry.  Now I understand why some medicines are so costly.Be clear about the role and responsibility during the interview processPeople are generally friendly and communicate well. Room to grow and learn inside after hire. Promotions are available with time. Great benefits and retirement plans. They really care and want people to be happy and taken care of.This company takes care of its employees and creates a good environment in which to develop your skill set and further your career.The product is great and the accounts that work within the market are very dedicated to their patients.Excellent company. Great environment, lots of room to grow and advance your career. Would work there again given the chance.Quiet office.Nice people.I was only a temp there so I am not in the position to be writing a review of the company. I enjoyed my experience there and it seems like it would be a great place to work long term.Inspected medicine powders before formulating into medicine capsules, Learning procedure for medicine production steps.Staying seated almost the whole 10 hrs.

31,Speech Scientist,Amazon,3.7,10100.0,"Amazon is a fast-paced, exciting place to work. I highly recommend anyone to apply. Management was strong and colleagues were great.there is definitely a lot of labor involved working at amazon, but i have come to appreciate the process it takes for my amazon orders to get  to me, as i am part of that processCulture and livelihood of job completely depends on the team and the manager leading that team. Fast paced and challenging work, lots of autonomy and ownership.nothing good to say about this company. management is all politics and although they say they care about their associates and their input, they do the complete opposite.I believe that if they took control of bad situations that they would be able to have a lower turn over rate. In a typical day they would make you go over the same thing over and over and it was incredibly tedious. I felt that if they put people in certain jobs and considered their abilities and put them in functions that would work better for them, they would have a better work atmosphere.Too many managers NOT aligned with the mission statement that get in each others way.  Getting feedback takes upwards of weeks.  Management turnover is standard.You'll definitely be able to make a decent amount of money, but the work is exhausting and, from my experience, managements tends to treat associates more like cattle than people.Learned that I didn't really like talking on the phone that much, I don't like being stuck in a cubical, my coworkers were amazing.really good with working with your schedule for school alot of room to grow and advance. plenty opportunity to learn different things management could be alot betterit was very fast paced. They move people around too much. About the time I got use to and doing well at a job function, I would get moved to another.Amazon was a really good company to work for the treated everyone with dignity and respect and they have great benefits.Amazon was challenging at first but the proper training and understanding of what's required of you they make it very easy for you to do your jobI learn a lot of things as a staff in amazon in how to operate and communication skill and using drive and scanner and with good quantification, is good working with the company.I didn't like it there but the money was great. They always on you about numbers . They also work you too much and disorganized .there were some good times and prizes also.Amazon is not for everyone. It is a tough, fast paced, environment. The days are 10hrs long and during the holidays there are lots of overtime opportunities. I love the fast paced atmosphere and the benefits offered. There is always opportuinity to further your career and Amazon even offers a program to help pay for an associates degree!I liked working here, the benefits were awesome. Management strived to make working conditions better and rewarding. Work was challenging but not hard. If you show up to work then you are ok. Not for the lazy thinking at all.I enjoyed working with amazon. i learnt how to deal with clients and different type of people from different background culture. The most difficult time is the day it was raining and i have to deliver package on a must condition. working under the rainThis job was interesting and if it wasn't for the physical demands of this job had I would probably still be there.You are on your feet 10 to 12 hours a day 4 to 5 days a week depending on the time of year. You pick items that customers have ordered on the Amazon website and then it is packed and shipped out.I got to drive what is called an Order picker it is a lot like a standup forklift only backwards, the forks are behind you and you put a cage on the back and fill the cage with the items that are in an order.I enjoyed my co-workers I miss them all.Management I never really saw because I was on night shift.Hardest part of the job was lifting up to 49 lb itemsMost enjoyable part the people I met and worked with.work is not hard. but constantly have to be bothered by them telling you rate even when the machines are messing up. Long 10 hours of work. no music or no motivation to keep u going. managers show favoritism and dont do their jobs at all. unorganized and never know whats going on.I worked at Amazon for a few months, as well as Integrity Staffing. For one, they are very unorganized. They provide very poor training but expect high rates with little errors. I only got trained for 5 hours on my first day and the other half of the shift I worked in the MOD. I got fired for productivity, which was due to poor training. I learned how to  perform my job better while I was on my final write up and getting retrained, however it was too late. I asked managers several times to move me so I wouldn't lose my job but nobody seemed to care. I worked there for 2 months and got fired. Managers were very rude to me as well. One manager told me if I didn't speed it up I was going to get terminated. I really didn't enjoy my time at Amazon, I feel like they didn't give me a chance.I enjoy my job with the interaction it makes the day a lot more productive because I learn and can encounter things I normally would not at other jobs.The hiring staff is very unfriendly, though business professional. The breaks are very short. Coworkers constantly trash talk the management and all of hr staff. HR is hardly ever available to answer questions and are lazy.","10,000+",Boston,Cambridge,MA,2016-11-29T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/speech-scientist-job-cambridge-ma-us-176844136.aspx?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
32,Biostatistician,Justice Resource Institute,3.7,40.0,"This company does a lot of good for many people.  As a non profit company there are not many pay raises but the benefits are decent.  My coworkers are dedicated to helping the youth.  Management at the program level are considerate of their employees.Co-workers are great and the individuals cared for. Management expects way too much for the money they pay with little or no incentives to stay working hard and not much room for advancement. Pay raises are not guaranteed unless company profits and everyone gets one. They keep pushing more and more responsibility unless you stick up for yourself.great kids, great staff, good hours, good place, good money, wonderful management, friendly people and atmosphere, only reason i left was to stay home w kids otherwise i would still be thereI like working there been there for a while. They only thing is they don't pay enough money that's all. They really help they kids and want the best fro them. A typical day at work is a restraint if they kids don't act up. I've learn many things from working in these field, i believe people can over come anything and change and function normal. I like some and some like me, I don't like when people are doing the kids wrong so i don't like some people because of that. The hardest part is restraint. The most enjoyable tings are is the outing and when the kids are happy.Management isn't that great. The residents have more voice then you do. If you don't have seniority and you have an issue you will be heard but, they take it like a grain of salt. The benefits are great. The pay could be a little better for what the job entails.The supervision at this company sucks.  They are unethical in their practices.  Require workers to drive almost 2,000 miles a month for client care.  They force overtime but refuse to pay for it.  They expect one person to do the work of five different people.  The morale around the office is that everyone wants a new job.  I would strongly suggest not working here.I fully enjoy working with JRI, their leadership is incredible. I've learned many new skills over my decade working in the agency.I love the environment in which I work, I love the people I work for. I enjoy that changes are being made for the better within the program. The pay is not great, but that of any human service worker is not.JRI is an ok place to work, have very good benefits. The workers have a very good sense of unity. I like the fact that I'm busy all the time, if you are not afraid to work hard then, it's perfect. Flexible hours.There is no room to expand or grow within the agencies. Salary increase is non existent.The average lifespan of a JRI employee, to my knowledge, is 2 years... and this is why.  It's a job where people come to get entry level experience, may move up, but only meekly because the options are few and far between, and the ceiling is pretty low.  There are no incentives to stay.  Vacation time does accrue quickly but it maxes out at 4 weeks.  No performance reviews, no contact with management to give feedback or voice concerns, no raises based on merit or length of employment, no maternity benefits (other than those legally mandated), and the expectations are high.  Work holidays, nights, and weekends.  Be available by phone always.  If it takes over 40 hours you are expected to do it- with no compensation.  The clientele is great, most of the colleagues are too.  There are some pretty excellent training opportunities but JRI won't ask if you want them, you have to seek them out and then ask for funding.  The overhead is so much and the 8-10 VP's of JRI get paid BIG BUCKS, but where are they???Working for Justice Resource Institute has been great in the sense that it feels like coming home. It's a great supportive environment.The peer support is great and fun, energetic group of mixed age people . We share our ups and downs and collaborate to find solutions to pressing matter as a team....that's the most enjoyable part of the job. The down side of the job is lack of advancement. within the company.Worked at one of the residential schools (live and attend school on site) with adolescent females. There is room to advance, camaraderie amongst direct care staff, immense training and education given weekly, and the chance to work in both the residential and educational capacity.The pay was too low for the amount of responsibilities. They did have rather good benefits.  It was hard to move around and move up.Great team of individuals both co-workers and management. Very caring and dedicated to it's clients and staff.Lots of support.Company cared about it employees. Offered many incentives as well to make people want to work there. HR is great and management is the best ive seen in a while.I was hired as part of a management team who were tasked to develop three new group homes and behavioral programs, policies and procedures for the rehabilitation of adolescents with a variety of behavioral, cognitive, and psychological disorders.  A month into the job the funding that had been projected as forthcoming from DDS fell through.  Consequently, so did the planned management and staffing structures.  I elected to move from group home management to the position of clinical case manager so that the Assistant Group Home manager whom we had already hired was promoted to Group Home Manager without a raise in pay, but did not suffer a pay cut.  Once opened, a typical work day saw me traveling to one of the three group homes where I provided individual, family and group therapy.  My work day included case management, ensuring that all providers to include DDS and DCF were on the same page with progress and delivery of services.   I worked closely with direct care staff to ensure best practices toward building therapeutic alliances with the residents.  The most difficult part of the job was the extended travel.  The group homes were located between Chesterfield (Norwich area) and Thompson.  Often I would be called on to be at Thompson for staff training and then travel to two or more group homes for unexpected meetings mostly having to do with one of the children requiring crisis intervention.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being part of a like-minded team who practiced a gentle and consistent approach to behavioral change, and who refrained from shaming, blaming  more... or judging in order to manipulate behavioral compliance.  lessA nurturing atmosphere with a supportive administration. If you are positive and a hard worker looking to support families, then this is the place to be.I enjoyed working at JRI. They have a wonderful benefit package.The hardest part of the job was having a supervisor that was unavailable. The staff that I worked with became like family. Amazing group of men and women.The individuals that we worked with, helped create that bond.This was an entry level position as a Residential Counselor. I soon became a Supervisor. I have found this to have been the best Company that I have ever worked for. I would not hesitate to take a part time position with them anytime. Great Administrative Residential DirectorGood team work. Learned from supervisor and other coworkers through wonderful communication skills and trainings. Great support systems set in place and a community you can trust. Flexible work schedule.Good place to work, Hardest part of the job was the always schedule and transport. I moved up to management fast. Co workers are ok, I learned a lot about human services and developmental disabilities. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the clients everyday and knowing that I helped them get a job.",NA,Boston,Needham,MA,2016-11-11T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/biostatistician-job-needham-ma-us-173855302.aspx?mescoid=1500153001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
33,Senior Purification Scientist,Danaher,3.7,101.0,"Work there was like anywhere else,you do your job everything goes fine.I worked in many areas in plant, we made craftsman tools and packed them to be shipped to sears and other places.Their was a lot of good people working there and miss seeing them every day.The hardest part of the day was when four or five trucks came in at same time to be loaded, it was like none stop and some times overtime.Many opportunities to learn, but very few opportunities to advance.  Work/Life balance non-existent.  Feel like you are an infidel if you need to work at home, call out sick, apply for FMLA or handle personal family matters.  Currently, there are NO managers as all have left for other, more lucrative and appreciative opportunities.Executive leadership does not follow through on engaging employees or developing them for growth.  There is a whole division of employees who are heavily engaged in helping the business leaders implement company strategy, but are completely ignored and continuously unrecognized.I enjoyed my time at Danaher Motion, I held a number of positions there, as I worked there for 30+ years. The management created a lean work atmosphere, that challenged us as a team. The hardest part of the job was to make our daily rates. We all pitched in as a team to make our rates, and our work experience enjoyable.Trains its leadership on ""Danaher Business System"" principles. Leaders are then expected to drive rigor, build talent that promotes the DBS culture. The result is every employee thinks and solves problems like a scientist. Status quo is constantly questioned and business model continuously strengthened.Daily working with customers world wide through emails and some phone calls.Learned more about end of life management. Management changed during my time here. Too many changes all at once made things very difficult. No change over time to accommodate changes. Retired too many people all at once with a huge loss in contacts and information.Co-workers for the most part was easy to work with most of the time.No collaboration with other areas to stream line processes.Working with data collection and system conversions.Good company to work for. Very busy!!Customer care has expanded many roles and back up many other divisons in the company.A typical day is answering the phine to customers calling for repairs, returns, or want to place an order.Data entry for orders, returns, repairs, etc. Creating UPS labels for returns, Entering credits.My coworkers were always friendly and helpful, as was the management team.The hardest part of my job was the stress of a complaining customer. The most enjoyable part was being on the morale team and planning team building events for the staff.I liked working for Danaher.The Danaher company that I worked at was wonderful, pre-Danaher. When Danaher takes over, although tough, the business improvements are definitely good for the business. The people, however, suffer. There is complete lack of concern for long-term employees; people who have no other skill than what they have been doing for 30-40 years. They do not want old people or old ""tainted"" culture. If you are young and ready to climb a ladder, this is the place for you. Otherwise, steer clear.no sure how things are nowadays but compensation was good, work balance was good, plant director ok, good place to learn lean tools.I have worked with Danaher for over 2 years now and have been promoted to 3 positions within a 6 month span. I went from machine operator, to Cybron Production and Scaling, to Quality Assurace Technician. Paying attention to detail and the need to learn more than my assigned postion, I am able to advance in my knowledge and understand how the departments work together to produce the desired outcome of parts and assembly. I enjoy leaning how to make new molds, how to adjust them, and gaining knowledge of what is part does for each customer we produce for. The engineers work closly with me to teach me details of their work, so I may improve constantly on my job in quality. I work closely with management in my daily work schedule where I feel free to make suggestions or offer advice to make operations more organized or improved as well as follow instructions given to me, I work overtime and in the place of those that may need to miss a day.I work weekends when needed and other shifts when needed.management your co-workers,working with good and nice people,the hardest part of the day was trying to work with some people that didnt wont to do their job.Working at Danaher is very frustrating since Priorities are swapped like underwear.I learned so far that even the most skillfull people can be disabled by mismanagement.Hight pressure company that works you 7 days a week 14 hours a day.   Set unrealistic expectations.   The initial interview are all smoke and mirrors, and change on you after you start.They also gave me insights on the job Description also. Good place to work.I enjoyed working there.Good Benefit's.work sometimes, 7  Days.Great! Very professional staff.  Team work environment. client focused. Exemplary Client Service and satisfaction integral and non negotiable. Wonderful place to work.Danaher has the worst management ever. The management focus more on friendship than business. Favoritism is out of this world. There is definitely no trust with the management team. We cannot even go to our human resource for help. The rules are not for everyone. Certain individuals are definitely excluded. The pay is horrible meaning an individual that has been there for 40 years is making the same thing as individuals that have been there for 3 to 5 years performing the same task. The raises are definitely unfair. How can your grade be the same every year even though you exceeded in mostly everything that was expected, but still receive the same raise year after year? You cannot advance in this place. It is according on who you are. It should be based off of skill, education, and performance, as well as some other qualifications, but race should not be one. Hate to sound cliché, but race is definitely a factor. You do not have to take my word, just visit the facility and do a walk through up front in the office area and decide for yourself.This job was challenging and i love a good challenge. I found this job very rewarding. The 200 people that reported to me were an absolute pleasure to work with. Together we built a great team and became the top in this facility.My internship at this location was excellent. The work I was exposed to contained more responsibility and value than any other company I had worked for previously. The work culture was great as well as the work environment.GOOD: This is a great company to learn and develop in.  They challenge you daily but allow you to accomplish things that you never thought possible.  The people are amazing to work and the teamwork is amazing, even with conflicting metrics.BAD: They will take everything that you will give which can cause a challenge personally to have a healthy work/life balance.  They need to focus more on development conversations and actions instead of daily objectives.It was a good place to work and a good company to be involved with the company is associated with Sears and machining making tools.While working at Danaher (Beckman Coulter) I grew as a professional as well as person.   My experience at this work place were knowledgeable, and insightful.   It accommodated my needs at the time of hire to be able to continue with the family needs that I acquired at that time in my life.  The opportunities to grow in my field of employment were always available and I was able to take advantage of the challenges offered where I performed at 100% of my ability.  The relationships developed with my co-workers were true and loyal and we learned to work as a team were each of our work reflected the balance of an excellent working environment.  I always felt as if it was my second home.   The only reason I left was because my family moved to Maryland and I didn't want to continue being alone in Florida.High customer service demand. Most work was done individually without much team work. Required a lot of push demands instead of being able to be proactive. Requires more communication between departments internally. Customer service is required for internal just as much as an external customer. Getting to personally talk with my regular customers in other service centers. Emails and instant messaging doesn't always work for explaining issues.","10,000+",Boston,Framingham,MA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/senior-purification-scientist-job-framingham-ma-us-176770844.aspx?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I learned something new every day and had a strong sense of purpose.•	Performed ELISA technique by using plates coated with contaminant proteins in toxoid preparation in order to indicate if the antibodies to contaminants were responsible for the discrepancy •	Maintained impeccable standards in chemical inventories, safely disposing of waste and accurately calibrating laboratory equipmentDuring my time with Yoh services I was able to learn the proper procedures and methods of a pc deployment project and I was also able to learn basic pc troubleshooting skills.Extensive Corporate Organizational Transition Process to provide an accurate response. The Management Team was also undergoing a major transition process which filtered to the new employees. The communication from the Executive Team to the team members was lacking and much to be desired.I was a Recruiter at Yoh for a little over 3 years.  During my tenure the company had difficulties paying contractors on time, answering contractor questions, or generally running back office operations.  There is little advancement opportunities.  It is nearly impossible to make the Incentive Trip for producers.  Yoh is unable to recruit good talent and after 3 years I know why.they have allowed me to work with benefits. It's nice to have an Human resources, information technology, payroll and all other administrative type of people/representatives available and with separate and individually listed easy to find phone nos.this job was exactly what I was hoping it was going to be, I loved this job. we were working on prototypes and conducting experimentsA typical contract company, poor management, lack of integrity, long work hours, and no raises for one whole year or Per Diem when other contract companies were providing it.They supply good income and a steady employment. If you have an issue they will help you. They also provide good benefits such as medical benefits.Good place to work. Management responds to contact with the employee. Diverse employment market. Easy to communicate with. I liked working for them.YOH is the only contract company that has ever allowed job security including benefits and vacation time.  I would highly recommend.This temporary opportunity came at a good time. It was an absolutely wonderful job which I enjoyed. There were no benefits due to the temporary nature but otherwise, I would highly recommend this company to anyone looking for a high quality job.The HR department constantly requested and then finally SENT my Social Security Number in plain text over the internet.I cannot imagine a company not knowing better then this. Have they never even seen a TV commercial?Just imagine, people from this company setting up computers for clients?As a contracting company, Yoh made the process simple and easy to navigate. The on-boarding process was flawless, and their management staff was pleasant to work with.Staffing recruiters are professional and helpful, responding via email to questions and concerns in good time. Allows for the option of a flexible work schedule.Good pay. Does not offer health insurance. Don't get aid time off until you have been there 1 year. They do offer a pretty good 401",NA,Boston,Cambridge,MA,2016-11-29T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/associate-scientist-protein-analytics-job-job-cambridge-ma-us-176810932.aspx?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

47,Senior Data Scientist,NVIDIA Corporation,4.2,100.0,"People are friendly.  Really organized.  I learned a lot about the systems and how everything worked at the site.  Management was great.  The only thing I really did not like was the fact that growth opportunities took a while.  I have a lot of experience in security but needed to be patient in order to grow in the company.Every GPU cycle presents new challenges, features and work. Nvidia constantly pushes the envelopes in all aspects and leads the industry with new technologies.Most of the time, I am working with multiple teams to bring new chips and features to market. I am constantly learning and am supported by capable leaders and peers.Constantly working on new features and different teams across the world means I'm working around the clock. Work/life balance is reasonable but at times can be quite challenging over long periods of time. Management has good vision and direction. CEO is always thinking years in advance and pivots the company when beneficial to the future. Nvidia is constantly pushing gross margins which can be felt at the engineering level. Intent is good but can be overly restrictive at times (e.g.: lab equipment, computer purchases, etc).Working is not clearly directed. Direction is being changed every moment. Management has no enough experience to work on the system product and handing the people who from various cultures previously.Great co-workers, fun, challenging innovative products.  Upper management tends to have unrealistic schedule expectations that leads to long hours, stress and low morale.Nvidia is one of the best company. I learned lot from my team. People are very cooperative. Sometimes, work load was not manageable but over all I rate 5 out of 5.As with many big corporations, there's a big game being played on employees..here it was primarily using West Valley Staffing, the in house staffing agency to lure people in with potential jobs at a growing co/dept but in fact, the department has NO requisition/authority to make this contractor a permanent employee, and NO incentive to, because WV pays below market, with almost no benefits, no sick time, no holiday pay unless you've been there 6 mos, etc. Good luck going through years of being underpaid, below market, for the ""hopes"" of becoming a permanent employee.  (stories of people being contractors for 2-5 years abound)And the other game is people working cross functionally, with reporting/performance/pay managed by one manager, but actual work and projects with multiple managers who don't communicate, so no one really knows everything you're being asked to do, or should be paid to do.One thing to remember before starting a job at NVIDIA that is, you are responsible for your work. Super Cool people and super smart minds. Your every word has weight. So when you say something to management or peers you better get it done because your word stands for your commitment. You will get all the help you need but you gotta ask for it. Nobody is going to do spoon feeding for you. The best part about it is you will learn a lot in the process and you feel confident. That's my best take away from NVIDIA.Nvidia was a great company to work with. Employees are smart and creative thinker. Company takes care of its employees.You would learn a lot of new technologies here.CEO gives great talk and knows what he is doing and what he wants the company to be doing. However, you can be in a group with management that gives no direction or nothing specific at all, which can make it confusing on what you should be doing. One time, the VP set up a meeting to have us suggest ideas of improvement for a software tool. However, he didn't specified the purpose of that meeting beforehand, and thus, nobody prepared the appropriate material for the meeting discussion. At the end, we had to reschedule the meeting, which made the first meeting a waste of time in my opinion.Management is off hand which provides personal growth There is a lot of room for creativity. Work here to work in a environment that promotes growth.This company has no regard for you or your family.  As long as you perform you will be OK...but if you are not a culture fit.  Good bye.    It is micromanaged by a megalomanic.  And frankly there is not much upside in their product line.  Intel will eventually eat their lunch.The company is run by  business savvy engineers which is quite rare for a company of this size.  The primary focus in the mobile products is always on delivery of a quality product.The CEO has demonstrated the ability to make strategic investments without bending to shareholder fickleness.  Sometimes these investments work out, other times they do not.  This is extremely important for companies long term health.The company focuses hiring on top talent across the industry.  This results in a diverse workforce that may be overwhelmed but is generally quite technically competent.Was very informative to learn about how conferences work from outside in. Worked from checkin to after party and concluded with take down of the event. Was a great learning experience working along side the Events team at Nvidia.This was a volunteer experience in which I setup monitors, booths, posters, and tables for the GTC conference. In addition I help setup lan cables in each room to provide everyone with a connection to the internet. This is one of the most memorable and enjoyable volunteer work I have ever done. Talking to the executives during the conference and learning about IT and how important it is before a day of a big event opens my eyes about the men and women of the IT industry.it is good company and really friendly environment to work with. My daily responsibilities are debugging, troubleshoot and fixing all the RMA devices. Sometime i have to work with software engineer in flashing and making sure the devices have a good and functioning image. I have enjoy and love to work for this company.Nvidia is a great place to work, but it's lacking when it comes to having a conducive environment for younger or start-upy kinds of employees. It's a very classic style of doing business, and many of the middle people (who've been there for less than 10 years) will tell you that you could do worse in many places, but you could also easily do a lot better.Management is pretty hands off, certain ones will micromanage, but in general the structure of power is accessible from the lower rungs. The hardest part of my position was being one of the very few people who represented the target market/audience, and so many of the people making these products wouldn't ever consume them, and that dissonance was aggravating to be around.fair place to work, the culture is not so good in my team, but some team is better, pretty much depend on the style of the managerhighly talented peoplegood managementgood base packageco-workers support is very goodgood work-life balanceCompany always tries to come up with good products and has courage to enter new markets.I like working at NVIDIA for the culture and the friendly people.  Unfortunately, the work I'm doing is not very fulfilling for me, and there are no opportunities for what I want to be doing at the location that I'm at.Compensation is at or above market.  The company provides competitive benefits, except for the 401K, which is not comparable to other large companies.  Compelling technologies and products.Bad: Little or no organization, very little processes, micromanaging management, managers who were great individual contributors but horrible people managers. Too political an environment.Good pay, decent work life balance.",NA,Palo-Alto,Santa Clara,CA,2016-11-10T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/senior-data-scientist-job-santa-clara-ca-us-175759969.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
48,"Data Scientist, Internet Services Team",Apple Inc.,4.3,2700.0,"As a specialist, your duty is to help customers. Whether that is purchasing Apple merchandise or helping them trouble shoot. I learned more about communicating with customers. How to figure out more than one solution to one problem and to always keep the customers interests ahead of mine. Hardest part of my job was dealing with tasks that I was in no way required to do. Some customers would come in with issues that you had to resolve despite it not being an Apple app problem or software malfunction. But keeping Apple loyalty among customers is very important, so it had to be done. Enjoyable part of my job was helping people. As well as interacting with customers. I was able to learn new tasks and solutions every day. My coworkers were more than willing to lend a hand if needed and were so diverse in their education, backgrounds and fields of expertise that they had so much to offer myself as well the customers.Apple is a great company for bringing people together. We were a team of 300, and for the most part we were all into having big group events and hanging out together after work. Coming to work was a positive experience every day, and you learn a little bit about your job every day. Even at 2 years in the same job position, things change constantly and I am never bored. Pay could be better, and I wish that promotions were more frequent. Apple brings in new people constantly, and sometimes a transfer will come in.I had two internships at Apple, and the support from my manager and co-workers was outstanding. I learned something new each day and was able to have control of my own project and implement my own engineering design decisions to make a great impact. The compensation and benefits were generous, and the job occasionally required longer work hours.Overall, working for the Apple Store is an amazing opportunity. Their entry level pay is higher than most places, and you get plenty of benefits, even if you're part time. You just need to be willing to handle an extremely fast paced environment with a constant flow of customer traffic. Your skills with customer focus, product knowledge, and learning on the fly play a huge part in being a specialist for Apple.Most of the coworkers are friendly and willing to help, but unfortunately, the management uses personal favoritism in order to determine who gets to grow within the company.One of the best places I was able to be myself and strive at what I do best. With the addition of being able to help both co-workers in their training and development in growth and customers with any need.Being a Home Advisor for apple gives you the ability to work in the comfort of your own home office, while being able to work very closley with others within your team and departmentWonderful place to work.  I would have stayed longer but moved.  I became apple certified in a lot of different areas.  I love to be challenged and I'm very good worker.great place to work. However if you are considering advancing in the retail work it's a lot of politics with management.This is a great place to work! The team culture is awesome and great and the benefits are off the chart! The option to work from home and the company advancement are great!I always loved walking into work because I knew I was there to do something that mattered. Apple taught me new ways to look at the relationship between a customer and a product. The ways in which I learned to communicate with people and act as a professional are lessons I will not soon forget. The benefits for working at a company like Apple are hard to find anywhere else. From the Employee Stock purchase program to the ability to access some of the best software on the market for little to no charge, Apple takes care of their employees.Working for Apple was one of my best job experiences. The only downside was that once I was determined to be a ""rock star"" in sales, it was almost impossible for me to move into a different position within the store. I was only able to recieve my technician liscense after having surgery, and not being able to be on the sales floor, which allowed me time to study and pass the test. Even then, I was only allowed behind the genuis bar when they were shorthanded.Advancement is difficult but if you are persistent you can excel. There is a great discount for employee's and it's a super fun place to work! Very friendly staff and the management is extremely receptive to feedback as long as you are. Keep in mind though, you are getting paid to smile.good food at cafe and great co workers that led to a fun work environment.  great monthly beer activities lot of free beer, free beer. and lots of free beerI worked at Apple, Inc. for more than five years, in California, Oregon and Idaho as a Business Expert and Business Mentor.

If there a problem I mark it down on the system to forward it to my manager.Each and every day you will meet amazing customers from all over the world who have one thing in common... The love for Apple. Not only will the customers and the busy atmosphere make your day go buy in a jiffy, but the hundreds of employees you work with day in and day outWorking for Apple is great, they open doors to endless possibilities, have great benefits and perks and are just overall a whole different environment then you are used to.They are always changing the goal you need to meet. but overall it's ok. I loooovvvveeeee my manager but the HR is not as greatApple provides paid training and it is really good training they do not just shove you though and put you out to get eaten alive.

62,Statistician,Robert Bosch LLC,4.1,1300.0,"Review prints find parts to build the machine. if needed I will make the parts. quote jobs talk with customers about there project and if satisfied over build. sometimes customers wants more than what was quoted at the start of the job.Bosch is a non-profit organization, which means it's not publically traded and there are no share holders. It's a very diverse company, as well as the largest automotive supplier in the world.Bosch treats its employees well and there are many opportunities, especially for those with 4yr degrees.My position required leadership skills to direct the work force towards company goals. This included on time deliveries, customer interaction, and diplomacy. Other responsibilities included training of workers, both salary and hourly, and safety. It was a pleasure to work with, on the most part, professional people in their fields of expertise. This created a high expectation that the team would achieve daily and long range goals. I earned the respect from all levels of management.Worked for the company for nearly 20 years.  They use to walk the talk of the culture and importance of community.  They used to treat their employees like valuable team members.  Now, it has turned into a burn them and churn them, no matter how much a person has contributed to the success of the organization.Management changes every few years and the culture changes to reflect the beliefs and management practices of the current establishment.Typical day is mostly desk environment but it greatly depends on the product line one works in.   Being a large company many responsibilities are compartmentalized, however a position where interaction with multiple disciplines was most rewarding because it allows you to become a generalist.  At the same time, you could also become an expert in a specific component, so it's easy to find that this company provides opportunities across the board to fit the breadth of knowledge you're hoping to gain in a product/system.So far it is a great environment to work. You get well trained before being left on your own. There is opportunity to grow and advance if hired on permanently. The fact that you have to start as a temp instead of direct hire is kind of a negative due to the pay as a temp. You cannot live on $11/hr.  But if hired perm, the pay is well above average.1. Bosch expect you to grow automatically, the training/follow-up feed back is severely insufficient.2. Bosch encourage you to work over time: it is not on the rule, but the task assigned to you definitely make you work over 50, even 60 hours per week, on an average Engineer;  3. Highly bureaucratic management.4. Lack humanistic care: my colleague's wife is during pregnancy at her 9th month, the company still assign him to German for 8 weeks! He miss the most important moment in his life! Similar things happened very often.5. HR is not nice to you, especially if you are a not US citizen: your green-card sponsorship, H-1 B are reluctant approve with delay.Relatively good compensation; Good to be a manager in BoschWonderful experience while working for Bosch in Broadview, Illinois.  Excellent Leadership and ample opportunity for career movement.  Technical and operations training is world class.  The benefits at Bosch AANA, are great especially when compared to what other companies are currently offering.  The only reason I left is Bosch moved their distribution to Atlanta Georgia.I didn't quite like the environment. We have a certain time to get a lunch break or a mini break by the time we eat lunch you're almost late to complete your shift. The warehouse is extremely huge and you have to almost run to get to the front of the warehouse. But then there is that one thing that you cannot do and that is run.I have learned a lot from this position regarding strategic planning of the product line, communication with different management levels inside and outside of organization and also i have learned that i am not a 100% office person. I like to travel outside the office, meat people and get challenged by their needs.* Fast paced and results driven environment* I Learned that you will never achieve true confidence or success without stepping out of your comfort zone.* I Worked with some of the most talented managers with strong engineering back rounds that were committed to success. They were always approachable and willing to share their knowledge.* My co-workers and I worked as one. We worked as a team and addressed problems in the same manner.* The hardest part of the job was learning how to get all supportive groups of inter-connected processes to work together and consistently live up to their end of the task.* The most enjoyable part of the job was making commitments to our customer and being able to deliver on those commitments.Operated and tested parts for customer satisfaction. If parts were unsatisfactory they were disassembled and reassembled to be allowed to leave the plant. The most enjoyable part of the job were the individuals I worked with. The hardest part was working and going to school full time.Very productive. I learned  the difference parts of the fuel injectors. Also there are different types of injection. Working for Bosch has been and experience for me because I have learned so many things about the fuel injections.Well structured company to work for. Great benefits. Great pay and fun people to work with. Management was awesome. Was respective very well. Made a lot of friends.Bosch is a great company.  They strive to be the best at manufacturing products for the automotive industry.  I leave work every day knowing that I contributed to the high standards that are in place.( A typical day at work ) my crew and I reaching our daily quota          ( what I learn )  troubleshoot , calibrating , testing , rework                  ( management ) respectful and supportive ( co-workers ) , respectful and willing to lend a hand ,( hardest part of the job )  when machines would malfunction , ( most enjoyable part of job )  leading my guys helping and teaching as much as possibleA typical day at work for me was extremely rewarding. This was a 7 day operation that required a lot of team work. What I learned from here was my knowledge of heat treat and the importance of team work. The management staff that I worked with was top notch. Most of my coworkers were also top notch. The was really nothing hard about this job but hearing the news we were closing. The great working relationships that you build!!Don't recommend, they don't care about the employees only the profits and quantity of parts put out, long hours 7 day work week,lots of employee turnoverI needed more to do. They were trying to force me into another department in which I was uncomfortable with, because it required a lot of computer work.

Great benefits. A typical day at work is mainly answering calls and helping customers with their accounts, taking payments, verifying charges, opening disputes.It is a senior design. Our goal is to build a security system in order to let the users using their finger print to open the cabinet.And I am responsible for coding the program for hardware like Wi-Fi, camera and physical locker. I connected the hardware with Raspberry PI that is a series of credit card-sized single-board computers by using python library.This is a happy, clean and environment. Ongoing training, open door policy, great benefits, Lean something new each day. I love this job, this company and where I worked.I love working at Synchrony. From management to coworkers to VP of Operations everyone is amazing. I worked in the Phoenix location.Fun, cool and laid back environment as long as you do your work. Callers can be ignoring and a hand full just keep your calm and meet the metrics. Call out policy and days off are ok. Each department get different holidyas off.all ready wrote review. i said it was a great company highly favored by most people who work here very uplifting enviorment really cares about employeesI will take escalated calls and help consumers with their financial issues.  Also, help debt collectors with procedures and training.  It is a great place to work with multi opportunities to move forward.Its a good place to get your foot in the door. they promote within and provide amazing benefits. Depending on the department they can be flexible.  The pay should be higher  is one of the only issues.I was working as a contractor in synchrony financial. I have found this workplace good for the employees and contractors also.A typical day of work will start with meetings. During my tenure i learned a lot from my projects. The hardest part of the job i will say meeting the timelines.Lack of communication, managers are very secretive and misleading. No one knows what is going on, lack of priorities. Overall terrible experience.Synchrony Financial is more than just a call center. It is a place where one can start a career. I love  that everyone all the way up the the CEO was once a call center representative. This company hires within which is amazing. If you are wanting to do more they provide you with the opportunities and encouragement to do so.Synchrony Financial is a great company to work for, it is a friendly environment and great working conditions.  The company is always helping out in the community making it great for volunteer work as well.Good place to work if exempt. However, advancement chances are slim unless you're well connected with the site leader. Good office atmosphere and friendly coworkers are a plus!Work work work work and meet your numbers if not you will be wrote up. It used to have great benefits but since it changed hands they are slowly taking away benefits.Lousy place to work. A lot of code learning in a short amount of time spread over multiple platforms in comparison to embarrassing low pay. Absolutely ridiculous!!! Older people or those with disabilities treated badly!Its been about an year since I started working for Synchrony Financial. I feel myself lucky for getting an opportunity to work in this  company.From the top down everyone loves their job there and it trickles down to the bottom and really makes a difference to work in a place like that.  More companies need to adopt their culture.  Being a part time work at home rep we still feel included in every way.If you can get in with Synchrony, there is plenty of room for advancement. It is a challenging environment, but you don't feel overworked. Great benefits and wonderful culture.Discovery Place is an amazing place to work there's so much to learn and see from animals, to rainforest, and science explosions. This place is so ideal for children who love science.Excellent benefits and rate of pay.Plenty of vacation and personal/sick days.Management excels at communicating with staffExcellent training program and changes are communicated effectively",NA,Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-11-19T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/avp-credit-innovation-data-scientist-l11-job-chicago-il-us-174578142.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

We had many long term employees and we all worked well together.After working in a larger corporate environment, working at Toshiba was difficult due to the minimum amount of resources available. They try to do more with less but it's hard to compete with the big boys that way.During my 31 years in Toshiba was a exciting work every day as well as challenge where we have to use all company resources to solve problems. Also, trainings in different aspect were provided for the company in order to have a excellent team work.Start-up seems to be going well and making right decisions concerning system upgrades (transitions and changes from prior company ownership).  Focus on improving bottom-line and consolidations to achieve that is occurring.People are friendly and good to work with, and environment is pleasant.

It is fun and nice to work there. You will learn a lot from 9:00 to 6:00. You will have company party every month.Worked for 35 years must have been a good place to work.  I enjoyed every day.

Job was not hard, I enjoy are part of this job.Having worked at Toshiba an excess of twenty-four years, I can still say in all honesty it is the best job I've ever had! I find it great to be on the forefront of technology, working for an OEM manufacturer. A typical day involves a variety projects, so you never get bored. Co-workers may need a bit of nudging to meet a deadline, but then everyone has their own schedule.

85,Geospatial Data Scientist,Allstate Insurance,3.9,2900.0,"See above, work load always very heavy, employees stress levels extremely high. 2 people actually walked out after I was laid off. The hardest part of our day was prioritizing as everything was equally important.During my time at allstate I was able to perform in numerous areas such as personal lines adjuster, bodily injury claims, auto theft claims, auto appraiser, auto management and property appraiser. The company trained me in all aspects including creating an outstanding customer experience. Management provided the necessary tools and skill set I needed to perform my daily job. Allstate is extremely customer focused but at the same time, very employee focused. Allstate does a good job ensuring employees are given every opportunity to succeed. Differing opinions are encouraged. New ideas are solicited and open communication is welcomed. I enjoyed my time at allstate.Allstate was the best i have experienced in terms of a company actually caring about their employees. Although they couldn't satisfy everyone, they tried! I give them an applause for their efforts in trying to focus on work and life balance for their employees. Still it is a job or career path, and they have to do some things in the eyes of corporate as a business,which can at times feel a little too scripted and repetitive. Overall if you are looking for a reliable and respectable good paying job and for a company who treats their employees well, then this may be a good fit for some of you out there. Most of all, i will miss the awesome potlucks and free prize giveaways there.Overall, a good place to work. The last couple of years have been fraught with uncertainty. There is a definite push to outsource job functions. For an entry level position good place to start. You receive  pretty training. There are opportunities for advancement if you work hard and use the talent development tools available. The hardest part of this job was having to say goodbye to people that you've worked with for many years due to restructuring and outsourcing. What I learned is that you can accomplish anything you set your mind to if you use tools available such as networking and ensuring your manager knows what you want to achieve.Overall, Allstate is a great company at which to work. They provide a great compensation package. Allstate is a large company, with over 30,000 employees. Any company of that size, of course, has areas of opportunity, but Allstate does not run from them. They are constantly pursuing improvement. I plan to be with Allstate until I retire. They are an extremely ethical company, and they work to always be customer focused. I do feel appreciated at work, and I am consistently pushed and coached to always do the right thing for the customer.Responsible for performing clerical and administrative duties in an office setting. Assisted executive assistants and secretaries by sorting mail, filing, answering phones, greeting clients, This job allowed me to build a rapport with customers. The management and my co-workers were very encouraging and supportive of my ambitions both inside and out of work. I handled correspondence, preparing reports, maintaining office files and inventory. They are also responsible for limited bookkeeping activities, taking messages and preparing outgoing emails.Working for this company expect to be burnt out and overworked. The company only cares about productive and numbers. Only promote if they like you. If you have any college background please......stay far away from this company. The individuals that are in mgmt doesn't have any college education however are responsible for your future. If you want to work for insurance please go to Progressive or AAA...where they actually pay you a decent rate. Oh yeah you will have no personal life once you work here. Your coworkers will throw you under the bus to make themselves look better for mgmt.A typical day of work for me is driving 48 miles to work arriving 2 hours before opening to get a head start on the day.  Focus on meeting company sales goals while training new sales staff as well as holding tenured staff accountable.  Over the years I have learned how to manage multiple books of business as well as interview/hirer new staff, implement onboarding processes, train on policies/procedures for sales.I'm one of 4 individuals that runs the organization.  My title is Director of sales.The hardest part of the job is realizing that I have not further opportunity to grow or attain equity in the company after investing 10 years while helping grow the overall book of business by 45 million. The most enjoyable part of the job has been gaining wisdom of managing several small businesses while increasing my overall sales/management skills.The way this company and their offices operates the workplace is great.  The positions here allow employees to keep work in the office and not take it with us when off the clock.  It is very flexible there as far as requesting days off, days switches, vacations, etc.  The position I work in, though, is very intense--it is not an easy job; however, the compensation is what makes me continue to work as hard I have been, and strive for even better.  The job and company overall is definitely customer service driven and focused.  Having to investigate liability from a car accident, and delivering the not so good news when someone is found responsible for a loss is one of the most challenging part of this job.  Also, if you are not organized and fail to properly time manage, you will have a very hard time succeeding in this position.Thought it was a great place to work my first 6mos....but they want you to work for peanuts compared to the other insurance companies. They push more and more and more work on you and if lucky you'll get a 2-4% raise (maybe). Management changed too much for my liking and all they care about are the numbers not the employees (don't be fooled). You're sold a bunch of wooden nickels at this company, a lot of pipe dreams.... To many meetings and not enough development of employees.....I could go on and on ....only gave two stars because a few of the co workers were greatIt is a very stressful job. I have learned a lot of skills and you are critiqued on every thing you do. I have learned about production type work, developed a keen eye to search out problems. The hardest part of my day is all day, every piece of work that you touch could have the potential of being placed under scrutiny and you get dinged on minute issues. The most enjoyable part of my job was PTO and office recognition times which were far and few between.A typical day is busy handling calls and new files.  I learned all aspects of the auto insurance business.  Management is traditional and conservative.  The co-workers were the best part of the job.  The most difficult part of the job were technical issues.  There were many which delayed and frustrated employees and clients alike.  The benefits are still fairly good but diminishing yearly.I come into work and log in to my computer. First thing I do is check my email and process any service work that may need to be done. After that, I make about 200 calls throughout the day to sell insurance. I manage the staff and help them close policies and process service work for their clients as well. My co workers are great. I trained my current employer and have a great working business relationship with him and the other two guys that I work with. The hardest part of my job is trying to keep the clients at renewal.Allstate is a great place to start your career because of the flexibility of working in a smaller capacity agent. Much more room for you to go at your own pace. Good products but limited lines of business. Management can be fickle depending on the office you're in. Overall it's a good employer with a strong brand.Typical day at work is you go and sit at your desk and take anywhere from 40 - 90 calls a day assisting customers and local agents with information and changes on policies. I learned a lot of information about insurance and how the whole business is ran and how insurance works. I learned what not to do as a leader. I did learn some good leadership skills. Learned about insurance laws, Learned how to provide premium customer service. Learned the psychology behind customer service and people. Most of my co workers are awesome and great people, hard workers and very intelligent. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the stress of people calling in and yelling about premium increases and when people make mistakes. Dealing with all the corporate jargon and the company refusing to change for the better.Not amazing because the management is very low quality. Unfair hourly raises, and unprofessional sources. The most enjoyable part was time spent with coworkers and days that lunch was provided for us. The hardest part of the job was the fact that there were no new leads which carried into no new income for comission.I love building business and new relationships.  Fast paced position that is rewarding in recognition and compensation.  I have learned that to manage a team effectively you have to be able to lead from the front.  Time manage is critical for success.  The toughest part of my job is work life balance.  I enjoy helping people.a typical day at work is taking over 60 calls assisting customers with policy changes and billing questions. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to provide and effortless experience to all customers and hearing them say how much we`re appreciated. the hardest part of the job is not having any work life balance.A typical day was to have all technology functioning to perform a fantastic day of sell. Taking care of customer needs and staff needs all day and troubleshooting when necessary in order to meet expectations. At the en of the day will have end of day reports ready.Management were willing to accommodate much of our needs  and keep us inform of any new innovations or tactics to move forward.  Co-workers were very friendly and willing to cooperate with any given task.I enjoyed taking care of customer and meeting staff expectation.Administered the equitable recovery on 550 and third party administrator claims, including worker’s compensation, auto, general and product liability, integrated disability, claim administration, and risk management services nationwide.Established strategic connection with SRS claim directors and account managers to certify that data integrity remained high while reducing collection time.Communicated with claimant’s counsel to quickly resolve medical liens while preserving a high net recovery.Company experiencing growing pains. More employees need to be accountable. Compensation and benefits are above the norm. I personally traveled every week spending 3-4 nights in hotels. I would have  liked to have more contact and visits with home office.","10,000+",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-10-12T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/3ad81127-52ce-4153-83d9-c6d732467137?mescoid=1500140001001&jobPosition=13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
86,Senior Data Scientist (IS Centers Of Excellence),"Tyson Foods, Inc.",3.7,1800.0,"Long hours, but pay is good and I had nothing but respect for my upper management, who weren't afraid to work those same long hours and then some. Some of the green hat managers weren't that good, but they eventually get weeded out. The blue hats were mostly good managers and the plant manager, production manager and 99% of upper management onsite were great people. Advancement is certainly there if you want it. A few employees there were pretty shady people, but in a plant that size that's to be expected. There were a lot of great employees as well.The lady at human resources was barely even in her office when I needed to speak to her and when she was, she was very short with me. The supervisor and team lead over at DSI were even worse. Team lead yells at other employees for stretching their hands, supervisor laughs at team lead for yelling at others, and makes fun of others on the way they talk, plus he was barely even in the work area. Also, he told everyone that a specific job had already been taken when it was not. NOBODY IN MANAGEMENT DOES THEIR JOB CORRECTLYWorking at Tyson was like having a second family.  They offered several in depth training programs to gain knowledge.  Unfortunately, after the plant manager retired the atmosphere changed immensly, most of my long time co workers pursued other opportunities.  The hardest part of the job would have had to be all the issues caused by the wash down crew, i.e. machines don't like 140 degree high pressure hot water and bleach.  Also, a lot of equipment would get damaged or have parts lost in the process.  However, I always have enjoyed a challenge!!!A typical day for me consisted of cleaning, climbing, and inspecting.  I learned a lot about handling chemicals, and factory operations.  The managements was very helpful and friendly.  My co-workers worked hard and as team to get the job done. The hardest part of the job was wearing all the equipment and climbing in to weird places. The best part of the job was the feeling of the was the feeling of transforming the building every time we came to clean.learned leader ship skills, how to operator heat presses, blenders, ovens, Fuji film packaging equipment, flatbread sheeter, data recording on sp charts. co-workers are mostly friendly and very productive. management is normally really involved with helping keep production and if members are in need of help. the hardest part is the 7 days a week. most enjoyable was the ability to learn new things and work your way up in the companyTyson Foods was a fun and fast paced place to work. I enjoyed  knowing that my work meant something. There are a lot of different cultures that work at Tyson.  It was fun learning about all of them.  For the most part, the management team was awesome.  But, there are always those few that make things difficult.  The hardest part of the job was being able to stand on your feet for long periods of time.  The first couple of weeks are a little difficult, but once you are able to get past those. It is a breeze.  The best part of the job, was the health insurance.  It was not too expensive. Plus, there are many options available.My responsibility was to make sure that the meat was straight coming down the assembly line and there was nothing else on the line. I work with a great team, we became a family. We all had our ups and downs,but we was able to always pull through. We knew how to put our problems or feelings to the side when it came down to work and we made our production majority of the timetransportation and distribution of processed chicken to the customers in a store door delivery method , 6 days a weeklearned the importance of meeting and exceeding customer needsgreat management and co-workersworking with a perishable product and always being aware of a temperature controlled itemcustomer satisfaction was the ultimate goal.I enjoyed my time working for Tyson Foods, New London, WI plant. I found that the maintenance department was very clickish and when management of the plant was faced with a difficult personnel challenge, their answer was to eliminate the problem.The start of the day is the most key point of production level and tells you what kind of work day you are going to have. I learned the performance of my task can dictate the team member [performance ahead of me. I learned to be an overall good team player their. Picking up the next employees slack makes the job very hard. The most enjoyable part is quality production being pushed out, and the happiness of going home after a hard days work.Standard Labor, Easy On Day Shift, Harder On Night Shift dealing with chickens are not easy as it may seem. The Hardest Part Of The Job But Looks Easy Is Hanging The Birds. fast process and you have to be quick.The job was physically demanding but, the paychecks and benefits were well worth the bodily pain. The only issue I had while employed here was human resources wouldn't accept doctors excuses and I would have to resubmit paper work to have points removed. I love working here.  I met some really amazing people and my gpm and supervisor were amazingI work for as a Production Supervisor. If I had known what the hours would be, I never would have taken the job. Supervisors work no less than 70 hours a week. You get very few breaks and sometimes get to take a lunch break. I would not recommend this job to anyone who actually likes to have a life outside of work. Almost every Saturday is spent in the plant.A typical day at Tyson Foods is to come and set up your line, ensure your team members work safely, ensure product is safe and of good quality. I have learned to manage a production line and to take care of your people and they will take care of you. The hardest part about my job is dealing downtime. The most enjoyable part is working with adverse backgrounds.I enjoyed working at Tyson the employees are much like family when  you work there. There are job postings all the time which give you the opportunity to learn several different jobs. Some are hot, cold, or dry environments. I had the opportunity to work throughout the plant and really loved working there. It is hard work and repetitive but if you are a hard working individual it will not bother you. The management are very good at solving problems and mostly easy going. The pay is good and with perfect attendance you are rewarded  with coupons to use in their store.Favoritism is a huge problem at the facility I worked for. Sometimes the managers are very critical to certain team members and at times even belittle them. Tyson Foods as a company I give 2 thumbs up, but the Sedalia Mo. planning 2 thumbs down. Team members should be treated with respect and not have to work in a hostile environment.Great  people to work with. Management  is cool too the work is easy too.  washing machines off with a pressure hose and chemicals the negative is you work everything night they pay is not bad but it ain't greatThis job is great but physically demanding and overall just hard all the way around. The pay is great but for every penny paid it is well earned. The work environment can be a little intimidating if your not used to working with people from different countries like Sudan, The Congo, Africa I would guess that the plant was 80-20 20 percent U.S.citizens the rest were refugees.You do everything that has something to do with Tyson food almost... In the plant you go from hanging live chicken to kill... It go through the clean and chill process you rehang it cut. Clean scale pack and label and ready to shift chickeni loved working at sonic because i got to work with money which i had never done before but once i got the hang of it i got it i loved to make tips and to make the people feel good and made sure they always had what they needed. My Co-workers werent all that great but i hung in there and got through the day because i have a kid to think about and not having a job wont cut it.This job was one of my favorites.i actually didnt mind going out of my way to help out where it was needed here anytime.the people i worked with was for the most part friendly and i got along with most everyone.work was hard but the pay made up for it.great job and now am still applying to go back.","10,000+",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-12-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/3e8e2d28-5ecc-42e2-a71d-9aaa63e62f86?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=14,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

89,Senior Data Scientist,National Opinion Research Center (NORC),2.8,15.0,"Its a good job but it can be very boring at times. You have to complete a lot of things to basically complete your task. You repeat yourself ALOT!! NOT ENOUGH HRS OR ENOUGH PAY FOT WHAT WE GO THROUGH ON THE PHONES.In the trainings they concentrate on telling you what you should not do and punishments if you do.Regional supervisors have a reputation for being mean and most of the team managers micromanage and nickel and dime every single expense, mileage and production time.You can tell that's the way they have been trained.If you complain they just fire you and blacklist you.I love my job but this company is HORRIBLE. They condone workplace harassment and do nothing to rid the place of it. Stuff gets stolen left and right- food, cell phones, personal belongings. Most of the supervisors don't know nothing and buttkiss and blame the ti's always!! They DONT COMMUNICATE AT ALL and everyday there's a problem with something because the lack of communication!! Raises are hilarious and they only promote those who they can take advantage of or if they like you and dont speak up against wrong doings. They outkast you if you have a brain and know your rights. They love to fire pregnant women and threaten your job even if you have written notice from a doctor. The morality and ethical treatment is hilarious and because they have NONE!!!!!! And I'm pretty sure if the contractors that hire them knew how they treat their employees they would DEFINITELY FIND SOMEONE ELSE!!!!!!! The job itself awesome!! Sit down and talk and the phone all day! Easy! I've made a few good friend in thankful for (only reason they got the 3 stars) But this company DEFINITELY NEEDS to reevaluate the way they treat you!!!!!!!! Ex. They recently promoted a perverted man who makes A LOT of women uncomfortable and NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE!!!!!!!! Even with NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS!!!!! And supervisors telling this man to stop...... Lawsuit waiting to happen..... And since they are relocating now they are downsizing yet still hiring!!?????? See???? No one knows nothing and they're not letting anyone know what's going on.... No consideration at all for the employees. People have kids, bills.One of thet largest research firm in the Country.  This company is known for providing the best care for its employees.company requirements-very attractive-require employees to  treat respondents with dignity and respect-something that is certainly lacking in the work force today.The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the respondents-always learned something while in their presence.  The hardest part was when I had to leave many of the respondents  and move on to another assignment.I have no comment about the CEO of the company, considering I don't know him to state an approval or disapproval-I have selected No only because I want to exit this page.I usually come in at 9:00 am speak to several different households through out the country to determine whether they are eligible for the National Immunization Survey.  Its take about 20 to 25 minutes to complete a single interview. I collect important data from respondants so that the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, state and local health bureaus can allocate funding in areas where they are needed. Hardest part of job is building a rapport with a respondant within the first 30 seconds of the call. The management and coworkers at NORC are very nice, polite, and helpful. The most enjoyable part of the day is quitting time.They tell us we are not doing telemarketing, but however you look at it, it is telemarketing.  We are trying to make people conduct a survey against their will and no matter how many times they tell us ""no"" we continue to call them back. I try not to complain because a job is a job, but they are ridiculous.great company pays well! Management is very supportive. Best company I've ever worked forThis is a great atmosphere to work in but very strict policies on attendance and in job decorum.I worked in the TSSO department. It is essentially a big call center to collect information on behalf of government agencies. It is run like a sweat shop. There is an incredible amount of micromanagement. You have to clock to break when you step away from your station even to use the bathroom. You cannot talk to the person next to you. You cannot eat while working. You are expected to work as fast as humanly possible all the time, and statistics are taken to measure your ""production"" There is no job security and HIGH job turnover. About the bottom %10 is fired and replaced monthly. They don't want you to think. They want robots.For me this place thee pits!! I took it as a means to generate some income after being unemployed for some time but after being there for a short time I knew my time there was coming to an end. I worked as a professional telephone interviewer for minimum wage, most people you call don't want to be bothered and others can be nasty and mean. There are production goals so you have to do somewhat well and also reading verbatim is crucial. Attendance is what can get you axed but they have a system where you create your schedule and trade hours, so it is possible to pick up more hours. Some people from management are nice, but the rest seem to be angry about life! Team leads walk the call center floor to watch you which made me feel uncomfortable - you can't read anything besides your own notes and no phones are allowed on the floor-of course people do. You get 6 minutes for every hour worked and there is 4 hour shift requirement. Minimum of 16 hours for each work week is required. Not much time to do anything considering it is on the 14th and 16th floor, and it takes like 3 minutes to get to the lower level in the elevator to get food/drink.Bottom line, if you are a student and need a flexible work schedule, then this is it. If you are looking for second job, this could work.There are other opportunities for you to do other things within the company, most still require for you to be on the phone.The promises in the ads NORC puts out sure knows how to reel you in. The big problem though is that this company falls very short on the delivery. I wouldn't take their ad for face value, if you know what I mean.Don't expect much in the salary department. Their ""competitive pay"" is merely fancy wording for minimum wage. The environment is very controlled indeed, they put all of their energy in the wrong place. It seems as if management goes out of their way to see if you're committing any office crime, such as forgetting to punch time, barely overshooting on breaks or working a little too loudly(whatever that means.)Speaking of management, they are a most conflicting bunch. It seems as though the different levels of management don't communicate with each other as well as they probably should. They do not make their guidelines for call production crystal clear. In fact, it sometimes seems as if their guidelines change on any given day. As a clerk, that makes it pretty difficult to know how to do your job, know when you're on top and when you're falling flat. They do offer the chance to have a 1-on-1 sit down to go over your stats. Unfortunately that turns out to be quite unproductive, as the person you meet with usually has no idea about the role of a production clerk, meaning they can't offer much in the way of advice or answer most questions you might have.As for the actual work itself, in my opinion things can get a little tedious. There is little variety in regard to the kinds of tasks you perform; you're either on the phone, on the computer, or both. On the off-chance  more... that there is another type of task available, you can pretty much forget about being considered for it if they already have you working the phones. Plus, I really didn't see many chances for true advancement during my time there. They only seemed to offer a handful of temporary projects, and once completed, it's right back to square one.On the upside, alot of the other employees there are pretty pleasant, scheduling is quite flexible, and NORC really does have a great, easily accessible location. Just wanted to say that this was not intended as a bashing rant, so I hope it wasn't taken as such. I just wanted to try to paint a very honest picture about what kind of company this is so people would really know what they were walking into if considering employment here.  lessI worked as a field interviewer. My main duties included planning and making trips into the field and/or telephoning respondents from my home office. Initial contact with respondents was with a cold visit or cold phone call; then explaining the study, persuading respondents to participate, and conducting the interview according to protocol. Also had to follow up (either in person or by phone) with respondents who had made appointments to be interviewed, or prompt and persuade resistant respondents to participate.My direct supervisor (field manager) was very easy to work with and very helpful and supportive.Being a field interviewer in not difficult, but one must be very organized and a self-starter, since you are working independently out of your home office. You also must not be shy about making a cold call or visit; and must be articulate enough to explain the study and why a respondent should participate in it.For me, the least enjoyable part of the job--which I didn't have to do too often--was doing occasional in-person visits with another field interviewer. I'd rather work independently than to have to put up with another field interviewer's quirks.Most enjoyable aspects: working out of my home independently, being able to by and large set my own schedule, doing a variety of tasks, and doing in-person interviewing in different areas of the region where I live.For one thing these are temporary jobs not permanent. They dock you for any bathroom time over 6 minutes. I never heard of such a thing the wages are minumum and you are expected to reach a quota this is more like a sweatshop than a job. Run away from this place it not worth it.Like the office setting, not loud and friendly coworkers. I like the ability of working for different government agencies and handling different tasks like data entry and telephone interviewing and clerical tasks.Sat at a computer cold calling individuals to complete the National Immunization Survey on behalf of the CDC.",NA,Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/541c4074-ce4c-420a-b97a-398435dcc090?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

It was demanding.  Teaching web development online can be very difficult at times.I enjoy my job, teaching prelicensing insurance in multiple states for Life, Health, Property and Casualty. Hardest part is not knowing when is my next class.I was a student and have a favorable view of Kaplan.  Their instructors are competent and I learned a lot there.  The instructors at Kaplan were available and were invested in my learning.  I would recommend Kaplan University to anyone wanting to get a degree.This was one of the best jobs I have had.  I had a whole teacher's manual to the ACT prep I was teaching to the students.  Kaplan's hiring staff and other staff are very organized and informative.  The down-side to this job for me was that it was a temporary ACT Instructing job at a highschool in East St. Louis.  St. Louis does not seem to do a lot of K-12 in-school ACT/SAT prep so I didn't have another opportunity arise for me.Kaplan University offers opportunity In a variety of academic positions.  As supervisor, I trained and mentored over 100 adjunct instructors.  I was responsible for scheduling and creating a team atmosphere.Watching the students as they progressed through the different courses, Seeing them advance their skills and confidence as they learned the tasks required to work in the medical field was great.Pay was decent. Working culture was decent.  I give it 3 stars because there was not much room to grow on the sales side.  Not quite sure why I have to give such a ling review for a decent company there is not much more to say.great atmosphere, great location and the people you build relationships and bonds with create an even more stable platform to grow within the companyKaplan University is a great place to work. The company believes in people over profits. We service students in 36 different countries and always put students first.Just have to be able to deal with changes.  The hardest part of the job is to make your goal, because if you don't you are only as good as your last enrollment.Work hour is flexible.They have nice complementary food.There was some conflicts from two art directors that make designer's design decision hard.The company had alot of ups and downs when I was employed there. I survived 2 massive layoffs. Other than that the benefits were average and the company would have lavish Holiday parties as well as shut the company down for half a day for field trips.Initially Kaplan Test Prep was a wonderful place to work. Days were busy, but we were productive, had a great team, and were all dedicated to doing the best for our students.  The common sense of purpose made it a great place to work.  Eventually the business changed and the atmosphere did as well, but once upon a time it was a great place to work.During my internship and few weeks of working at a geriatric and internal medicine office, I learned that working in the back office was more than I expected.  I didn't anticipate some of the behaviors of the patients as well as the family members that attended their visit with them.  I believe I would've worked better in a pediatrician office.  My LVN was a very sweet and helpful coworker who had a very loving and nurturing personality.A great place to add training and organization skills. They don't have any internal growth or much of management support. A pretty chill atmosphere and casual dress code.Worked at Kaplan as an admissions advisor for over 2 years. Completed my Masters degree in Health Administration. Volunteered each qaurter with the United Way.

Servers work on all opening duties such as: butters, waters, parmesan, salad dressing, snacks(during shows) and polishing their sections. Bartenders opening duties are making sure you have all the glassware you'll need, stocking your bar with beer, wine, and any liquor you may need and cutting fruit.I've learned a lot during my time at Andiamo, I've learned how to talk to people, bus trays, food services, even food preparation. Management is a little scattered sometimes, but overall they're a good team. My coworkers all stick together, like a family, and always have each others backs when we need it but like all families once in a while there is a bit of drama.

93,Lead Data Scientist,GrubHub,3.0,63.0,"Grubhub will use you and won't care. They will have you drive all over the city to restaurants 20-30 mins away and won't pay you for those miles but they make sure that the distance between the restaurant and customer is no more then 3 miles away. Your told to accept all orders and just call dispatch and have them redirect the order to someone that's closer. The problem with this is that Grubhub will still count this as a rejected order. If you don't have any other source of income then I guess you can stick with this mistreatment but if you do, stay far away from Grubhub because you will be out of a car very soon and underpaid for your work.Great company to work for. They will prepare you for your future. They give back to their employees and the staff is wonderful. More pay would be nice.GrubHub may have a great concept, delivery direct to your door from the restaurant of your liking, but they have a horrible overall platform for drivers. First, I was with the company just three days before going to, what they call, ""driver care"" for assistance. The representative on the other end of the phone was rude and malicisously didn't help me when I began questioning her reasons for being so rude. It was just a disaster of a call with no assistance for my situation.Despite that issues, I decided to give the company another chance. What a mistake! They claim to pay a minimum hourly wage if your quota is not met. But, the underlining trick to that is that your acceptance rate has to be high enough to qualify. Well, that's really not possible when you're having to reject calls that are over 30 miles away from your current position. It's a trap! This really is not a company, nor a platform I would encourage anyone to invest themselves in.The night dispatchers try sending you everywhere.... you will have like 1 hour or even 5 mins left to your shift and they will try to send you 45 mins away to another city. like really I have a life I have another job. Plus the gas and wear on your car ! If you want to keep your drivers make sure you treat them right!The CEO of GrubHub is an intolerant bigot who only caters to one political persuasion and looks to silence balanced views in the work-place.This is a very unfriendly place to work. You need to keep your head down and not stick out or else management will treat you poorly. Never express your opinion, or wear your hair in a different way, or draw attention to yourself.The office culture here will destroy your life, and stress you out.This is a grotesquely irresponsible and terrible company. The product is extremely poor and it exploits its employees and contractors.The letter from the CEO has highlighted the company culture that bleeds down from the top.It's a democracy - to threaten those who participated in the freedom of democracy is in essence blackmail and inducing fear-mongering tactics.Horrific company culture from the highest level of management. Sub par business model leads to furious customers. The CEO threatens employees saying they have to agree with his political views. I feared for my job and security.Want a low life job that makes 11.5 an hour? Go to Walmart... you won't waste a lot of gas or destroy you car while you work.  Want to waste a lot of time waiting for Restaurants to get the food ready to deliver and NOT get paid for it? If so keep reading. If you want to waste a pile of gas money driving half way across town to have that glorious oppty to wait and get paid a peanut? Well yeap you should sign up today with Grubhub... App is not reliable and minimums are a farce. Do yourself a favor and kill the curiosity about what it will be like before you waste time and money finding out that you are not your own boss and you make about or less than what you could make at Walmart or In Out burgerDay to day at grubhub is very hectic and fast paced, customers and restaurants contacted us frequently for assistance with issues or support, and I was on the phone for most of my day, operating between several systems to assist them. From there I was promoted to the finance department where I assisted in identifying and preventing fraud committed on the website. In this role I was not on phones but did email customers quite a bit to assist in fraud claims and errors with their purchases. I learned empathy and working efficiently in a fast paced and large environment and how to rely on coworkers to assist in day to day and working together to achieve an office goal and provide quality customer service.  The hardest part of the job was not getting frustrated with difficult customers and learning to walk in their shoes when solving a problem. The most enjoyable part was my co workers and satisfying customers with good service.1- App crashes almost everyday. They ask you delete the existing one and download again. 2- They send you 4-5 miles away from your location. You drive but you don't get paid for gas. They only pay for the gas you used between the restaurant and customer.  In other words (because you don't get paid until you reach the restaurant), you pay your gas expenses out of your pocket. No need to mention about car depreciation :)3- Let's say your shift is between 11 AM to 5 PM, and you don't want to accept a delivery which is created 4:57 that shows on your statement as REJECTED. Your acceptance rate goes bad. When acceptance rate is below %75 they don't contribute for min. guaranteed payment .4- New delivery order may pop up when you are on the way for delivery. You either reject or accept it otherwise you can't inform grubhub that you delivered the existing order. It sucks especially when you drive. It is like texting when you drive.Me gusto mucho este empleo muy facil tienes la oportunidad de escoger tu propio horario tienen buen salario y es un trabajo independiente.They want you to go to other side of town for delivery which you won't be compensated for.  When you refuse for too far away,  they' ll still keep sending you the same place in the future.  This wrecks your priority and acceptance rate.Explain this: Thursday you get two orders, same area, about $8-$10 tip. Friday you get three orders, very far apart, tips $13-$15 and guess what? BOTH MADE $21. You tell me if that's fair or not. Both days are same pay!!! OK, $0.86 difference. Really?Miles I drove probably was 10+ mikes, only considered over all is about 4 miles. They also don't pay you for attempting to deliver an order, picked up food, arrived at destination and customer cancels. No pay, plus you need to get permission to click delivered? Not only I wasn't paid twice for a delivery I already picked up, but I drove far for them and NOTHING. Company doesn't value their drivers, pay sucks on top of that they want you to extend your hours, ask why it's not delivered yet? Umm it's rush hour, traffic!!Company makes billions just like Insta Cart and paying their employees $1,lmao. GH makes around that amount, yet we get scrap money while the office people make money off of us. So, if you work for GH, just take it easy and don't worry about the office and their bs needs and rules. Just respect the customer and enjoy the drive till you leave the company. Don't drive your new car for this job, get a second older car to beat.Grubhub is a wonderful company to work for.  Very diverse, very friendly. Great pay, benefits. Triple pay on holidays. Contests & monthly bonuses is a plus.When I started working with GrubHub it was awesome: lots of hours, flexible, fun. Now GOOD LUCK if you can get a shift. There were probably 40 people in my area, now it's probably double or triple that so shifts are hard to get since they are first come first serve. Also, if you're lucky enough to get a shift or two, one may suddenly disappear leaving you with no work or money. If do work a shift, they will most likely short pay you. Don't get two shifts in one day, you wont get paid for the full hours worked. Oh and if you ever have any problems regarding shifts or pay, tough luck. They tell you to email them and when they finally get back to you a week or two later (if at all), they will just have a copied & pasted response for you. Worst, most unorganized & unprofessional company ever!GRUBHUB IS A COMPLETE rip-off. I work with this company for 6-months. The first month, I was paid $10.00 HR. The following month this company sent out emails to everyone in regards to pay decrease to $9.00 hr. The pay is now $9.00 hour for every state. Delivery radius was no more than 3 mile. I delivered a cheeseburger and a diet coke 26-miles from the restaurant. Grub hub is just taking advantage of the drivers. Grub hub is trying to make all the money on the delivery driver expense. Grub hub will call you to pick up a order over 20-miles away. You will not get paid for the miles going to the restaurant. You only get paid from the restaurant to the customers house that maybe 6 blocks away. GRUBHUB is not a dependable company for work. Recently grubhub had over 20 drivers on the clock for the entire week. Lots of drivers drive full time to pay there bills. Grubhub took everyones hours for the week. Lots of people left or didn't trust this company anymore. Every week they want you to fight for blocks for hours. You are a independent contractor 1099 at the end of the year. I got paid $360 for one week. My Gas was $200 for that week. I only made $160 for the week. Lots of wear and tear on your car. Grub Hub has lots of bad reviews! Don't be a victimFun job to work, you choose your own time and you use your own car. shifts consist of three hours per shifts. Shifts start at 11:00 and the latest you can take is 9. Depending on where your located, your area can be busy or slow. The hardest part of the job has to be just finding where people live in apartments, it's like wheres waldo.First of all, understandably, you do not want me to receive this $9/h for doing nothing so you will ensure I receive a delivery once an hour with no regard for my cars mileage.If I do not accept this delivery that can be twenty five to thirty minutes away, my acceptance rate and priority as an employee goes down. It is VERY hard to see even a penny of that promised $9. I have never seen one. Grubhub; if I'm doing nothing, I expect nothing. I also expect to be able to clock in on any day. And as an independent contractor, I should be able to. If the problem is people clocking out at peak times, perhaps you can keep acceptance rate based on reliability.The $9/h if you do not receive a delivery system throws a wrench in everything. I would rather get deliveries that make sense and are relatively close. Also these deliveries make other deliveries late as it pulls me into another drivers usual area.Great place to work very friendly environment and helpful. awesome schedules laid back work environment. Just an amazing place to work and the pay is awesome way better than most jobs.","501 to 1,000",Chicago,Chicago,IL,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/2c3c6e73-3790-45f7-938c-18c01624d89e?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=21,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

101,Data Scientist,Bed Bath and Beyond,3.7,2300.0,"Its not a difficult job. Retail in general is not really difficult. Customer service values are top priority. This is a great job for friendly motivated sociable people.My general impression of most of my coworkers is either young and lazy or old and stuck.My oppinion of managers is that most of my managers are alright.The hardest part of the job is dealing with the occasional rude customers. Honestly it's no big deal in general but no one likes to be disrespected.The most enjoyable part... I can't say i particularly enjoy any part of the job in all honesty. I do enjoy a handful of my coworkers though.Can be a great place to work. It is very hard to advance within the company. Yearly raises on excellent reviews are 20 to 30 cents. I have worked at three different stores with very different ways of doing things. It can be very high drama or very relaxed depending all on management. The customers for the most part are great, but also very needy because that is how we've trained them to be. It's nice to able to take care of customers and we bend over backwards for them. That said, the corporation does not go out of its way to help employees. The company is very frugal and raises are ridiculous; people will often get hired that make more than I do, and I'm a keyholder. There is a lot to do and its hard to get bored if you have a good work ethic.Bed bath and Beyond is not a bad company. I have been with the company for five years. I have worked at three different stores within the company for school purposes. I believe that one of the particular stores I worked for the management could have been of higher quality when it came to how to talk to employees, scheduling, and understanding of personal circumstances. I enjoyed my co-workers at each store. A typical day at work is either working at customer service helping customers & being a cashier or, working on the floor stocking products as well as helping customers. The hardest part of the job is working long hours in the evening getting off at 11 p.m. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers. There is not mush room for advancement. That is one of the features I did not like.I'm a customer service rep. Nice and friendly people who shop at our store.  Management is mostly reasonable.  Co-workers are fun to work with.  They really make or break the job.  Overall good working conditions.I received An Achievement Award , and Gold Shrink Penn on Behalf of Management Staff Bed Bath Beyond , also awarded $25 Gift Certificate After Completing 5 years of , a $1.50 raise after first Full time position Great Fast Effective , Customer Service Driven , Team Work Oriented , Fun Friendly Environment on a Daily Basis ,Very BusyManangement at Sonic was unfair and played games.They always would change when you were allowed to put in requests for time off. only select few were given their requests. There was definitely favorites, and drama constantly between the managers. I eventually had to leave because of the drama, the games, the unfairness, and to grow in my career.I worked there for 10 years as a manager.  The only positive is the benefits.  There are too many negatives:  Worst work-life balance in retail, poor raises for hourly's - 25 cents max a year, rarely a positive comment from the regional managers down to a regular manager, hard to get promoted if an hourly since there are few full-time slots.  And if you're a manager, there isn't enough salary to get the tasks completed and you're expected to pick up the slack for the lack of salary or........stay there forever to finish it.  Without a , ""Thanks for the effort,"" comment.I like working here its a nice environment, my coworkers are all amazing. You get to work with people whom have different personalities and views. As well as dealing with different types of customers, so you learn the different kinds of shoppers . I love that the management works with my class schedule really well.I enjoyed working at Bed Bath and Beyond. The management was nice and worked with school hours. The store manager also kept a fridge and freezer stalked at all times and bought us lunch about once every other week. The coworkers also became great friends of mine in such a short time. One even offered to let me sleep on her couch after only knowing her for a month due to flooding closing the road that I lived on. The only downside was that the managers had been there for 10+ and there was no room for promotions.I was made the primary customer service person over a year ago and I am still in the same position, I have asked if there is any room for me to have a little more responsibility in the store but it has not been granted to me. There are little benefits working here. The discount is 20% off your entire purchase. Relationships between co-workers and management is mostly awkward and uncomfortable. I have learned a lot about working in customer service and how to multi task and solve problems.Overall, Bed Bath and Beyond is a very simple retailer.  Their focus remains two things, exceptional customer service and keeping the store full.  There are very few reports that are utilized, sales are rarely discussed, technology is limited and the pressure to hit goals is virtually non existent.  The physical and mental toll on their managers are great however, as they are asked to do quite a bit more than most other retailers.  There is very little staff given to complete tasks, so much of what needs to get done has to be done by the managers in the building.There is very little performance management so a person is always safe in their job, however, under performers are never really held accountable for their performance.To be successful in the company a leader will most certainly have to lead by example.The job has taught me how to always be multi tasking as well think out of the box to solve problems.I liked this job but the pay is at a stand still to long. You was able to wear several titles and no pay raise for what  person was worth. The job was very interested and there was a lot to be learned. The feeling to be able to tell a customer about an item and the customer is very satisfied and happy while making their purchase was a joy.Management is always helpful, although the vetting process for managers hired from the outside and inside alike is lacking. Working at BB&B has helped my customer service skills skyrocket to the level of advanced, in my opinion. Customer reviews and general satisfaction of other at the workplace prove this.Love working with the brides at the registry. Love the co-workers. Nice atmosphere. Management helpful in some areas. Interacting with the customers was the greatest.A typical day at Bed Bath and Beyond included opening or closing duties, assisting customers with bridal registries and stocking the sales floor.  I learned how to solve problems with co-workers and customers in a positive manor.  There was a big range in the quality on management.  One of them was very disrespectful to employees, but most of them were very hard working and gave appropriate feedback and training to employees.  Most of my co-workers were great and communicated well with me about what was happening that day in the department I was assigned to work in before leaving for the day.  The more you work as a team, the better your experience will be!  The hardest part of the job was climbing 12 foot ladders and retrieving or storing merchandise in top stock.  After doing this for years, I still got nervous!  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the regular customers find items for their homes.  Once you get to know them it is so rewarding when you learn their styles and preferences.I only worked here for a little over a month. The job itself and the people I worked with were great, despite long hours due to constantly being understaffed. My problems began with management when after working a 40 hour week as a part time associate, I asked the scheduling manager to roll be back to 25 hours a week because I'm a student and need time for school. My manager then told me that was false and showed me in the computer system that I was only working up to 24 hours a week. I knew immediately this was false because I had a picture of the paper schedule for my 40 week and previous weeks when I'd worked well over 25 hours. When I showed her the schedules from these weeks, which looked starkly different from what I saw on the computer, I was told that I was being disrespectful, and was then scolded by one of the other managers for ""calling her a liar"". I quit after finishing my shift that day.If you like friendly co-workers, an easy retail job, relatively nice customers, and management that changes your hours in the system so that they don't need to pay you for your time, this BB&B is for you.Managers sometimes are lost. Poor desitions making . Poor work ethics. Company benefits are awful. I have worked with this company for 5 years and still not passing 10 dollars an hour. Human resources treat badly . They fire for anything. Even When you have a legitimate reason . Even if you call out and give reason and even bring them a note. they pay raise is awful to 18 to 25 cents a year. very bad company to work with.Depending on your store, you'll have to be able to put up with an ever rotating door of so-so managers. Some of them are amazing, otherwise they're pretty terrible and you never know what you're going to get. We are constantly short staffed, constantly cutting hours while still hiring 6+ people at a time, the technology is pretty horribly out of date there and the communication amongst the management is atrocious. They do pay well for retail and the benefits are nice if you're full time.In my experience, Bed Bath & Beyond is full or wonderful, organized, and professional employees. Both their practices and policies always benefit the customer as well as the team members in a very practical and sensible manner. However, after being here for almost a year hours have been drastically cut and the raise I was promised after my review never went into effect, therefor I cannot afford to stay with the company much longerI love the job and the people that I work with but the company does not care about their associates. I have asked for several raises because I am doing managerial work but all have been denied. The work is hard and challenging. The management is terrible and are not willing to help. Overall I love the job and what I do but the company is terrible. I am one of the hardest workers but I make less than $10 an hour.You must be a people person to work at BB&B. Customer interaction is a must. They do a great job training you in all the different products they sell. The staff is upbeat and professional , so is the management. The pay could be better, but they do offer good benefits after you become full time.","10,000+",New-York,Union,NJ,2016-11-16T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/data-scientist-job-union-nj-us-174259346.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

I'd recommend it to someone looking for a sales job.Enjoyable work environment with hard-working, reliable coworkers. Management was laid back but dependable. Owners are very good people and are extremely involved in their business. Most enjoyable part of the job was bartending and meeting new people. The hardest part of the job was being short-staffed, sometimes management approved other servers/kitchen staff to leave early.Typical day is good .I learned who to trust yourself.Management is good.My co-workers are good persons.No hardest par of the job.My co- workers are the most enjoyable part of the the job.I worked shift work with a team. I would stock shelves, food items and assist cleaning crew to help out. I was always told that I was a good team player. My most enjoyable was seeing that the work I had done was done right and others benefitted from it.They didn't tell me when they hired me that it was only going to be for three weeks while the manager was visiting family in Chicago. So I came to get my pay check and they told me they no longer needed me.Overall, the established system provides a good sense of job security; allowing for expectation of long term employment. A very dynamic operation with lots of moving parts allowing for significant multitasking and obtaining solid results...more accomplishments than the general public knows or understand.  However, at times not enough time in the day to accomplish all that is desired.Typical day consitst of managing contracts, initiating case investigations, participating in outreach efforts, participating in operation shield, auiditing, creating presentations for managment meetings, ectI learned both physical and personnel security rules, regulations, and requirementsManagement was awsome, everything was structured and very organizedMy coworkers were very supportive, knowledgeable, team playersThe hardest part about this job was actually leaving, even though it was for a promotion.

I live and learn alot during my employment there with Ice.Very competitive & a lot of favoritism. Difficult to advance do to culture.This is a dead end job with no opportunity for growth. It was completely unprofessional. They are not timely with shift bids, coaching's or year end reviews. The job requirements and expectations certainly surpass the pay with new job requirements being added on weekly and your pay staying the same.CONS: Must absorb OT on lunch hour. no sick days. lack of communication between management and employees. no concern for non-sales positions. PTO is not handled in a timely manner and the logic behind it makes no sense.I loved my job and the people I worked with, but the pay was poor. Sometimes you lost whole seasons, but you were home a lot to.work is routine and atmosphere is very dry. Management fears lawsuits so they keep allowing bad employees to stay around. Hard to promote or get a permanent position due to veterans preference.All sales and you are just a number. If you have family issues like a death in the family. They put work first. I would not go back there* Constant ongoing training* Good Management* Talented people to work with.* Cafeteria on site* Public transportation close byThis was a home based position. I loved every minute of it. My team was amazing, our management team was always available to help and assist us. The pay structure was great. I learned more than I could of ever thought about the travel industry and got the opportunity to  take advantage of many gifts that were available to the employees.  My GM was not a nice person. he was very rude to his employees and never gave any hours to anyone but just one person that he was having a relationship with.

105,Data Scientist,Merck,4.1,1900.0,"Jobs like this are not easy to find.  The best place I have ever worked.Only there a year and was being trained as a manager.  Tough training but prepared you for position.  Good company culture.  Enjoyed the people I worked with as well as management.Enjoyed working for this company. They treated their worker fairly and with respected. They made employees feel needed,I loved going to work.  I had the same manager for over 11 years which seems to be unheard of in the industry.  I learned the value of respect - ""catching people doing something right"" - which was one of my manager's sayings.  I also learned when participating in a workshop with co-workers always give the positive feedback then ""what you may which to try next time"" and then end on a positive note.The hardest part about the job was when someone in an office was dismissive before they knew my expertise or even me as a person.The most enjoyable part of the job was the people and knowing when I was helping and was a real resource for their caregiver.Great benefits.  Very generous pay and benefits.  Learned a lot of MS Office products there.  Family feel to the company at times.I worked 8 hours and walked to plant to plant. I learned many task as troubleshooting. There were a very nice organization and good relation with the head-plant. The more hardest were use the safety uniform. The most enjoyable part it was the relation with the others employees.Merck has three major sites in Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.   Boston site is the smallest of the three sites.Productive fan place to work and culturally diverse. Coworkers are helpful and cooperative. When it comes to team projects or cross-functional team projects, members seem to have open minds for different kinds of views and to resolve issues. Team members work hard to meet deadlines.Good company-I was there for a long time.  Many opportunities to grow and develop. I was promoted often. last job in oncology.Fun place to work and always a challenge. Good work culture and good co-workers. Good management. Always improving on production methods, Grate recognition program.Very competitive energetic environment to provide products to HCP's  in very important therapeutic catagories. Co workers most always have the highest level of integrity and passion.An excellent work experience and an excellent Company. In all aspect they offer: training, incentives, excellent products, etc. Unfortunately the Company Plan in which I work will be closing in December and I have to move.This is a wonderful place to work. They have a great work/life balance program and they even offer a shuttle program for a low cost to individuals to ensure they have transportation to and from work.Safe place to work, nice co-worker and a great place to make friends. Don't know about benefits because I was a temporary employee.Merck has great history, surround talent people, advanced techniques, excellent research environment, good benefit; I pretty much enjoy working at Merck.A typical day would be to check all pending correspondence that required follow-up and perform those tasks, move on to new work as needed and keep an eye on needed changes.I have learned the importance of understanding different communication styles.I take full responsibility and bring issues to closure either through my own skills or tapping into more experienced management.My co-workers have always bee over a wide range of diversity.The hardest part of any job is identifying priorities and watch for shifting priorities to address them in a timely manner.I love interaction with people and tending to their needs.Durham VBF, could use more restructuring. Need managers that have experience and people skills. The culture needs to be restructured also. Work-life balance in nonexistent. Pay is not all that good.Very good company. typical day includes making the production of vaccines and cleaning aseptic clean rooms. also dealing with paper work and log books.This company has great benefit packages and good work/life balance and all of the advantages a workplace can have.

108,Geologist -  Hazardous Site Investigation/Sampling /Remediation Projects,Randstad Engineering,3.8,7200.0,"very effiecient in getting in contact regarding job openings, don't work within the company as I am an agent they send out for various jobs if i fit the criteriaThe ratings depend on the manager who oversees the Randstad office that the talent works with. As of today, I have an excellent manager.  She listens.  She is helpful.  She is attentive, makes sure we are treated fairly, makes effort to match us with departments that would be a ""good fit"" for both parties.  She keeps open communication and good relations between both the talent and the contractors.The manager before her was not good.  She was not on our side.  She would advocate for the contractor over her talent (employees).This company did exceptional work at getting you in with the appropriate company that you fit in with in a very timely manner. They placed me in the right company that allowed me the opportunity to further my customer service skills and gain administrative assisting experience as well. My co-workers were great and always available to assist with the answers to any questions i had. Management was great as well and very approachable. I enjoyed when my manager would ask me to assist her with different projects that allowed me to broaden my administrative skills.Randstad has found me a few jobs here and there to help out with gaining experience & providing me with assignments that have helped out with my bill situation. They always know exactly what I have in mind for an assignment, have not disappointed me in the offers for assignments and happen to be one of the greatest temporary agencies I have ever worked for!The job consist of the following:•	Packaging inspection and packaging machine operator.•	Product labeling for organization.•	Product assembly of medical hospital supplies.•	Ensure and follow all safety rules and procedures.Management, operations, and staff were all a pleasure to work with. No problems. I am glad they made sure everyone understood and followed safety and procedures to ensure that everyone goes home safe.Good place to work. I was working second shift and for personal reasons needed to go to first shift. Talked to management for a month with no results. In that time they hired many people off the street for first shift. Got frustrated and moved on by because of personal reasons.IRandstad placed me with a company in HR/Administration.  The company hired me after my 90 days.  Skills include: tracking employee time and attendance, maintaining employee timecards, workers' comp claims and reporting, OSHA Log, crossover to the accounting department, and shipping department.  I really enjoyed my co-workers and worked for this company for a year.I really enjoyed the chance to work contracting at the Vanguard site. staffing phone lines and fielding calls from current and potential clients I learned various call types, allot of problem solving skills.Management I only encountered 1 time in 10 months she attended a meeting. I mostly worked with numerous Team Leads.I really enjoyed interacting with my fellow co workers , being part of the team.The hardest part of my job was I didn't have any licenses so it was a strict, follow the contract agreement. Most enjoyable part was the customers that I did have a positive impact on.Randstad was not bad to work with, they gave me a job and paid me. The company I worked for as a temp through Randstad was a very fast paced, dark and dirty warehouse with multiple lift trucks moving at high rates of speed. I learned a lot about how to safely operate lift trucks in an excessively dangerous environment without error.I enjoy being the first one coming in every morning and getting my center ready for clients to walk in, to get the solutions to their issues met. One of the most enjoyable parts of my job is the ability to brighten up a clients day, as we see many clients with issues that are causing them to have a bad day because they can't work. It gives me a great feeling to be able to assist a client and resolve their issue and brighten up their day in doing so.Great Culture, Market Leading Company. Randstad is a good company with an awesome leader. Middle Management has been somewhat sub par but its definitely improving. Great starter level Management job. I learned alot while employed. I'm simply looking for a company with a higher cieling. The promotion level is nowhere near whereI am hoping to go. Otherwise a good companyExcellent company to work for and I would like to continue working for them in the future again. I loved working at my last assignment at Merrill Lynch, Jersey City, NJ.I had the best coworkers who used teamwork to help each other out.The hardest part of the job was I had worked many days without a lunch.  I was so busy that the day flew by.The most enjoyable part of the job was even though I was so busy the people I worked with was the nicest people of all the places I had ever worked.I also enjoyed working with PowerPoint and had a chance to be productive and contribute to the MSG Group.I'm currently working with this staffing company as of now operating heavy machinery, pallet jacks, cherry pickers and also forklifts. I'm very flexible within a warehouse facility whether its locating items for shipment or processing payments. From time to time I usually go out onto the roads to assist our drivers with large orders drop offs to other companies or businesses.Randstad is an amazing group of people. They are willing to talk to you about any issues you may be having. If you find that the job you have through them isn't working for you, they will help in finding something that does work for you. Whether that be in the same company or in a different company that they do hirings for. I never had a bad or unhappy moment when working with these people.I recently had an interview with this company. I was told that I presented well and was very professional. After 3 months of looking for employment and contacting my recruiter I have yet to be placed. I've called my recruiter several times asking for assistance and she tells me that she can't find anything that fits my job description. I have applied for countless jobs on their site, but still haven't received a call back from anyone. I'm not sure what the problem is, but the Ranstand Office in Duluth GA was not helpful at all.w	Exercised tact, good judgment and patience while communicating with the public, departments and internal customers which resulted in high customer retention rates and a positive work environment.w	Evaluated sales quota reports and customer service survey studies pertaining to work flow, time factors, procedures, and staffing, made recommendations and encouraged staff to exceed expectations.w	Researched information, analyzed accounts to reconcile errors, modified account transactions, authorized the removal of penalties and issuance of credits or refunds.The pay was okay, its hard to get hired on with a company permanently through them. I was lied to and told there were no more first shift positions available, but I was told once there were some available I would be able to get that position. A week later they were bringing in new people for all shifts, I asked again same answer. I worked with them for 6 months and every week it was the same thing.Randstad is a strong player in the technology recruiting market.  The Austin office is well managed and has a strong team.  While the base salary is pretty low, there is a generous commission structure.  Benefits/PTO/Stock Purchase Plan/401k are all very strong.  Great place to work!I really enjoyed my time with Randstad and I would recommend them to everyone. The managers and supervisors are understanding, fair, and if there is an instance where one of there employees is being mistreated, they jump on it immediately. Overall, I have no complaints when it comes to this company.Randstad Technologies has been one of the most informative jobs I've held. With the vast array of support jobs I not only learned about how to work in Major Corp networking, I also learned about other businesses and got a better understanding of the business world. Sadly each job held in Randstad is entirely up to the client and not one's own capabilities making it hard to invest oneself into the job.Great place to work at, although I did not enjoy the back to back, non-stop phone calls. Also, it would be more enjoyable if it was only inbound calls rather then the majority of the calls being outbound because the customers got mad quickly about being called at all or often multiple times a day.",NA,New-York,Edison,NJ,2016-11-21T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/geologist-hazardous-site-investigation-sampling-remediation-projects-job-edison-nj-us-176487674.aspx?mescoid=1900265001001&jobPosition=11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

122,Data Scientist,CDI Corporation,3.7,262.0,"CDI Corp was an excellent company to work for. The hiring team was well versed in the HR process and the on boarding was fairly easy to complete.  Only bad experience was the exit process, no details given and when contract was about to expire very little communications from management. When trying to find additional employment there was absolutely no follow up and no new job prospects presented.There are a million things wrong with this company, so where do I begin?1) Their on boarding system is a joke. I had no idea who my manager was and no idea what my job really entailed. 2) They try and do a horrible job covering up their mistakes. I saw a job posting for my same position with higher pay. When I confronted them about it, they took down the posting immediately and brushed it under the table. 3) Their entire internal software system is extremely antiquated. They need everything to be run on a PC and through Internet Explorer. I used to have to travel 3 miles every week so that I could input my timesheet on a brick of a laptop. I still have to use a totally outdated timesheet system that they just ""updated""4) There's little to no interaction with management or anyone higher ups5) Absolutely zero career growth and development. I tried for a year to try and get some momentum on growth opportunities... NOPE6) Benefits are a joke. The pay is already horrible, you really expect us to pay for benefits out of pocket?!?!CDI is a third party contract business. I actually worked as a contractor for IBM. CDI has a great system for payroll and communications. The management team there really cares about their employees and will make sure that they are gainfully employed.They are very good at negotiating with the customer and very good representing the employee to the customer.So far the managers I have worked with are very good, and being able to work from home is an awesome perk.The key problem and one for which I wouldn't recommend working for CDI is the fact that as an employee you live under the constant threat of being laid off. If you are brave enough to work for them you better have a ton of money saved up so that when you do get laid off ""and you will eventually"" that you have something to fall back on. The company doesn't appear to be able to market their services very effectively. This means one minute you are busy and the next minute you are scrambling for something to dig into.  They are heavily dependent on Intel which is as we all know a fickle company who doesn't like to keep people around for an extended period. My advice: find a job with a company where you don't have to live under this kind of stress.CDI allows for my career to succeed and improve with current industry standards. Very competitive and a major turning point in the planning industry. CDI maintains and focuses on serving our clients with a combination of innovative technologies, increased efficiencies, and leading edge solutions with an end-goal of achieving client excellence.At the Cincinnati branch we have one customer, GE(primarily Aviation). As GE goes the contract procurement goes and for the past couple years it has become lethargic. This is because they only have one new product coming out. I have personally been put on part-time(furlough) at 4 month and 3 month intervals. So far for 2016 I have been billable 50% of the year so far. This situation is less than ideal for most individuals with families depending on that salary. I am in the analysis group. We had ~15 engineers 2 years ago. Now, we are down to 3 engineers. Some people got raises recently, a measly 2% across the board. This is the first raise I have been told in over 2 years. The stock of the company has fallen ~50% since the CEO started in August of 2014, but he hasn't been fired. We got a new VP of our division last year. She came and gave a town hall speech with aspirations and haven't heard anything from her since. The people I have worked with are top notch engineers. Never have had an issue with anyone. Benefits are the worst in the business. But what do you expect from a purchase service company. I am lucky cause usually if there is no work you are fired(as stated in your contract you sign when you start). Management doesn't care about you or your family. Our Director of Operations has a Ed Grimley complex without the hairdo that is embarrassing. We have a Director of Business Development that hasn't done squat to get new customers. Must be nice to get paid 6 figures and have nothing to show for it.I've worked for several years for CDI Corp. I initially was placed as a web author for a large tech company (client) and over the years moved up through CDI to be a project manager, working on various contracts with the same client. My experience within the organization has varied a great deal based on changes within CDI management, contracts I worked on for the client, and the teams I worked with. By and large, I had the privilege of having excellent managers who advocated for my advancement and fantastic teams made up of intelligent, motivated people who were a pleasure to work with. For the last 3 years, I have also been able to work from home full time, and I have loved this flexibility.The downsides to working for CDI is that it is ultimately a staffing company. The pay and benefits are not great, and your long-term growth are limited by the contracts available. It is nearly impossible to continue advancing your career beyond a certain point, and for an ambitious person, this can be very frustrating. It can also be frustrating as a manager not to be able to see your employees advance to the levels they should because there simply is not opportunity. While local management is fantastic, corporate management, whom we rarely deal with on a regular basis, are out of touch with the local teams, and meaningful rewards for truly outstanding performance are few and far between. For instance, it's been 4 years since the company last had annual merit pay increases, and the last round of merit pay increases were so low, they didn't keep up with cost of living increases in the  more... area we were based. There is no loyalty from the corporate office, and excellent employees who have been loyal to the organization may be laid off with limited notice when their contract is up. Local management tries to mitigate this, but corporate has made it increasingly difficult to reward and retain top talent.  lessGreat temporary employment agency. Who they vendor for is hit or miss. Some contrats are great and some are not. Some companies will keep you for multiple and exttended contracts. Chances of get fulltime employment.Subordinate to IBM work requirements,  so Little actual advancement opportunities. Mostly just a payroll administrator.IBM has a major initiative to move as much work offshore as possible. I have trained about 10 offshore groups & transferred work to them. I am about to do another one in the near future.Very pro family was able to work and do family events. Management was very good on making employees feel good about what they were doing. The cost of insurance was the only poor item.Great company just wish previous owners did not run it into the ground as we have a lot of work to do to recover the profit margins we are comfortable with. Hours will always be long at a start up and compensation low. but the new leadership is outstanding and has given the company with a 39 year track record a real chance to recover.Coordinates and implements the established referral process for children and families, ensures the implementation of recruitment including the child find effort, implement the enrollment process, provide accure record keeping, assist in the parent committees.I learned that I was a case manager for 30-35 families and that together with the parents, teacher and core team, we can guide parents to coordinates efforts to ensure services for children including children with disabilities. Ensures that children are up to date on epsdt. The most enjoyable part of the job is work with children and families and help them.Daily tasks are spread out so you do you have some down time. Work environment is ok. Work long hours sometimes. Occasional saturday workI'm a sub under a bigger company. Rare to see any of my own management. occasional e-mail. Management of Aecom calls the shots on a daily basis.I have an outstanding team to work with. It is a managers dream. The hardest part of the job is keeping a team of billable employees in a services industry busy whenever their is an economic down turn, or the client work load diminishes, considering the low overhead budgets that we have to work with to maintain shareholder profitability.CDI marine was a very nice place to work.  Direct supervisor had personnel interests and desire to keep people working.  Upper management had dropped the ball, finding new or continuing work for personnelI learned new software and industry specific tidbits of information. This has definitely been one of my most interesting jobs to date, with a great group of co-workers. I had the best supervisor ever!CDI was a good contractor in the Pittsburgh area at this time (1994).Working at Westinghouse on contract was interesting in that I tested software for a nuclear reactor, the pay was fair for an hourly rate, no benefits, and I had 3 courses still to complete at CMU if I wanted to finish my MS degree there and not being a Westinghouse employee, I did not have tuition reimbursement to do that.  I never became a full time employee at Westinghouse and left after the summer to move to another city and I never did complete those last 3 courses at CMU.CDI gets the job done.  But I was looking for something a little more long term with upward mobility opportunities.  Such an opportunity cannot be had with CDI.They do a decent job managing contract workers for clients but no job search. Their orientation does not seem to be a job house so much as a contractor wrangler.Company was a temporary Head Start provider appointed by the federal office of Head Start Management.  Our previous employer CEDA of Cook County Illinois lost it's federal funding to provide Head Start services due to it's mismanagement of government funds in 2014,  ALL employees from the Head Start division were laid off.  CDI was appointed and hired staff who wanted to stay on but again everyone was laid off effective August 31, 2015.   Many were told that this would be at least a two year process until an approved company or organization could be found to continue services - ALL SERVICES,  but just a year in we were all gone again.  To be fair CDI was thorough with it's procedures -  especially with it's accessibility to upper management and supplying staff with materials and handling repairs in a very timely manner,  something that never occurred (due to partiality and favortism) within CEDA, which had too many friends and relatives on staff fostering a climate of dissatisfaction for those employees who were honest,  hardworking and dedicated to the children and families they serviced.  Many good workers with years of experience will never get the chance to retire with ""their"" company because they were betrayed.  CDI came aboard and immediately stopped that culture and I for one would like to thank them -  if only they had not dropped us so soon,  leaving us for dead also!","10,000+",Washington,Washington,DC,2016-11-16T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/data-scientist-job-washington-dc-us-176192530.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

Work/Life balance is WAY OFF-balance!!!.  You go to work before the sun comes up, and you usually do not get home until around 6:30pm.

Team leaders are very good about giving us information about the line we are working on. I've learned from hand packing, stacking boxes onto a pallet, use of jacks/power jacks, doing rework, and numerous of different inspections of candy bar. Everybody is very friendly and like to help you learn the job you need to do that day. Hardest part would be the overtime but you accept that when taking the job.

126,Data Scientist,Dewberry,4.0,26.0,"It has been a great company with good work life balance. Dewberry wants you to succeed financially and career wise while having fun life outside of work.Dewberry is a great company to work as various departments can be available in one area. I learned computer skills such as Autodesk AutoCad and Bentley Storm/Water Cad. In addition, I learned a lot of each municipality and city differs from one another.I traveled working in the pipeline survey area. It's more like they hire their friends that have no experience and let go people that actually know what they are doing.Nice place to work, all employees and the office manager, were always nice. I loved the schedule and all the people that work in this office were very professionalDewberry is has a great productive and friendly work environment. Everyday one can learn different things in technology as you are expected to be on your toes. I am very lucky to have a very relax and friendly co-workers and managers.The co-workers are the best part of this company.  They make up for the lack of support from management tolerable.  This company is very top heavy---which wasn't always the case and its sad to see that its come to that.Tasks included: Scheduling inspections for affected homes to assess damages from Hurricane Sandy such as finding unsafe amounts of lead or asbestos containing materials;Uploading data collected from Lead and Asbestos Reports onto a case management system to track progressUtilizing a switchboard phone system to handle a high volume of telephone calls in order to assess clients’ needs; andProofreading and editing Lead and Asbestos reports before entering data into case management system. It's a very lax work environment as long as you get your work done. You get your own work space and computer. You make your own schedule and the pay is hourly; I had a part time position so I was able to come in at any time as long as it was between 8am and 5pm from Mon - Sunday and complete up to 30 hours a week. Co-workers are very friendly; the environment is very professional.  There are copious amounts of paperwork that you must process accurately and efficiently.Emergency Management. Please let applicants apply.I performed field services for FEMA hurricane disaster management on Louisiana GulfCoast. Involved numerous assessments and monitoring, including public and privateproperty assessments; demolitions, salt water damaged tree removal DR 1607, DR 1603Hurricanes Rita and Katrina.A typical work day is working hard at the computer.I learned a lot at Dewberry, and the really cool thing is that I'm still learning a lot. To name a few, I learned how to use MicroStation and how to manage LiDAR data. The co-workers are very nice and easy to talk to. The ironic thing is that no one seems talkative, though.The hardest part of the job is being able to finish the task in the given time that's handed to you because the task can be a large quantity of work.The most enjoyable part(s) is constantly learning as you go and seeing the final product make a huge impact in a community. For example, the hazardous debris projects.I learned a lot at Dewberry in my field of work, and gave me the work experience I needed and involve myself in. It gave me the opportunity to work with a team, on an individual level, and on my own to develop ways to better myself and the way we worked. However, management seems a little sloppy. While I was expected to be temporary, the way it was handled was poor and was essentially laid off without being told so. While the main project was coming to a close; they told us to find other work within the office -- but no other projects were in line leaving many of us stranded.The most important thing to Dewberry is that you have an engineering degreeDay of traveling from job to job. Management errors at times. Most co-worker were hard workers. I learned time management, How to lead a crew, operated different survey equipmentGreat technical people and strong managers. No strong growth for technical people. Most of the fast grown in their career are those who management to move to the management track.In this position I learn how to review contracts, PO, mod, etc. and jobs set up and to billing clients on a monthly basis.  The hard part is to get project managers to submit their invoice proofs on a timely manner.I enjoy going into work everyday! The office environment is great and the work is fun.Performed intensive assessments of damaged homes and estimated repairs required for habitability requirements.  Separate calculations from Xactimate sketches were made to differentiate actual storm damage, previous repairs, new repairs, deferred maintenance and neglect.  Worked with a cohesive group of talented individuals with a very wide range of background from all over the United States.Received great work experience in a variety of fields of Civil EngineeringGreat place to work.  Would recommend it to anyone looking to work here.I have worked here for several years and the company is nice to work for. Headquarters is in Fairfax VA.Depending on your position you can work a lot of overtime although they pay for it which is nice. The contract work can be stressful and there are ridiculous demands at times. Overall, not bad benefits and a good experience.Overall the environment is good.

I gathered a lot of experience from Bowhead and learned the value of interactions between different societies.Bowhead may be a great place to work if you work at one of the contract locations.  Working at headquarters in Alexandria, VA, is a different story.

No complaints.my typical day consist of arriving 10 minutes early,then receiving part in from delivery that day and storeing them away,also consoladate and filling pick orders for the next day.Benefits are not so great, but the pay is decent.

136,Research Scientist,BAE Systems,3.9,1700.0,"BAE continues to be out of touch. Instead of being cutting-edge the motto seems to be just ""cut"". Management constantly changes incorporating their own vision without regard to the impact of employees. The job market is difficult, but this company's mentality has declined dramatically over the years. Do not expect a long-term career unless you are upper management. The most enjoyable part of the job are the co-workers. Great team-spirit and a willingness to work hard and do their part. However, this is sometimes strained because of constant layoffs and fear of job security.I worked for BAE for many years. The job was fun and rewarding, because we are helping our military. A good feeling of teamwork, but... the management was terrible at this plant. Laborers were treated as such while other parts of the facilities work sectors and management were treated with respect. Upper management was useless. Benefits used to be good, but they are continually taking them slowly away. And yes, if the plant closes sure to weather or breakdown, you must use your PTO to get paid. I just heard that since I've left, they've now decreased PTO from long term employees to what you would earn at 5 yrs. service.BAE is a decent company to work for, however, it is easy to be capped at your current location.  Room for advancement unless you are an FLDP (future leader development program for those directly out of school) advancement is stifled before the management level.  Employees at my site are placed on a high potential list which means nothing as being on that list doesn't mean you will be presented with any additional opportunities or benefits just given more work when the company lets someone go or has a special project.  I think the company is a good company and I have been able to build my skills but there is no clear path to the next level.  There still seems to be a culture of rewarding those who are not the best workers but instead have been fortunate enough to advance to the next level and find some up and comer who can do their work for them.  I would recommend the company for those coming out of school and looking to build their career and gain experience.If you have never worked in Defense, you may find the work culture and environment very frustrating. You will find that the management is preoccupied with low level book keeping (ensuring task codes are opened / closed on time, making sure that hours are used up before the task code expires) instead of ensuring work is being completed in an efficient manner, providing technical leadership / vision, or communicating important changes to the team. You will find that there is an abundance of middle-management, many of whom do not have the leadership skills or technical competence to lead with any efficacy.On the other hand, if you are less concerned with progressing your career and are mainly looking for a stable place to work, where the pay is good, and the benefits (401k match, medical, vacation) are good, then this could be a match for you.normal contracting company. - average pay ( for the feild)- good benefits- competitive contracts- management is so so- work life balance depends on contractsI worked at the Land & Armaments group in Santa Clara, CA for 6 years.  Unfortunately, the location was closed and the capability moved to Michigan.  But while I was there it was a great place to work.  Healthy work environment - no good-ol-boy network, nepotism or discrimination - a truly enlightened management who treated people fairly and with genuine respect.  Good work/life balance, ethical business practices and friendly and supportive peers.The company is great to work for, but depending on your location, it could be better for the day to day.  There is a lot of favoritism in the Resource Center.While there are many opportunities for training in different areas, there is not a lot of room to move up.  It's very rare to receive a promotion.  Moving laterally is fully possible, however.The most enjoyable part of the job is the work is relatively easy, as long as you know everything about your job.  Training can be poor at times when there is a mass hire, as people tend to quit in groups.Heavy workload no real appreciation, except for a few. Management in T.A. are very non-people involved. Not a positive environment.What company did these jokers work for? Not one word about trading promotions for acsess to fallen women and then demoting and firing them when tired of them. Management enabled this culture.Management seems to range from inefficient to incompetent. Meetings are run so poorly that no minutes or action items result, therefore no one is held accountable for anything they say in a meeting, so managements response is to simply have another meeting, run the same way, with the same people.The place is staffed with people who have any type of military experience, relevant or not, even if they were fired from the military. No training at all, including where to go to log hours!The ""rules"" are written clearly but treated as if they are subjective so it's hard to say when they apply or when they will be enforced.Management is the worst from Executive level to middle management, my boss boss was a micro-manager and wanted to control everything though she was not qualified; they treat their employees poorly with the exception of Executive management and those who favorites.Read specifications on each item of each project.Learned to coordinate with customers and personnels of the ship and shipyard crew to better run the job.Management were supportive with planning and coordination of the project.Co-workers were fun to work with and dependable.Hardest part of the job was the commute.Most enjoyable part of the job is knowing the accomplishments were met every after project is over.Hot, Dirty, Best describes most days, But thats life in a shipyard.Like most companies now they push this culture of respect and safety, But only when its convenient for them. I did learn many things here, co workers were all right. In the time I have been here there have been 4 big shifts in upper management, But things would get a little better then back to the BS, Direct supervisors range from great to terrible. When things are slow they can be 30 hour week slow, to two days off a month fast at the drop off a hat, and you never know till Thursday so not really a family friendly job.regulars laid off and replaced with contractors.  yard management is severely deficient. craft management, in some crafts, is self serving. many supervisors lack proper knowledge of procedure or how to lead. it was a decent place to work about 5 years ago but now i'd advise anyone looking for career to look past BAE.It has been a very disappointed experience to work with BAE. There is a contract work system where the employee has work to do if there is a contract. If there is not contract, the employee is sent home using the PTO or without salary, until any contract is open and accepted and , then they will call you to work. I had to beg for work in other dependencies. But it is too much pressure trying to justify your production hour for hour in projects all the time.Besides that, it looks there is not evaluation of the managers or superiors: they don't' analyze that situation and allow people without manners to be who is your boss.I am looking for a job desperately.......I had been with this company for 5 months and I only worked 2. I am really afraid they can laid me off at any time. It is impossible working under that situation.Software coding on a long term project for the Court system Good Management Had Great Benefits Learned a lot of Computer Technology from UNIX to Windows and Networking protocolsGood benefits, work / life balance. professional co-workers and management team.  Overall an enjoyable experience and for a large company, it has been a good place to workVery poor communication within management.  No change management processes.Semi flexible hours.No unusual benefits.  Below par with comparable companies.Salaries are below comparable companies.This is a very difficult company to work for.  I gave many unrewarding years to this company and never felt satisfied or appreciated for the job I did.More people, ideas and obstacles are put in place here for you to do your daily job that any place I have worked before.  Asked to be a forward thinker but you are always placed in a box.  Told to think outside the box but when you do you get slapped on the wrist.  The management plays favorites and there's a hierarchy to who is next in line for promotions so no need to keep the resume up to date other than to get out.Management and co-workers welcome new hires. All were very helpful while learning the BAE processes and procedures. BAE uses the 9/80 work week which is very useful for work/life balance. Would recommend BAE Systems to anyone.","10,000+",Washington,Arlington,VA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/research-scientist-job-arlington-va-us-176779653.aspx?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Lots of data mismanagement, and clients whom were not happy with the management of the clinical trail data. After an intense 2 weeks at the company, the CEO at the time and the Client were very pleased with the expediency in which we resolved the issues. I went full time after 5 months at the company, something I was working hard towards.As the company PHT began to rise from the issues of 2012 , so did my responsibilities. I became more knowledgeable in clinical trial matters. Not just the management of data, but the development process of the studies prior to being active. I was continually in demand by our international project teams, for the work I was putting out. It became more challenging as the years progressed, but I dived into every situation open minded. I made myself available for my colleagues from Project teams to Support staff. I guided Junior team members in the Data Quality Specialist department, in the understanding of studies and their approach to cases and task management.When the PHT merged with ERT, I felt as if things in the company changed, not all for the good. Staff were leaving at a enormous rate prior to the merger, review process was completely changed, with no opportunity for a one on one with my manager. The environment did not feel the same to me any longer; I hardly worked  more... with my immediate team members, communications seemed to have been less through phone calls and more through massive email chains(which caused confusion for many team members), and my growth and progression in the company felt stunted.  lessA typical day is touching base with an employee that I am responsible for in regards to his training.  We interact with one another throughout the day and work well together to make sure all deliverables for the quality team is in order.  As a Quality Assurance Auditor I have learned allot about how very important it is to maintain certain standard operating procedures and for each and every person within the organization to abide by them.  If these SOPs are not followed the productivity and effectiveness to to our tasks on a day to day basis may be at risk.  The outcome, may even affect the client in some cases and this is something we strive to avoid.  The hardest part of the job, is actually trying to explain that individuals cannot and should not deviate from their own written processes.  The enjoyable part of the job is making the end result, making the clients happy as well as knowing the tasks assigned was done accurately without any risks along the way.ERT is passionate and committed about transforming the way you conduct the drug development and healthcare efforts. Understanding that you need the most accurate, cost-effective and convenient support systems to collect timely, regulatory-compliant data. You expect unparalleled service, proven process and leading technology managed by professionals, ensuring our pledge to you of “getting it done right.”Wish they didnt take work from home away. I was more productive in a more closed environment. Also shouldnt have sole to third party company.It is a very responsive company and their HR/admins sincerely serves their employees with in the boundaries of the resources made available to them. They have a very flexible training program. What more can an employee ask for!The job was a regular job, but the employees made it fun to work there.

140,Senior Advanced Analytic Applications Engineer,General Dynamics Mission Systems,3.6,156.0,"Learned a lot while employed with GDMS. Was able to cross train in all departments. No room for advancement At this time in a different department that I haven't already worked in.Management only looks out for itselfOpen door policy does not workPay is goodBenefits are fairExpense reports get processed quicklySuccessfully ignores all of Colin Powell Leadership GuidanceThis company is ok if you are starting out in the workforce. Definitely not a place to be at if you're seeking growth in logistics. I've been with this company for over 5 years and can't to leaveDaily work is good with some long hours as working with the government brings unexpected periods of added work loads. Company is going through a rough period where many employees are leaving due to economic turbulence.If you are a hard worker, looking for challenges, growth and working in a team environment then this is a good place to work. If you like working on projects that build systems to help protect our troops, our country and our way of life then you can't help but want to work here.Flexible work schedule, very supportive of military life, always engaged in some type of project and you are able to chose your career path.Employees are very passionate about their jobs! They develop excellent product for the government systems part of GD. I worked for this company when they were also part of GTE.In the beginning, this was a great place to work. Personal growth and advancement were encouraged. Pay was a little lower than the competition, but security was better than the competition, so it worked out. Today, pay is still a little low, and there have been several cuts in the benefits. Work hours vary greatly from position to position. I honestly enjoy my job, but work hours as a salaried employee can be ridiculous. Middle management seems to normally care about what is happening with the employee and will help you to grow. Senior management within Mission Systems varies, but is usually appears to understand the project and includes several technical people. It will be interesting to see how the upcoming election changes the workplace. Overall, I still recommend this company as a workplace.Great management and benefits. Flexible work hours, tough objectives and talented personnel made the job an amazing experience.Good work environment at this location, which is one of the smaller GDMS locations. Management is fine. Had a good boss and peers.General Dynamics is like any other major defense contractor when it comes to employees and cutting the profits. Employees rank last middle management a little higher and Corporate taking the biggest cut of the pie. GD was the first large defense contractor that I worked for and in order to substantiate their bloated corporate profit the employees were offered expensive substandard insurance options. The stress to produce was constantly in motion and the stress level was out of this world. I saw literally a 100 percent turn over in the year that I worked for them. Prior to being laid off the stress got so bad that I came within an inch of walking away and forgetting that I ever worked for them. If the employee didn't kiss butt to the customer they were gone in a heartbeat.Great place to work, challenging environment to learn and grow.  Flexible work schedule.  Good pay and benefits.  Great people to work with.The company went down hill much in five years. Management likes to pretend that they are still in the military, ignore rules, lie to workers, hire friends, blame others for bad decisions.Many middle age workers have a GD pension, a military pension, a 401k and soon will draw Social Security, and often like to talk about how much they have saved and the great plans they have. The younger workers get a 401k and have to listen to how much better the others have it, and have to accept that they will not be able to afford to retire.We would arrive and open the site, Do preventative maintenance on the vehicles. Get any failed items repaired or replaced from our parts warehouse. shipped bad parts to vendors received parts from vendors. Inventoried and store all equipment and tracked all repairs. compiled spread sheets of repaired items for upper management. when we are all finished we lay out all of the equipment for the military to inventory and sign for the vehicle. The hardest part of the job is having a inventory in excess of 100 million dollars for a standard time frame of 5 months. The most enjoyable part is finishing with no lose of equipment.Typical government contractor environment. Beige walls and linoleum floors. Minimal training budget, essentials only, plenty of politics and constant reorganizations.I learned a lot about working with challenging customers and co-workers.  I had a nice high-walled office with a door.  An ergonomic review was needed and the company provided the recommended accommodations.My direct manager was excellent. I was highly complimented for my accomplishments while there and repairing equipment he hadn't been able to find someone to properly repair previously. The shift was nice, early morning to about 3:30pm, and I had every other Friday off.My Co-workers were good, but not the best or friendliest I've worked with. But there are some bruised ego's everywhere you go when you have high capabilities.The hardest part of the job was that I was on my own to study schematics and learn the fix the radio sets I was responsible for on my own. The pay was also sub-par for what they asked of you.The schedule and being so close to my home was the most enjoyable part, and the fact my boss was actually my neighbor. It was very hard on him when he couldn't get a job req. opened prior to my contract running out, and I know it cost the department terribly when the bean counters cut the contractors.There is little to no advancement in the organization as a whole. It is a toxic environment filled with cronyism and backstabbing. You will not acquire any skills and there is no training in most areas. The engineers are good people and very talented, but the managers will keep them down because they feel threatened.The engineering staff and the technical know how made General Dynamics (once Motorola) a leader in the communications industry. Due to the current management style annual earnings has become more important than customer satisfaction. On the positive side there is a lot of diversity in individual assignments. Co-workers are friendly and get together outside of work often.Old Fashioned work environment chaotic mix of managementconstantly in flux.Flexible Hours.unvoiced expectations.Poor management to employee communication (they are slowly getting better)The company is well positioned to continue growing but severely lacks a kind of company culture that makes people excited to work there. It's a comfortable job but promotions come slowly and the work gets boring very quickly.","5,001 to 10,000",Washington,Oakton,VA,2016-11-30T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/senior-advanced-analytic-applications-engineer-job-oakton-va-us-176893485.aspx?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=5,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I learned that communication is key to be productive.  Worked closely with the Office Manager and the President of the company (the only 2 in the office).  The hardest part is communication between our office and our other US office in NC.  The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with people and being able to work independently.I enjoyed working for Coupons.com as a contract Copywriter. I learned a lot through this position that will help me in future roles.

143,Data Scientist,Amazon Corporate LLC,3.7,10100.0,"Amazon is a fast-paced, exciting place to work. I highly recommend anyone to apply. Management was strong and colleagues were great.A typical day at work here is always crazy because they set new rules everyday. I have learned to just suck it up and go with what ever come my way for that day. Management has no clue of whats going on. they are some good and some bad coworkers as every job is going to have. But I'm a people person anyway so I'm not really bothered by anyone. The hardest part of my job is having no good direction and no routine at all, everything is so disorganized. The most enjoyable part is only when i get the opportunity to learn new things,One of the worst places I ever worked. I hate how they treat their employees like a number, HR is the worst ever!! There is really no structure, rules changes everyday, to many kids. Coworkers are awesome, the managers, ops managers don't have degrees in their positions. Managers have to many favorites. You really have to kiss butt to move anywhere or try to learn new positions. This place is nothing but about NUMBERS....Could be so much better, if only they cared about their employees.Amazon is a great company to work for.  If you enjoy working in a fast paced environment without supervision; this is the company for you.  It is a good company. They give great incentives, especially; during the holiday.  They practice good safety standards for a warehouse. The best thus far. State of the Art facility and equipment. The company is growing and expanding more and more. An excellent opportunity to learn more about the fulfillment industry.Amazon is a job with great positives that rope you in. They have awesome pay, with minimal requirements. As well as immediate benefits and plenty of overtime. Which is perfect for seasonal workers. But when you are looking to advance you realize the dirty game Amazon plays. Incentives and bonuses are not give, after working so hard to be earned. The stress, from the condition of the environment you work in, combats the mental/physical stress of doing the work at benchmark. There is absolutely no kind of job security. The job just take more from you then you'll ever recieve.Everything about this place reminds of prison, from the orange vest they make you wear, to the safety line you have to walk in, to the constantly working on your feet. Your not being paid to think just work. Supervisors always on your back, similar to a Corrections Officer. Your hard work gets unnoticed so don't try and give 110%, try 65% instead. Work is extremely easy but boring. It's hard to get fired, you pretty much fire yourself by constantly being late or not showing up for workI enjoy my position.  Fun working atmosphere with great Supervisors.  Great benefits.  Hands on supervision.  My typical day at work begins with a stand up procedure to receive all updated announcements.  Work starts out with clocking in to your computer and getting the products ready to Prep...e.g., bagging, taping, bubble wrap, etc.Hardest part of the job is standing on your feet for 10 or 11 hours a shift.Most enjoyable is sitting down at break and lunch.  Resting your feet as much as possible.  Sharing important information with each co-worker to be sure the job process is successful.I wanted to make permanent but has worked there during peak season. It seems like management should know a good worker to refer. i enjoyed working on the dock and even got told by the supervisors that they like my work ethics at work .hardest part was lifting things too heavy or finding out who pulled the e brake to rest the whole conveyor belt for the dockI enjoyed working with my co workers who were willing to work with you and the bosses loved that i would always be willing to help and to learn new work task.A typical day at work would consist of safety checks, start meetings about company numbers and progress. I've learned how to work in a fasted pace production environment, I learned data entry skills,shipping and receiving skills and also I learned how to be proactive in going above and beyond (safely) the call of duty. I like the management because of their experience to teach and provide incite. The hardest part of a job for me was being in an environment where I'm not able to grow. The most enjoyable part of a job would be the people that I worked with which made the time go by fast.Amazon is a very cultural  work place its fun to meet different employees from all over the world. Management and everything about the place is very organized very well.In order to work at amazon you have to be able to work hard and work long shifts daily. The hardest part of the job is the parking lot having patience with the long traffic that comes with working at a very large building. I've learned how to stay focus for a long period of time, how to talk to be people who knows little English, how to act under pressure, and how to be a hard working employee.Loved, loved loved my job at Amazon and was more than thrilled to go in. However the men working there are all a bunch of horndogs without a clue. They dont mind to do as they please and grope you at any given point. Management never done a thing to help. Other than the pig like men, its extremely enjoyable, fast paced and a very friendly/diverse environment. Plus SO many benefits and great time off plan!I believe that if they took control of bad situations that they would be able to have a lower turn over rate. In a typical day they would make you go over the same thing over and over and it was incredibly tedious. I felt that if they put people in certain jobs and considered their abilities and put them in functions that would work better for them, they would have a better work atmosphere.There is absolutely no supervision. They can't keep employees because their rate is too low, the main reason being that employees are too busy socializing and flirting with each other to care. Employees are having ""relations"" in their cars, married and single alike. Safety is also not a concern. There is a lot of horseplay going on. Employees locking wheels on a co-workers cart, taping up the wheels, sticking their feet under a passing coworkers cart's wheels, etc. The employees don't go to work to perform their duties, they go for other reasons. Some employees don't care about the work as much as the at work social life they have, and as a result, merchindise gets damaged.•	Working on Software Development in Digital Software and Video Games Platform.•	Created Auditing System which is a real time expert system implementing business rules. It was required for predictive maintenance and process validation.•	Created a Rules Engine to fire and execute rules and perform required fixations as predictive maintenance.•	Designed the application on Service Oriented Architecture, created services and used Guice Dependency Injection for the faster instantiation and execution of services.Amazon can be a great place to work, they are understanding if you have a family to care for. They do many events for the employees to make things fun,but if you are a seasonal employee your chances of being hired on permanently can be very slim. with the good , and the bad it's still a good place to work.U can work really hard for this company and if u mess up just a lil they we let u go really fast, they say they care about u but they really don't.  all they care about is numbers not the people who works hard. ask anybody there about break time, u only get really is a 9-10 min. break for a 10-11 hr days they r crazy. it takes u 2-3 walk to the break room and 2-3 walk back  u do the math.  to many managers telling u what to do. These workers need to get paid more at Amazon.!!!  Walmart's warehouse get's better pay, lot's of people here left Amazon to Walmart  to better them self. U go to work each day thinking em i getting fired today, not funThere's very little work life balance for most people who want to move up, and the managers are constantly changed around between buildings and departments. In order to move up there's a huge barrier to entry level advancement as Amazon needs base labor, so the majority of folks who start at T1 end at T1. That said, there's a lot of opportunity to grow within your area, and if you're seen as a leader you can become an Ambassador.It was a decent place to work for. Working there is good way to lose weight. The amount of work they expect you to do vs the amount of pay they give you isn't totally worth it. They give you a monthly bonus based on the whole builds productivity instead of your own personal productivity which is not right in my opinion. If you place 2 pieces of product into a wrong bin out of 5,000 plus you do a day they will give you a big lecture on how you are doing a bad job and need to do better or you will get a write up.Don't treat British people nice , rude,nasty attitude have no respect when it comes to their employees where I suffered from anxiety and it isn't a nice place to work where they were pressuring people to keep to speed with targets and productivity which is a form of bullying and punishing the sick people too money too badWarn people who to apply for this could happen to yourselvesGreat benefits after 1 year mark , manangent needs a little work.very fast pace and they don't have any problem getting rid of you , your always walking on egg shells , you only have a certain amount of time you can take off, you get personal like 40hrs (4 days) ,80 (8 days) and vacation accruing 1.35 days every 2 weeks for a year(32 hrs)-3 days and 2hours mandatory OT could be called 12hrs before a shift suddenly usually 4 day shifts on 5 with overtime .I learned how to operate the reach truck, PR, PC, clamp and tugger after over a year of employment although I requested it constantly.  They constantly move you around to other departments that you are not very good in instead of cross training other employees so that there is a rotation instead of the same people always being sent elsewhere.  Favoritism was a major problem there.","10,000+",Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-11-01T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/data-scientist-job-seattle-wa-us-175194584.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Also you should be prepared for no clear direction from management, and ineffective training/tools to do the job.  Every decision made is for the company to save money at expense of employees, Job responsibilities are piled on with ineffective compensation. Very little in terms of recognition. Policies not clearly defined.   PTO accrues but if you are let go it isn't paid out.  Hides behind being a ""start-up"" business.  Management lacks clear direction.

I am knowledgeable in all areas of the warehouse, so I go where I am needed.  I train new employees, to go and research items from vendors who send us items that need to be verified, ex. match the picture, and are what they say they are.Everyone at Zulily was very pleasant and willing to help. Everyone worked together as a team to resolve any unsolved answers or concerns. As a International Support Specialist, I assist international  customers with placing, tracking, returning or canceling orders. The goal is to do whatever makes its right for the customer, allowing flexible resolutions.The company is good in general but one can easily observe poor management and coordination. In most cases they are task oriented with little or no concern for the general safety and choices of the workers.Fun place to work but it takes alot out of a person. They take care of the employees and it's a very fun job if you can handle it. Peak will be fun. Good company.I have a chance to help customers all over the world. I have learned an appreciation for retail, sales, postal service and working hard as a team. The hardest part of the job was which of the many offers to give. The most enjoyable part was knowing that I could help and think outside of the box to give the customer great service.Receiving, picking/packing, and shipping. zulily is a retailer obsessed with bringing moms special finds every day—all at incredible prices. zulily is fast-paced, data-driven and down to earth company with unique and challenging tech problems to solveI see Zulily like a baby Amazon.Because it is a baby Amazon for babies, kids, and moms. But now its becoming more and more a bit of everything anyway, I say its good to start off because they will hire almost anyone but also fire almost anyone too. If you work hard you will get far, and if you do poor than you won't have much luck. This was my first warehouse job and I got to know all the stations and all functions really got to know how well a warehouse really works. Management was a problem, there was lack of communication and we would in trouble for things one manager told us to do while the other manager didn't want us to do that certain task. It was odd sometimes but overall a warehouse is a warehouse. And I made good money.zulily is a growing company with strong leadership truly focused on doing what is right for the customers and employees.  It is a fast paced environment and can sometimes be challenging to keep up with.  But they have a strong belief that we learn best through our mistakes and encourage you to take chances.A typical day at work:+ Inventory of product+ Occasionally putting product in their proper locations What I have learned:+ Learned how to work with ipods and Honeywells+ Learned how to pick and pack, receive product, inventory, auditing, stocking product, sorting productMy co-workers:+ Morale among workers very low+ Can be a hostile work environmentThe hardest part of the job:+ Rules constantly changing+ Poor communication between management and workers+ Lack of accountability+ Opportunity for advancement poorThe most enjoyable part of the job:+ The work itself is not hardGreat Place to work in the Columbus, Ohio area.  I have been here and have seen many great things happen at this growing company.  Looking forward to many more things happening in the positive direction.Great people, great environment. management was soo helpful with anything you brought their way. great schedule.very user friendly website and take charge managementLots of opportunity and innovative solutions happening here! Great first position that will help advance anyone in their early careers.","1,001 to 5,000",Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-11-29T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/senior-data-scientist-job-seattle-wa-us-175321859.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

149,Data Scientist - Metals & Mining,McKinsey & Company,4.3,173.0,"*Smart, hard-working people everywhere you look*Management invests in helping individuals develop professionally*Collaborative, supportive environment (if occasionally stressful)*Fantastic topics that matterFun environment where employees become a close knit community and become life long friends.  Employees are highly intelligent and have rock solid values.  The benefits are incredible, and work/life balance is a priority.  The only drawback is that there isn't any growth opportunity for the support staff.  As a non-hierarchical company, employees are all equal, so promotions do not exist.  Unfortunately, the job responsibilities never change, which can eventually create boredom in this position even though the position is very fast paced with a heavy workload.I have enjoyed working for this company and have gained a lot of experience in accounting, finance, HR, and office management. However, the opportunity to expand and grow in the finance field is rather limited and doesn't fully align with my ultimate career goals.Most management that work under Procurement- GPG- do not have experience in procurement. They are only there because they know someone higher up. It's a great company if you work on the consulting side and starting at the bottom will not get you there. They only hire consultants from top 10% in ivy league schools. If you work as an assistant in procurement, be careful who your managers are. Some will belittle you, yell at you in from of people over the most stupid thing and require you to take a test before being hired which doesn't apply to assistant work at all. Benefits are great if you are a full time employee and they won't let you take time off in the first year. Following year, approach with caution. This place is all about politics and favoritism. If you get on the wrong side of a manager, you won't get a promotion. They are experts are making you believe you will move up and when the time comes they will give you some excuse. They will try to give you the least amount of money and work you like a dog.Only good to put on resume because of the name.I need to put 150 characters here. It was a good experience and I learned a lot when working here. The culture and atmosphere simply fostered excellence.They really try to build you up and make you succeed in your time there, helping with advancement.They keep the kitchen fully stocked and have regular reviews to ensure the entire team understands where the projects stand and how to improve/lessons learned.Many e-mails.  Travel arrangements. Meeting scheduling.Learned to be extra pro-active.Management of support staff is fair.Great peers - always ready to help each other.Hardest part of job is constant change of schedules.Enjoyable part of job is figuring out complex travel arrangements and offering solutions.Exceptional workplace where you get to work with some really smart people. You get to do interesting work in a fast paced environment.  Limited advancement opportunities and professional development.McKinsey & Company is one of the top companies to work for but beware that this only applies if you have a career as a Consultant, Engagement manager, etc and working on the Client side.  However if you're working in Operations, Reconciliations, Card Service, Purchasing, Procurement... you won't have a life, you will be humiliated, yelled at and you will put in more than 50 hours a week. Yes you'll have great benefits and vacations but you'll work during your vacation or expect a call from your manager.  If you leave on vacation, you'll pay the price when you return.  It's a nightmare.  Some that have been there for several years, are use to this type of treatment and think this is normal. Leaving that place was the best thing I've done!!  The only positive thing was to have McKinsey in my resume which it landed me a great job with great people who actually treat me with respect. I want people to know so they won't go through the same nightmare I went through. If you land an interview, please ask the right questions, make sure this place is for you.  Ask the employees questions about their supervisor, manager, etc, ask them if there happy, ask about work & life balance. Think twice about it if you have a family and kids... because you won't be spending much time with them.Pros: fast learning curve; working with smart people; exposure to a variety of different topics/industries;good training programs and exit optionsCons: poor life balanceLarge variety of challenging clients & situations across the globe and incredible people to work with.  Plenty of opportunity and ability to forge your own path.A place where you can explore you area of interest. Good people. Daily you will learn new things . You can travel all around the Globe on various engagements.This company has many good qualities preferred skills and knowledge can be implemented in future job replacements to better advance your professional needs.Come in early and enter day in a very easy going environment. It was a lot of tedious work but it flew by and it was a great learning experienceSet up equipment for consultants. The processes of internal technology. Co-workers were self centered. Working around the strict budget placed on IT.People:-- Surrounded by some of the most talented, impact-driven people of any organization-- Contrary to most expectations, the people are interesting and interested, and much more interested in solving problems than career advancement or office politics.Lifestlye:-- Travel and hours can be challenging, but most of it is self-enforced. There is a tradeoff between location/lifestyle/sector for any project, and you can't always have all 3.Too many arrogant people... although others are very nice.Your life depends completely on your engagement manager. If you have a complete lunatic, your live will be terrible. Otherwise, you may be happy...Great place to work; very difficult business problems and high exposure to c-suite executivesOne of the best companies to start a career in but sustainable work life balance is difficult to achieve, especially as you take up senior rolesIncredible people, pay, training, benefits, and career opportunities during and post-.  Work/life balance has a lot of room for improvement.McKinsey provides excellent benefits and a bright, airy, warm work setting. Non-management salaries are minimal and advancement is extremely limited.","10,000+",Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-11-12T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/data-scientist-metals-mining-job-seattle-wa-us-175903633.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I worked with many good people during my career by continual downsizing has had impact on work environment.They treat you horrible and don't care what you have to say. They never see what good you are doing at your job, only what you're not doing. I couldn't work there anymore.I loved speaking with the various different people every day and the ability to help them. I loved the fast paced environment and co workers.  The hardest part was the mental fatigue of 4, 12 hour days.   LolAssisting customers with their technical support issuesLearning how to utilize the multiple computer screens daily Management team was okMy co workers were all over the place most of the timeHardest part was not being able to give the customer everything they wantThe employers were great created a very comfortable work environment, several incentive programs, and holidays were always fun, very casual, laid back place to work!I worked for Sprint under Xerox. Horrible, horrible horrible. They do not care about employees. Will fire you at the drop of a dime( highest turnover rate). When I resigned( was not fired), 2 months later they were closing the site. Didn't surprise me one bit.A typical work day is good. I learned how to give customers the satisfaction if they are irritated.My co-workers are helpful we all help each other and try too direct each other in the best direction.There really isn't a hard part on my job everything that I do, I try my best to make no mistake. If I make a mistake I learn from it and not dwell on it. Make sure it doesn't happen again.The most enjoyable part is De-escalating the caller on the other line.Xerox is a great place to work there are plenty of opportunities and advancement in the company . Definitely is a great place and has great balance between job and home lifeManagement is mismanaged, high turn overrate. High pace environment. But turn over rate is so high easy chance for advancement. Low pay rates for the amount of work that is asked of you.long hour that did not pay well enough for the amount of pressure that was put on me. the training did no adequately teach me how to perform well.Training is a pressurized joke and not complete.Will be thrown into cold water early stating ""need"" of people on the floor ... it's a ruse they do to everyone.Will not work with your scheduling needs and put pressure on your personal/family life for company purposes.Is willing to risk employee health & safety on the bad winter weather days in order to stay open!!!What enjoyed most was the flexibility in you schedule.  I was afforded the opportunity to work from home 2 days a week (Monday & Friday's, selected by the Director).I worked there for a year and a half very poor management You can ask a supervisor a question and they never know the answer. Stressful and drama environment all upper management talk about each other and complain about eacother to employees about work not getting done. They expect you to never ever  be a minute late ( like we can controle weather, highway crashes etc.) and never miss even if family emergencies.I would go in call center be sure all updates needed were posted and received calls to assist with Humana.  It was a different job culture for me I do not prefer working in call center environment.Let this be your last option/choice for a job. This job will leave you with no life, over worked and under paid. Management dont care about issues that may arrive in you life. You need to be at work when you are suppose to be there no matter what.Overall, Xerox is not a bad place to work. One of the biggest benefits is that you can work from home, saving a great deal of money on commuting, among other things. You also get paid-training, and get to be a part of a team generally filled with interesting individuals from all over the United States. Work is fast-paced, and there is never a dull moment.However, there are some glaring problems that stick out like a sore thumb:- Disconnect with management. From the upper management, down to our supervisors, down to our advisors, there is a terrible disconnect. Misinformation gets strewn around constantly, and at times it seems like our upper management team has no idea what actually goes on or how to fix certain problems (such as attendance).- Poor compensation. Base pay is excellent, starting around $10/hr, and you can qualify for RBC (results-based compensation). However, maintaining any significant level of RBC is nearly impossible, and how it works is not very apparent. Additionally, there are no raises for tenured employees. You could be there for 5 years, and still be making your starting pay.- Lack of opportunities for advancement. If you're looking for a place where you can grow as an individual, this may be the right job for you. But if you're looking for the opportunity to move up into a leadership position, this is not an excellent place to be. Lower performers tend to be promoted before the highest-performing employees, and its possible to have a top performer that's been there for 2 years still stuck in an advisor role while someone who has been  more... there for 3 months advances and moves up.  lessxerox has really good incentives and bonuses but if you have kids i wouldn't recommend it, the schedules are trash, the supervisors are lazy and the policies they have in place are a little to drastic. in training we were told the schedules go by attendance but that was a lie , i was there every day on time and still got a trashy schedule. i hated it there, and the distance i had to drive to get there was absolutely not worth it. if you do not have kids and your young i do suggest you apply because the money is the only thing good about the company, everything else,  i could honestly pass on.Company itself offers decent benefits. Hired us at a certain time as to not offer us holiday pay it was all a strategy they planned to hire tech support reps for the iPhone 7 release.I get to travel to different Xerox clients and work in a variety of industries at the client locations. I have also had permanent on site assignments.Attendance policy needs to be changed. Also needs to give further review to staffing as they are giving people days off for OT but not seeing shortagexerox is a great place to work. i enjoy everything about it from the actual facility itself. its beautiful not a uptight everybody stressed out environment like you would typically see in an corporate setting. even down to the management the supervisors and instructors are phenomenal.","10,000+",Seattle,Redmond,WA,2016-12-01T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/data-scientist-job-redmond-wa-us-176966814.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
