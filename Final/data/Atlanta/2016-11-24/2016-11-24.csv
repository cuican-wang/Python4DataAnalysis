23,4887.0,"Submission for the position: Principal Data Scientist - Atlanta, GA - (Job Number: 00328428)",Honeywell,3.9,3600.0,"overseen the field installers of water meters and electrical metersPerformed energy saving tests on homes. Wasn't a bad place to work. Just was funded by state contract and the contract ended and wasn't renewed.Honeywell forced employees to take 1-3 weeks off without pay, reduced pay and outsourced jobs to China, Mexico and India.  If you do something that your manager does not like, it is sure to go into your annual review.  If you do something that your manager likes, it may not show up in your annual review.Of course, the job conditions depend on where you work and the management culture. My department at Honeywell was chaotic because management changed so often. Layoffs always loomed. One was always under the gun and no one seemed to be happy.My typical work day consist of requesting quotes and placing orders.  In addition to regular duties, working on projects and continuously improve the work environment. I have been given the opportunity to learn and gain respect from my capability to learn quickly. I have strengthened my communication skills a great deal. As with any job, getting along with co-workers depends on you as a person and how to deal with certain situations. I get along with my co-workers here at Honeywell very well. As far as the difficulty of my job, I do not find it difficult. I do have a great boss that helps his team understand so we achieve things we want or need to learn. The most enjoyable part of my job is the flexibility and consideration of things that I may need to take care of away from work. As long as things are not continuous, they seem to work with you if something comes up.It is a large Company but keeps close contact with employees. Has been some issues with traveling. company truck taken away and ask to use person trans.Do not work here. They are cutting benefits, cutting vacation and holidays. They took away work from home. Do not consider this job unless you are really needy. There is no assigned seating and you will have no desk as it is open space. No privacy whatsoever. Go elsewhere as they are trying to force people out now.A typical day at work involve solving manufacturing problems and other processes. This site design and build unique RF components and antenna that does not allow for trial and error to solve production problems.I work 2nd shift and the people I work with are very easy to get along with. I really like the Supervisor but not a big fan of upper management. The site Supervisor is a good guy but corporate really keeps his hands tied. At least from what I've seen. I really like the work but a couple of times a year there is a big push. That can lead to a lot, sometimes mandatory overtime. Overall it is not a bad company to work for but don't expect a  lot of opportunity for advancement.I spent 18 years with Honeywell and was very happy with the knowledge given to me and the talent i gave back.  Management was the issue.  Their name was more important to themselves then the growth and employers in the company.Company is not doing well and employees are taking the brunt of it.  Pay reductions, bonus reduction, no merit increases, work from home eliminated, healthcare costs increased and so on while instituting furloughs with no change in expectations.A company that pays very fair their employees with very good compensation and benefits package. Health insurance, life insurance and good work-life balance.New CEO taking over.  Lots of organizational change took place prior to that and lot's of change continuing.  It was a good company in the early days of the Cote era. I wish them the best.set goals & able to express oneself through tasks & like to be able to be innovative be working with fellow employees with like mind sets. upwards & downwards feed bring both upper & lower managers together.Excellent opportunities for professional  growth. Telecommuting is allowed which allow you to provide an excellent service to your accounts.If you cannot say something nice, say nothing at all.  Lots of really good people that help and also are there to make things better.job was good while it lasted, company as a whole is a major international corporation.  that is hard to be in contact with, but the program worked on is greatGood environment to work and very good people to learn from. Management very professional and willing to train and listen and empower to get the job done. It's a nice place to work if you want to begin your career in the aerospace community.The work is interesting and usually fairly rewarding. The pay is pretty average but you're expected to put in more hours/more work and assume more responsibility than comparable positions at similar companies. The company is definitely driven from the top down with concerns for stock price and responsibility to shareholders and executive bonuses at the forefront.OK.  No issues... all good.   Great place to work on all shifts. It's a union house so... Don't know what to say other than this survey is getting on my nerves INDEED.Great Company to work for. Lots of talented people. You will learn lots of new thing with the technical diversity of this company. The only problem is the politics at this location are horrible. Employees seem to come to work in fear. Many of them seem frightened to speak or say hello. lots of rules and regulations, and you are under constant surveillance. Atmosphere is not very friendly.","10,000+",Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-11-24T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/853d71c5-284e-4df6-b96c-97d721107f69?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
