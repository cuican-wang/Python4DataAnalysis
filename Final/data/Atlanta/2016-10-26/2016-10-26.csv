31,4895.0,Data Scientist,IgnitionOne,3.4,9.0,"This is a tough one. They no longer sell the tech I was hired to sell (DMP). The other divisions are solid with good support. Again, my whole group has dissolved, so not much to review.Unfortunately, I was let go for punctuality, however, the individual in charge of monitoring my punctuality couldn't accurately do so as he was hardly there on time himself. Other than that the positive feedback I received from literally everyone else was very encouraging and allowed for a positive and productive work environment. I was able to have free reign in investigating and procuring new ways to save money for the company and my opinions and thoughts were valued. The atmosphere was bright and healthy.It was not a good work environment. About 16 of the people I used to work with have all moved on to other jobs because of the management or culture.This is a great company to work at for individuals who are fresh out of college as well as for individuals who are creative.This place has a great environment with food/drink perks all the time and great events, but it is a 6 day a week job on most cases and between the commute and long hours, it usually turns into a 14 hour day.The culture at IgnitionOne is very fun and filled with amazing, hard-working and intelligent people. Management is another story.As an Intern during the summer of 2015, I was able to experience and talk with each department of the company to gain useful insight on the future of the digital marketing industry.The people at IgnitionOne are very nice. They are like a big family. The environment is very comfortable and you won't feel pressure. It is a good place to improve your skills and personality. I LOVE that company.",,Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-10-26T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/a511caba-6735-447e-8c94-35c0f90e7ef1?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=20,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Safety has always been a priority for the company and the employees enjoy the work atmosphere.Good people working on combustion engineering.  The rubber applications area I worked on was considered mostly a commodity area so very little new product development.Working for this company provided the opportunity to advance as an Executive Assistant.
