39,4903.0,Data Scientist,Connolly,3.2,31.0,"I loved it there, but a severe lack in communication/understanding led to my termination. I would ask weekly how I was doing, and was told I was top tier, but at the same time, HR was being told my productivity was bottom tier.Definitely a great place to work, very team oriented with many opportunities for advancement. Hard work definitely pays off! Striving to look for concepts in order to find healthcare overpayments is one main goal of my team. Takes focus and diligence in order to achieve high results.Cotiviti is an amazing place to work no matter where you are in life - just out of college, or more settled down. On the job, you will learn every day as medical documents and rules are updated, systems are changed are for the better, and new insights are made.I've been with this company for 3 years and I really like it here. Yes, there have been a lot of changes but most have been positive. Flexible work schedules, good benefits and casual dress. The culture here is unlike other places I have worked. I also enjoy the people I work with.Very un organized the systems are very out dated and down most times. Management don't have a clue. Staff very immature and have horrible communication skills don't like to share information. Worse place to work. Very low salary and medical benefits very expensive. Not sure how this company still around. They're so focus on numbers and don't care about their employees. Very high turn over rate.I left two years ago - a happy day in my life.  If you were among ""the anointed"" by management, you'd do well.  Otherwise, the best you could hope for was to be ignored.Love the Flexible hours.  The pay could be better. Nice Culture. The dress is casual. There are activities that bring the people together.Days are very much the same. Time is flexible so long as you work 40 hours a week. Very intelligent managers and senior members. Great work environment that makes coming to work enjoyable. Would recommend to anyone pursuing a career in the healthcare industry.Do not work here. Terrible micro-management. Horrible benefits and hours.  All software is outdated. No money in IT infrastructure.A lot of promises made upon hiring that were simply untrue.  Majority of auditors have no actual healthcare experience and do not appreciate those who do. Very territorial over learning most senior auditors do not want others promoted and create a very hostile environment.great work place the collection manager is a little  on the unsavory side. But other than that its a great place to work. I would love to work in a different deptI started whenever I wanted, which was nice, as long as I worked and eight-hour day. MY co-workers were welcoming and friendly. I called insurance companies to confirm that they were still with their clients.The company appears to be unstable.  There is not room for advancement and the company does not honor it's long term employees.Smart, professional work environment. Wonderful group of people to work with.Recent acquisition and merger have created more of a 'corporate' feel. Very intense work environment. Be ready to give 110% every day. But, also very much a team environment.Work ethics have diminished. Pay has been cut in half. Poor management with no relatable job skills. Does not promote from within.Nice place - very disorganized as far as project planning and execution is concerned. Nice physical environment and good people.This company is now involved in multiple law suits because of its poorly run organization. The only benefit is the company paid well and was flexible which was great for anyone attending school.Laid back, yet productive.  Did your job, nobody bothers you.  They showed their appreciation for a job well done.  I would go back if they called me.I can't believe what a great family to work for. They reward, appreciate and are always in good moods. They CARE about people.Great company. Very unique industry but leaders in that segment.Connolly is a great opportunity for an individual that has not been in the healthcare field for a long time. Job is not challenging in the skill set that I have acquired.","1,001 to 5,000",Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-08-25T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/1eebecbf-40d4-40e4-a584-c5ea5a8b5eac?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
