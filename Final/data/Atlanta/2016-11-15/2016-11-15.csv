9,4873.0,Research Statistician,State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company,4.0,3500.0,"Worked their 10 years ago so my knowledge is outdated. However, while there it was a friendly work environment, the work quickly became repetitive so a love of insurance claims is essential.We were available to take client homeowner claims calls from allover the USA, to call out for quality first contact and verify the facts of loss, then move the claim forward in the best way. Every assignment presented learning opportunities. Management and co-workers are supportive and capable. The hardest part was denying coverage when it did not apply; The best part was helping people to understand and claim all of their available benefits.Loved it  I really didn't theyvtreated me like they should honestly just filling this because I guess I have too. Seems a bit much indeeda great place to work. it really is like working for a good neighbor. they really do listen to you and care what goes on in your life. the pay is great but they also make u enjoy your jobTypical work day as a field claims adjuster would to confirm your field appointments scheduled the previous day with policyholders. Inspect, estimate and settle claims with policyholders onsite if possible.  Review outstanding estimates that need to be revised and settled with insured, public adjusters or co-workers.  Management was very proactive in the development of the employee.  Co-workers were excellent.  Hardest part of the job was just traffic.  The most enjoyable part of the day is seeing the faces of policyholders when you able to ensure the policyholders that you are there to help and return them back to normal from a loss.Loved working for State Farm the staff and the way management conducted the work environment and privileges that were available to the staff.This particular State Farm Agency, the work environment is very tense and extremely competitive among the agents..creating a very hostile work environment.I worked at a local State Farm for a short time while in high school with marketing events, and as an assistant at their office. Duties included mailing out insurance quotes, scanning documents, and preparing gift bags for special events. Management was great and so were the hours!Management structure, knowledge of who really does the work needs improvement. Political correctness overshadows hard work and commitment to the Company.. The compensation, benefits and chances to learn are really good.I love not having weekends to work, but it can get confusing with all the information that is required to know for the job.The agents are cheap no benefits ,no sick time . No raises , it's a revolving door.  The only con is a work balance life. It's a revolving door for the company. The agents only care about themselvesGreat job , if youre looking to make great money in a nice environment this definetly the place to do it, I would love to go backJob Security can be an issue and they push sales very hard on their employees. Pay is another issue because compensation is at the low for what you sale on a daily basis.I already reviewed State Farm and Indeed is making me do it again. I only have 78 characters and need another 50 ish to get off this screen, gosh is this annoying.Life is too easy while working under Corporate, stay happy and no one bothers you. Just do what you do and life is great working at the corporate office.very good and challenging place to work,i found friendly good environment in the place i worked, enjoyed working thereAfter many years with State Farm, the changes in customer service, how the employees are treated, and managements lack of support is awful.  The customer is not treated as they should. Employees are micro-managed. Your work is never good enough.  Mandatory OT most of the time.  Unable to use vacation time as the dates are blacked out with no capacity to use your time.  Management is not there to support you and cannot be trusted.Its a shame that State Farm has turned into a call center in which number of phone calls is more important than taking the time to give the customer the best customer service.Working at State Farm I have learned so much about insurance and the importance of quality customer service. Managers are always ready to support employees and to assist them in growing in the company. I enjoy coming into work because I know what I am doing is making a difference with each customer I speak with.Amazing work environment, everyone was helpful and primarily focused on getting their work completed. Training was extremely helpful and there's no pressure if you accidentally make a mistake. I would work for them again, without hesitation!Short lunch breaks, not a lot of time to make doctors appointments or take care of personal errands. Didn't like counting deposit daily while others didn't do it.Every day what you do you know you will have an impact on peoples lives.  The work you do whether it is customer facing or not can have a positive impact and make a difference.  Most positions are well paid and the benefits are extremely competitive.  There is opportunity to move within the company depending on your work produced.","10,000+",Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-11-15T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/research-statistician-job-atlanta-ga-us-176092094.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
28,4892.0,Data Scientist  Full Time W2 Only Local to Atlanta,iSymmetry,3.0,2.0,"Was guaranteed job 400 miles from my home. Arrived the day before the promised job was to begin. It never began. Recruiter kept lying to me and kept demanding that I stay in that area with no salary and no expense money to pay the hotel bill (the hotel bill was to have been paid out of my salary but I could not earn anything as the job never began). After two weeks during which I caught the recruiter telling me 5 lies, I had to come home. I could not afford expenses of over $1000 with no assurance that the job was ever going to start.N/A I currently work here and it is a great company and enjoy at AT&T.
