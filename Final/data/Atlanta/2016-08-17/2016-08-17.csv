78,4942.0,Research Scientist,Intuitive Surgical,3.7,31.0,"Great company to work for if you are on day shift, by the time you are out it is still bright enough to enjoy the rest of your day. Ultimately, as long you have something to do on a daily basis you should be good to go. They have a low tolerance for being late, so assure you are well grounded with your work ethic. Free coffee in every corner of the building.Would recommend this company of many different levels. Job security, health benefits were above average, and company would show appreciation of it's employees with events and incentives.The company tends to overwork its employees, provides very little opportunity for promotion, misleads employees regarding job promotions, and the political management gets old working under.The work environment is driven hard by high demand of the product of a very fast growing company. The constant rush, demands, and near-emergency situations can be stressful if you don't enjoy that kind of pressure.Management practices are very well honed and modern, though advancement can be slow as new positions are often filled from outside the company. The company is full of highly dedicated, skilled, and hard working people generally providing a great work environment.The hardest part of the job is most likely the stress. It can be brutal at times.The most enjoyable part of the job is the people. Generally people that end up employed there want to be there and contribute and it makes for a great place to work, especially when the pressure is on.ISI pays well and offers attractive benefits, while producing a great product. The folks here are very accountable for their jobs and it's a fast-paced and fluid environment that always keeps the work interesting.The main weakness is that you can wind up in a bad group with a terrible manager... which when paired with the fast pace and high expectations, gets people to their pain thresh hold quickly. Despite the attractive pay and benefits, I haven't seen as many good employees running for the door when things go bad because it simply isn't worth putting up with the trouble anymore.indecent management could use replacement. long work hours but on the brighter side every 6 months you get evaluated for a raise.I love working for Intuitive Surgical!... and I don't want to leave, but on the same token, I miss being home & I miss being with my fur babies.Innovative company with great work life balance. Significant responsibilities given to junior employees makes Intuitive a great place to grow your career. Very laid back work environment.There really is not a typical day in the life of a da Vinci sales professional.  However, a day in the life of a sales manager could involve, a two to three day field ride with a rep, followed by conference calls and one:one performance calls with my team.  In the field ride day, starting off with a robotics committee meeting with the OR leadership and C-suite executives, discussing high level performance metrics and the strategy to guide improved economic and clinical outcomes.  Following, 3 cases with surgeons and staff at different points in the learning curve, using high direction, backed by clinical and technical expertise to, create successful outcomes not achievable with robotic technology.What I learned?  More than all of my work experience combined.  I learned to changing the standard of care requires building trust, delivering high value, create equal business stature with your customer base, be excellent in managing operations, highly clinical with the ability to sell in a compelling and provocative manner, be proactive in communication and leadership, and highly collaborative.  Collaborating with multiple internal sources even on a 5 minute call, can generate enough feedback to create the best plan to execute from.My peers and our leaders are the sharpest individuals in the medical device segment.  All driven to succeed while being accountable for helping everyone achieve success.The hardest part of the job is staying focused on the vital few action items that will create the desired results and any given stage of the selling process.  There are so many  more... things that we can act on, and picking the most important one that will compel behavior changing results.The most enjoyable part is leading my team and our customers to achieve results not thought possible.  Working with highly skilled and tenured clinical reps and finding a way to improve through every customer interaction is amazing.  Creating a collaborative work environment for our surgical customers to formulate higher efficiency in the OR, resulting in better patient care.  Coaching a surgeon to adopt a minimally invasive technique that will take a guaranteed open procedure and create a minimally invasive approach that will forever change the lives of the patients treated.  lessReceiving in defective materials from the field and working with OEM vendors to get these pieces of equipment repaired or replace to replenish inventory needs. The Inventory is for the Field Service Engineers that is our main priority to make sure they have the parts needed when visiting a site location.You may get what you want in pay but you will get twice the work. They ask people to work 10 hour days but really want you to work 12 hour days. Upper management is stiff and disconcerted form real people. The stock is no longer preforming as it did in its heyday but they still think they are at the top of the food chain. If you like to get chewed out in meetings this is the place for you.Hours are really long the management is good but they don't give opportunity for advancement. It can be stressful at times with lack of information to provide customers. Again expected hours during quarter end were 6 to 6I received some really great training here on lean mfg. 5S, commwip and they have a good quality management system  but my cell as they call the work groups had it own click and I didn't really fit in. Surprised that they did not find another job or cell for me to work in. I was never late and always did what they asked me to do. They wasted a weeks worth of training and I ended up at another company making more money. So glad I saved myself a years worth of time. I would go just for the training though. I think they really just hired me to get them through their quarter end but they were not honest about that from the get go.Everyday is never the same.  We are presented with challenges on meeting company and customer expectations.  This is to be expected in a fast paced environment.  Great place to work and grow.  Highly recommend.Very political and low pay, also they discourage overtime even after being told by recruiter that 10 percent of my pay would be overtime and was given a higher pay scenario.i work for this company about 2 years.i was assembler about 1 year and get promote to lead.i have learn form engineer and manager.my co-worker is fun, i just want all my guy do a good and quality job.my hard part is my guy is make to many mistake on the job.A positive work enviroment with friendly people. Heavy workload with a lot of pressure of building a quality product. Opportunity for promotions very limited1*	Provide customer service, training, and support of the Concur online booking and expense management reimbursement tool2*	Ensured compliance with policies by training employees on federal and company reporting requirements3*	Monitored key metrics for reporting expense processing goals, including resolving expense report aging4*	Produced Ad-hoc Concur and AMEX reporting5*	Conducted monthly compliance audits, working with AMEX and employees to reconcile Concur accountsLeadership is not there. You are expected to take on many task without direction. I learned so much about FDA standards and documentation. Management moves around so much. Co-workers are very tired and stressed. FDA requirements are constantly changing. The pay was very good.I have nothing good or bad to say about Intuitive can not comment due to legal issues and the agreement have signedThis was 1 of the best jobs i have ever worked for.i had a early shift when i worked there ,which was great.at this company it did not matter what,the job was,the job was done at ease with a steady work flow.also at break or lunch they have coach truck on wheels come to provide meals.",,Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-08-17T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/8c3aeea7-ce88-455e-96ec-b4285037e5c1?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
