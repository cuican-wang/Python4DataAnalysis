0,4864.0,Data Scientist,State Farm,4.0,3500.0,"Worked their 10 years ago so my knowledge is outdated. However, while there it was a friendly work environment, the work quickly became repetitive so a love of insurance claims is essential.We were available to take client homeowner claims calls from allover the USA, to call out for quality first contact and verify the facts of loss, then move the claim forward in the best way. Every assignment presented learning opportunities. Management and co-workers are supportive and capable. The hardest part was denying coverage when it did not apply; The best part was helping people to understand and claim all of their available benefits.Loved it  I really didn't theyvtreated me like they should honestly just filling this because I guess I have too. Seems a bit much indeeda great place to work. it really is like working for a good neighbor. they really do listen to you and care what goes on in your life. the pay is great but they also make u enjoy your jobTypical work day as a field claims adjuster would to confirm your field appointments scheduled the previous day with policyholders. Inspect, estimate and settle claims with policyholders onsite if possible.  Review outstanding estimates that need to be revised and settled with insured, public adjusters or co-workers.  Management was very proactive in the development of the employee.  Co-workers were excellent.  Hardest part of the job was just traffic.  The most enjoyable part of the day is seeing the faces of policyholders when you able to ensure the policyholders that you are there to help and return them back to normal from a loss.Loved working for State Farm the staff and the way management conducted the work environment and privileges that were available to the staff.This particular State Farm Agency, the work environment is very tense and extremely competitive among the agents..creating a very hostile work environment.I worked at a local State Farm for a short time while in high school with marketing events, and as an assistant at their office. Duties included mailing out insurance quotes, scanning documents, and preparing gift bags for special events. Management was great and so were the hours!Management structure, knowledge of who really does the work needs improvement. Political correctness overshadows hard work and commitment to the Company.. The compensation, benefits and chances to learn are really good.I love not having weekends to work, but it can get confusing with all the information that is required to know for the job.The agents are cheap no benefits ,no sick time . No raises , it's a revolving door.  The only con is a work balance life. It's a revolving door for the company. The agents only care about themselvesGreat job , if youre looking to make great money in a nice environment this definetly the place to do it, I would love to go backJob Security can be an issue and they push sales very hard on their employees. Pay is another issue because compensation is at the low for what you sale on a daily basis.I already reviewed State Farm and Indeed is making me do it again. I only have 78 characters and need another 50 ish to get off this screen, gosh is this annoying.Life is too easy while working under Corporate, stay happy and no one bothers you. Just do what you do and life is great working at the corporate office.very good and challenging place to work,i found friendly good environment in the place i worked, enjoyed working thereAfter many years with State Farm, the changes in customer service, how the employees are treated, and managements lack of support is awful.  The customer is not treated as they should. Employees are micro-managed. Your work is never good enough.  Mandatory OT most of the time.  Unable to use vacation time as the dates are blacked out with no capacity to use your time.  Management is not there to support you and cannot be trusted.Its a shame that State Farm has turned into a call center in which number of phone calls is more important than taking the time to give the customer the best customer service.Working at State Farm I have learned so much about insurance and the importance of quality customer service. Managers are always ready to support employees and to assist them in growing in the company. I enjoy coming into work because I know what I am doing is making a difference with each customer I speak with.Amazing work environment, everyone was helpful and primarily focused on getting their work completed. Training was extremely helpful and there's no pressure if you accidentally make a mistake. I would work for them again, without hesitation!Short lunch breaks, not a lot of time to make doctors appointments or take care of personal errands. Didn't like counting deposit daily while others didn't do it.Every day what you do you know you will have an impact on peoples lives.  The work you do whether it is customer facing or not can have a positive impact and make a difference.  Most positions are well paid and the benefits are extremely competitive.  There is opportunity to move within the company depending on your work produced.","10,000+",Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-11-30T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/data-scientist-job-atlanta-ga-us-176895906.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

3,4867.0,Data Scientist Internship (Spring 2017),Cox Automotive,3.3,47.0,"Management is the killer in this organization due their inability to recognize, compensate, empower, train and promote internal talent. There's no vision for the future and a huge issue with communication within the department. There's no career growth. Your coworkers are the most enjoyable part of coming to work daily.This company is a typical BIG business. Employees get treated horriblely. Training is a joke and communication is nonexistent. Fellow employees can treat you poorly,  harass you and completly get away with it. Management refuses to take care of their responalites or correct wrongful doings. This is the worst job I have ever had. People hazing me and being down right awful to my face is actually allowed here. You get benefits here. That's it. Manheim Phoenix is the worst company you can work for.The company benefits are good and after 13 years the pay is good.It is also close to home,and there are some good people that work there.I agree 100 percent with the other reviewers about NO advancement. You MUST brown nose or be friends or family of management to advance.I have learned a lot about the auto auction industry working there,such as structural damage to vehicles.Most of my co-workers are great to work with others do whatever they want and you will carry the extra load.My new manager brought his old employees with him and they get away with everything,being late,costing the company serious money,etc. The hardest part of the job is figuring out what the company wants because they will not communicate it to you.I worked here for 3+ years in management. Customer is always right. And I mean ALWAYS right. Steal? No problem. Attempt to defraud the company? No problem. Upper management has no spine and most of the managers couldn't flip burgers at McDonald's. But if you're in the clique you're good. Private pension is nice and benefits are good but don't expect fair treatment.I worked as a contractor but saw the benefits of the company and the culture.  Great company to work for - management was nice ;paid wellGreat company culture you really take pride in your job. Honestly nothing bad to say in my opinion. Anyone who is lucky enough to land a job here would be lucky.rough days working outdoors(cold,hot,wet).pay does not equal work for these conditions.poor management,people sent home when they are needed.most promotions given to kiss a**es.business seems to be ran by good ol boy network.This company brags on treating employees with the utmost respect, offering them the highest technical equipment and a wonderful work environment. While that may be true for some locations it certainly is not for Manheim Nashville. Technology can't keep up, management doesn't care about the attitude or professionalism they display or of the people it employs and acting inappropriate and talking filthy seems to be encouraged. There are good benefits here and that's about all I can say. They are great to the dealers, they truly produce, but they care nothing else about this company . Numbers are all that matters and if you're looking for a place where you can make a difference this is not the place for you!I think it's a good company to work for I do agree with some of the other reviews that advancement is based on brown-nosing and who you know not what you know and that's the sad part because it's not fair.Working for Xtime which is Cox Auto.Seems like a very nice place to be with and benefits are great.Managers are very nice to work for. Regular day hours Mon-Fri.Pay & compensation are good as well.I landed an opportunity with my dream company to work for after years of pursuing the chance.

Terrible management that allows supervisors to act in an abusive manner. High turnover in certain positions due this type of management.  Certain managers in this department have hired and fired mutliple employees in the Facilities Ops Specialist role, STAY AWAY.  Upper management and HR do nothing to stop this type of behavior.  Very unprofessional group of managers.  Worked there for 1 year and left because this department is a joke.Cox Automotive is a great place to work.  The staff is very helpful and professional as well as their Management who are always willing to come alongside and answer any questions you may have.The good ole boy attitude is alive and well at Cox. I wasted  years there and was bullied for the last four years.  If you steal, lie, and cheat you will do well or if you are a female and are willing to date the married customers.  HR is a joke and the managers have their jobs because of who they know and not what they know.great place to work.  great culture. work life balance. good leadership.  gym on campus.  coworkers are great.  work from home is available.It was an awesome place to work.  Loads of diversity and culture integration. Training is ""fly by the seat of your pants"". Co-workers are great individuals to work with.Great business to work for if you have a passion for cars  family oriented the owner work hands on they take pride in there business!Fast paced environment. Company vested in employee development. The company is well structured but lacks consistency. organization. The only consistency is constant change which creates uncertainty.I loved my 6 years with Cox Automotive - however after 6 years of hard work and going above and beyond, my department was eliminated.  Assistance in finding a new job did not pan out as several other people were displaced at the same time.Was hired about a month ago and they have done nothing but give me the run around,saying my background check still hasn't came back.It doesn't take a month for one to come back especially if you have a clean background!","10,000+",Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-12-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/b8b124a3-82f0-4b90-ac55-1bfdf59914ee?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

6,4870.0,GIS Analyst,Atkins North America,3.3,24.0,"All about the work. If you work yourself out of work you will not be paid for the extra time. The salary does not compare to other local companies.Lower levels, ok. UK management not interested or involved. Salary and benefits below industry standards. Shame it all went so wrongThis was my first job out of college. I enjoyed my coworkers a lot because we were all in the same age range. Unfortunately, there is almost no room for advancement in the company. Management is all over the place and don't know what they're doing. This job was just ok and the main plus for me were the great friends I made and the work/life balance.Treats employees like they are a contract shop but doesn't compensate appropriately.  It only takes a few weeks of a downturn for them to lay people off.  They are horrible at finding work. Everything needs to be approved by the management in the UK. If you are not from the UK, you cannot advance in this company. I will say the culture is great, and the people are nice, it's the structure and the upper level management that needs some work.Atkins is amazing company to work for. The environment there is a professional one and yet also is fun and fulfilling.My co-workers were always extremely helpful - providing training at any point that I may have needed it. This company is one to work for!!From the CEO to the seller-doers, Atkins prides itself on its global, diverse culture.  Flexible schedules are available to most and benefits are comparable with other firms in the industry.No job security, don't know if you will be laid off from day to day. No clear vision of new management. Decisions being made in a vacuum. Coworkers being laid off that are crucial to current projects. Severing business relationships that have been in place for 20 plus years.Do not come work hereTruly an awful place to be. Legacy PBS&J company was a wonderful employer until an incompetent CEO took over in 2005. Then a series of events rocked the company to its core: an embezzlement by the CFO and his direct reports, the indictment of two former company officers (minor, but still a PR problem), an FCPA investigation, the ousting of the company's chairman/CEO by employee shareholders, the sale of the company to a foreign owner. While the sale to Atkins was probably a good move, the subsequent replacement of a stablizing CEO with a cold, former military leader with a hierarchial organizational style was not. It's a culture of fear that now permeates down through the ranks of management. In a tough economy, employees are now hunkered down, hoping to hang on till retirement or waiting for other employement opportunities to come along. Insecurity prevails. Loyalty and hard work have nothing to do with whether you keep your job, rather it's who you're friends with. Innovation, once a hallmark of PBS&J, is a thing of the past. Good people have been leaving the company in droves -- either by their own choice or the choice of managers unclear about their direction. Sorry I waited so long to leave.I cannot speak to the current operations of Atkins North America after their acquisition of PBS&J. I was ""thanked"" for my 20+ years of service after the acquisition, and let go.I can say that as PBS&J, the Corporate leadership of this employee owned firm was very approachable, inclusive, and genuinely desired to perform the highest level of service for their clients. Retention of employees was high, and the pay scale was competitive.Great place to work with supportive management. The networking events on Wednesday and Thursdays are always great. That is all!!!!In a typical day at work I need to review every contract before an attorney. For the past three months I have been very involved in the implementation of a new electronic filing system for the company.The most enjoyable part of the job is my schedule. I work nine hours from M-T and 4 hours on Friday.An internationally owned company that came in and acquired a thriving business and proceeded to downsize and close multiple offices and service lines.I learned alot of skills while working and Atkins due to the awesome culture and tools available. Management was accessible and maintained an open-door policy. I loved working with so many talented people that offered kindness freely and respected each other.good employees good benefits managements was supportativeexcellent workplace, great management, hours, advancement opportunitiesA productive work place where professionals are always welcomed, have many opportunities to share their knowledge and experience and has an adequate amount of social exchanges.ATKINS is one of the world's leading design, engineering and project management consultancies.A typical work day consists of a variety of duties from writing agendas and inputting them into MUNI, putting together contracts and making sure all necessary legal documents have been executed, pay applications being entered into MIS, dealing with citizens and County staff as well as other contractors and sub-consultants. There are many critical dealines to be met, and to get items in to the Board of Directors in a timely manner and you have to stay focused and on task to get this done.It was a great learning experience in the 11 years that I worked since I was exposed to so many different clients with so many different needs and I was able to learn so much from the team that I worked with over the years. The most enjoyable was the variation and continuous challenges brought in by each project.Atkins allows employees to work flexible schedules and is pretty flexible with your time as long as you work your required hours.I had the unfortunate experience of working in the Atkins run traffic operations center in Raleigh NC. First and foremost, this job is always available for a reason. In their attempts to operate on a 24/7 basis - management often punishes one person to work third shift (10pm-6am) then come in at 2pm the same day and work second shift until 10pm that night. There is never any expectation for even a third of the center to work this ridiculous schedule, only one person gets punished this way from month to month. If you are asked to participate in their dispatch training, expect to be there 11 hours a day every Monday and Tuesday, wich consists of sitting in an insect infested room with one DOT rep, and the training coordinator who have you dispatch calls according to video replays, then talk trash to and about you throughout your employment about how you attempt to dispatch said calls. The coordinator who operates the training has less than two years of any sort of dispatch experience, and at best fakes it until he makes it, more time is spent talking trash often heard in high school locker rooms than doing anything job related. After less than two months expect to take an exam that determines your employment, again administered by the obviously drug dependant training coordinator. The largest part of the exam is to create a 45 mile detour listed on a map, and recreate 12 digital message signs about the extensive detour - something that may occur once every six months. While I was taking the exam, the training coordinator failed to give the first group the detour part of the test,  more... then to cover his failure, told coworkers that the people taking the test did not do that part of the exam - the fact that he never handed out that part of the test was never addressed. Also notice how the pay for this position went from $13/hr back to $14/hr financially Atkins traffic operations in NC is failing, so much so they had to cut hours in Greensboro to make payroll. Again this job is always open for a reason - wait tables before making the mistake of wasting your time for Atkins.  less",,Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/gis-analyst-job-atlanta-ga-us-176763800.aspx?mescoid=1500140001001&jobPosition=3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
7,4871.0,Senior Public Health Scientists - Senior Project Managers,ICF,3.4,237.0,"training provided was exceptional, some management very knowledgeable, environment clean and organized, some company morale, pay should increase for the jobWorking for this company one may feel like they are not part of the machine that keeps this company going. The culture within the company is ""do as you're told and do not go against the grain."" Entering work on a daily basis becomes a chore - basically coming to work to earn a paycheck and nothing more. Upper management consist of people who previously served in the military together and their attitude is to say ""yes"" to the site manager no matter what. Even though there is constant descension from the management team the workers on the floor make things better. There is no growth opportunity beyond team lead and unfortunately the pay has been cut drastically for any person the management team selects. If you are not a person to go with the flow and give a constant yes your time will be limited.Reading other reviews of this company indicate to me that it depends on what part of the country you work in as to whether it's a good place to work. In Martinsville, VA it was a rotten place to work. Management treated employees with very little respect, there were few advancement opportunities, and pay raises depended on who you knew and not what you knew. (it took me 4 1/2 years to get a pay raise of $1.00).You had to constantly be worried about being fired for insignificant reasons. It was a stressful place to work.There was a different set of rules and regulations for the Martinsville call center compared to the rest of the company. We got no holiday pay and only 1.54 hours of PTO time per month. Your schedule could be changed without notification or concern for how it might affect you. The work enviroment was decidedly hostile. Leaving this company was the best thing that could have happened to me.Have you seen Office Space? It's kind of like that. You better get your billable hours in, but not too many to the same charge code, or you'll be hearing from someone... During the 2013 Government Shutdown, they made their employees use vacation and unpaid leave if they couldn't find work (which was most of us). Pretty much sums it up. Basically, all they care about is how billable you are, so there's absolutely zero office culture (until happy hour when people would bond over how awful it was), and their year-end raises were laughable. DO NOT WORK HERE if you can help it.I began my career at ICF 5 years ago and was an employee referral.  The company has grown by about 1500 employees since I began and has still maintained a strong culture.  I was hired as a senior individual contributor and have been promoted several times in the last 5 years.I worked full time hours for several months and was never offered full time benefits such as health insurance. There is a huge lack of communication between management and employees. I witnessed managers and supervisors disrespect and talk down to their employees and nothing was done about it.The worst place to work for. They do not value there employees at all. The pay is horrible. The do not offer pay raises but give you new titles and expect for you to be content and do it for the low pay. The supervisors are horrible!! There was only one decent sup in there. They don't know what they are doing. When you ask questions they make stuff up and when you show them they are wrong they still expect you to listen and do what they say. They contradict there selves a lot. Very hostile work environment. No benefits of perks of working with them. They constantly put you down. You can be an excellent performer and they will look you in your face and say. Now you need to perform higher. They recently had / training classes of 12 ppl and out of those two training classes there is probably 4 ppl still employed. I've never worked in a office were everyone hates the job and the managers. They don't allow u to speak to fellow colleagues. If they see you are getting close they separate you. You are not allowed to talk. I honestly could keep going on but I would be here for days.I spent 15 years at ICF in total. I left and came back...and left again.  If you are willing to work hard, you produce great results, and you're willing to take some chances, you can go far here. I and many, many people I worked with, built careers here with a lot of advancement over time. I could name 20 people who started out near the bottom and worked their way up to VP. ICF is known for having really smart people, so there is stiff competition to get choice assignments and stand out in the crowd. Salary increases are not always large, but if you stay the course and continue to deliver, you'll get promoted and the money will eventually follow. Plus, there are several focus areas and a ton of projects, so if you don't ask permission too much and just take on as much as you can handle, you can learn a whole lot about your favorite subject and management in general.Working in the accounting department of ICF has been insanely awful. Management seemingly has no idea what they want and care very little for employees under Director level. They continue to lie and let employees go saying that they need to downsize for financial reasons and yet will create new Director positions shortly afterwards. There is no advancement at all. They would rather hire outside the company than promote the people within. Raises are horrible. Fear and intimidation are used to ""encourage"" employees to do their jobs and more by my current manager. Despite eight people leaving because of her, they continue to keep a no nothing manager on board who has no government contracting experience who has managed to overwhelm and anger everyone she encounters.My review is the same as my previous review of the company. Management staff is very non-supportive of lower level employees. There is no room for advancement unless close with upper management (based on friendships).Very low annual pay increases (on average 1.5%). Autonomous work culture. Only great situation if you are at Principal or VP level...everyone else do not get pay raises.This was one of the greatest experiences of my work life. The managers as well as the executives believe in hard work and celebrating the earned success of hard working team. I learned a lot of professional  work culture and how to effectively get things done without supervision but still meeting deadlines.ICF is an industry leader in consulting. ICF provides excellent employee benefits and exciting job opportunities. With offices all over the world, ICF positions itself to be a global leader in consulting.-Provide good training-Nice Supervisors-Nice work environment-Work  load balance is good-Not enough salary -You can ask for work from home after you complete one year at ICF        but you cannot ask for Monday and Friday-No more opportunities to move aheadICF recently went through a rebranding. Their staff is dedicated and hard working. People stay at ICF long term. I was part time and did not seek a full time opportunity there since the commute was too far for me.  I think the management is excellent. Unfortunately my boss was laid off and my position therefore was no longer needed. I enjoyed my time while I was there and think highly of the human resources staff.Senior management attention and leadership is outstanding.  Great benefits, co-workers, working environment.  Terrific opportunities to work on variety of projects and locations.Great place to work with good culture, smart people, strong passion. They also allow me to work from home. Unfortunately, they are too business-oriented and do not adequately support their staff with good benefits and salary increases.A typical day at work involved a good mix of project work and proposal development. I learned a great deal about consulting, project management, and the proposal process.Co-workers were great.Hardest part of the job was working remotely.Most enjoyable part of the job was traveling and working at a work site.This is by far the worst job I have ever had. Training is very poor and when they put you on the phone they change their mind about what you can and can't say every 10 minutes. There is absolutely no consistency and management refuses to help you. One manager spends her time taking personal calls while the other one guesses at the answers. None of the phone numbers they provide as resources work and they are always asking you to do more with no additional benefits. There are no other job titles which means no where to move up . Supervisors refuse to take escalated calls and gossip about employees to other employees. They can't even provide a clear answer about included benefits due to being over budget,most likely from the ridiculous turn over rate. No training class makes it more than a few days,and new class is taught weekly and each time only 2 out of 12 makes it for more than a week. Worst of all management stifles your personality, They claim it's too ""flamboyant"". They don't want you to know your fellow coworkers but expect you to tell them all of your business. You can't even use your cell phone in the break room. They make up reasons to fire people and never provide a legitimate reason. They even broke contract with the temp company that recruited for them without letting them know.Their goal for employees : have no personality and take as many calls as possible without offering real assistance to customers.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!ICF International provided an environment that promoted both professional and personal growth. Through ICF's mentor program, I was able to learn skills outside of my scope of work. This program was a major component in developing skills that resulted in promotions and pay increases.Awesome workplace. Great working. Company culture is good and people are flexible. Lot of work and good no. of hiring. Telecommuting is also there as an option.",,Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-11-17T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/senior-public-health-scientists-senior-project-managers-job-atlanta-ga-us-176292433.aspx?mescoid=1900254001001&jobPosition=3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

9,4873.0,Research Statistician,State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company,4.0,3500.0,"Worked their 10 years ago so my knowledge is outdated. However, while there it was a friendly work environment, the work quickly became repetitive so a love of insurance claims is essential.We were available to take client homeowner claims calls from allover the USA, to call out for quality first contact and verify the facts of loss, then move the claim forward in the best way. Every assignment presented learning opportunities. Management and co-workers are supportive and capable. The hardest part was denying coverage when it did not apply; The best part was helping people to understand and claim all of their available benefits.Loved it  I really didn't theyvtreated me like they should honestly just filling this because I guess I have too. Seems a bit much indeeda great place to work. it really is like working for a good neighbor. they really do listen to you and care what goes on in your life. the pay is great but they also make u enjoy your jobTypical work day as a field claims adjuster would to confirm your field appointments scheduled the previous day with policyholders. Inspect, estimate and settle claims with policyholders onsite if possible.  Review outstanding estimates that need to be revised and settled with insured, public adjusters or co-workers.  Management was very proactive in the development of the employee.  Co-workers were excellent.  Hardest part of the job was just traffic.  The most enjoyable part of the day is seeing the faces of policyholders when you able to ensure the policyholders that you are there to help and return them back to normal from a loss.Loved working for State Farm the staff and the way management conducted the work environment and privileges that were available to the staff.This particular State Farm Agency, the work environment is very tense and extremely competitive among the agents..creating a very hostile work environment.I worked at a local State Farm for a short time while in high school with marketing events, and as an assistant at their office. Duties included mailing out insurance quotes, scanning documents, and preparing gift bags for special events. Management was great and so were the hours!Management structure, knowledge of who really does the work needs improvement. Political correctness overshadows hard work and commitment to the Company.. The compensation, benefits and chances to learn are really good.I love not having weekends to work, but it can get confusing with all the information that is required to know for the job.The agents are cheap no benefits ,no sick time . No raises , it's a revolving door.  The only con is a work balance life. It's a revolving door for the company. The agents only care about themselvesGreat job , if youre looking to make great money in a nice environment this definetly the place to do it, I would love to go backJob Security can be an issue and they push sales very hard on their employees. Pay is another issue because compensation is at the low for what you sale on a daily basis.I already reviewed State Farm and Indeed is making me do it again. I only have 78 characters and need another 50 ish to get off this screen, gosh is this annoying.Life is too easy while working under Corporate, stay happy and no one bothers you. Just do what you do and life is great working at the corporate office.very good and challenging place to work,i found friendly good environment in the place i worked, enjoyed working thereAfter many years with State Farm, the changes in customer service, how the employees are treated, and managements lack of support is awful.  The customer is not treated as they should. Employees are micro-managed. Your work is never good enough.  Mandatory OT most of the time.  Unable to use vacation time as the dates are blacked out with no capacity to use your time.  Management is not there to support you and cannot be trusted.Its a shame that State Farm has turned into a call center in which number of phone calls is more important than taking the time to give the customer the best customer service.Working at State Farm I have learned so much about insurance and the importance of quality customer service. Managers are always ready to support employees and to assist them in growing in the company. I enjoy coming into work because I know what I am doing is making a difference with each customer I speak with.Amazing work environment, everyone was helpful and primarily focused on getting their work completed. Training was extremely helpful and there's no pressure if you accidentally make a mistake. I would work for them again, without hesitation!Short lunch breaks, not a lot of time to make doctors appointments or take care of personal errands. Didn't like counting deposit daily while others didn't do it.Every day what you do you know you will have an impact on peoples lives.  The work you do whether it is customer facing or not can have a positive impact and make a difference.  Most positions are well paid and the benefits are extremely competitive.  There is opportunity to move within the company depending on your work produced.","10,000+",Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-11-15T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/research-statistician-job-atlanta-ga-us-176092094.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I enjoyed having a stack of paperwork that needed done by the end of the day. When it was decided that another department would be merged with the one I worked in, there were too many people away from their desks not working than actually getting the work done.- pour training - rushed at learning - pour slow systems - pour management Pour communication especially with new employees Expecting them to know everything in three weeks I was hired on through a company agency, received no feedback on my progress I was doing my best to learn System navigation was a mess but took my time to learn My agency called me late evening informing me that the company has to let me go, the company didn't have the guts to say that to my face I could not go back the next day to retrieve my personal belongings, company assured me it takes time to learn everything not to rush myself take my time ask questions which I did but I never got the opportunity to prove myself to the company with their lies of training time would be 4 to 6Weeks.Assurant is a great company to work at. Focused on their employees and their development.Has an onsite day care and elementary school for employees kids only.Great Campus. Onsite Cafeteria is amazing.Normally people work there until retirement.This company has some great ideas and talented people, but seems to have trouble moving in a unified direction. Hopefully their reorganization in July 2016 will help them with this challenge.Assurant Health was an inspiring, and fun place to work that gave GREAT benefits. I learned patience working for Assurant. The management and co-worker staff were a great group of people, always helpful and reliable. The hardest part of the job was knowing that it was closing. the most enjoyable part of the job were the Employee Events.Loved the department activities, they allowed you to expand your network and learn about the company. Health insurance was expensive and not worth it since you have to meet all your deductibles first before it covered your claim.Loved working there, unfortunately company is closing for business. Wonderful employees, great management, great hours, benefits affordable, was planning on retiring with the company.When I started there the facility was owned by The Signal and it was an enjoyable place to work.  After The Signal was sold to Assurant the place changed.  Assurant has a good reputation for its various insurances businesses but does not seem to understand how a warehouse/manufacturing facility should operate.  Instead of advancing from within, the company started looking solely to outsiders to fill management ranks.Once you are acclimated with your workload they will send you home to work. I have learned a lot about mortgage insurance and why its needed.Ability to grow and challenge yourself.  Very family oriented and willing to work with you as needed.  Career advancement opportunity are numerous.  Co-workers are willing to assist when able.A typical day at work would be quite strenuous because of work overload, however, it is very easy to manage so as long as one is organized. I have learned numerous positions within this company of how to refurbish a electronic device, and this information is only attainable at a job experience such as this. Management, in my opinion, is poorly structured and should be more organized with each and every department of the facility. I do not believe in making acquaintances nor friends with my co-workers because I prefer a strict business setting, however, if confronted about a situation that pertains to the job itself I will address it properly. The hardest part of the job is most likely being underappreciated by knowledge. I feel, as an individual, that not only does this company respect my eagerness to become more of a beneficial employee, but also does not respect my well being. The most enjoyable part of the job though would be that I get to see new products on the market and refurbish them for many loyal and returning customers.A good place to work.  Unfortunately due to healthcare reform, we had to shut down.The remaining small group, has become a loyal close team.12 hour weekend joyed being busy, you could start at on position and by the end of your day be doing something else, management is excellent they tolerate no negativity nice place to work at.Assurant is a productive but a fun workplace filled with many employee engagement & activities. Its a great balance of work and life balance.A typical day is split between managing the day to day flow of the teams and problem solving new issues. We are in the process of implementing new formal processes in all areas. These require continual refinement. Each day presents learning opportunities in multiple ways. I strive to improve the effectiveness of my management technique with this new knowledge. My co-workers are hard working, dedicated professionals! The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the accomplishments achieved by the associates around me.The work atmosphere is very regimented. You take your breaks and lunch (30min) with everyone else at a set time. You have to remain quiet throughout the day, being social is not encouraged. However the latest pop hits are continually beamed from the loudspeakers, and although its not very loud, it is distracting to hear the same songs over and over again about once every hour. The training process consists of someone sitting over your shoulder watching you work ALL DAY, every day pointing out errors, which makes it harder to concentrate. This goes on for months. It's not at all a friendly environment, very strict with little to no interaction with coworkers. Most just stare at their screens with a scowl on their face most times anyway.Very happy with my overall experience. A good place to work with competitive benefits for employees. But as many companies are doing now a days always looking for ways to save and I was laid off from my position.On any given day you are constantly engaged with employees and customers. The company has done a good job of encouraging continued learning to diversify your skills while broadening your scope of work. Due to regulatory changes the Specialty Property division has undergone some shifts lately resulting in reductions in force. Senior leaders have really encouraged employees to understand a successful change model. There are some great individuals throughout the company.The hardest part of the job is to encourage peers, management, and direct reports during a visible shift and reduction in force. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping employees develop their skill set to better position them for future change.I would test the cellphones to ensure the phone would be operational  ensure the phones would take pictures and work properly for the customers.

Documentation, optimization, performance tuning, and critical success factor monitoring.Great company but is transitioning from a family run business to one run by non family who are incented to grow profit at all costs. While this is perfectly respectable it is causing difficulty for the lifers to adapt to and as a result cooperation within the parts of the organization is lacking.I enjoyed my time at Cox Enterprises. I got an opportunity to learn a new technology involving SaaS and be a part of the implementation team for Oracle Fusion Goals and Performance Management tool. The management is really great but it needs more skill to deal with immediate managers. On the whole a good experience.During holidays, the company lets all the employees go home early the day before a holiday. The company is all about family. They give plenty of vacation days and sick time. My co-workers and very intelligent and great to work with.I worked for Cox Enterprises for 10 years, I started out in the mail center and while in the mail center helped the facilities team as well. I whent full time with the facilities team in 2010. I was told several times b y my manager that I would be promoted and was passed up by employee's that I had trained. Those employee's were promoted because Cox Enterprises promotes diversity to look good in the eyes of all that view upon them. The company says one thing and does another. They cheat and lie to present a picture that is false.Coworkers, other staff, and executive team were all productive. This is a very established business and they treat staff very generously. It can be challenging at times however the overall benefits help.This is a fantastic company to work for, and, the atmosphere is laid back.The people you work with are great, and, not a lot of micromanaging at this level.I enjoyed working at Cox while learning new tasks daily.

Fun place to work a well thought out corporate environment. Benefits are excellent.Working through my daily pipeline keeping accounts updated, talking to customers (inbound calls) who want to work with us in bring account current or payoff.  Work projects that are offered by management dealing with accounts that may need to be charged off, re-evaluated for assistance to the consumer etc., talking with our attorneys, and answering emails, taking requests for reinstatement and payoff figures. I have learned time management, and the hardest part of my job would be not being able to assist someone who is really trying and they don't have the means to do so.the most enjoyable part is the people I work withIt was a enjoyable job at first but then became really stressful and impossible to meet goals. The role play was ridiculous with upper management, nothing was the right thing to say.Typical day of processing transactions and making deposits. I did learn a lot on the banker side of things which was a nice asset. But there is no room for advancement.Bank Teller/ Customer Service Representative, August 2003-September 2004Some of a bank teller's responsibilities include cashing checkAccepting deposits and loan paymentsProcessing withdrawalsSell savings bondsAccept payment for customers' utility bills and charge cardProcessing necessary paperwork for certificates of depositSelling travelers' checks Specialized in handling foreign currencies, or commercial or business accounts.SunTrust Bank allowed me to advance quickly due to my desire for learning the banking industry and work ethic. The majority of my managers were very understanding and trusted my abilities. Those attributes are what molded me into becoming a very thorough trainer and listening ear for my co-workers.Managerment wasn't fair or understanding. Human resource was for managers not for the employees. Lot of benfit was taken away. Co workers was good. You get blamed for mistakes that supervisors and managers didn't explain the process or produres correct. The most enjoyable part was meeting new friends.Definitely was a great place to get work experience and to understand corporate america, as they say. Helped me develop a certain level of professionalism that I do not take for granted.Good work environment, Good schedule, they really work with you schedule wise. Hardest part of the job was dealing with customers.Expect to work from sun up to sun down. Make sure to ask alot of questions from superior and to attend trainings.Not good on grqining before just tossing you out there to find your way in the mix.I would do transactions as well as have conversations with my customers. I learned a  great deal about banking from my co-workers. The management was fine but mainly learned from my supervisors. The hardest part of the job was really dealing with the rude customers. The most enjoyable part was the co-workers as well as the regular customers that would come in.I have seen many HR issues in the branch and management doesn't do anything about it. They continuously push us with sales and our sales goals are unreal.Great place to work in team environment to meet growing needs of a bank moving into the national spotlight.  Work included meeting with several lines of business in the asset finance brokerage unit, building new software solutions and eliminating redundant capture of data.  Systems included Misys LOAN IQ, AFS COMPASS, Bloomberg, DTCC, Calypso Derivatives system, Impact brokerage system, MTS Money Transfer system, OnLine Treasury Manager and GEAC General Ledger systems.    Regulatory reporting included Dodd Frank Volcker, CCAR Liquidity reporting, Shared National Credit reporting and other ad hoc internal audit requests.Most enjoyable part of the job was working with several lines of business helping them streamline and prepare for growth.  Flexibility to work from home and move around the office buildings to meet staff.Great place to work, Suntrust has a good learning experience in place so that you can learn your specific job and excel in the area of your position and career.Suntrust has a great work life balance.   They also are supportive of new technologies and provide training to those that require it.I did not enjoy this job.  I just wanted to help customers with the needs they were concerned about.  However, banks are only concerned with convincing customers to sign up for more accounts that I, as a teller was constantly told I had to offer to the customers even when I already knew the customer was not interested.SunTrust is a great employer with excellent benefits such as 401K and health, however, there have been many changes to banking regulations in the past 6 months and we anticipate many more in the next year which can possibly result in banker's bonus incentive changing (not for the better).Lots of empty suits walking around. The company is the epitome of corporate America. No one knows who to talk to, there is very little accountability, and the organization is constantly being rearranged with higher turnover than usual. Think of the show ""The Office"" but banking. The compensation is great, above market, however the company does not invest in new technology to keep up with its competitors.Make sure you have a manager willing to mentor you because SunTrust has the worst onboarding and continual development/training programs I and my coworkers have experienced.There are many people working at an abnormally slow pace so they can give the impression of being busy; as a result projects and initiatives take very long, there are delays and project cost overruns, and communication across the enterprise is difficult due to people's lack of accountability and caution to take ownership of anything. High producers are rewarded with more work and more responsibility while advancement is limited because of ""lifers"" waiting (or needing) for a RIF (RIF = layoff, reduction in force). The main advancement one will get is AVP to VP and annual raises. On the Consumer and Wholesale side, SunTrust has antiquated backend systems and infrastructure -from the 80s and 90s that continue to be patched, creating unnecessary errors and work so that people will be ""safe"" in their jobs. The CEO is very concerned with the bottom line and will not make any meaningful (high dollar, high value) investments for the future to build lasting value; as a result the organization is simply  more... a ticking regulatory time bomb, waiting to explode at any moment.In the Consumer division be sure to wear a suit every day. You won't be client-facing but the culture requires business attire, which is totally unnecessary for employees in support roles. There are no happy hours or after work events unless you organize yourself - office managers do nothing to support a positive corporate culture, they only serve to manage Managers' calendars, give out equipment, and make sure employees are sitting in the right cube.  lessA lot of sales involved.  Outbound calling, setting appointments, follow-ups, etc.  Not difficult, but not very exciting either.  Compensation is competitive.  Good bonus program.  I hear benefits are decent (I don't use them).I have no comment at this time about the company, good company to work and good management, sad that many departments are closing. No other comment at this time. Thank youGenerally, this is a good place to work in Atlanta.  Salaries are competitive and most managers are solid.

Wasn't a bad place to work. Just was funded by state contract and the contract ended and wasn't renewed.Honeywell forced employees to take 1-3 weeks off without pay, reduced pay and outsourced jobs to China, Mexico and India.  If you do something that your manager does not like, it is sure to go into your annual review.  If you do something that your manager likes, it may not show up in your annual review.Of course, the job conditions depend on where you work and the management culture. My department at Honeywell was chaotic because management changed so often. Layoffs always loomed. One was always under the gun and no one seemed to be happy.My typical work day consist of requesting quotes and placing orders.  In addition to regular duties, working on projects and continuously improve the work environment. I have been given the opportunity to learn and gain respect from my capability to learn quickly. I have strengthened my communication skills a great deal. As with any job, getting along with co-workers depends on you as a person and how to deal with certain situations. I get along with my co-workers here at Honeywell very well. As far as the difficulty of my job, I do not find it difficult. I do have a great boss that helps his team understand so we achieve things we want or need to learn. The most enjoyable part of my job is the flexibility and consideration of things that I may need to take care of away from work. As long as things are not continuous, they seem to work with you if something comes up.It is a large Company but keeps close contact with employees. Has been some issues with traveling. company truck taken away and ask to use person trans.Do not work here. They are cutting benefits, cutting vacation and holidays. They took away work from home. Do not consider this job unless you are really needy. There is no assigned seating and you will have no desk as it is open space. No privacy whatsoever. Go elsewhere as they are trying to force people out now.A typical day at work involve solving manufacturing problems and other processes. This site design and build unique RF components and antenna that does not allow for trial and error to solve production problems.I work 2nd shift and the people I work with are very easy to get along with. I really like the Supervisor but not a big fan of upper management. The site Supervisor is a good guy but corporate really keeps his hands tied. At least from what I've seen. I really like the work but a couple of times a year there is a big push. That can lead to a lot, sometimes mandatory overtime. Overall it is not a bad company to work for but don't expect a  lot of opportunity for advancement.I spent 18 years with Honeywell and was very happy with the knowledge given to me and the talent i gave back.  Management was the issue.  Their name was more important to themselves then the growth and employers in the company.Company is not doing well and employees are taking the brunt of it.  Pay reductions, bonus reduction, no merit increases, work from home eliminated, healthcare costs increased and so on while instituting furloughs with no change in expectations.A company that pays very fair their employees with very good compensation and benefits package. Health insurance, life insurance and good work-life balance.New CEO taking over.  Lots of organizational change took place prior to that and lot's of change continuing.

Management very professional and willing to train and listen and empower to get the job done. It's a nice place to work if you want to begin your career in the aerospace community.The work is interesting and usually fairly rewarding. The pay is pretty average but you're expected to put in more hours/more work and assume more responsibility than comparable positions at similar companies. The company is definitely driven from the top down with concerns for stock price and responsibility to shareholders and executive bonuses at the forefront.OK.  No issues... all good.   Great place to work on all shifts. It's a union house so... Don't know what to say other than this survey is getting on my nerves INDEED.Great Company to work for. Lots of talented people. You will learn lots of new thing with the technical diversity of this company. The only problem is the politics at this location are horrible. Employees seem to come to work in fear.

24,4888.0,DATA SCIENTIST,Home Depot,3.8,21300.0,"I was thankful to be hired in a speciality department (doors & windows) because it allowed me to sit down with customers and discuss their needs for new doors or windows. I usually worked evening shifts and Saturdays, as well as the occasional Sunday. As a student, it was a decent part-time job that helped pay the bills, and HR was always helpful when I had a scheduling conflict between school and work.Typical day was helping customers and stocking shelves.I learned a lot about all the different departments which are great life skills, also learned how to provide superiors customer service.Management was poor when I was there, but have heard it has improved a lot.Co-workers were great and fun to work with, made the day go by smoother when we had projects together.Hardest part of the job was the high demand of everything that did not involve the customers directly. i.e. big lists of stuff to do during your shift and a limited amount of time to do them.Most enjoyable part of the job was driving forklift.A decent company to work for. After working in over twelve stores on a regular basis, I found most of the associates to be very friendly, upbeat and a generally good morale.However, there are also extreme pro's & con's depending on your position and if you are an actual store employee or a MET employee.The overall culture of the company is good. The hourly rates are in one big bucket as opposed to being determined based on job requirements and responsibilities. The annual raises are honestly a joke at .25 cent being the maximum for non-management staff.A big plus is the option to transfer is you decide to relocate.Over all, in a scale of 1 - 10, I give The Home Depot a 7 and that is primarily because of the benefits. However, because of the low rate of pay, the benefits eat your check away.overall HD is a good company but I can only Speak on my experience with my own store. When I first started there It was very hopeful and i was looking to grow, that idea quickly turned into a headache as I felt my management didn't have a a good grasp on how to maintain morale among staff (little to no recognition for achievements, constant negative critique), they practiced in favoritism (awards and promotions stayed within a particular circle) and it was very apparent to many of the staff. after awhile progression felt non existent no matter how much was put into the work. many times it felt as if our store didn't practice the Core Values that Home Depot preaches, but as I said my experience my particular store.I have loved my time with this company and do find that it is very enjoyable to work in most stores.I do find the pay to be a little low especially for those that take their own time to learn new skills and receive extra training to not receive a pay raise. I will warn you that if you are part time (I am not) that hours for the most part are very limited through most of the year with the exception of holidays (off seasons you can get as low as 6 hours for the week to 18 hours). You also will not receive benefits if you are only part time. The good thing is that they do work with school and child care situations as long as you have the paper work to back up your needs.There are many opportunities to learn new skills, but management at the store level can hinder your progress greatly, even if you are well qualified for a supervisor position.  This is a good job to have while in college, but I would not make this a career, unless you absolutely love this area of business.  Be careful of adding new skills and letting management know, because you will be finding yourself taking on more responsibility without appropriate compensation, such as raises or recognition.Lastly, store managers do not care if you have a college degree.  It seems having an advanced education would benefit those who work in the corporate office.You have little or no career path at Home Depot. They talk a big game and promise a good career path and training to make sure it happens, but does not happen if you are a older person with a great management background. The hours of scheduling are radical at best and you are always under manned and over worked for very little compensation. Although I was rated a 5 out 5 performance for my work evaluation I was never considered for promotion because I was pigeon holed in a certain area and increased their sales by over 20% in the departments I was assigned to work in.  Would I recommend a career path at Home Depot. Only if you want to be a slave to the company if you are a department manager or assistant store manager. They are very much abused.A typical work day depends on what you can do, machine operators are expected to do a majority of the work to maintain and recover departments. Other associates don't always do much and it does sometimes get all dropped on one person later in the day in addition to customers who are occasionally confrontational. Management is usually good on all aspects and help get the job done when possible. Hardest part of the job is doing the parts of the jobs that the other associates have refused to do that gets tacked onto your list.Great benefits and if you do a good job and show you know what you're doing they take care of you anyway possible.I love working for Home Depot.  Great management, upper and in-store.  It really felt like people cared for my career, and were always willing to help me advance.  Recognition was amazing.  Whenever I did well, I heard about it.  Worst part of the job is the work/life balance.  With an unpredictable schedule (As a department supervisor, I did not have a consistent schedule) it was really hard to plan for things outside of work.  Also, pay was barely enough to support myself.  I did well and got raises, but it really wasn't substantial.I learned great customer service skills and commercial contractor skills. A typical work day would be switching between departments throughout the store to assist both the Do-It-Yourself and Commercial Contractor customers. Many of the store management were always very helpful. The hardest part of the job was during inventory count and reorganization where it was very taxing physically. I enjoyed working mostly with the customers and making a difference in their shopping experience.I have worked here ten years and it has only gotten worse as the environment is not one of positivity but of negativity.  Associates are asked to do way more than possible and then asked why customers are upset?  It seems as if quality associates are few and far between because most associates don't know much and their shelf life is a couple of months so experience is severely lacking.  If you are knowledgeable you are taken advantage of by fixing what others mess up but nothing gets done to stop the mistake from happening again which is mind numbing.  The pay raises are laughable as you can hit all your numbers and do it all but your getting what everyone else gets which is not much.  Pay is horrifically bad and most associates are way under the poverty line while working here.  There are no cost of living wages so pay does not match what's going on in society but nothing is ever addressed.I  am currently a supervisor at the Home Depot. The culture is phenomenal, the associates and managers couldn't be better. Compensation is competitive but could be better, especially for skilled individuals. Hours are erratic, but recently full-time employees were given fixed schedules. Lots of advancement opportunities if you are willing to work for them.At Home Depot, the associates and management is almost like family, so almost everyone is pretty friendly. The training is great. You do occasionally have to interact with disgruntled customers, but if you keep a positive outlook and attitude, and irate customer will easily turn into an understanding one. The health benefits are great. You can receive a bonus every 6 months and a raise every year. The vacation time is competitive with other companies, and you often feel like a valued associate.On an average day I could be needed in almost any department. Management is average with some managers going above and beyond and some falling very short. Fellow employees range from very knowledgeable to highly incompetent and there are a few who flat out lie to the customers just to get a sale. The compensation is a joke being that they offer you minimum wage and ""benefits"" and there is no way to advance within the company unless you want to make it a career. It would take at least 20 years to even become a store manager let alone any real management within their corporate side.The Home Depot is a great company that allows opportunity to grow. With this company a worker can advance him/herself as far as they want to. The environment is very friendly, and customers have a lot of respect for the company as well as the workers. Management was great and always available when needed. My co-workers were all very nice and made it fun to come to work everyday. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet the whole shift but you barely notice it. The most enjoyable part of the job is giving good customer service and receiving praise and compliments from customers you've assisted.The management and staff are great but some of the internal politics are a bit unfair. Promotions are slow and rare and there are very few full time opportunities. The benefits they provide are decent (if you can afford them). I struggle as a normal employee to prove my value and earn a promotion. There is some favoritism in upper management, but it still wouldn't hinder me from wanting to advance within this company.Fast paced, heavy customer interactions, need to be able to think on your feet or have the computer skills to search out the products that the customer is wanting.Some heavy lifting is required and scheduling can be difficult to work around at times.Great benefits package for full time and part time jobs.Hard work at times so you really EARN a paycheck.Supervisors do not care. They're just there to fund their hobbies outside of work don't do much but walk around and chit chat. GWA's work hard day in and day out. High turnover, nobody wants to work there and people are constantly being fired because of productivity numbers which are poorly in place and work against you. they are always hiring because no one wants to work there after a few months. Very stressful and constant changes by people who don't do the work. If you have to work there make it temporary and exit before they find a reason to let you go because of their poor management and poorly thought out changes.There's just nothing good to say.I've literally sat in ""Process improvement"" meetings where management would ask employees how they would improve things.  Employees would come up with many many ways things could run better and how to fix processes and each idea was met with; ""That's not necessary, you just need to work harder.""There's also a massive issue with first line managers constantly throwing each other under the bus.Their mantras are ""Hard work and Accountability""The result are beaten down employees and a culture of CYA above all else.I have never seen or heard a company spend so much money on food for the employees. This is supposed to make the employees moral better, but I don't see it. The food they buy is so unhealthy. How do they expect people to work with enthusiasm after they eat potato salad and baked beans? The management at my store is not very proactive, from what I see. They seem to busy to help with anything physical and if you ask for help they say they will get some for you, but you never get any. Management does not promote teamwork well.Learned more at THD about how to manage a business than any business school could ever teach me. They pride themselves on internal promotion and advancement! THD does an outstanding job at training and developing from  one day on the job!

Again, my whole group has dissolved, so not much to review.Unfortunately, I was let go for punctuality, however, the individual in charge of monitoring my punctuality couldn't accurately do so as he was hardly there on time himself. Other than that the positive feedback I received from literally everyone else was very encouraging and allowed for a positive and productive work environment. I was able to have free reign in investigating and procuring new ways to save money for the company and my opinions and thoughts were valued. The atmosphere was bright and healthy.It was not a good work environment. About 16 of the people I used to work with have all moved on to other jobs because of the management or culture.This is a great company to work at for individuals who are fresh out of college as well as for individuals who are creative.This place has a great environment with food/drink perks all the time and great events, but it is a 6 day a week job on most cases and between the commute and long hours, it usually turns into a 14 hour day.The culture at IgnitionOne is very fun and filled with amazing, hard-working and intelligent people. Management is another story.As an Intern during the summer of 2015, I was able to experience and talk with each department of the company to gain useful insight on the future of the digital marketing industry.The people at IgnitionOne are very nice.

32,4896.0,"Associate Director Data Scientist, Patient Insights and Innovative Solutions (Atlanta, United States)",UCB,3.5,57.0,"Was Fortunate to grow from Collector to Supervisor, hire 80% of own staff, and developed them. Once had a new Manager my development increased, was always able to improve training programbecause that was one of my strong points.Typical Day was balanced between my Collectors, Clients, and fellow Supervisors along with other Corportate needs, however the priorties were the collectors and the clients.Doesnt keep their word about raises after 90 days, only the collectors that have been there 10 years or better are really the ones that gets incoming calls. And makes real money for a bonus check. I hate the fact the pay schedule is set days of each month.not a bad company if looking for a job.  If looking for a career, look elsewhere.  District managers are good senior management needs a self check.If you're looking for a place where your efforts are appreciated and your results are rewarded - skip this place. It it is simply not a place to build a career. It is a good place to work when you're in between jobs or if you're not the primary income of the household. Don't expect to be appreciated much, and make sure you only take this job if you have the flexibility to quit at the drop of a dime.great atmosphere, wonderful coworkers, wonderful management, great incentives, lunches were good. great feedback dailyThe culture at UCB is very positive with several avenues to advance your career. The training was extensive and very thorough. The management team was well trained and came along side the reps with a coaching and uplifting attitude. The co-workers all worked together as team players and we were able to have a lot of fun and get work done as well. The hardest part of the job was more industry wide not related to the company. It was seeing the physicians and getting in the offices with new policies of no lunches and only so many reps on certain days, etc.Co-workers are helpfulChallenging positionCan be stressfulPay is based on bonuses Monday through FridayNot a lot of training providedLearn mostly on your ownAlways busy, making phone calls or receiving phone calls. Convincing people to pay off their debt and even play with numbers a bit. Supervisors are always there to help and prepare you for different scenarios that you may come across of. Hardest part is finding the consumer and actually getting them to stay on the phone with you and not hang up.UCB is pharma company that has drugs for the central nervous system, GI and rheumatoid arthritis.Offer a pretty good retirement plan and other benefits.The people are fun.UCB offers education reimbursement.Too many people in management positions that don't know what they are doing.  Some haven't ever managed people before and their teams are used as experiments for them to become one with no formal training and transition.  Management should really truly value their team by their action and not giving lip service that doesn't add up.  You stay too long the place will drain you of all of your true intelligence because it seems like if you are clueless you are better off there than being an intelligent person.  If you value your job and work hard you are stuck in your position, but if you don't do anything and just look busy you will be great and set up for success!!What i enjoy most is the people at this company.  Everyone is very friendly and a great group to work with.Each day in the office im able to learn new things and build new relationshipsI enjoyed very much working for UCB for the last one year.I feel valued and got tons of support from management and my peers. I can truly say that I enjoy everyone who works here and that it is an environment in which I want to come to work every day and I'm proud to say I work here.""The fact the we all work towards the same goals truly fulfill meThis job was moved to a different state. I had mainly negative experiences working here, which helped me get motivated to change career paths.UCB is very demanding.  They are about collecting debt for their clients and making their goals for the month.  Management isn't the greatest, but they will get the job done.  Co-workers are nice but it's a job not a place to make friends.  The hardest part of the job is making the monthly goal when consumers don't want to pay their debt.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when you collect a lot and know that your in bonus.Ucb has opportunities to grow, but at slower pace being that there are so many vets in position. The company give those that are just getting out of school a chance for employment. Ucb offers insurance and incentives for all employees.easy place to work - caring management and excellent healthcare.Management is poor and the work ethics are low. Not a job I would recommend unless you need to something to get you on your feet.Billing to various insurance carriers. too many people in one room with half cubicles hard to concentrate because of noise volume.Making Outbound calls to customers into how to correct there debt situation.Advising customers on how they can settle their debt without making their finances being affected.making sure the sales have the right product and material to see the doctor sells the medicine the company offer them.its ok company to work for.hours are just enough.the hardest part of the job is getting clients on the phone",,Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-10-20T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/66d936ef-a6f8-427d-a1df-be74cad2cc3e?mescoid=1100011001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
33,4897.0,Sr Data Scientist - Fraud,Assurant,3.7,1100.0,"Sourced and purchased replacement products for people who purchased contracts on computers, monitors, printers, and other electronic equipment.I enjoyed working with my co-workers.A typical day is split between managing the day to day flow of the teams and problem solving new issues. We are in the process of implementing new formal processes in all areas. These require continual refinement. Each day presents learning opportunities in multiple ways. I strive to improve the effectiveness of my management technique with this new knowledge. My co-workers are hard working, dedicated professionals! The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the accomplishments achieved by the associates around me.I currently work in customer care for property loss and it's a nightmare. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work there. There is little room for moving up in the company. It's often hard to get help when you need it as well with a phone call. I know people that have been there 3-4 years and have never received a pay raise. I'm trying to catch the first thing smoking out of there. I don't know anyone on the customer care side that likes it. This company is also not for someone that has a family or small children. I'm currently on my 3rd schedule since I started there last April.A typical day was we would wait till the phone would ring and then would get them thru the process of filing a claim over the phone and to see if they qualify for a replacement device.   I learned on how the t-mobile exchange process works and u dont always get approved.  My co-workers were great people but they wanted to figure things out for your self.Hardest part of the bad was listing to the sad stories and not being able to helpAssurant Health was an inspiring, and fun place to work that gave GREAT benefits. I learned patience working for Assurant. The management and co-worker staff were a great group of people, always helpful and reliable. The hardest part of the job was knowing that it was closing. the most enjoyable part of the job were the Employee Events.When I started there the facility was owned by The Signal and it was an enjoyable place to work.  After The Signal was sold to Assurant the place changed.  Assurant has a good reputation for its various insurances businesses but does not seem to understand how a warehouse/manufacturing facility should operate.  Instead of advancing from within, the company started looking solely to outsiders to fill management ranks.Taking calls from insurance agents and customers in reference to homeowners policies, updating info., issuing payments on premiums. This position has made me very knowledgeable at the insurance industry and how lenders and insurance companies work together and the importance of insurance. I love a challenge ., the hardest part of my job was learning the insurance ""world""., the most enjoyable was definitely the people I worked with and assisting our customers and getting a bad situation turned around for the positive.So many negative changes have made the claims department  a toxic and disheartening place to work.  A few years back, it was a great place to work.  There was a sense of community and hard work was appreciated.  Since the arrival of new claims leadership, the department has suffered significantly, with a high turnover of good, experienced employees, replacing them with inexperienced,  entry-level ""yes men"".I've learned a lot in the past year and a half about Insurance, escrow, and mortgages. The hardest part about my job is not being active. I love helping others, so when I get a call from a homeowner and I'm able to help them it makes my day. The management team seems to work well together and try their best to help every when available. I've learned how to listen fully overall.The work atmosphere is very regimented. You take your breaks and lunch (30min) with everyone else at a set time. You have to remain quiet throughout the day, being social is not encouraged. However the latest pop hits are continually beamed from the loudspeakers, and although its not very loud, it is distracting to hear the same songs over and over again about once every hour. The training process consists of someone sitting over your shoulder watching you work ALL DAY, every day pointing out errors, which makes it harder to concentrate. This goes on for months. It's not at all a friendly environment, very strict with little to no interaction with coworkers. Most just stare at their screens with a scowl on their face most times anyway.Not a great place to work .Too much into performance driving and not about the customer. They also pay temps more verses direct hires. The 3 years I worked there I was assigned to three different clients. Very unstable work environment with high turnover ratio. The pay was also a factor. Who wants to work for a 1% pay raise?I help assist homeowners with their homeowners insurance, ensuring that they have sufficient coverage. I also aid in any questions they may have, also help with property loss when the customer has a loss with the home.I worked here 3 1/2 years, I was doing exceptional well, but it was so hard to get promoted or move around within the company. They are so difficult working with when it comes to requesting off. They are constantly increasing the work load every other month but wont increase your pay. The company is a joke to work for.On any given day you are constantly engaged with employees and customers. The company has done a good job of encouraging continued learning to diversify your skills while broadening your scope of work. Due to regulatory changes the Specialty Property division has undergone some shifts lately resulting in reductions in force. Senior leaders have really encouraged employees to understand a successful change model. There are some great individuals throughout the company.The hardest part of the job is to encourage peers, management, and direct reports during a visible shift and reduction in force. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping employees develop their skill set to better position them for future change.Great place to work in with a fast paced environment. Management is great. Co-workers are very friendly and the office has great ammenities. Hardest part of the job is the attrition causes work overload on the existing adjusters in order to get the job done. The most enjoyable part of this  job is being able to satisfy an insured that has suffered a loss by idemdifying them back to the condition they were prior to their loss. We are the insureds 911.This job was very easy for me to learn how to do and allowed me to eventually train others to do what I had learned. Although the work and job duties can sometimes become monotonous and repetitious, the ability to converse with nearby work colleagues makes it easier to more fun to get through the day.When I first started at this company I enjoyed it much more than when I left. I enjoyed having a stack of paperwork that needed done by the end of the day. When it was decided that another department would be merged with the one I worked in, there were too many people away from their desks not working than actually getting the work done.Assurant is a great company to work at. Focused on their employees and their development.Has an onsite day care and elementary school for employees kids only.Great Campus. Onsite Cafeteria is amazing.Normally people work there until retirement.I really enjoyed working at Assurant. My typical day was cosmetically and functionally testing new devices that were sent in.  I was really impressed with the open door policy that we had with our supervisor. The genuinely took our suggestions seriously and if it helped with the process they acknowledged the employee that helped implement the new procedure. The hardest part of the job was sitting for 10 hours. I really enjoyed the fact that we worked four ten hour days.- pour training - rushed at learning - pour slow systems - pour management Pour communication especially with new employees Expecting them to know everything in three weeks I was hired on through a company agency, received no feedback on my progress I was doing my best to learn System navigation was a mess but took my time to learn My agency called me late evening informing me that the company has to let me go, the company didn't have the guts to say that to my face I could not go back the next day to retrieve my personal belongings, company assured me it takes time to learn everything not to rush myself take my time ask questions which I did but I never got the opportunity to prove myself to the company with their lies of training time would be 4 to 6Weeks.Enjoyable workplace which provided a through knowledge of the individual health insurance industry. The company was huge on cross training, and the more you learned the more valuable you became to the company. This allowed the company to move you to other departments based on the business needs, which overall helped with your job security.","10,000+",Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-10-17T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/3b8f8060-9527-47dc-bf09-247f2a125c2e?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

The most enjoyable part of job is to work with others as a team.Very nice place to work. Not working directly for Turner, as I'm contracting.They invested a lot in the Techwood campus in Midtown.Fun environment and creative place. Benefits are good and people are friendly. Highly recommend this company for those who are looking for a great career in cable television entertainment. Location is central in the city of Atlanta and easy access to highways and public transportation. Competitive company in the industry, top network ratings.Turner services company is a great place to work if you need to make money, and have experience in A/C repair. For people who think about applying though, need to expect to learn to do thing's different ways. Some of his ways are very different than most places, but they are more effective and safe.Balanced work life and great atmosphere.Flexible hours and management is very professional.Overall it is a pleasure to work for this firm.Was a maintenance electrician with them, the project manager I worked for was VERY unpleasant and had even worse leadership abilities, jobsite was miserable and the company didn't seem to care about the workers at allGreat company but recent changes and layoffs have effected morale and output. New management as well not as committed as long term management that has leftOverall Turner was a wonderful place to work, friendly people, excellent benefits, excellent pay,  room for advancement in some cases, Overall wonderful place to work.Great company once the organizational changes are complete.  However, they've replaced a large amount of IT staff with offshore employees.  Overall, my experience with management was pretty good.Turner is an excellent company to work for.  I have been working for Turner for the past 15 years and would recommend the company to anyone who is looking for employment.And management of sales...it is an family owned place. I enjoyed the people i worked with and people i served..i came to work on time every dayFollowed Agile methodology, had meetings scrum meetings everyday. Good team work and very friendly environment. Good platform to learn many new things. Discussing with team members and improvising things is most enjoyable.They do not have benefits, 401-K. All the employees I talked to said they are over worked and underpaid and that Turner does not appreciate them.Turner was a great company to work for in the late '90's until 2005 when I left. Great Management, great Company perks , benefits took great care of employees!Definitely didn't expect this as it unfolded. Management does everything to discourage you from changing departments. You have a better chance of raising the Titanic with tweezers. Most of the co-workers are as phoney as a three dollar bill. There are some talented people and some are generally good people. However, even they fall victim to the alphas of various clicks. They are conniving, lazy and extremely underhanded. I'm not sure how some got hired and furthermore astonished that they maintain their job. Which leads me to this. Beware of management moles. I would guess that's how a few of them still are able to loiter masquerading as workers. These incompetent, useless ones will despise you once you show drive, talent and unwavering confidence in spite of their efforts to maintain a hostile work environment. The directors are actually the most miserable of all. Constant nitpicking to those who aren't their chosen ones. Do yourself a huge favor and move on. Lastly, there is zero work life balance.Well in construction we all have our good days and bad ones.And with the technology we have today we are always learning something new. Just always remember to put your safety first on each task you start.Turner is a great place to work. You can definitely move up in the company. Paid holidays, great Insurance, and Friendly work environment. I would go back in a heartbeat.Excellent place to work. Turner simply needs to put forth a more concentrated efort towards implementing  more diversity via the oranization's hiring process and overall talent acquisition; especially within the company's ""sports"" department in it's Century City Office.Spent a long (Too long) in the Technology department.  The management was confusing in the decision making.  Spent money on pointless projects and then never had money for training.  Most new skills came from new hires and then got stale sitting in a cube.  Middle management seemed to enjoy misery of subordinates.  To the point of running out on the tab for department lunches!  OK so now it's all gone, new company with very little staff left.Pipe fitter, do daily progress reports,time sheets, issue work schedule, and read blueprints. Very reliable worker.

37,4901.0,Senior Data Scientist,Bank of America Corporation,3.9,14500.0,"A good place to work if you like to work in financial. a typical banking workforce. they provide good benefits that works for youBank of America Relationship Managers are always on the go. It is a fast paced job that demands a lot from you. If you are looking for a career at a Banking Center that is rewarding and thrilling, than the RM role is for you.This bank was a great place to work at. Met a lot of great people here and definitely learned a lot. Also a lot of pressure to open accounts and achieve goals, your job depends on it. But other than that lots of room to grow  and you advance quickly. Great pay and great benefits.My typical day at Bank of America was always eventful. I would always deepen relationships with clients by providing them with accurate information regarding their financial situations.Bank of America is an excellent corporation to work for.  They value their employees ""Employee recognition day"" every year.  The managers incorporate the banks core values in their everyday routines.  Management is very good at communication and the managers and employees support each other.  Each day we worked hard and had fun at the same time.  I enjoyed working with my associates by supporting them and driving them to excellence.   In  my personal opinion every job has its challenges but once you excel through them it gives you such a great job satisfaction.work was great, fast pace, time went by so fast.i learn to process checks for the Bank.Management help as much as they could.Co-workers was fun to work with, some wasn't. But I was there to do a job.The Hardest about the job..There was a limit to how many checks to do in one night. I wasn't that fast.The most enjoyable part about the job was, I was working.I loved working as a teller for this company. Very positive. Definitely recommend anyone who love working with people to apply. My management team was amazingTeam spirit, drive sales and revenue. requires multi tasking and focusing on clients. Relationship management requires direct contact with clients and sales partners to assure that we are meeting the needs of the customer.As a BofA RM you are basically a glorified cust serv rep.  All the bank  cares about is opening checking accounts for as many cust as possible and sell as many CC as possible. Now Ive heard that every branch is different (which should not be the case) but the branch I worked at had very poor management that seemed to just be learning everything as the days go by and the bank as a whole seemed to embrace this philosophy. Inefficient systems that made it impossible to do anything in a timely manner were an everyday nuisance and everyday that I came into work it seemed that there was some new policy or new way of doing things. A typical day of work includes seeing anywhere from 10-12 customers of which the majority have some issues or complaint, resolving that issue and then find some type of product to sell to them. I did not get along with my coworkers in this branch for the most part (I had 10 different in 5 months)  About the only positive thing I can say about working here where the hours. Bank generally closes as 4pmThis company will work you and under pay you. And the more you give the more they demand. On the other hand it really teaches you many thingsI learned many things while working there. I learned how to multitask in a busy, fast paced environment while handling a lot of cash. Learned how to converse with customers and listen when needed too. Learned how to handle customer complaints and direct them to the manger if I couldn't answer it. Overall working at Bank of America taught me many things and my manger made it more enjoyable. She can be a reference if needed as well.I have made some great connections within the firm because I'm a part of an employee network and I enjoy the connectivityA typical day at work starts with a daily staff meeting where we are all caught up on company news, daily accounts, and our daily SLA's that have to be met for the day. A wake meeting so to speak.During the day i process and personalize on average around 7,500 accounts. I am constantly multitasking and trouble shooting utilizing Data Card and Syntera software and hardware systems, until my company and personal goals are met for the day.I learned that I can do anything that i set my mind to. I am a quick learner. i learned to rely on my teamates and to help the team because we all have common goals and valuesthe hardest part of the job is the production aspect.the most enjoyable part of is the relationships that i have built and cultivate on a day to day basis.You were to come in, do your assigned tasks and go home. The management didn't go out of their way to be extra helpful however my coworkers were great!This is a fast pace environment and always have to adapt to changes and updates in processes and procedures as well as management as there are several updates every month.I would not recommend anyone working here. It's very cut throat and there is very little support from management. Everyone is out for themselves.Nothing but stress, high pressure sales, harassing customers to get them to buy more debt that they don't need. You are instructed to be relentless, push and use high pressure sales tactics to bully customers into loans, credit cards or any other det=bt we can get them into. My blood pressure went to the roof, you have to call customers, peruse their spending habits on their bank accounts so you know what products to cram down their throats. If you enjoy doing all that, this is the job for you. If you have a conscious you will never be able to sleep at night doing the things the demand you do to reach extremely unrealistic sales goals.This company has great job security and multiple opportunities for advancement. The job culture makes you feel like more than an employee but an advocate for change.While working for bank of America Edd I was always being rushed by my supervisor and I did not appreciate it very much the were gonna fire me because I was not quick enough on the typingFast pace work place but worked with very nice people. Day went by so fast when working with great group of people. Worked on different projects with different colleges at very high level.A typical day at work was when me and my team were given a task that is normally done in two weeks to be executed in three days due to clients request.This made me learned a lot like being more proactive,work under pressure as a team,stay focused so as not lost concentration and also communication skills. I make sure at every stage of the job,i keep management aware about the progress.Actually, i have a very wonderful team of co-workers whom we always work as a team and make sure we uplift the name of the company.working alone is not a problem but its more enjoyable working as a team because we put our individual talents  together.To me,the hardest part of the job or task was to meet up with the due-date in order to ensure at all times customer satisfaction.The most enjoyable part of the job was when we submitted the job respecting the three days.","10,000+",Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-09-11T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/48945b03-d88c-4457-8a75-3209e7fcda6e?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

I would ask weekly how I was doing, and was told I was top tier, but at the same time, HR was being told my productivity was bottom tier.Definitely a great place to work, very team oriented with many opportunities for advancement. Hard work definitely pays off! Striving to look for concepts in order to find healthcare overpayments is one main goal of my team. Takes focus and diligence in order to achieve high results.Cotiviti is an amazing place to work no matter where you are in life - just out of college, or more settled down. On the job, you will learn every day as medical documents and rules are updated, systems are changed are for the better, and new insights are made.I've been with this company for 3 years and I really like it here. Yes, there have been a lot of changes but most have been positive. Flexible work schedules, good benefits and casual dress. The culture here is unlike other places I have worked. I also enjoy the people I work with.Very un organized the systems are very out dated and down most times. Management don't have a clue. Staff very immature and have horrible communication skills don't like to share information. Worse place to work. Very low salary and medical benefits very expensive. Not sure how this company still around. They're so focus on numbers and don't care about their employees. Very high turn over rate.I left two years ago - a happy day in my life.  If you were among ""the anointed"" by management, you'd do well.  Otherwise, the best you could hope for was to be ignored.Love the Flexible hours.  The pay could be better. Nice Culture. The dress is casual. There are activities that bring the people together.Days are very much the same. Time is flexible so long as you work 40 hours a week. Very intelligent managers and senior members. Great work environment that makes coming to work enjoyable. Would recommend to anyone pursuing a career in the healthcare industry.Do not work here. Terrible micro-management. Horrible benefits and hours.  All software is outdated. No money in IT infrastructure.A lot of promises made upon hiring that were simply untrue.  Majority of auditors have no actual healthcare experience and do not appreciate those who do. Very territorial over learning most senior auditors do not want others promoted and create a very hostile environment.great work place the collection manager is a little  on the unsavory side. But other than that its a great place to work. I would love to work in a different deptI started whenever I wanted, which was nice, as long as I worked and eight-hour day. MY co-workers were welcoming and friendly. I called insurance companies to confirm that they were still with their clients.The company appears to be unstable.  There is not room for advancement and the company does not honor it's long term employees.Smart, professional work environment. Wonderful group of people to work with.Recent acquisition and merger have created more of a 'corporate' feel. Very intense work environment. Be ready to give 110% every day. But, also very much a team environment.Work ethics have diminished. Pay has been cut in half. Poor management with no relatable job skills. Does not promote from within.Nice place - very disorganized as far as project planning and execution is concerned. Nice physical environment and good people.This company is now involved in multiple law suits because of its poorly run organization. The only benefit is the company paid well and was flexible which was great for anyone attending school.Laid back, yet productive.  Did your job, nobody bothers you.  They showed their appreciation for a job well done.  I would go back if they called me.I can't believe what a great family to work for. They reward, appreciate and are always in good moods. They CARE about people.Great company. Very unique industry but leaders in that segment.Connolly is a great opportunity for an individual that has not been in the healthcare field for a long time.

Keysight Technologies has a desirable company culture.Keysight Technologies embodies a positive work environment, has great benefits, cutting edge technology and has smart people who genuinely care about their colleagues and take pride in the quality of their work.Keysight is also a leader in the Electronic Test and Measurement industry.Most enjoyable: the people, good managersLeast enjoyable: some frustration from bureaucracy in systems and processesOverall: Still a great company to work for from it's HP roots. Working to find new revenue growth opportunities.I feel this company is trying to catch-up with technology which has made them overly focused on giving preference to new hires. Also, importance on credentials is given to much emphases--many times overlooking more qualified experienced members.Keysight is filled with great people who are dedicated to their roles and to the company. The work-life balance is great, and the opportunity for advancement is available.I have enjoyed working at Keysight. Great work environment. Encourage innovations. Access to the state of the art research articlesvery good environment.  everyone works together as a team and it make for a fun place to work.  keysight is a very employee oriented company and they are always looking out for the employee .Come into work, setting up machines and prepare for work. I've learned about photo chemical milling processes. Management was the biggest issue for production in the company. Management by people who are untrained, unprofessional, and have absolutely no idea of production and manufacturing. Not a open door policy. If you have any issues or concerns to bring up, their reply is basically, ""you are replaceable, just like everyone else."" People we setup for failure everyday by management. We are production workers who come into work everyday when a targets on our back's. We are setup for failure everyday for no apparent reason. Employees are like family, we work as a team and support each other as a team. Hardest part of the day was to know you have not failed work and you still have your job. Most enjoyable were spending time working with your team.It's a great workplace for employee, because it has flexiable working time, and also has conerns on the employees' health. And the management team has good communication with engineers when they make decision on projects.Job Work/Life Balance: goodCompensation/Benefits: goodJob Security/Advancement: badManagement: badJob Culture: goodR&D, Engineering and Production driven to create and produce high quality products for the world.

49,4913.0,Data Analytics/Web Developer,Lockheed Martin,4.1,3500.0,"This was a 40 hour a week job but was only given part time status. this was to replace a leaving officer before the installation of a card access security system. This location needed a government Security Clearance. Security handled certain documentation to be destroyed. At this location we had standard tours.Good working conditions but a lot of responsibility for a small salary.They forget that we live in the NYC area and take advantage of the poor labor market. A take home of 700 per week when you and three others are responsible for 30 million dollar program makes everyone have to have two jobs just to break even. That is if you can find another job. Everyone in the office is financially stressed and over half the office is looking for another job including our whole team. They outsource projects for what can be done internally at four times our rate but underpay us for what we doWorked on a secured program, but you walked into work feeling like you were making a difference in the world. Management was great at book keeping and very knowledgeable when it came to asking questions. Lots of overtime was offered. Working at the place everyone wants to work at is awesome. Awesome co workers who meant business. The only downfall to this place is the rocky road to gain seniority. When there are ups they are up, but when things go down, without out the seniority it get cloudy.The interview process was very stress-free. The interviews were friendly. They didn't ask any useless questions such as ""What is your greatest weakness."" I submitted and application, received an email to schedule an interview in the same week, and after the interview, I heard back from the hiring manager promptly.Working on upward mobility program and be more people oriented.Reasonable place to work with a slant on conservative values, and a cautious venture into new technology.  As an aerospace firm, they are subject to the market and governmental variability in opportunities typical of those companies driven primarily by large government contracts.Helped to provide funding for fixed asset requirements for various divisions and tier construction projects.  Helped to maintain big construction project scheduling compliances.  Expedited and processed funding documents.  Presented formalized reports to senior management documenting expense spending and extrapolating future monetary spending throughout the end of the  year. Comfortable in high level management meetings.  Enjoyed my knowledgeable co-workers.You don't miss it until it's gone...or something to that effect but needless to say when you look back at your career you'll always relate back to the companies that had the most impact on your professional life. That for me would be Lockheed. While we struggled to compete in a federal market that was okay awarding contracts to the 80% solution, 'Technically Acceptable, Lowest Cost,' the company still led key markets serving the federal government like space, aviation, and weapons. Following the market value you'll see how the market aligns with the management and leadership of the company as the stock value has done nothing but grow.As a contractor, I traveled around the U.S., Hawaii and Puerto Rico conducting industrial hygiene and radiation surveys at FAA facilities.  I also enjoyed teaching courses in radiation safety and measurement. The program manager in Washington D.C. was very supportive. I learned a tremendous amount health physics and met many wonderful people in the FAA.This company has a wonderful work life balance with a 9 80 work schedule and flex time.  It's nice to be able to control your own schedule when life happens, and not have to notify god and country of needed time off.With downsizing, being able to do more with less as far as staffing goes isn't unbearable, but the compensation is less than par.This was a typical cubicle workplace, easy to fall into a simple and repetitive routine.  The job had very nice benefits and rarely left me overworked or working overtime.  Management rarely impressed, but the workplace was overall a fairly nice place and there were still plenty of fun and kind coworkers.  It is a large complex, so there are a lot of other people working in the vicinity.Lockheed Martin is BIG, with offices in many states and countries, and many different office cultures. You'll find a suit-and-tie culture around Washington DC, jeans in the western and mountains sates, khakis and button-down shirts throughout.  Production facilities tend to be very deliberate and detail-oriented; as you need to be when your products are those of a major aerospace company. There are also research labs which are more flexible and tolerant of failure, but bring your A-game if you apply.The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to interact with various IT (Contractors) and Federal Civilian professionals. The hardest part of my job was having to deal outdated IT systems and software and find solutions related to problems that arose from that. My coworkers were the best...we had the best IT team.Meetings with top officials, customers, business analysis for website development, serving as liaison between developers and customers, extensive quality testing for web development, helpdesk support, preparing presentations, managing projects using the Agile Methodology, and working independently to solve problems.As the work as a Project Manager was fast paced and sometimes because construction can be unpredictable, esp. if it is outdoors, may be hard to plan any type of vacation, but I really enjoyed the work, the people, including the customer and the site...It was a rewarding and fulfilling experience. I only left Lockheed due to a contract change...wish this never happened...since it was all downhill after Lockheed left.The company provided excellent wages and retirement programs. Incentive programs for employees to benefit their department and weekly meetings with department management for problem solving solutions and clean work environment.I was able to start my days at 530am so I could be done early enough to pick up my children from school. It was work that you could do on your own and were not waiting on someone else to finish so you could start.While I was there for 12 years we did have four different managers. At times there was no manager and when a new one would be hired it was myself that would need to train them. The atmosphere was friendly and fun while also getting your job done.Enjoyed sixteen years of employment working several different programs as an engineer with lots of variety and with lots of new challenges.  Great ethical culture.  In all my years there, there was only ONE time that someone lost their temper and yelled at colleagues.  Great compensation package as well.The best, hard working, dedicated people are the company's biggest plus. Perks? Yes, there are perks (free catered lunch, game room, instruments if you like to jam etc.) But, don't come here for just the perks. This is the San Francisco Bay Area. You can practically go shopping for perks and benefits package. But come here if you want to work with smart, hard working, driven people.LM Sunnyvale was a wreck - unqualified people being promoted and put into positions they were not qualified for.  People were not excited about change.LM Colorado was a different place - things got done, qualified people were hired and we had fun making sure our projects got done and were completed with pride.Currently work at Lockheed Martin as a counselor for consumers. I take an average of 60-70 calls a day giving and submitting accurate information into database. Management and co-workers at my current employer are all team players and they all allow me to do my job daily. It can be challenging mentally but it allows me to challenge myself with each difficult task. I like the fact that I can help people are who struggling with specific issues.I actually worked for Martin Marietta before it merged with Lockheed in 1995. The teamwork among the Executive Secretarial staff was outstanding. The two Assistant Treasurers I supported were good at informing me of what they expected of me and acknowledging me when I performed well. They also handled my errors with understanding and retraining.","10,000+",Atlanta,Marietta,GA,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/53c8d166-9257-4c12-9766-0321bf5c1114?mescoid=1500129001001&jobPosition=18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

My title is gp12 and i enjoy doing my job everydayCall office to see if they have a position open or available, typical learn entry level position jobs. Management is very caring and tries to find a job that best fits you. Co workers are great people to be around, hardest part getting the job that you want. Enjoy working with people that want to help youManaged poorly.  would not recommend working here based on the relationships upper management has with office staff. Very unprofessionalIts all factory work, line assembly. Nothing special about it, long hours, standing on your feet for long periods of time. Most places they place you have good working teams. Some times you get a lazy team but that all depends on the management.Nesco is a staffing agency that works to help you get and keep a job.  If you lose it for whatever reason they always are there to help you find another job.  I've never had an issue with getting hired at a factory after being hired through nesco.Work is not at all hard, but requires constant standing, pulling, lifting and pushing product from one place to another for a minimum wage to limit amount with no room for growth or promotion.Since its a temporary agengy , you aren't guaranteed work and they pay is low. I enjoyed the company I worked for through them and they pay weekly. Overall not too bad if you can find permanent placement.They were on top of everything. The coworkers were very reasonable and easy to work with. The managers and employees were respectful to everyone. I learned how to prep parts and materials before painting them. I worked long hours when it was needed.This job was through a temp agency only. It was a small call center and very laid back . Anice place to work for younger or retired individuals.Went into agency and had job placement same day. Paperwork and initial skill testing is somewhat lengthy but worth it. Takes your interests and skills and helps them match you with a job of the same skill and interest set you have. Can only work at the job assignment for 6 months, but at the end of that 6 months the company can offer permanent employment to the temp employees they are interested in.This company was ok at first but I worked one job with them then they told me I couldn't work threw them anymore but a few weeks later they offer me another job wich I accept then they were very rude to me about my abilities to workUtilizing an ipad you would receive and complete your work assignments, order parts, print, and a couple of other thingsyou have to be at work at 7:00 am during the morning. I learned how to run a packing line and load a truck. some of the floor management were professional but others weren't. Most of my co-workers were pretty cool to work with. They always gave a helping hand when needed.The hardest part about the job was to meet the some of the high quotes of completing some of the work that we were doing. Most of the work that we didn't consist of any group work. The most enjoyable part of the day was lunch , why because we got 45 minutes and and allowed use to finally talk to each other about what different jobs that we were all working on.Help me understand how to work in a high productivity area. Made sure I learned skills to take me to the next level of employment. great place to work for.Worked for a plastics company in Dundee, Florida. You end up being treated like garbage. You'll find yourself doing most of the production supervisors duties while he gets the pay. Management can be quite intolerable and very unconcerned about you. If you find yourself working here leave your dignity and self esteem at home. Count on being lied to!Was told job started at $13. Turns out it was $10.I worked in the Norwalk location at Pinnacle and that was the WORST mistake for a job. That place is a joke. The boss treats his workers like animals. There is no organization what so ever in the factory. I applied to work and 90% of the time I was cleaning. I worked there for 7 months and finally got a different job cause it wasn't worth the mental stress after the boss called me a b****.  Most of the time there isn't any P.P.E so got chemical burns and have scars now on my arms from getting cut. I would contact NESCO to let the office know of everything that was going on and no changes were ever made except NESCO contacted the boss and I would get the 3rd degree or he would make me work harderThe job was very unprofessional and full of drama. I never worked the schedule I was hired in to work. What they call training is shadowing another employee while they're on the phone with a customer. No for real in the class training. They fire employees without explanation...feels like you're walking on eggshells.Had issues with management putting me in an awkward positions with potential jobs. Loved working for Nesco Resources. Would recommend friends to try out Nesco in the future. Hope to find other temp agencies that compare to Nesco in IL.They lied about everything from where I was working to the position.

57,4921.0,"Research Scientist, Talent Solutions",Corporate Executive Board,3.3,74.0,"THose with masters or PHDs treated those working towards a graduate degree and just had a BA as if they were not smart enough or qualified to interact with clients.There was one individual who was the reason for 2 people leaving the company and management promoted him because of his knowledge even though his colleagues and CLIENTS were unhappy with the way he interacted with clients.I went in with high hopes & came out nothing but disappointed- specifically with management. The culture is super inmature & management lacked any leadership.Typical day for me would involve attending many meetings and working long hours to ensure all work was completedMy manager was great but was also stretched very thin.  My team was wonderful and I could always rely on them to get their work doneMy work life balance was not great and working while on vacation was the norm.  This does not happen everywhere within CEB though.8:30- 5:30 Job. Great working atmosphere, with great colleagues to help you out if you ever have a problem or question. Management is good, closely work with either an Account management or Sales Executive.  Work life balance is the most enjoyable aspect of the job.It is a great place to start your career I the sales environment. It has continually pushed me out of my boundaries and has allowed me to become a more productive and efficient worker. Having said that, the management there is as all high pressure sales environment. It is an all right position if you don't mind dialing 100 times a day and pitching all day over the phone.The work in the CEB project is amazing, challenging and gives opportunities to be focused but creative every day. From having barely any people we grew to 15 members in the team in three years and completed work volume normally handled by twice as many peopleThe one thing that I have never understood is the lack of possibility to arrange work hours more flexibly and integrate suitable technology. If we would have been allowed to work at least part time from home (50/50) it would be the most ideal project ever.I am glad to have been a part of it and will always cherish itIt's a cool career startup for a recent college graduate. Nice company culture and learning experience. Not for everyone but the right candidate or employee can be successful doing what is expected.Lots of office politics here. Highly dysfunctional. Everything takes lightyears to get done. Processes they use are archaic. Overall, the charity does make a difference in a lot of people's lives. They just need to fix themselves and they will make an even bigger impact.CEB is an ok company. I started there almost a  year ago. Not a lot of room for advancement. Especially after earning my CISSP.Really loved the culture and people at CEB. It's such a great place to learn and grow - you can really do a lot! Management is great, and if you are a hard worker, you can go far.Overall CEB is a great company to work for and to get professional work experience.  They pride themselves on hiring the best of the best, including extremely smart and innovative individuals.The environment is friendly and they offer a great benefits package that is very competitive, however in many departments they lack career advancement.Great company to work for. Salary could be a bit better but the benefits and Paid-time-off are second to none. Positive work environment and great training system. Positive managers and supervisors and everyone is helpful.There are so many brilliant and kind people working at CEB who support organizations around the world with research and best practices yet CEB does not follow its own guidance.  Horrible career pathing, low pay and poor management at the top.Work in my division often consisted of doing the same thing each day but that might have changed since then. The rah-rah culture was not my favorite.Fun but unorganized.  Good leadership in some sections but in other departments there is a lot of confusion.  Work hours are pretty good except they micro manage a lot.I really enjoyed my time at CEB.  However, the travel was over the top and advancement opportunities in the Chicago area are limited or non-existent with corporate headquarters being in Virginia.  Daily activity included cold calling, presenting to C-level executives, managing team.  The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting and talking with executives across all industries.CEB has a great company culture that promotes work life balance. It's a wonderful place to get your bearings, build a foundation, and network. Networking is a must because promotions are clearly based on who you know. Some teams play favorites more then others.Are you (or someone you know) looking for a new career opportunity in the Washington, DC area? If so, I would highly recommend investigating CEB. I have the pleasure of working at CEB and believe it is a great fit for me during this portion of my career. CEB has great benefits and career development opportunities, is true to its values and is committed to its employees.CEB has a young atmosphere. The majority of the employment population are recent graduates. The offices are modern, and if you are willing to ""play politics"", there's room for advancement.You'll learn a lot at CEB and work with some very smart people and even sharper clients. The work life balance is also pretty good. The problem is that the work tends to become extremely repetitive after about a year or two and upward mobility is extremely limited. Furthermore, upper management is still treating CEB as if it were a 200 person firm. Growing pains abound including antiquated performance metrics that handicap the company and stale, groupthink from upper management.Fun place to work for young professionals.  CEB has good training, but the career path is not as clear as they make it out to be.  High turnover.","1,001 to 5,000",Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-10-19T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/8d107634-8bba-4ea3-9c51-946476d5030e?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=26,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
58,4922.0,Staff Analytics Engineer – Installed Base,GE Power,4.1,163.0,"As being in a US company, ive seen through out the years how they establish a working space and culture that helps you interact with other people and everyone is willing to help no matter where they are or what they do, also it is so amazing how well structured the company is and how that simplify a lot of thingsToo many layers of management. Challenging to make changes. Great people to work with. A caring group that is very supportive.There was a corporate take over of Alstom Power by GE. As with all take overs, it adversely affected moral. Everyone had to re-apply for their own jobs, or an alternate job. Many were required to relocate. Some were laid off with benefits packages, and some were just fired.GE Power is a typical large company.  There is a large corporate culture that must be assimilated, and then you must learn to navigate the corporate politics.Typical day involves engagement on global projects and working with multi-cultural teams to achieve project milestones for shipment, installation, commissioning and handover to customer.It's a great place to work. You learn to deal and work as a team with Manufacturing, Planning and Engineering. There is a great environment to work. And you would need to do a lot of cross-functional activities to get the job done.productive, team work, interesting projects, benefits, supportive management and co-workers, learning culture, good tools and design methods, continues process improvement.Company is constantly going through changes,not impactful changes, with each regime of managers is the worst as before.Challenging work with a unique culture.  Solid teamwork with solid work-life balance. Going through some significant organizational changes due to a major acquiition.Good people to work with, executive team lacking vision.  Closing the GE Power Conversion Pittsburgh facility.  Jobs moving to Berlin, Germany.G.E. is a fast paced company .  They make important decisions quickly instead of holding multiple meetings and countless power points.I enjoy coming to work everyday and working on engines. management is on your back pushing to meet needs making you feel uncomfortable. co- workers are great, very flexable work schedule.I don't have much negative to say, I love to work here. The people are kind and like any place there are bad days but the job security is good and the company is making many good changes.My schedule was a bit unknown at times as I had to respond to emergency calls. I am nuclear certified, and take pride in my work. The Job description classified me as a Field Service Representative but I was considered a Hybrid. The position that I applied for was a Field Service Representative for Mobile site operations and data analysis. I was transitioned into the Beverage side and spent several weeks away from home. I have a Wife and 3 young kids so time away from home can be difficult on the home front. The up side to travel is that I'm use to it and can easily adapt if needed.I loved working there unfortunately they are closing boss where good benefits are great people are great just cant move to CanadaGE invested in our company and then later bought the company.  Our initial team was assimilated into the GE system which was, at times, challenging.  GE has a lot of rules, procedures, and GE speak that took some time to get used to.  I appreciated the challenges, however in running such a huge corporation.  Do you teach all of your employees Six Sigma, or only a certain group?The GE management team was tough but always fair.Since 11/02/2015, Alstom Power became part of GE.  With this alliance, the new GE power segment is now GE Power.   Overall, I think that it has been a good transition.  Now I'm just learning about this new company.There is always work, and the co-workers are friendly. The hardest part of the job is getting used to moving the heavy tanks from one place to another without a hand truck. Once you're used to it, it becomes really easy. The place is very safety oriented, and the workers are very helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you reach the end of the shift, and realize how much you were able to accomplish within 8 hours.Was allowed to work with great people from home.  There was a lot of different day to day task.  Customer and sales reps were very good to work with.Big company operating in nich market areas, with overall good market share, and stable balance sheet. Eight layers of management with 300000+ , however it still keeps buying out its competitors. Values experience but does not have a good system to measure it. Dominated by few groups like Aviation, Pratt Whitney, Rolls Royce, university alumni and other groups. Offers a good starting salary but later average 1-2% yearly increase. Healthcare benefits require 3000$ out of pocket before they start. Monthly health insurance payments are high. One has to carry a long list of approved prescription list to their doctor or risk paying the unauthorized prescription .Has 401K but it is limited to company stock and investment options.May be a good place for starters but not very good for mid career professionals.Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company.","10,000+",Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-10-18T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/ec407bfc-aa96-4f3c-9a44-7568cf241ba7?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

Things were going great and then some changes with our specialty pharmacy and stock price was affected.  Then came the layoffs!!I really do love the team which I get to work with, however I know many others are NOT happy.  Issues with management and available resources - we all wear many hats!I find Valeant Pharma increases my productivity by allowing analyses much more quickly and thoroughly than I previously was able to do. I think you have put together a great tool. It is clear that you have a great understanding of how to conduct company/therapeutic area analyses and have included that knowledge in Valeant Pharma.Productive Work, Balance Work, good co-worker, You learn a little of everything, a job not so strong, in a typical work day, it works well.terrible company to work for. They don't care about employees at all. they only care about buying and destroying companies while making money. they are also raising the drug prices out of control and firing employees from left to right and they hire contractors to avoid paying benefits.Great work-place environment.  Never was micro-managed and your opinion really matters.  Co-workers were great to work with and were always there if you needed help.  Fast paced job and had to be on your toes all the time.despite the news valeant was an amazing place to work. i had the best supervisor and amazing team. it was fast paced and i learned alotNo leadership whatsoever. Decentralized and fragmented at best. Lots of insecurity with no cooperation. Employees simply what to survive.A very fast paced environment very performance driven. Acquisition was the company's method of growth. I learn't to make do with as little as possible. decisions are made on the fly.valeant provides a great work life balance and compensates its employees accordingly. Typical day is like any other pharmaceutical rep. management is not very goodTwice Valeant has purchased smaller companies I've worked for and TWICE they ran those products into the ground.  Valeant has horrible management from the top to the bottom.  And all they care about is their bottom line!! $$$$ Don't take a job with Valeant and if they buy your company-----RUN!!!My performance helped make my time at Valeant valuable and rewarding. They pay for performance!The Hardest part of the job was dealing with upper management decision making. My co-workers were excellent as we worked very well together. My most enjoyable part of this job was working the my doctors and being a value to each and every office i called on.A good company to work for and has good benefits. It would be nice for a company of it's size to have the compassion for their employee's as the mom and pop companies do. Sad to say they don't.Get paid well but the company is going through a lot of changes. Large territories. Good coworkers. Employee stock purchase program generous if you get in at the right timethe culture at Valeant is not what I like at a place of work. Valeant doesn't care about employees or patients. They raised the price of drugs to unbelievable prices that no one can afford.Poor CommunicationVery little IT support.Slow response time or no response to call list updates.Purely profit driven company.Prepare to be 3 people to one person for work load, under staffedDifferent main frame systems management needs a Do overWater cooler co-workers/heavy office gossipThe hardest part was not having enough hours in a day and no overtime offered to consultants.The most enjoyable part was building relationships with the customers.Some Managers and Supervisors are very unprofessional. Work ethics sucks and childlike behavior. Department is unorganized and level of knowledge is minimum.Excellent job, goals clearly defined, production schedules and workload clearly defined.The Quality system is dynamic as well as the work ethic.Very clean and orderly manufacturing and solution prep areas.Company makes fast decisions.

73,4937.0,Clinical Research Scientist Physical Therapist,Shepherd Center,4.3,32.0,"Love Shepherd and the culture. Great place to work if you want to ""do good"" and feel like you're contributing to help patients. Horrible management, no advancement, but if you're OK with that, it's a great organization!Worse job I ever had, you kill yourself with turns every 3 or 4 hours , patients are very heavy and most of the time you have NO help because there is no ""team work"" nurses DO NOT help because they are ""busy"" in their phones. There is a lot of gossip, and if the patients have MONEY you have to treat them like your mother or you will get fired. Management is horrible please do yourself a favor and run run run.Shepherd center was a very nice place to work and to learn about more in the medical field I learned a lot dealing with paraplegics and quadriplegics and also with brain injuries ventilators and also tube feedings Skin Care the shepherd center was a great place to learn all types of research about paraplegic and quadriplegic and how to work with them so they are able to go home we work very closely with the families on training them on how to take care of their loved ones we also work closely with the patients so they knew how to take care of themselves and to also train other people people how to care for them!Great Hospital to work for. I highly recommend it to everyone.It has really helped me to sharpen my skills as a Certified Case Manager.Shepherd Center is an excellent non-profit organiztion to work for and all the employee through out the center are very professional and the hospitality is great. I have learned that everyone is treated fairly and kind. The Directors that I work for are the greatest they really care about their staff and if you have a family situation they are there without micromanaging. My co-workers are the greatest, this is the first organization where there everyone is very supportive of each other and works as a team. The hardest part of the job is trying to serve the consumers and the want answers right now instead listening to what is actually being said. The most enjoyable part of the job is having patience.Former respiratory therapist, wonderful patients and a feel good place to work. Management in the respiratory department needs a turnover desperately. Would be a wonderful place to work if management changed.Shepherd Center is a Hospital for people with brain and spinal cord injuries. A typical day of work consists of displaying a high level of customer care. The atmosphere at the Shepherd Center is very friendly and up-beat, which allows your caregiving experience one to remember.Very dilligent in work habits. Excellent turn around time for patients.Treated staff well. Good benefits/pay. Would not have left if under different situation.This hospital has been a wonderful learning tool as a young nurse.Coworkers are supportive and the administration constantly looks for new ways to improve employee satisfaction. Long hours with a great deal of physical activity such as lifting and turning patients. Great for obtaining well rounded skills of a registered nurse.Superior training and great management at the Shepherd Center. The shift hours are perfect for me as well as the location.Things really need to be shaken up in the middle management area. Most have been there for more than a decade and are stuck in the way that things have worked. Granted Shepherd Center has done some groundbreaking things in the area of TBI and SCI rehab but that does not mean there is no room for improvement. Management is often the cause of a lot of tension in the work place due to inadequate communication skills with the staff. There is also an air of mistrust that causes a lot of perception problems and often forced resignation or termination of a staff member which increases the already high rate of staff turnover - it's a vicious cycle that upper management is hopefully taking note of in their assessment of the hospital's programs. Management should learn to value and trust the people they hired to do their job and to contribute new things to the organization as the old ways that have been perfected are learned.I am a Outpatient Access Rep. I work in a high volume call center taking inbound and outbound calls from patients. I love my work because I know that what I am doing is key in the success of the Shepherd Center. I work very well with all of my coworkers and am known to be the life of the department. I am the one the will have everryone smiling and laughing even when they don't feel like it. The hardest part of the job would be seeing the injuries that our patients have substained in the accidents they were involved in but the best part about my job is seeing the progress and change of the before and after they become patients here.Participated in SCI research with classmates and team members. Performed subject recruitment, testing, data collection and analysis for arm and hand function of SCI patients.My co-workers were awesome here. I learned so much about Spinal cord and brain injury. Most of the patients are so thankful for your care and kindness.I learned so much at Shepherd Center, How to be able to multitask and being on time knowing you have a patient that needs to be at an appointment at a certain time. Learning different skills and keeping you certified in your profession with advancement every year.This a top of line work place for spinalcord and head tramria patiens .I learnwd alot there I was very young at the time .The people were very help surpotive of there stiff thats why I wsa there for 22 years.Working at the call center is different from working in thw clinic dealing with actual patients. You come in, log into your data system. For me, I'm either doing medications; where I call in prescriptions to various pharmacies. Or home health, where I send the doctor different paperwork about patient's lab results, reports, and/or wheelchair requests, as well as therapy requests.I work very well  to protect the policy and procedures..I respect team work and I have learned some much working for this company for 4.5 Years.The challenging part about my job was bowel programs,I literally prayed through my traning because I needed the job and it got better for me..I got alone with my co-workers.The Shepherd Center is a wonderful place for rehab. The management could work on there personalities and the way the interact with their employees.All Care for quads and parapalegic paients. Including but not limited to bowel /bladder management.I loved working at The Shepherd Center. This was a brand new build of the system for Shepherd. Although there was a huge learning curve for the staff, they were very understanding and wonderful to work with. I love a challenge, and with all the custom assessments, this was a challenge. What fun!",,Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-11-09T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/7b898ad3-c310-4438-bcc6-7605b36895dc?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
74,4938.0,"Scientist IV, Material Surface Characterization (Packaging Analytical)",Forest Laboratories,3.8,469.0,"The people here are wonderful to work with. I wish the company was a little less old fashioned and would allow telecommuting.Allergan is the result of mergers and acquisitions and as such comes changes and job uncertainty. As with all changes come some good management and some arrogant management, with the latter a reason for good people not to stay. When you hear the peers of the bad manager even criticizes them it make you wonder why they are kept on in the first place.Allergan is a strong company that has always had a great culture.  The work/life balance is good.  The benefits and good, but have been slipping over the last few years.  Following the merger with Actavis, the company has been overly focused on mergers and acquisitions and less concerned about research and growing existing product lines.It's awful to see and hear from others how poor or non existent the culture is at this place.  Management (including Jr/Sr/Executive) is so poor due to the fact the CO only wants to save a buck by putting inexperienced and bewildered people in place just to follow orders like clowns and repeat their superiors like parrots.  It's a good place to stay away from!Good culture with good leadership. Work life balance is not as good. Hard working people with a good compensation package. The opportunity for advancement is good since there are many divisions.The work is very easy an 3rd grader can do it, but the work environment and management is extremely poor. One the worst company's I have ever worked for. If one manager doesn't likes you the rest doesn't either, you never get off at shift end time. The worker's most of them are lazy and they don't do anything about it. They just had two lay offs and the last year and a half if you have standards do not apply for this company. The hiring manager feed you a bunch of lies to make you think it's a great company to only be hired and find out it was all lies!  Only great thing this company has to offer is health insurance.As far as warehouses are concerned, this was a laid back place to work but we also took our jobs very seriously. Management was great and co-workers worked hard.I worked there for over 5 years before the location shut down due to lack of work, combined with other reasons. I really did enjoy the responsibility that the job required.Allergan is a forward thinking company that considers its employees as an asset to its success. Great management teams and benefits. A global technology leader and is on the cutting edge of science and technology. They have great benefits and a strong team environment.selling devices, aesthetics and pharmaceuticals for a top notch fortune 500 leader. innovative and growth pharma on the frontier.  Selling to physicians, hospitals and group purchasing organizations and having the ability to negotiate contracts is a must.  you need to be driven and a leader. Management qualitiesAfter the Actavis merger and Allergan purchase, there was a rapid change in management  ( three managers in three years) that created a very challenging and strange work enviroment.This is review for the Allergan/Actavis (former Forest Laboratory, Inc.):Really fancy, high research culture, very productive and very good managed company. Very good team worked lab with very good relationship between workers and management.Direct following all FDA guidelines (cGMP, GLP).Dedicated to advancing treatment of Eye Disease. Extremely Pofessionalatmosphere, Loyal, Great company culture.Tremendous pipeline, with true advancements/first in class/first ever treatments.Specialty Sales- where Pharma reps are truly consultants.A tyical day at work begins with assessment of what previous shift had done and what is priority at the moment according to management business interest for the day.Team work are highly examplify in the way the process is arranged. No one person can run the process from start to finish. You need one or two people to verify part of the work you have done.The hardest part of the job is that some of the equipment in use is highly complex.Whenever target is met brings moment of celebration. This is my joyous moment.work was stressful long hours with no appreciation for employees hostile management rude and not caring of employees feelings coworkers were pleasant but also alot of drama and favoritism. the hardest part of the job was the lack of respectPleasant society of people to work in a lab.  Would have been nice to have a research facility at the location or access to a gym at the workplace.  In terms of advancement at the Waco location, there were none other than applying for a different position.  I enjoyed working for the company, their flexibility, management, and work environment.The people I work with throughout the US and even globally have been a real pleasure.  People are responsive and it's been a real team effort that's really hard to find these days.My only complaint is that the company is changing rapidly and there's really not a feeling of stability.  The buying and selling of assets is constant and at the highest level everyone else is just a number.  Once you get down to the director level and below it's the greatest of experiences, but the CEO only has corporate interests in mind.You can be relocated and happy you survived the most recent merger and then let go six months later in the next deal of a lifetime.Allergan is an awesome company to work for. You get surprise rewards and days off. Our Sr. Site Director has an open door policy. She listens and is really great. The company is understanding to life events and changes. We have a Monday thru Friday schedule only and get all respected holidays off with pay. You couldn't ask for more than that.Great teamwork environment. manageable travel requirements. Supervisors encourage autonomy.Excellent training for me as a new position in the role of MSL in a new division.Excellent small immediate team with great extensions.Hardest part of the job was back to back conferences is multiple cities.Best part of the job fostered independence with weekly conferences with supervisor.Allergan is a nice company to work for that offers many opportunities with great benefits.  The Orange County campus has amazing talent. Work hours are flexible for most positions.I was given opportunities to learn different trades. I worked with different people. I enjoyed getting to know about different departments. My supervisor was always there if I had any questions and gave positive feedback and constructive criticism.The majority of my career was with Forest Laboratories prior to the Allergan acquisition.  Forest was a family oriented environment where management and employees worked hard and cooperatively to ensure the highest quality work was achieved.  I am proud to say I had a successful 16 year career with this company until the acquisition, which resulted in the elimination of my department as well as all its employees.","10,000+",Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-10-31T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/5f2c287c-d001-43e5-b39d-f04544ec8224?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Ultimately, as long you have something to do on a daily basis you should be good to go. They have a low tolerance for being late, so assure you are well grounded with your work ethic. Free coffee in every corner of the building.Would recommend this company of many different levels. Job security, health benefits were above average, and company would show appreciation of it's employees with events and incentives.The company tends to overwork its employees, provides very little opportunity for promotion, misleads employees regarding job promotions, and the political management gets old working under.The work environment is driven hard by high demand of the product of a very fast growing company. The constant rush, demands, and near-emergency situations can be stressful if you don't enjoy that kind of pressure.Management practices are very well honed and modern, though advancement can be slow as new positions are often filled from outside the company. The company is full of highly dedicated, skilled, and hard working people generally providing a great work environment.The hardest part of the job is most likely the stress. It can be brutal at times.The most enjoyable part of the job is the people. Generally people that end up employed there want to be there and contribute and it makes for a great place to work, especially when the pressure is on.ISI pays well and offers attractive benefits, while producing a great product. The folks here are very accountable for their jobs and it's a fast-paced and fluid environment that always keeps the work interesting.The main weakness is that you can wind up in a bad group with a terrible manager... which when paired with the fast pace and high expectations, gets people to their pain thresh hold quickly. Despite the attractive pay and benefits, I haven't seen as many good employees running for the door when things go bad because it simply isn't worth putting up with the trouble anymore.indecent management could use replacement. long work hours but on the brighter side every 6 months you get evaluated for a raise.I love working for Intuitive Surgical!... and I don't want to leave, but on the same token, I miss being home & I miss being with my fur babies.Innovative company with great work life balance. Significant responsibilities given to junior employees makes Intuitive a great place to grow your career. Very laid back work environment.There really is not a typical day in the life of a da Vinci sales professional.  However, a day in the life of a sales manager could involve, a two to three day field ride with a rep, followed by conference calls and one:one performance calls with my team.  In the field ride day, starting off with a robotics committee meeting with the OR leadership and C-suite executives, discussing high level performance metrics and the strategy to guide improved economic and clinical outcomes.  Following, 3 cases with surgeons and staff at different points in the learning curve, using high direction, backed by clinical and technical expertise to, create successful outcomes not achievable with robotic technology.What I learned?  More than all of my work experience combined.  I learned to changing the standard of care requires building trust, delivering high value, create equal business stature with your customer base, be excellent in managing operations, highly clinical with the ability to sell in a compelling and provocative manner, be proactive in communication and leadership, and highly collaborative.  Collaborating with multiple internal sources even on a 5 minute call, can generate enough feedback to create the best plan to execute from.My peers and our leaders are the sharpest individuals in the medical device segment.  All driven to succeed while being accountable for helping everyone achieve success.The hardest part of the job is staying focused on the vital few action items that will create the desired results and any given stage of the selling process.  There are so many  more... things that we can act on, and picking the most important one that will compel behavior changing results.The most enjoyable part is leading my team and our customers to achieve results not thought possible.  Working with highly skilled and tenured clinical reps and finding a way to improve through every customer interaction is amazing.  Creating a collaborative work environment for our surgical customers to formulate higher efficiency in the OR, resulting in better patient care.  Coaching a surgeon to adopt a minimally invasive technique that will take a guaranteed open procedure and create a minimally invasive approach that will forever change the lives of the patients treated.  lessReceiving in defective materials from the field and working with OEM vendors to get these pieces of equipment repaired or replace to replenish inventory needs. The Inventory is for the Field Service Engineers that is our main priority to make sure they have the parts needed when visiting a site location.You may get what you want in pay but you will get twice the work. They ask people to work 10 hour days but really want you to work 12 hour days. Upper management is stiff and disconcerted form real people. The stock is no longer preforming as it did in its heyday but they still think they are at the top of the food chain. If you like to get chewed out in meetings this is the place for you.Hours are really long the management is good but they don't give opportunity for advancement. It can be stressful at times with lack of information to provide customers. Again expected hours during quarter end were 6 to 6I received some really great training here on lean mfg. 5S, commwip and they have a good quality management system  but my cell as they call the work groups had it own click and I didn't really fit in. Surprised that they did not find another job or cell for me to work in. I was never late and always did what they asked me to do. They wasted a weeks worth of training and I ended up at another company making more money. So glad I saved myself a years worth of time. I would go just for the training though. I think they really just hired me to get them through their quarter end but they were not honest about that from the get go.Everyday is never the same.  We are presented with challenges on meeting company and customer expectations.  This is to be expected in a fast paced environment.  Great place to work and grow.  Highly recommend.Very political and low pay, also they discourage overtime even after being told by recruiter that 10 percent of my pay would be overtime and was given a higher pay scenario.i work for this company about 2 years.i was assembler about 1 year and get promote to lead.i have learn form engineer and manager.my co-worker is fun, i just want all my guy do a good and quality job.my hard part is my guy is make to many mistake on the job.A positive work enviroment with friendly people. Heavy workload with a lot of pressure of building a quality product.

You are expected to take on many task without direction. I learned so much about FDA standards and documentation. Management moves around so much. Co-workers are very tired and stressed. FDA requirements are constantly changing. The pay was very good.I have nothing good or bad to say about Intuitive can not comment due to legal issues and the agreement have signedThis was 1 of the best jobs i have ever worked for.i had a early shift when i worked there ,which was great.at this company it did not matter what,the job was,the job was done at ease with a steady work flow.also at break or lunch they have coach truck on wheels come to provide meals.",,Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-08-17T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/8c3aeea7-ce88-455e-96ec-b4285037e5c1?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
79,4943.0,"Scientist, Med Imag Analysis",Emory University,4.1,263.0,"As an employee at the Woodpec, I helped students and faculty with gym access. I also helped them with directions and would be asked to assist with special events when needed.Good benefits and good people. Some zones are laid back and a pleasure to work in.  The housing zone is not one!The bad, do not pay enough to live within 25 miles of campus.  The pay rise goes to those in the crony system and the rest of us do not even get a COLA.  The rise is always less than the rise is benefits, parking and inflation whilst management hands out fat bonuses to themselves.Highly political environment with a lack of respect for veterans, usually by those who have never served. I've been there many years and still don't have a full set of uniforms.  Technologically challenged management has us carrying a 10 lb walkie talkie from the 70s, a flip phone, our personal phone and defunct ipads whilst trying to perform maintenance.  I feel like I am wearing a batman belt and trying to work without throwing out a hip or my back from the weight of the walkie talkie alone.Working for Emory University is great depending on the department you are working for. The benefits were very good and the University was good at acknowledging your accomplishments. However, some management teams can be uncaring, play favoritism when enforcing company policies and non communicative with department changes that affect your role within the department. Working with the staff and students can be a challenge but the diverse environment leaves plenty of room to create new friendships and partnerships across the campus.OMG I miss my Job with Emory.  They offer the best benefit package with matching on your 401k with 6.9% match, plus a guaranteed raise each year for performance and cost of living.  the best medical benefit package ever, they covered my fertility treatments.  I absolutely loved my Medical Director.  I can't say enough positive things except if you get in make sure you stay in.Stable place to work. Great benefits. Moves very slow. Very political. Not a place geared toward millennials: Not really flexible with scheduling, no real promotion potential, low pay, etc.. Many things that millennials look for in a new career are not here at Emory. They advertise things such as flexible scheduling, etc.. However, these they are not enforced throughout the University. My department also needs work with diversity and inclusion.Options to move within, great benefits, good work-life balance. Management varies depending on the school and type of work. I really enjoy working in the academic environment.Emory has a good work life balance, but there is not often a plan for advancement or a way to build upon your skill set. Management for the most part in my experience has always been supportive. Your co-workers as all do are in a range from some hard workers to others that are just here for the paycheck. The hardest part of the job is that no matter how hard you work they are very strict with pay scales and so you are rewarded the same, the hard workers and the dead weights. The most enjoyable part is that they have always been supportive of home life and if you need to do something personal.I would say working at Emory was pleasant. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting people and establishing long term relationships.this is such a supportive wonderful place to work. great benefits for all staff, faculty and students. i would highly recommendEmory University is a great organization to work for. The salary scale is rather low for the area but the benefits and job security make up for the low pay. I enjoyed my 5 year employment with the University. The work/life balance was very fair. The Emory culture is awesome!I loved working for Emory. Unfortunately during the time that I worked for them they did not have enough work for me to maintain my expenses. The rate of pay was great and the benefits, even,  for me as a per diem employee were amazing. I would go back to Emory in a second.Typical day is a coronary or a valve that may take an entire shift to complete due to training of Fellow's. Management changed over the course of my time here, but the one they have now I believe will take the department in a new direction as they bring younger people into the department for the culture to change with the advancement of medicine. Amazing surgeries that take place in this facility, so my learning was truly above and beyond! I always enjoy learning new things at work, so it was never a dull day. The hardest part was that as a strong employee, you get burnt out because the surgeons always want the most experienced in their room.Not enough employees or assistance. Over worked and under paid. Raises were insufficient but great benefits. Average company. Same concerns with other medical facilitiesEmory University is a very pleasant place to work. No micromanaging, extremely flexible schedules for most departments, and a pretty relaxed environment across many departments within the institution. Honestly, the work/life balance that is fostered within my department is unmatched; it's hard for me to consider trading it. However, the disadvantage that I find with Emory University is the lack of advancement opportunities for certain positions. There are some positions that have been deemed ineligible for advanced titles, and the hard part about that is once you're stuck in that type of position, depending on how specific the work is, it can be difficult to transition out. It is hard enough finding other positions in Emory without having to worry about how specific your current role is and whether or not it translates well for other positions; even though your title is generic and many others employees with the same title but in different positions are eligible for advancement, and also, there is actually an advanced title for the job category which actively used but it only applies to certain roles that have the same lower level title. To make this make sense, there are several program coordinators, but certain program coordinators in specific roles aren't eligible for advancement to program coordinator sr., which is completely unfair. In my opinion, Emory Central HR needs to take a long, hard look at their job descriptions and the positions that they are being applied to and make some revisions. A few other issues that I would like to mention outside of lack of advancement  more... are that 1. Once you are hired into a position based on your then current qualifications, i.e. high school diploma, but then later complete your bachelor's degree, it is hard to be reclassified or receive a pay increase commensurate with your new qualifications. 2. They would rather have one employee doing three jobs and paying them for only one than to higher adequate staff to get the work done.  lessI highly respect the leadership.Opportunities to advance.Each academic school has own sub-cultureAttracts world class talent and eventsVery diverse work environmentEmory has been my home for 16 years. It is a place where achievement is rewarded and hard work and dedication are praised.Emory University continues to be inquiry-driven, ethically engaged, and a diverse community, whose members work collaboratively for positive transformation in healthcare management and accessibility.The hardest part of the job was managing the office without sufficient assistance.  A lot was involved from maintaining memberships, updating software, training staff, managing annual the conference, orchestrating all logistics for various trips for members, communicating with international management team, reconciling finances/budgets/profits, placing/mailing weekly orders, maintaining stocked products, filing, answering phones, and entering all fundraiser donations, attaching proper literature per level of membership, and maintaing office calendars of events.Supervisor was very supportive and nurturing of his team members. He allowed professional and personal growth for team members. Colleagues help each other and value team work. Emory offers great benefits.I really liked this job because I got to work with animals and medical science five days a week, I could take the Emory Bus for free, and I also got free food for my snakes.My typical day at work is great i greet all my co-workers and my boss as i come in .I learned all the skills to do my job as well as to be a team leader.The management work well with me as i follow their  instruction on projects, i get along well with my co-workers we work as a team.There is no hard part on my job,it is always interesting.The most enjoyable part of the job is finishing the task completely with my team.•	Consenting and interviewing potential research participants, scheduling and overseeing study visits, and creating reports for IRB and NIMH•	Determining eligibility by administering the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders •	Point of contact for research participants and clinic patients; answering phones, and scheduling appointments			•	Managing electronic and physical patient files•	Verifying validity, and calling in refill or new prescription requests",,Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-08-10T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/e3245e65-9351-41c8-bed8-fd7131bb5457?mescoid=1900254001001&jobPosition=13,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
80,4944.0,"Scientist, Certifying",Quest Diagnostics Incorporated,3.8,2100.0,"Quest is a good place to work if you are out of college but with it being a very busy and fast pace lab, it makes training slow and also, long work days.A high volume laboratory that constantly keeps you on your toes.You learn how to manage your time in order to do your job productively and efficiently.  Management expects you to be able to do your job without too much supervision.  Co-workers are great and quite easy to get along with and are almost always there to give you a helping hand.  Hardest part of the job is being able to manage the different hours they may give you if they are short handed.  The best part of the job is that your constantly learning new tasks so that no day is ever routine.Used to be a great company, until they hired management with no people skills. Yes fast paced,  yes high volume company. Benefits are competitive and most coworkers are patient driven. Working for this company is an insult to employees. You are a number and can be replaced with PT employees easily. Women get paid less. If you are required to work overtime..... Dont expect to get paid for it. Then you are punished for working more as required by the department. A global company  who preaches ""patients first"" sure needs common sense. Be careful if you become a patient while your an employee. ..why because they truly don't care, no empathy and they steal your life. .Good luck and dont believe anything they tell you..you can see the character of their actions. Previously over 10 years employed. ... Glad I leftI have never posted a bad review on any employers that I have worked for before, but this one was different. At this company you are considered a number and not a person. Some parts of the policy were very unfair to the employees.  Management was not all bad, but some of them were very inconsiderate and obnoxious to say the least. Compensation could have been better, but benefits were good. I am very glad that I have been relieved from this company. It was very difficult to be effective in this position because of the criteria and expectations. We had to sit for hours trying to process the interviews to a suggested perfection expected not to mention how long some of the interviews were. This was not always easy to do because applicants are most sensitive to answering a lot of medical history questions.  No matter how hard you try it was not good enough. This position caused quite a bit of stress .The Company had a high turn-over rate. I would not refer anyone to work here. That is because I do care about people in general.Quest Diagnostics is a horrible company to work for especially as a phlebotomist. The pay is horrible and below other companies pay. The benefits are extremely expensive and you can still expect to pay 80 dollars out of pocket to see a physician. You are constantly under staffed and overworked and rarely get to take your breaks on time. There is a lot of pressure put on you for keeping wait times down but they do not provide the help needed. Supplies? don't count of having what you need on hand to do your job. Constantly running out of tubes and butterfly needles and having to send one of your staff members out of your already short ran location driving around to other locations to find the supplies needed. Management is horrible and do not help with these issues. I do not recommend working for this company! Go else where if you can!They lie, promise raises that never happen. If you are lucky enough to get one it's $0.08 after a year. They do not value their employees. Every day threatened that you are replaceable. Unable to transfer to different positions. Your manager will say bad things about you to ensure that you can never leave or transfer. Never able to get time off, even if planned and requested months in advance.I think Quest Diagnostics should care about there staff. They keep on changing procedures when incident happens. Need to know that some staff working graveyard should get more and the management should listen to us more.There is more to this company then what it could be. We should be able to contact the proper people there. when there is a problem. There are different shifts and the Grave yard shift is the hardest..A good company to work for overall.  Good, mostly helpful employees.  Very demanding supervisors and managers, who did not quite understand the difficulty of our jobs, but would always expect miracles.  Constant mandatory overtime, including intimidating employees to work overtime or face disciplinary action.  Not understanding that us, employees, have a life other than Quest Diagnostics.  Very little salary increase over the life of my employment, actually laughable.Quest drives for process improvement throughout the corporation reflecting in new and innovative ways to perform. Good stable company. Competent management in place. Run like a major corporation which leads to National deliverable focus vs. local deliverables which may be more applicable to your region.In the billing department, the upper management has no concern for most employees, they have their favorites and friends, they were allowed to bully and harass other employees, nothing was done, the managers and team leaders openly talked about other employees and their personal business.I truly loved the work part of my job, the company had great benefits.fun and excitied to be there  the management was awesome  and my co-workers we was a team the hardest part of the job was leaving when i was offered a position the salary was lower if got hired on i couldnt  except but this was a great job orange park floridaThe place is ran like a sweat shop, all about production and numbers. The manger of processing watches people on camera and pretends to be all the good of company but is only to make himself look good. The supervisors are all lying puppets. I wouldn't recommend this as a long term place to work.Very High collection volume you meet great people all day friendly and helpful co-workers. I learned a lot working for Quest Diagnostics the computer systems that they have are wonderful and informative to help accurately collect and process specimens. Although Management may have friendly and even helpful personality traits, It can make or break your experience as an employee. To be honest there really wasn't anything hard about  the it. The Most Enjoyable part of the Job for me would have to be the veni-puncture collection. I love putting patients at ease and hearing them say I didn't even feel that, this really makes my day because I want to assure them that I am concern with there well being and overall health.I love my co-workers.The patient load in high volume. the benefits are great. Management tends to hire outside for supervisors regardless of current employee's experience or education. That the reason I am currently looking outside of the companyI have been with Quest Diagnostics for almost 4 years and it has been a downward spiral. Management and the company only care about numbers. Nothing is uniform. It is hard to get questions answered and the job is tedious, but somewhat easy. The pay is on the lower end of being decent and the insurance is HORRIBLE. Co workers are unprofessional but some are friendly. The only thing enjoyable about this job is hearing the satisfaction in a doctor or patient's voice.This is a good place to work if you are looking for a place to gain experience working in the lab processing area's.  Co workers and management are not friendly or helpful.  No one seems happy there. Long hours.  The most enjoyable part of this job was getting off at the end of my shiftQuest is a okay company to work for, they value their customer, but not their employees so much. They give you 1 personal day per year and they count missing days against you when you have to call out. They 401k is awesome and also the insurance that they provide. I've work for them off and on for a total of 4 years.The manny patients that we see in this type set up  job help me very much in be coming a great phlebotomist, seen patients of all ages taking care of at least 50-70 patients gave me a great practice and experience. The harder part of the job was when dealing with small children its never easy to see them cry! Great team work help me to make my job more essay and enjoyable.Quest Diagnostics offered little room for advancement and lower than average salary for existing employees. New employees come in to company at much higher salary than existing.Very productive company. Hard to balance work and life. Requires mandatory overtime. Good pay and benefits. You get to meet alot of good people from different backgrounds. Management can be better.Quest is a wonderful place to work.  Great learning opportunities, the culture and atmosphere is respectful and kind.  The compensation is above the norm and very fair.","10,000+",Atlanta,Tucker,GA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/b1c68a58-fbee-4d6a-bcdc-34613b0d37da?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=14,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The guidance provided by the senior management is really a plus and overall the work culture is really great here.Great place where I was able to learn about the engineering field and at the same time was able to contribute with my knowledge of computer software systems.A lot of confusion when it came to scheduling;  Right hand didn't always know what the left was doing.  I didn't learn anything that I didn't know, may be a couple tricks from some of the other field technicians.  The field techs were good, and the most helpful.  A typical work day start with you going somewhere and then turning around and having to go somewhere else (hoping you had the right equipment with you).  Just a lot of confusion.Great company! Great benefits! Highly qualified and friendly staff that became like family! I fully enjoyed working for this company! If you are great with time management, responsible, hands on, easy to work learn hands on and able to work alone than this company is great for you!Pay was low for the work assigned. A lot of late pm and early am assignments with little turnaround time. Many job assignments in one work day and not enough time allocated to do proper inspections.Take jobs for services, dispatch technicians, perform soil & concrete testing, covering customers services with technicians at the time specified by customers.This job has give me more experience in geotechnical engineering. My co- workers/ bosses are very friendly. This job takes a lot of hard work, but it is very rewarding. The hardest part of the job would be waking up at an early hour to drive to a job site in another city, or having to stay in that different city over night.Management at my office at Terracon (Atlanta-Duluth) was very good about changing the safety attitude in the company, and always emphasized the reasons and resources to do our jobs safely. Most managers were very supportive of safety, and of promoting the junior staff. There was a really big emphasis on the numbers - chargability goals and budgets were talked about at least weekly. Most junior staff was cross trained in at least two services (Phase I, NEPA, wetlands, asbestos testing, etc.) to ensure that when work was slow that you could cross to another group. Each office operates as an individual Profit-Loss center. This allows each office to be more nimble and quick to respond to the local markets and to employee needs and ideas. However, it does not provide incentive to share work across offices. It was not uncommon that if someone in our office got a job in TN or MS, that we would keep it and spend more money traveling rather than working with an office more local to the project and spending less money. This also goes back to the focus on chargability.There was a lot of flexibility to make your own hours and to work from home frequently.Salary . Work 60 plus hours a week with absolutely no extra compensation or gratitude whats so ever!! Charge you too much out of your paycheck to use their company truck. Had one for the longest time last few  years took it away with no compensations at all. Cost me naturally more in fuel and tolls wear and tear on my car for same salary. And in office between 6am and 7am. Getting home maybe by 7pm or 8. Approximately an hour drive each way. :'(:-(:O:-(Typical work day- 7 am - 530 pmRecent changes in management have made me open to other options, however I'm not unhappy with my jobMy co-workers are a good group of people and very supportingThe hardest part of the job is the lack of being able to plan personal things more than 24 hours in advance.The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with clientsMy job consists of commercial construction inspections and materials testing such as testing concrete and soil densities and reinforcing steel inspections according to blueprint and engineering specifications.Here is what we were told when terracon bought out our company, ""you are not just a number to us. Here is your employee number, that's how we know who you are."" Bonuses can equate to fake money that can only be used at there silly online store with cheap merchandise which is like pulling teeth to use. They'll give you a truck to take, which you can take to and from work, good right? Then charge you for it and call it a state law....liars. Raises are stupid. Only the top few get good raises, so you can bust your behind and do well, but if the manager has his ""friends"" working there guess who.gets.the good raises. They do not.care if you want a life outside of work. Billable time is all they care about, so, when you take an approved paid vacation, it really hurts your billable hours, and you will be fired if your billable hours for the year don't meet their expectations. This company is set.up for the top paid employees to continue to do better while the ones that work hardest, the techs, get the.most scrutiny and fired easily. Any other testing company would be better to work for.Wake up early go to construction site test concrete lots of downtime and minimal physical work. lots of days with 12 hour shifts.Terracon is a first class company. Proper initiatives are in place to be sure every employee is taken care of at every level both personally and professionally. It's an employee owned company so much care is given to its employees. The benefits are good and management truly does walk the talk.typical day on the job, you have to drink alot of water and work hard and fast to complete the days work given, its normaly hot outside, so it can get exsausting, work hard and go home and rest for tomorrows day of work.Typical run-of-the-mill geotech company devoid of excitement, ingenuity, or passion. Works most on commercial real estate development that requires very little engineering expertise.professional team of engineers and project managers, exposure to a lots of great projects, opportunity for advancement. Long work hours during summer.Every day was different. Never knew where you were going to be and what you were going to be doing next. Worked many different time shifts to me clients needsMy location meant well in their actions but this ""employee owned"" company certainly did not have the employees in mind. As an hourly employee during the summer (our busiest time) they decide instead to hire on 5 unneeded interns to take our hours away. This is not a stable job and the job itself is meticulous, robotic, boring and dull. This is a mind numbing place. Now, I have a college education so this is part of the issue but still, there is so little variation it kills me. The co-workers are nice and the management is mediocre at best, they tend to only care about salaried employees. I learned how to take concrete samples and test for quality of concrete.Terracon is a bunch of people who think they are someone, needing to always be over your head. You apply for one job and they hire you for another, promising promotion and never getting it. Lab life sucks.Good co workers and managers to work with.Good experience to learn civil drafting.No room to grow with the company.  Just stuck at the same spot.","1,001 to 5,000",Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-09-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/3d147c5e-6303-44d7-a370-108a29563725?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=21,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

109,4973.0,Chemist II,Cryolife,3.7,11.0,"A typical day consists of numerous processes in flow that require heavy attention to detail, team work, and self accountability. I have learned how to create the product we produce as well as all the necessary procedures from product formulation to packaging it for shipping. Management is constantly searching for new ways to make production more time and cost efficient, as well as speaking with employees to obtain advice for bettering procedures. Co-worker relationships are  typically healthy and everyone is usually willing to lend a helping hand. The hardest part of the job is following behind fellow co-workers and trusting their integrity to their duties because one mishap from any person can halt a production. The most enjoyable part of the job is being in a process with co-workers that you can trust to do their job efficiently and are able to complete a process flawlessly.They will work you to death. Low pay, Advancement opportunities are rare. Look elsewhere. Fear and blame culture. This place will exacerbate any anxiety you already have.This is a great company to gain experience and get your foot in the door, but the pay is too low to really consider a career here. The new CEO has spoken about working on raising pay, and if that actually happens I will definitely reconsider looking elsewhere because other than pay, the company is great to work for.Nice company but no advancement opportunities present. Good job for people fresh out of college. I like the type of work they do, but not somewhere you would want to stay forever.Working in production, is simple and boring repetitive work. It's the same tasks, every day. With that said, the company is headed on the right track and does offer good benefits.CryoLife is a excellent place to work.  The job was challenging but the most fascinating part of CryoLife is that the company helps to save lives.  I was able to see first hand how the company helps families.  I worked directly with 2 sets of organ donor families and 2 sets of organ recipient families that had visited CryoLife.  I worked directly to welcome them as well as set up all of the audio video to broadcast their presentations.  CryoLife is growing rapidly and I was very disappointed to leave.Had several responsibilities in this role. - Created marketing and sales tools- Collaborated with R&D and the engineering department- Helped to resolve any product issues- Developed sales training and marketing plans- Helped to stay compliant with FDA- Supported the entire country and worked with sales forceThe most enjoyable aspect of the job was helping the sales force close business and being in the field with them.Working for this company was a challenge because it was a very busy, fast paced company. Lives depended on the speed in which products came in and out of the company. It was a company where everyone really worked together as a team and it felt like a family.The most enjoyable part of my job is the opportunity to work with various groups throughout the company.A mid-sized medical device and vascular tissue company with a history of providing customers with unique solutions. A typical day at Cryolife involves team work on every process. From staging of materials to aid the flow of production to cleaning of work stations.I learned about formulations, tissue processing, exposed to how to write SOP's and many other production related duties.Management was very hard working and open to feedback.Great co-workers.The hardest part of the job involved packing shippers on dry ice, very physical work.the most enjoyable part about the job involved filtering bulk solutions, and filling syringes.",201 to 500,Atlanta,Kennesaw,GA,2016-12-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/c67e14a6-c6ef-4119-8bf5-8a29475c0bbc?mescoid=1900259001001&jobPosition=8,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
