32,4896.0,"Associate Director Data Scientist, Patient Insights and Innovative Solutions (Atlanta, United States)",UCB,3.5,57.0,"Was Fortunate to grow from Collector to Supervisor, hire 80% of own staff, and developed them. Once had a new Manager my development increased, was always able to improve training programbecause that was one of my strong points.Typical Day was balanced between my Collectors, Clients, and fellow Supervisors along with other Corportate needs, however the priorties were the collectors and the clients.Doesnt keep their word about raises after 90 days, only the collectors that have been there 10 years or better are really the ones that gets incoming calls. And makes real money for a bonus check. I hate the fact the pay schedule is set days of each month.not a bad company if looking for a job.  If looking for a career, look elsewhere.  District managers are good senior management needs a self check.If you're looking for a place where your efforts are appreciated and your results are rewarded - skip this place. It it is simply not a place to build a career. It is a good place to work when you're in between jobs or if you're not the primary income of the household. Don't expect to be appreciated much, and make sure you only take this job if you have the flexibility to quit at the drop of a dime.great atmosphere, wonderful coworkers, wonderful management, great incentives, lunches were good. great feedback dailyThe culture at UCB is very positive with several avenues to advance your career. The training was extensive and very thorough. The management team was well trained and came along side the reps with a coaching and uplifting attitude. The co-workers all worked together as team players and we were able to have a lot of fun and get work done as well. The hardest part of the job was more industry wide not related to the company. It was seeing the physicians and getting in the offices with new policies of no lunches and only so many reps on certain days, etc.Co-workers are helpfulChallenging positionCan be stressfulPay is based on bonuses Monday through FridayNot a lot of training providedLearn mostly on your ownAlways busy, making phone calls or receiving phone calls. Convincing people to pay off their debt and even play with numbers a bit. Supervisors are always there to help and prepare you for different scenarios that you may come across of. Hardest part is finding the consumer and actually getting them to stay on the phone with you and not hang up.UCB is pharma company that has drugs for the central nervous system, GI and rheumatoid arthritis.Offer a pretty good retirement plan and other benefits.The people are fun.UCB offers education reimbursement.Too many people in management positions that don't know what they are doing.  Some haven't ever managed people before and their teams are used as experiments for them to become one with no formal training and transition.  Management should really truly value their team by their action and not giving lip service that doesn't add up.  You stay too long the place will drain you of all of your true intelligence because it seems like if you are clueless you are better off there than being an intelligent person.  If you value your job and work hard you are stuck in your position, but if you don't do anything and just look busy you will be great and set up for success!!What i enjoy most is the people at this company.  Everyone is very friendly and a great group to work with.Each day in the office im able to learn new things and build new relationshipsI enjoyed very much working for UCB for the last one year.I feel valued and got tons of support from management and my peers. I can truly say that I enjoy everyone who works here and that it is an environment in which I want to come to work every day and I'm proud to say I work here.""The fact the we all work towards the same goals truly fulfill meThis job was moved to a different state. I had mainly negative experiences working here, which helped me get motivated to change career paths.UCB is very demanding.  They are about collecting debt for their clients and making their goals for the month.  Management isn't the greatest, but they will get the job done.  Co-workers are nice but it's a job not a place to make friends.  The hardest part of the job is making the monthly goal when consumers don't want to pay their debt.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when you collect a lot and know that your in bonus.Ucb has opportunities to grow, but at slower pace being that there are so many vets in position. The company give those that are just getting out of school a chance for employment. Ucb offers insurance and incentives for all employees.easy place to work - caring management and excellent healthcare.Management is poor and the work ethics are low. Not a job I would recommend unless you need to something to get you on your feet.Billing to various insurance carriers. too many people in one room with half cubicles hard to concentrate because of noise volume.Making Outbound calls to customers into how to correct there debt situation.Advising customers on how they can settle their debt without making their finances being affected.making sure the sales have the right product and material to see the doctor sells the medicine the company offer them.its ok company to work for.hours are just enough.the hardest part of the job is getting clients on the phone",,Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-10-20T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/66d936ef-a6f8-427d-a1df-be74cad2cc3e?mescoid=1100011001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
