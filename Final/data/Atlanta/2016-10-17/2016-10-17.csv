33,4897.0,Sr Data Scientist - Fraud,Assurant,3.7,1100.0,"Sourced and purchased replacement products for people who purchased contracts on computers, monitors, printers, and other electronic equipment.I enjoyed working with my co-workers.A typical day is split between managing the day to day flow of the teams and problem solving new issues. We are in the process of implementing new formal processes in all areas. These require continual refinement. Each day presents learning opportunities in multiple ways. I strive to improve the effectiveness of my management technique with this new knowledge. My co-workers are hard working, dedicated professionals! The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the accomplishments achieved by the associates around me.I currently work in customer care for property loss and it's a nightmare. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work there. There is little room for moving up in the company. It's often hard to get help when you need it as well with a phone call. I know people that have been there 3-4 years and have never received a pay raise. I'm trying to catch the first thing smoking out of there. I don't know anyone on the customer care side that likes it. This company is also not for someone that has a family or small children. I'm currently on my 3rd schedule since I started there last April.A typical day was we would wait till the phone would ring and then would get them thru the process of filing a claim over the phone and to see if they qualify for a replacement device.   I learned on how the t-mobile exchange process works and u dont always get approved.  My co-workers were great people but they wanted to figure things out for your self.Hardest part of the bad was listing to the sad stories and not being able to helpAssurant Health was an inspiring, and fun place to work that gave GREAT benefits. I learned patience working for Assurant. The management and co-worker staff were a great group of people, always helpful and reliable. The hardest part of the job was knowing that it was closing. the most enjoyable part of the job were the Employee Events.When I started there the facility was owned by The Signal and it was an enjoyable place to work.  After The Signal was sold to Assurant the place changed.  Assurant has a good reputation for its various insurances businesses but does not seem to understand how a warehouse/manufacturing facility should operate.  Instead of advancing from within, the company started looking solely to outsiders to fill management ranks.Taking calls from insurance agents and customers in reference to homeowners policies, updating info., issuing payments on premiums. This position has made me very knowledgeable at the insurance industry and how lenders and insurance companies work together and the importance of insurance. I love a challenge ., the hardest part of my job was learning the insurance ""world""., the most enjoyable was definitely the people I worked with and assisting our customers and getting a bad situation turned around for the positive.So many negative changes have made the claims department  a toxic and disheartening place to work.  A few years back, it was a great place to work.  There was a sense of community and hard work was appreciated.  Since the arrival of new claims leadership, the department has suffered significantly, with a high turnover of good, experienced employees, replacing them with inexperienced,  entry-level ""yes men"".I've learned a lot in the past year and a half about Insurance, escrow, and mortgages. The hardest part about my job is not being active. I love helping others, so when I get a call from a homeowner and I'm able to help them it makes my day. The management team seems to work well together and try their best to help every when available. I've learned how to listen fully overall.The work atmosphere is very regimented. You take your breaks and lunch (30min) with everyone else at a set time. You have to remain quiet throughout the day, being social is not encouraged. However the latest pop hits are continually beamed from the loudspeakers, and although its not very loud, it is distracting to hear the same songs over and over again about once every hour. The training process consists of someone sitting over your shoulder watching you work ALL DAY, every day pointing out errors, which makes it harder to concentrate. This goes on for months. It's not at all a friendly environment, very strict with little to no interaction with coworkers. Most just stare at their screens with a scowl on their face most times anyway.Not a great place to work .Too much into performance driving and not about the customer. They also pay temps more verses direct hires. The 3 years I worked there I was assigned to three different clients. Very unstable work environment with high turnover ratio. The pay was also a factor. Who wants to work for a 1% pay raise?I help assist homeowners with their homeowners insurance, ensuring that they have sufficient coverage. I also aid in any questions they may have, also help with property loss when the customer has a loss with the home.I worked here 3 1/2 years, I was doing exceptional well, but it was so hard to get promoted or move around within the company. They are so difficult working with when it comes to requesting off. They are constantly increasing the work load every other month but wont increase your pay. The company is a joke to work for.On any given day you are constantly engaged with employees and customers. The company has done a good job of encouraging continued learning to diversify your skills while broadening your scope of work. Due to regulatory changes the Specialty Property division has undergone some shifts lately resulting in reductions in force. Senior leaders have really encouraged employees to understand a successful change model. There are some great individuals throughout the company.The hardest part of the job is to encourage peers, management, and direct reports during a visible shift and reduction in force. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping employees develop their skill set to better position them for future change.Great place to work in with a fast paced environment. Management is great. Co-workers are very friendly and the office has great ammenities. Hardest part of the job is the attrition causes work overload on the existing adjusters in order to get the job done. The most enjoyable part of this  job is being able to satisfy an insured that has suffered a loss by idemdifying them back to the condition they were prior to their loss. We are the insureds 911.This job was very easy for me to learn how to do and allowed me to eventually train others to do what I had learned. Although the work and job duties can sometimes become monotonous and repetitious, the ability to converse with nearby work colleagues makes it easier to more fun to get through the day.When I first started at this company I enjoyed it much more than when I left. I enjoyed having a stack of paperwork that needed done by the end of the day. When it was decided that another department would be merged with the one I worked in, there were too many people away from their desks not working than actually getting the work done.Assurant is a great company to work at. Focused on their employees and their development.Has an onsite day care and elementary school for employees kids only.Great Campus. Onsite Cafeteria is amazing.Normally people work there until retirement.I really enjoyed working at Assurant. My typical day was cosmetically and functionally testing new devices that were sent in.  I was really impressed with the open door policy that we had with our supervisor. The genuinely took our suggestions seriously and if it helped with the process they acknowledged the employee that helped implement the new procedure. The hardest part of the job was sitting for 10 hours. I really enjoyed the fact that we worked four ten hour days.- pour training - rushed at learning - pour slow systems - pour management Pour communication especially with new employees Expecting them to know everything in three weeks I was hired on through a company agency, received no feedback on my progress I was doing my best to learn System navigation was a mess but took my time to learn My agency called me late evening informing me that the company has to let me go, the company didn't have the guts to say that to my face I could not go back the next day to retrieve my personal belongings, company assured me it takes time to learn everything not to rush myself take my time ask questions which I did but I never got the opportunity to prove myself to the company with their lies of training time would be 4 to 6Weeks.Enjoyable workplace which provided a through knowledge of the individual health insurance industry. The company was huge on cross training, and the more you learned the more valuable you became to the company. This allowed the company to move you to other departments based on the business needs, which overall helped with your job security.","10,000+",Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-10-17T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/3b8f8060-9527-47dc-bf09-247f2a125c2e?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
