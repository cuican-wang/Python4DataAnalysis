79,4943.0,"Scientist, Med Imag Analysis",Emory University,4.1,263.0,"As an employee at the Woodpec, I helped students and faculty with gym access. I also helped them with directions and would be asked to assist with special events when needed.Good benefits and good people. Some zones are laid back and a pleasure to work in.  The housing zone is not one!The bad, do not pay enough to live within 25 miles of campus.  The pay rise goes to those in the crony system and the rest of us do not even get a COLA.  The rise is always less than the rise is benefits, parking and inflation whilst management hands out fat bonuses to themselves.Highly political environment with a lack of respect for veterans, usually by those who have never served. I've been there many years and still don't have a full set of uniforms.  Technologically challenged management has us carrying a 10 lb walkie talkie from the 70s, a flip phone, our personal phone and defunct ipads whilst trying to perform maintenance.  I feel like I am wearing a batman belt and trying to work without throwing out a hip or my back from the weight of the walkie talkie alone.Working for Emory University is great depending on the department you are working for. The benefits were very good and the University was good at acknowledging your accomplishments. However, some management teams can be uncaring, play favoritism when enforcing company policies and non communicative with department changes that affect your role within the department. Working with the staff and students can be a challenge but the diverse environment leaves plenty of room to create new friendships and partnerships across the campus.OMG I miss my Job with Emory.  They offer the best benefit package with matching on your 401k with 6.9% match, plus a guaranteed raise each year for performance and cost of living.  the best medical benefit package ever, they covered my fertility treatments.  I absolutely loved my Medical Director.  I can't say enough positive things except if you get in make sure you stay in.Stable place to work. Great benefits. Moves very slow. Very political. Not a place geared toward millennials: Not really flexible with scheduling, no real promotion potential, low pay, etc.. Many things that millennials look for in a new career are not here at Emory. They advertise things such as flexible scheduling, etc.. However, these they are not enforced throughout the University. My department also needs work with diversity and inclusion.Options to move within, great benefits, good work-life balance. Management varies depending on the school and type of work. I really enjoy working in the academic environment.Emory has a good work life balance, but there is not often a plan for advancement or a way to build upon your skill set. Management for the most part in my experience has always been supportive. Your co-workers as all do are in a range from some hard workers to others that are just here for the paycheck. The hardest part of the job is that no matter how hard you work they are very strict with pay scales and so you are rewarded the same, the hard workers and the dead weights. The most enjoyable part is that they have always been supportive of home life and if you need to do something personal.I would say working at Emory was pleasant. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting people and establishing long term relationships.this is such a supportive wonderful place to work. great benefits for all staff, faculty and students. i would highly recommendEmory University is a great organization to work for. The salary scale is rather low for the area but the benefits and job security make up for the low pay. I enjoyed my 5 year employment with the University. The work/life balance was very fair. The Emory culture is awesome!I loved working for Emory. Unfortunately during the time that I worked for them they did not have enough work for me to maintain my expenses. The rate of pay was great and the benefits, even,  for me as a per diem employee were amazing. I would go back to Emory in a second.Typical day is a coronary or a valve that may take an entire shift to complete due to training of Fellow's. Management changed over the course of my time here, but the one they have now I believe will take the department in a new direction as they bring younger people into the department for the culture to change with the advancement of medicine. Amazing surgeries that take place in this facility, so my learning was truly above and beyond! I always enjoy learning new things at work, so it was never a dull day. The hardest part was that as a strong employee, you get burnt out because the surgeons always want the most experienced in their room.Not enough employees or assistance. Over worked and under paid. Raises were insufficient but great benefits. Average company. Same concerns with other medical facilitiesEmory University is a very pleasant place to work. No micromanaging, extremely flexible schedules for most departments, and a pretty relaxed environment across many departments within the institution. Honestly, the work/life balance that is fostered within my department is unmatched; it's hard for me to consider trading it. However, the disadvantage that I find with Emory University is the lack of advancement opportunities for certain positions. There are some positions that have been deemed ineligible for advanced titles, and the hard part about that is once you're stuck in that type of position, depending on how specific the work is, it can be difficult to transition out. It is hard enough finding other positions in Emory without having to worry about how specific your current role is and whether or not it translates well for other positions; even though your title is generic and many others employees with the same title but in different positions are eligible for advancement, and also, there is actually an advanced title for the job category which actively used but it only applies to certain roles that have the same lower level title. To make this make sense, there are several program coordinators, but certain program coordinators in specific roles aren't eligible for advancement to program coordinator sr., which is completely unfair. In my opinion, Emory Central HR needs to take a long, hard look at their job descriptions and the positions that they are being applied to and make some revisions. A few other issues that I would like to mention outside of lack of advancement  more... are that 1. Once you are hired into a position based on your then current qualifications, i.e. high school diploma, but then later complete your bachelor's degree, it is hard to be reclassified or receive a pay increase commensurate with your new qualifications. 2. They would rather have one employee doing three jobs and paying them for only one than to higher adequate staff to get the work done.  lessI highly respect the leadership.Opportunities to advance.Each academic school has own sub-cultureAttracts world class talent and eventsVery diverse work environmentEmory has been my home for 16 years. It is a place where achievement is rewarded and hard work and dedication are praised.Emory University continues to be inquiry-driven, ethically engaged, and a diverse community, whose members work collaboratively for positive transformation in healthcare management and accessibility.The hardest part of the job was managing the office without sufficient assistance.  A lot was involved from maintaining memberships, updating software, training staff, managing annual the conference, orchestrating all logistics for various trips for members, communicating with international management team, reconciling finances/budgets/profits, placing/mailing weekly orders, maintaining stocked products, filing, answering phones, and entering all fundraiser donations, attaching proper literature per level of membership, and maintaing office calendars of events.Supervisor was very supportive and nurturing of his team members. He allowed professional and personal growth for team members. Colleagues help each other and value team work. Emory offers great benefits.I really liked this job because I got to work with animals and medical science five days a week, I could take the Emory Bus for free, and I also got free food for my snakes.My typical day at work is great i greet all my co-workers and my boss as i come in .I learned all the skills to do my job as well as to be a team leader.The management work well with me as i follow their  instruction on projects, i get along well with my co-workers we work as a team.There is no hard part on my job,it is always interesting.The most enjoyable part of the job is finishing the task completely with my team.•	Consenting and interviewing potential research participants, scheduling and overseeing study visits, and creating reports for IRB and NIMH•	Determining eligibility by administering the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders •	Point of contact for research participants and clinic patients; answering phones, and scheduling appointments			•	Managing electronic and physical patient files•	Verifying validity, and calling in refill or new prescription requests",,Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-08-10T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/e3245e65-9351-41c8-bed8-fd7131bb5457?mescoid=1900254001001&jobPosition=13,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
