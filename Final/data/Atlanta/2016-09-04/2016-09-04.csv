87,4951.0,Staff Asbestos Scientist,Terracon,3.1,67.0,"Terracon is a great place for the beginners. The guidance provided by the senior management is really a plus and overall the work culture is really great here.Great place where I was able to learn about the engineering field and at the same time was able to contribute with my knowledge of computer software systems.A lot of confusion when it came to scheduling;  Right hand didn't always know what the left was doing.  I didn't learn anything that I didn't know, may be a couple tricks from some of the other field technicians.  The field techs were good, and the most helpful.  A typical work day start with you going somewhere and then turning around and having to go somewhere else (hoping you had the right equipment with you).  Just a lot of confusion.Great company! Great benefits! Highly qualified and friendly staff that became like family! I fully enjoyed working for this company! If you are great with time management, responsible, hands on, easy to work learn hands on and able to work alone than this company is great for you!Pay was low for the work assigned. A lot of late pm and early am assignments with little turnaround time. Many job assignments in one work day and not enough time allocated to do proper inspections.Take jobs for services, dispatch technicians, perform soil & concrete testing, covering customers services with technicians at the time specified by customers.This job has give me more experience in geotechnical engineering. My co- workers/ bosses are very friendly. This job takes a lot of hard work, but it is very rewarding. The hardest part of the job would be waking up at an early hour to drive to a job site in another city, or having to stay in that different city over night.Management at my office at Terracon (Atlanta-Duluth) was very good about changing the safety attitude in the company, and always emphasized the reasons and resources to do our jobs safely. Most managers were very supportive of safety, and of promoting the junior staff. There was a really big emphasis on the numbers - chargability goals and budgets were talked about at least weekly. Most junior staff was cross trained in at least two services (Phase I, NEPA, wetlands, asbestos testing, etc.) to ensure that when work was slow that you could cross to another group. Each office operates as an individual Profit-Loss center. This allows each office to be more nimble and quick to respond to the local markets and to employee needs and ideas. However, it does not provide incentive to share work across offices. It was not uncommon that if someone in our office got a job in TN or MS, that we would keep it and spend more money traveling rather than working with an office more local to the project and spending less money. This also goes back to the focus on chargability.There was a lot of flexibility to make your own hours and to work from home frequently.Salary . Work 60 plus hours a week with absolutely no extra compensation or gratitude whats so ever!! Charge you too much out of your paycheck to use their company truck. Had one for the longest time last few  years took it away with no compensations at all. Cost me naturally more in fuel and tolls wear and tear on my car for same salary. And in office between 6am and 7am. Getting home maybe by 7pm or 8. Approximately an hour drive each way. :'(:-(:O:-(Typical work day- 7 am - 530 pmRecent changes in management have made me open to other options, however I'm not unhappy with my jobMy co-workers are a good group of people and very supportingThe hardest part of the job is the lack of being able to plan personal things more than 24 hours in advance.The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with clientsMy job consists of commercial construction inspections and materials testing such as testing concrete and soil densities and reinforcing steel inspections according to blueprint and engineering specifications.Here is what we were told when terracon bought out our company, ""you are not just a number to us. Here is your employee number, that's how we know who you are."" Bonuses can equate to fake money that can only be used at there silly online store with cheap merchandise which is like pulling teeth to use. They'll give you a truck to take, which you can take to and from work, good right? Then charge you for it and call it a state law....liars. Raises are stupid. Only the top few get good raises, so you can bust your behind and do well, but if the manager has his ""friends"" working there guess who.gets.the good raises. They do not.care if you want a life outside of work. Billable time is all they care about, so, when you take an approved paid vacation, it really hurts your billable hours, and you will be fired if your billable hours for the year don't meet their expectations. This company is set.up for the top paid employees to continue to do better while the ones that work hardest, the techs, get the.most scrutiny and fired easily. Any other testing company would be better to work for.Wake up early go to construction site test concrete lots of downtime and minimal physical work. lots of days with 12 hour shifts.Terracon is a first class company. Proper initiatives are in place to be sure every employee is taken care of at every level both personally and professionally. It's an employee owned company so much care is given to its employees. The benefits are good and management truly does walk the talk.typical day on the job, you have to drink alot of water and work hard and fast to complete the days work given, its normaly hot outside, so it can get exsausting, work hard and go home and rest for tomorrows day of work.Typical run-of-the-mill geotech company devoid of excitement, ingenuity, or passion. Works most on commercial real estate development that requires very little engineering expertise.professional team of engineers and project managers, exposure to a lots of great projects, opportunity for advancement. Long work hours during summer.Every day was different. Never knew where you were going to be and what you were going to be doing next. Worked many different time shifts to me clients needsMy location meant well in their actions but this ""employee owned"" company certainly did not have the employees in mind. As an hourly employee during the summer (our busiest time) they decide instead to hire on 5 unneeded interns to take our hours away. This is not a stable job and the job itself is meticulous, robotic, boring and dull. This is a mind numbing place. Now, I have a college education so this is part of the issue but still, there is so little variation it kills me. The co-workers are nice and the management is mediocre at best, they tend to only care about salaried employees. I learned how to take concrete samples and test for quality of concrete.Terracon is a bunch of people who think they are someone, needing to always be over your head. You apply for one job and they hire you for another, promising promotion and never getting it. Lab life sucks.Good co workers and managers to work with.Good experience to learn civil drafting.No room to grow with the company.  Just stuck at the same spot.","1,001 to 5,000",Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-09-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/3d147c5e-6303-44d7-a370-108a29563725?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=21,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
