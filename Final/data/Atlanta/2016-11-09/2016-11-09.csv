73,4937.0,Clinical Research Scientist Physical Therapist,Shepherd Center,4.3,32.0,"Love Shepherd and the culture. Great place to work if you want to ""do good"" and feel like you're contributing to help patients. Horrible management, no advancement, but if you're OK with that, it's a great organization!Worse job I ever had, you kill yourself with turns every 3 or 4 hours , patients are very heavy and most of the time you have NO help because there is no ""team work"" nurses DO NOT help because they are ""busy"" in their phones. There is a lot of gossip, and if the patients have MONEY you have to treat them like your mother or you will get fired. Management is horrible please do yourself a favor and run run run.Shepherd center was a very nice place to work and to learn about more in the medical field I learned a lot dealing with paraplegics and quadriplegics and also with brain injuries ventilators and also tube feedings Skin Care the shepherd center was a great place to learn all types of research about paraplegic and quadriplegic and how to work with them so they are able to go home we work very closely with the families on training them on how to take care of their loved ones we also work closely with the patients so they knew how to take care of themselves and to also train other people people how to care for them!Great Hospital to work for. I highly recommend it to everyone.It has really helped me to sharpen my skills as a Certified Case Manager.Shepherd Center is an excellent non-profit organiztion to work for and all the employee through out the center are very professional and the hospitality is great. I have learned that everyone is treated fairly and kind. The Directors that I work for are the greatest they really care about their staff and if you have a family situation they are there without micromanaging. My co-workers are the greatest, this is the first organization where there everyone is very supportive of each other and works as a team. The hardest part of the job is trying to serve the consumers and the want answers right now instead listening to what is actually being said. The most enjoyable part of the job is having patience.Former respiratory therapist, wonderful patients and a feel good place to work. Management in the respiratory department needs a turnover desperately. Would be a wonderful place to work if management changed.Shepherd Center is a Hospital for people with brain and spinal cord injuries. A typical day of work consists of displaying a high level of customer care. The atmosphere at the Shepherd Center is very friendly and up-beat, which allows your caregiving experience one to remember.Very dilligent in work habits. Excellent turn around time for patients.Treated staff well. Good benefits/pay. Would not have left if under different situation.This hospital has been a wonderful learning tool as a young nurse.Coworkers are supportive and the administration constantly looks for new ways to improve employee satisfaction. Long hours with a great deal of physical activity such as lifting and turning patients. Great for obtaining well rounded skills of a registered nurse.Superior training and great management at the Shepherd Center. The shift hours are perfect for me as well as the location.Things really need to be shaken up in the middle management area. Most have been there for more than a decade and are stuck in the way that things have worked. Granted Shepherd Center has done some groundbreaking things in the area of TBI and SCI rehab but that does not mean there is no room for improvement. Management is often the cause of a lot of tension in the work place due to inadequate communication skills with the staff. There is also an air of mistrust that causes a lot of perception problems and often forced resignation or termination of a staff member which increases the already high rate of staff turnover - it's a vicious cycle that upper management is hopefully taking note of in their assessment of the hospital's programs. Management should learn to value and trust the people they hired to do their job and to contribute new things to the organization as the old ways that have been perfected are learned.I am a Outpatient Access Rep. I work in a high volume call center taking inbound and outbound calls from patients. I love my work because I know that what I am doing is key in the success of the Shepherd Center. I work very well with all of my coworkers and am known to be the life of the department. I am the one the will have everryone smiling and laughing even when they don't feel like it. The hardest part of the job would be seeing the injuries that our patients have substained in the accidents they were involved in but the best part about my job is seeing the progress and change of the before and after they become patients here.Participated in SCI research with classmates and team members. Performed subject recruitment, testing, data collection and analysis for arm and hand function of SCI patients.My co-workers were awesome here. I learned so much about Spinal cord and brain injury. Most of the patients are so thankful for your care and kindness.I learned so much at Shepherd Center, How to be able to multitask and being on time knowing you have a patient that needs to be at an appointment at a certain time. Learning different skills and keeping you certified in your profession with advancement every year.This a top of line work place for spinalcord and head tramria patiens .I learnwd alot there I was very young at the time .The people were very help surpotive of there stiff thats why I wsa there for 22 years.Working at the call center is different from working in thw clinic dealing with actual patients. You come in, log into your data system. For me, I'm either doing medications; where I call in prescriptions to various pharmacies. Or home health, where I send the doctor different paperwork about patient's lab results, reports, and/or wheelchair requests, as well as therapy requests.I work very well  to protect the policy and procedures..I respect team work and I have learned some much working for this company for 4.5 Years.The challenging part about my job was bowel programs,I literally prayed through my traning because I needed the job and it got better for me..I got alone with my co-workers.The Shepherd Center is a wonderful place for rehab. The management could work on there personalities and the way the interact with their employees.All Care for quads and parapalegic paients. Including but not limited to bowel /bladder management.I loved working at The Shepherd Center. This was a brand new build of the system for Shepherd. Although there was a huge learning curve for the staff, they were very understanding and wonderful to work with. I love a challenge, and with all the custom assessments, this was a challenge. What fun!",,Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-11-09T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/7b898ad3-c310-4438-bcc6-7605b36895dc?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
