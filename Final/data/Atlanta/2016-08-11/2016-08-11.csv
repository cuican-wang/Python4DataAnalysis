63,4927.0,Senior Medical Science Liaison (Southeast),Valeant Pharmaceuticals,3.2,42.0,"Great place to work if your getting your feet wet in this industry, good pay starting out nice breaks and good people who aim to help prolong the life of another no better feeling.Great place to work and good bonuses but job security can change fast.  Things were going great and then some changes with our specialty pharmacy and stock price was affected.  Then came the layoffs!!I really do love the team which I get to work with, however I know many others are NOT happy.  Issues with management and available resources - we all wear many hats!I find Valeant Pharma increases my productivity by allowing analyses much more quickly and thoroughly than I previously was able to do. I think you have put together a great tool. It is clear that you have a great understanding of how to conduct company/therapeutic area analyses and have included that knowledge in Valeant Pharma.Productive Work, Balance Work, good co-worker, You learn a little of everything, a job not so strong, in a typical work day, it works well.terrible company to work for. They don't care about employees at all. they only care about buying and destroying companies while making money. they are also raising the drug prices out of control and firing employees from left to right and they hire contractors to avoid paying benefits.Great work-place environment.  Never was micro-managed and your opinion really matters.  Co-workers were great to work with and were always there if you needed help.  Fast paced job and had to be on your toes all the time.despite the news valeant was an amazing place to work. i had the best supervisor and amazing team. it was fast paced and i learned alotNo leadership whatsoever. Decentralized and fragmented at best. Lots of insecurity with no cooperation. Employees simply what to survive.A very fast paced environment very performance driven. Acquisition was the company's method of growth. I learn't to make do with as little as possible. decisions are made on the fly.valeant provides a great work life balance and compensates its employees accordingly. Typical day is like any other pharmaceutical rep. management is not very goodTwice Valeant has purchased smaller companies I've worked for and TWICE they ran those products into the ground.  Valeant has horrible management from the top to the bottom.  And all they care about is their bottom line!! $$$$ Don't take a job with Valeant and if they buy your company-----RUN!!!My performance helped make my time at Valeant valuable and rewarding. They pay for performance!The Hardest part of the job was dealing with upper management decision making. My co-workers were excellent as we worked very well together. My most enjoyable part of this job was working the my doctors and being a value to each and every office i called on.A good company to work for and has good benefits. It would be nice for a company of it's size to have the compassion for their employee's as the mom and pop companies do. Sad to say they don't.Get paid well but the company is going through a lot of changes. Large territories. Good coworkers. Employee stock purchase program generous if you get in at the right timethe culture at Valeant is not what I like at a place of work. Valeant doesn't care about employees or patients. They raised the price of drugs to unbelievable prices that no one can afford.Poor CommunicationVery little IT support.Slow response time or no response to call list updates.Purely profit driven company.Prepare to be 3 people to one person for work load, under staffedDifferent main frame systems management needs a Do overWater cooler co-workers/heavy office gossipThe hardest part was not having enough hours in a day and no overtime offered to consultants.The most enjoyable part was building relationships with the customers.Some Managers and Supervisors are very unprofessional. Work ethics sucks and childlike behavior. Department is unorganized and level of knowledge is minimum.Excellent job, goals clearly defined, production schedules and workload clearly defined.The Quality system is dynamic as well as the work ethic.Very clean and orderly manufacturing and solution prep areas.Company makes fast decisions.  Horrible internal and external communication.  Pay much better than most pharma companies.",,Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-08-11T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/ba31ac60-e1a9-40bf-b7bc-50cb0e684f06?mescoid=1900254001001&jobPosition=32,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
