58,4922.0,Staff Analytics Engineer â€“ Installed Base,GE Power,4.1,163.0,"As being in a US company, ive seen through out the years how they establish a working space and culture that helps you interact with other people and everyone is willing to help no matter where they are or what they do, also it is so amazing how well structured the company is and how that simplify a lot of thingsToo many layers of management. Challenging to make changes. Great people to work with. A caring group that is very supportive.There was a corporate take over of Alstom Power by GE. As with all take overs, it adversely affected moral. Everyone had to re-apply for their own jobs, or an alternate job. Many were required to relocate. Some were laid off with benefits packages, and some were just fired.GE Power is a typical large company.  There is a large corporate culture that must be assimilated, and then you must learn to navigate the corporate politics.Typical day involves engagement on global projects and working with multi-cultural teams to achieve project milestones for shipment, installation, commissioning and handover to customer.It's a great place to work. You learn to deal and work as a team with Manufacturing, Planning and Engineering. There is a great environment to work. And you would need to do a lot of cross-functional activities to get the job done.productive, team work, interesting projects, benefits, supportive management and co-workers, learning culture, good tools and design methods, continues process improvement.Company is constantly going through changes,not impactful changes, with each regime of managers is the worst as before.Challenging work with a unique culture.  Solid teamwork with solid work-life balance. Going through some significant organizational changes due to a major acquiition.Good people to work with, executive team lacking vision.  Closing the GE Power Conversion Pittsburgh facility.  Jobs moving to Berlin, Germany.G.E. is a fast paced company .  They make important decisions quickly instead of holding multiple meetings and countless power points.I enjoy coming to work everyday and working on engines. management is on your back pushing to meet needs making you feel uncomfortable. co- workers are great, very flexable work schedule.I don't have much negative to say, I love to work here. The people are kind and like any place there are bad days but the job security is good and the company is making many good changes.My schedule was a bit unknown at times as I had to respond to emergency calls. I am nuclear certified, and take pride in my work. The Job description classified me as a Field Service Representative but I was considered a Hybrid. The position that I applied for was a Field Service Representative for Mobile site operations and data analysis. I was transitioned into the Beverage side and spent several weeks away from home. I have a Wife and 3 young kids so time away from home can be difficult on the home front. The up side to travel is that I'm use to it and can easily adapt if needed.I loved working there unfortunately they are closing boss where good benefits are great people are great just cant move to CanadaGE invested in our company and then later bought the company.  Our initial team was assimilated into the GE system which was, at times, challenging.  GE has a lot of rules, procedures, and GE speak that took some time to get used to.  I appreciated the challenges, however in running such a huge corporation.  Do you teach all of your employees Six Sigma, or only a certain group?The GE management team was tough but always fair.Since 11/02/2015, Alstom Power became part of GE.  With this alliance, the new GE power segment is now GE Power.   Overall, I think that it has been a good transition.  Now I'm just learning about this new company.There is always work, and the co-workers are friendly. The hardest part of the job is getting used to moving the heavy tanks from one place to another without a hand truck. Once you're used to it, it becomes really easy. The place is very safety oriented, and the workers are very helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you reach the end of the shift, and realize how much you were able to accomplish within 8 hours.Was allowed to work with great people from home.  There was a lot of different day to day task.  Customer and sales reps were very good to work with.Big company operating in nich market areas, with overall good market share, and stable balance sheet. Eight layers of management with 300000+ , however it still keeps buying out its competitors. Values experience but does not have a good system to measure it. Dominated by few groups like Aviation, Pratt Whitney, Rolls Royce, university alumni and other groups. Offers a good starting salary but later average 1-2% yearly increase. Healthcare benefits require 3000$ out of pocket before they start. Monthly health insurance payments are high. One has to carry a long list of approved prescription list to their doctor or risk paying the unauthorized prescription .Has 401K but it is limited to company stock and investment options.May be a good place for starters but not very good for mid career professionals.Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company.","10,000+",Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-10-18T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/ec407bfc-aa96-4f3c-9a44-7568cf241ba7?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
