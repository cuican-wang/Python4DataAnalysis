Keysight Technologies has a desirable company culture.Keysight Technologies embodies a positive work environment, has great benefits, cutting edge technology and has smart people who genuinely care about their colleagues and take pride in the quality of their work.Keysight is also a leader in the Electronic Test and Measurement industry.Most enjoyable: the people, good managersLeast enjoyable: some frustration from bureaucracy in systems and processesOverall: Still a great company to work for from it's HP roots. Working to find new revenue growth opportunities.I feel this company is trying to catch-up with technology which has made them overly focused on giving preference to new hires. Also, importance on credentials is given to much emphases--many times overlooking more qualified experienced members.Keysight is filled with great people who are dedicated to their roles and to the company. The work-life balance is great, and the opportunity for advancement is available.I have enjoyed working at Keysight. Great work environment. Encourage innovations. Access to the state of the art research articlesvery good environment.  everyone works together as a team and it make for a fun place to work.  keysight is a very employee oriented company and they are always looking out for the employee .Come into work, setting up machines and prepare for work. I've learned about photo chemical milling processes. Management was the biggest issue for production in the company. Management by people who are untrained, unprofessional, and have absolutely no idea of production and manufacturing. Not a open door policy. If you have any issues or concerns to bring up, their reply is basically, ""you are replaceable, just like everyone else."" People we setup for failure everyday by management. We are production workers who come into work everyday when a targets on our back's. We are setup for failure everyday for no apparent reason. Employees are like family, we work as a team and support each other as a team. Hardest part of the day was to know you have not failed work and you still have your job. Most enjoyable were spending time working with your team.It's a great workplace for employee, because it has flexiable working time, and also has conerns on the employees' health. And the management team has good communication with engineers when they make decision on projects.Job Work/Life Balance: goodCompensation/Benefits: goodJob Security/Advancement: badManagement: badJob Culture: goodR&D, Engineering and Production driven to create and produce high quality products for the world.
