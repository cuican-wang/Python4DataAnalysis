109,4973.0,Chemist II,Cryolife,3.7,11.0,"A typical day consists of numerous processes in flow that require heavy attention to detail, team work, and self accountability. I have learned how to create the product we produce as well as all the necessary procedures from product formulation to packaging it for shipping. Management is constantly searching for new ways to make production more time and cost efficient, as well as speaking with employees to obtain advice for bettering procedures. Co-worker relationships are  typically healthy and everyone is usually willing to lend a helping hand. The hardest part of the job is following behind fellow co-workers and trusting their integrity to their duties because one mishap from any person can halt a production. The most enjoyable part of the job is being in a process with co-workers that you can trust to do their job efficiently and are able to complete a process flawlessly.They will work you to death. Low pay, Advancement opportunities are rare. Look elsewhere. Fear and blame culture. This place will exacerbate any anxiety you already have.This is a great company to gain experience and get your foot in the door, but the pay is too low to really consider a career here. The new CEO has spoken about working on raising pay, and if that actually happens I will definitely reconsider looking elsewhere because other than pay, the company is great to work for.Nice company but no advancement opportunities present. Good job for people fresh out of college. I like the type of work they do, but not somewhere you would want to stay forever.Working in production, is simple and boring repetitive work. It's the same tasks, every day. With that said, the company is headed on the right track and does offer good benefits.CryoLife is a excellent place to work.  The job was challenging but the most fascinating part of CryoLife is that the company helps to save lives.  I was able to see first hand how the company helps families.  I worked directly with 2 sets of organ donor families and 2 sets of organ recipient families that had visited CryoLife.  I worked directly to welcome them as well as set up all of the audio video to broadcast their presentations.  CryoLife is growing rapidly and I was very disappointed to leave.Had several responsibilities in this role. - Created marketing and sales tools- Collaborated with R&D and the engineering department- Helped to resolve any product issues- Developed sales training and marketing plans- Helped to stay compliant with FDA- Supported the entire country and worked with sales forceThe most enjoyable aspect of the job was helping the sales force close business and being in the field with them.Working for this company was a challenge because it was a very busy, fast paced company. Lives depended on the speed in which products came in and out of the company. It was a company where everyone really worked together as a team and it felt like a family.The most enjoyable part of my job is the opportunity to work with various groups throughout the company.A mid-sized medical device and vascular tissue company with a history of providing customers with unique solutions. A typical day at Cryolife involves team work on every process. From staging of materials to aid the flow of production to cleaning of work stations.I learned about formulations, tissue processing, exposed to how to write SOP's and many other production related duties.Management was very hard working and open to feedback.Great co-workers.The hardest part of the job involved packing shippers on dry ice, very physical work.the most enjoyable part about the job involved filtering bulk solutions, and filling syringes.",201 to 500,Atlanta,Kennesaw,GA,2016-12-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/c67e14a6-c6ef-4119-8bf5-8a29475c0bbc?mescoid=1900259001001&jobPosition=8,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
