3,4867.0,Data Scientist Internship (Spring 2017),Cox Automotive,3.3,47.0,"Management is the killer in this organization due their inability to recognize, compensate, empower, train and promote internal talent. There's no vision for the future and a huge issue with communication within the department. There's no career growth. Your coworkers are the most enjoyable part of coming to work daily.This company is a typical BIG business. Employees get treated horriblely. Training is a joke and communication is nonexistent. Fellow employees can treat you poorly,  harass you and completly get away with it. Management refuses to take care of their responalites or correct wrongful doings. This is the worst job I have ever had. People hazing me and being down right awful to my face is actually allowed here. You get benefits here. That's it. Manheim Phoenix is the worst company you can work for.The company benefits are good and after 13 years the pay is good.It is also close to home,and there are some good people that work there.I agree 100 percent with the other reviewers about NO advancement. You MUST brown nose or be friends or family of management to advance.I have learned a lot about the auto auction industry working there,such as structural damage to vehicles.Most of my co-workers are great to work with others do whatever they want and you will carry the extra load.My new manager brought his old employees with him and they get away with everything,being late,costing the company serious money,etc. The hardest part of the job is figuring out what the company wants because they will not communicate it to you.I worked here for 3+ years in management. Customer is always right. And I mean ALWAYS right. Steal? No problem. Attempt to defraud the company? No problem. Upper management has no spine and most of the managers couldn't flip burgers at McDonald's. But if you're in the clique you're good. Private pension is nice and benefits are good but don't expect fair treatment.I worked as a contractor but saw the benefits of the company and the culture.  Great company to work for - management was nice ;paid wellGreat company culture you really take pride in your job. Honestly nothing bad to say in my opinion. Anyone who is lucky enough to land a job here would be lucky.rough days working outdoors(cold,hot,wet).pay does not equal work for these conditions.poor management,people sent home when they are needed.most promotions given to kiss a**es.business seems to be ran by good ol boy network.This company brags on treating employees with the utmost respect, offering them the highest technical equipment and a wonderful work environment. While that may be true for some locations it certainly is not for Manheim Nashville. Technology can't keep up, management doesn't care about the attitude or professionalism they display or of the people it employs and acting inappropriate and talking filthy seems to be encouraged. There are good benefits here and that's about all I can say. They are great to the dealers, they truly produce, but they care nothing else about this company . Numbers are all that matters and if you're looking for a place where you can make a difference this is not the place for you!I think it's a good company to work for I do agree with some of the other reviews that advancement is based on brown-nosing and who you know not what you know and that's the sad part because it's not fair.Working for Xtime which is Cox Auto.Seems like a very nice place to be with and benefits are great.Managers are very nice to work for. Regular day hours Mon-Fri.Pay & compensation are good as well.I landed an opportunity with my dream company to work for after years of pursuing the chance.  The team offers you great support when transitioning into the company as well as town hall meetings to keep you up to date with the company's goals and success.•	Responsible and accountable for project deliverables that  includes planning, scoping, estimation, status, tracking and reporting, mentoring team members, risk mitigation, training, escalation, communications, and Implementation.•	Vendor Management, manage 2 vendors to achieve the common goal for the project.•	Scrum Master, conducting daily scrum, grooming, planning, sprint review, UAT, documentation, demo and retrospective.

Terrible management that allows supervisors to act in an abusive manner. High turnover in certain positions due this type of management.  Certain managers in this department have hired and fired mutliple employees in the Facilities Ops Specialist role, STAY AWAY.  Upper management and HR do nothing to stop this type of behavior.  Very unprofessional group of managers.  Worked there for 1 year and left because this department is a joke.Cox Automotive is a great place to work.  The staff is very helpful and professional as well as their Management who are always willing to come alongside and answer any questions you may have.The good ole boy attitude is alive and well at Cox. I wasted  years there and was bullied for the last four years.  If you steal, lie, and cheat you will do well or if you are a female and are willing to date the married customers.  HR is a joke and the managers have their jobs because of who they know and not what they know.great place to work.  great culture. work life balance. good leadership.  gym on campus.  coworkers are great.  work from home is available.It was an awesome place to work.  Loads of diversity and culture integration. Training is ""fly by the seat of your pants"". Co-workers are great individuals to work with.Great business to work for if you have a passion for cars  family oriented the owner work hands on they take pride in there business!Fast paced environment. Company vested in employee development. The company is well structured but lacks consistency. organization. The only consistency is constant change which creates uncertainty.I loved my 6 years with Cox Automotive - however after 6 years of hard work and going above and beyond, my department was eliminated.  Assistance in finding a new job did not pan out as several other people were displaced at the same time.Was hired about a month ago and they have done nothing but give me the run around,saying my background check still hasn't came back.It doesn't take a month for one to come back especially if you have a clean background!","10,000+",Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-12-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/b8b124a3-82f0-4b90-ac55-1bfdf59914ee?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
