Widely used for pushing patches and software updates to Dell and Hp devices. Assets IT support team with trouble shooting and setting PC setup's for newly hired interns. i enjoyed coming to work everyday, encountered new problems that we able solve to create a more productive environmentI liked DAN because of the work sponsored happy hour that we had every Thursday. Everyone is pretty much cool, however, please do not expect a raise or a promotion. They will get you to work very hard for a reward and will never give it to you. I worked at the front desk and I am very sociable. Many team members vented to me about their problems in the office. Unfortunately, everyone seem to have the same problem: snotty clients and false promises. But the work place is very pleasant.- It is a routine Job from 8 to 5 everyday. - Lunch is not paid. We have to take an hour lunch because Finance is treated different than the rest of the company. The rest start 9 AM. - The rest of the company get overtime and Finance doesn't- Vacation is the only thing that keeps people enjoying their job because we get paid holidays and up to 2 weeks vacation for entry level people and 6 sick days.Overall, it has been a great place to work.  There has been significant growth over the last 3+ years, which allows for a lot of opportunity to learn, grow and make a mark in the longer term process and efficiency building. The hardest part is change management with teams trying new ways to manage day to day tasks.  Getting teams to embrace change and to think of more efficient and effective ways to do their day to day tasks, is a challenge. My co-workers have been awesome.  Everyone is willing to help and look out for each other.",,Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-10-06T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/80d87a4e-1874-4381-8487-c536d536cec7?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
