24,4888.0,DATA SCIENTIST,Home Depot,3.8,21300.0,"I was thankful to be hired in a speciality department (doors & windows) because it allowed me to sit down with customers and discuss their needs for new doors or windows. I usually worked evening shifts and Saturdays, as well as the occasional Sunday. As a student, it was a decent part-time job that helped pay the bills, and HR was always helpful when I had a scheduling conflict between school and work.Typical day was helping customers and stocking shelves.I learned a lot about all the different departments which are great life skills, also learned how to provide superiors customer service.Management was poor when I was there, but have heard it has improved a lot.Co-workers were great and fun to work with, made the day go by smoother when we had projects together.Hardest part of the job was the high demand of everything that did not involve the customers directly. i.e. big lists of stuff to do during your shift and a limited amount of time to do them.Most enjoyable part of the job was driving forklift.A decent company to work for. After working in over twelve stores on a regular basis, I found most of the associates to be very friendly, upbeat and a generally good morale.However, there are also extreme pro's & con's depending on your position and if you are an actual store employee or a MET employee.The overall culture of the company is good. The hourly rates are in one big bucket as opposed to being determined based on job requirements and responsibilities. The annual raises are honestly a joke at .25 cent being the maximum for non-management staff.A big plus is the option to transfer is you decide to relocate.Over all, in a scale of 1 - 10, I give The Home Depot a 7 and that is primarily because of the benefits. However, because of the low rate of pay, the benefits eat your check away.overall HD is a good company but I can only Speak on my experience with my own store. When I first started there It was very hopeful and i was looking to grow, that idea quickly turned into a headache as I felt my management didn't have a a good grasp on how to maintain morale among staff (little to no recognition for achievements, constant negative critique), they practiced in favoritism (awards and promotions stayed within a particular circle) and it was very apparent to many of the staff. after awhile progression felt non existent no matter how much was put into the work. many times it felt as if our store didn't practice the Core Values that Home Depot preaches, but as I said my experience my particular store.I have loved my time with this company and do find that it is very enjoyable to work in most stores.I do find the pay to be a little low especially for those that take their own time to learn new skills and receive extra training to not receive a pay raise. I will warn you that if you are part time (I am not) that hours for the most part are very limited through most of the year with the exception of holidays (off seasons you can get as low as 6 hours for the week to 18 hours). You also will not receive benefits if you are only part time. The good thing is that they do work with school and child care situations as long as you have the paper work to back up your needs.There are many opportunities to learn new skills, but management at the store level can hinder your progress greatly, even if you are well qualified for a supervisor position.  This is a good job to have while in college, but I would not make this a career, unless you absolutely love this area of business.  Be careful of adding new skills and letting management know, because you will be finding yourself taking on more responsibility without appropriate compensation, such as raises or recognition.Lastly, store managers do not care if you have a college degree.  It seems having an advanced education would benefit those who work in the corporate office.You have little or no career path at Home Depot. They talk a big game and promise a good career path and training to make sure it happens, but does not happen if you are a older person with a great management background. The hours of scheduling are radical at best and you are always under manned and over worked for very little compensation. Although I was rated a 5 out 5 performance for my work evaluation I was never considered for promotion because I was pigeon holed in a certain area and increased their sales by over 20% in the departments I was assigned to work in.  Would I recommend a career path at Home Depot. Only if you want to be a slave to the company if you are a department manager or assistant store manager. They are very much abused.A typical work day depends on what you can do, machine operators are expected to do a majority of the work to maintain and recover departments. Other associates don't always do much and it does sometimes get all dropped on one person later in the day in addition to customers who are occasionally confrontational. Management is usually good on all aspects and help get the job done when possible. Hardest part of the job is doing the parts of the jobs that the other associates have refused to do that gets tacked onto your list.Great benefits and if you do a good job and show you know what you're doing they take care of you anyway possible.I love working for Home Depot.  Great management, upper and in-store.  It really felt like people cared for my career, and were always willing to help me advance.  Recognition was amazing.  Whenever I did well, I heard about it.  Worst part of the job is the work/life balance.  With an unpredictable schedule (As a department supervisor, I did not have a consistent schedule) it was really hard to plan for things outside of work.  Also, pay was barely enough to support myself.  I did well and got raises, but it really wasn't substantial.I learned great customer service skills and commercial contractor skills. A typical work day would be switching between departments throughout the store to assist both the Do-It-Yourself and Commercial Contractor customers. Many of the store management were always very helpful. The hardest part of the job was during inventory count and reorganization where it was very taxing physically. I enjoyed working mostly with the customers and making a difference in their shopping experience.I have worked here ten years and it has only gotten worse as the environment is not one of positivity but of negativity.  Associates are asked to do way more than possible and then asked why customers are upset?  It seems as if quality associates are few and far between because most associates don't know much and their shelf life is a couple of months so experience is severely lacking.  If you are knowledgeable you are taken advantage of by fixing what others mess up but nothing gets done to stop the mistake from happening again which is mind numbing.  The pay raises are laughable as you can hit all your numbers and do it all but your getting what everyone else gets which is not much.  Pay is horrifically bad and most associates are way under the poverty line while working here.  There are no cost of living wages so pay does not match what's going on in society but nothing is ever addressed.I  am currently a supervisor at the Home Depot. The culture is phenomenal, the associates and managers couldn't be better. Compensation is competitive but could be better, especially for skilled individuals. Hours are erratic, but recently full-time employees were given fixed schedules. Lots of advancement opportunities if you are willing to work for them.At Home Depot, the associates and management is almost like family, so almost everyone is pretty friendly. The training is great. You do occasionally have to interact with disgruntled customers, but if you keep a positive outlook and attitude, and irate customer will easily turn into an understanding one. The health benefits are great. You can receive a bonus every 6 months and a raise every year. The vacation time is competitive with other companies, and you often feel like a valued associate.On an average day I could be needed in almost any department. Management is average with some managers going above and beyond and some falling very short. Fellow employees range from very knowledgeable to highly incompetent and there are a few who flat out lie to the customers just to get a sale. The compensation is a joke being that they offer you minimum wage and ""benefits"" and there is no way to advance within the company unless you want to make it a career. It would take at least 20 years to even become a store manager let alone any real management within their corporate side.The Home Depot is a great company that allows opportunity to grow. With this company a worker can advance him/herself as far as they want to. The environment is very friendly, and customers have a lot of respect for the company as well as the workers. Management was great and always available when needed. My co-workers were all very nice and made it fun to come to work everyday. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet the whole shift but you barely notice it. The most enjoyable part of the job is giving good customer service and receiving praise and compliments from customers you've assisted.The management and staff are great but some of the internal politics are a bit unfair. Promotions are slow and rare and there are very few full time opportunities. The benefits they provide are decent (if you can afford them). I struggle as a normal employee to prove my value and earn a promotion. There is some favoritism in upper management, but it still wouldn't hinder me from wanting to advance within this company.Fast paced, heavy customer interactions, need to be able to think on your feet or have the computer skills to search out the products that the customer is wanting.Some heavy lifting is required and scheduling can be difficult to work around at times.Great benefits package for full time and part time jobs.Hard work at times so you really EARN a paycheck.Supervisors do not care. They're just there to fund their hobbies outside of work don't do much but walk around and chit chat. GWA's work hard day in and day out. High turnover, nobody wants to work there and people are constantly being fired because of productivity numbers which are poorly in place and work against you. they are always hiring because no one wants to work there after a few months. Very stressful and constant changes by people who don't do the work. If you have to work there make it temporary and exit before they find a reason to let you go because of their poor management and poorly thought out changes.There's just nothing good to say.I've literally sat in ""Process improvement"" meetings where management would ask employees how they would improve things.  Employees would come up with many many ways things could run better and how to fix processes and each idea was met with; ""That's not necessary, you just need to work harder.""There's also a massive issue with first line managers constantly throwing each other under the bus.Their mantras are ""Hard work and Accountability""The result are beaten down employees and a culture of CYA above all else.I have never seen or heard a company spend so much money on food for the employees. This is supposed to make the employees moral better, but I don't see it. The food they buy is so unhealthy. How do they expect people to work with enthusiasm after they eat potato salad and baked beans? The management at my store is not very proactive, from what I see. They seem to busy to help with anything physical and if you ask for help they say they will get some for you, but you never get any. Management does not promote teamwork well.Learned more at THD about how to manage a business than any business school could ever teach me. They pride themselves on internal promotion and advancement! THD does an outstanding job at training and developing from  one day on the job! Great place to build wealth!","10,000+",Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-11-23T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/534e8aba-9536-4351-a0a0-8860159dfb67?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
