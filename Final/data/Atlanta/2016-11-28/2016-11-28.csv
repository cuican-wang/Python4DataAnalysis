6,4870.0,GIS Analyst,Atkins North America,3.3,24.0,"All about the work. If you work yourself out of work you will not be paid for the extra time. The salary does not compare to other local companies.Lower levels, ok. UK management not interested or involved. Salary and benefits below industry standards. Shame it all went so wrongThis was my first job out of college. I enjoyed my coworkers a lot because we were all in the same age range. Unfortunately, there is almost no room for advancement in the company. Management is all over the place and don't know what they're doing. This job was just ok and the main plus for me were the great friends I made and the work/life balance.Treats employees like they are a contract shop but doesn't compensate appropriately.  It only takes a few weeks of a downturn for them to lay people off.  They are horrible at finding work. Everything needs to be approved by the management in the UK. If you are not from the UK, you cannot advance in this company. I will say the culture is great, and the people are nice, it's the structure and the upper level management that needs some work.Atkins is amazing company to work for. The environment there is a professional one and yet also is fun and fulfilling.My co-workers were always extremely helpful - providing training at any point that I may have needed it. This company is one to work for!!From the CEO to the seller-doers, Atkins prides itself on its global, diverse culture.  Flexible schedules are available to most and benefits are comparable with other firms in the industry.No job security, don't know if you will be laid off from day to day. No clear vision of new management. Decisions being made in a vacuum. Coworkers being laid off that are crucial to current projects. Severing business relationships that have been in place for 20 plus years.Do not come work hereTruly an awful place to be. Legacy PBS&J company was a wonderful employer until an incompetent CEO took over in 2005. Then a series of events rocked the company to its core: an embezzlement by the CFO and his direct reports, the indictment of two former company officers (minor, but still a PR problem), an FCPA investigation, the ousting of the company's chairman/CEO by employee shareholders, the sale of the company to a foreign owner. While the sale to Atkins was probably a good move, the subsequent replacement of a stablizing CEO with a cold, former military leader with a hierarchial organizational style was not. It's a culture of fear that now permeates down through the ranks of management. In a tough economy, employees are now hunkered down, hoping to hang on till retirement or waiting for other employement opportunities to come along. Insecurity prevails. Loyalty and hard work have nothing to do with whether you keep your job, rather it's who you're friends with. Innovation, once a hallmark of PBS&J, is a thing of the past. Good people have been leaving the company in droves -- either by their own choice or the choice of managers unclear about their direction. Sorry I waited so long to leave.I cannot speak to the current operations of Atkins North America after their acquisition of PBS&J. I was ""thanked"" for my 20+ years of service after the acquisition, and let go.I can say that as PBS&J, the Corporate leadership of this employee owned firm was very approachable, inclusive, and genuinely desired to perform the highest level of service for their clients. Retention of employees was high, and the pay scale was competitive.Great place to work with supportive management. The networking events on Wednesday and Thursdays are always great. That is all!!!!In a typical day at work I need to review every contract before an attorney. For the past three months I have been very involved in the implementation of a new electronic filing system for the company.The most enjoyable part of the job is my schedule. I work nine hours from M-T and 4 hours on Friday.An internationally owned company that came in and acquired a thriving business and proceeded to downsize and close multiple offices and service lines.I learned alot of skills while working and Atkins due to the awesome culture and tools available. Management was accessible and maintained an open-door policy. I loved working with so many talented people that offered kindness freely and respected each other.good employees good benefits managements was supportativeexcellent workplace, great management, hours, advancement opportunitiesA productive work place where professionals are always welcomed, have many opportunities to share their knowledge and experience and has an adequate amount of social exchanges.ATKINS is one of the world's leading design, engineering and project management consultancies.A typical work day consists of a variety of duties from writing agendas and inputting them into MUNI, putting together contracts and making sure all necessary legal documents have been executed, pay applications being entered into MIS, dealing with citizens and County staff as well as other contractors and sub-consultants. There are many critical dealines to be met, and to get items in to the Board of Directors in a timely manner and you have to stay focused and on task to get this done.It was a great learning experience in the 11 years that I worked since I was exposed to so many different clients with so many different needs and I was able to learn so much from the team that I worked with over the years. The most enjoyable was the variation and continuous challenges brought in by each project.Atkins allows employees to work flexible schedules and is pretty flexible with your time as long as you work your required hours.I had the unfortunate experience of working in the Atkins run traffic operations center in Raleigh NC. First and foremost, this job is always available for a reason. In their attempts to operate on a 24/7 basis - management often punishes one person to work third shift (10pm-6am) then come in at 2pm the same day and work second shift until 10pm that night. There is never any expectation for even a third of the center to work this ridiculous schedule, only one person gets punished this way from month to month. If you are asked to participate in their dispatch training, expect to be there 11 hours a day every Monday and Tuesday, wich consists of sitting in an insect infested room with one DOT rep, and the training coordinator who have you dispatch calls according to video replays, then talk trash to and about you throughout your employment about how you attempt to dispatch said calls. The coordinator who operates the training has less than two years of any sort of dispatch experience, and at best fakes it until he makes it, more time is spent talking trash often heard in high school locker rooms than doing anything job related. After less than two months expect to take an exam that determines your employment, again administered by the obviously drug dependant training coordinator. The largest part of the exam is to create a 45 mile detour listed on a map, and recreate 12 digital message signs about the extensive detour - something that may occur once every six months. While I was taking the exam, the training coordinator failed to give the first group the detour part of the test,  more... then to cover his failure, told coworkers that the people taking the test did not do that part of the exam - the fact that he never handed out that part of the test was never addressed. Also notice how the pay for this position went from $13/hr back to $14/hr financially Atkins traffic operations in NC is failing, so much so they had to cut hours in Greensboro to make payroll. Again this job is always open for a reason - wait tables before making the mistake of wasting your time for Atkins.  less",,Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/gis-analyst-job-atlanta-ga-us-176763800.aspx?mescoid=1500140001001&jobPosition=3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

22,4886.0,"Consumer Banking Data Scientist- Atlanta, GA (Atlanta, GA, US)",SunTrust Banks,3.6,2200.0,"Awesome company but bottom line came first and often at the expense of the employees. Fun place to work a well thought out corporate environment. Benefits are excellent.Working through my daily pipeline keeping accounts updated, talking to customers (inbound calls) who want to work with us in bring account current or payoff.  Work projects that are offered by management dealing with accounts that may need to be charged off, re-evaluated for assistance to the consumer etc., talking with our attorneys, and answering emails, taking requests for reinstatement and payoff figures. I have learned time management, and the hardest part of my job would be not being able to assist someone who is really trying and they don't have the means to do so.the most enjoyable part is the people I work withIt was a enjoyable job at first but then became really stressful and impossible to meet goals. The role play was ridiculous with upper management, nothing was the right thing to say.Typical day of processing transactions and making deposits. I did learn a lot on the banker side of things which was a nice asset. But there is no room for advancement.Bank Teller/ Customer Service Representative, August 2003-September 2004Some of a bank teller's responsibilities include cashing checkAccepting deposits and loan paymentsProcessing withdrawalsSell savings bondsAccept payment for customers' utility bills and charge cardProcessing necessary paperwork for certificates of depositSelling travelers' checks Specialized in handling foreign currencies, or commercial or business accounts.SunTrust Bank allowed me to advance quickly due to my desire for learning the banking industry and work ethic. The majority of my managers were very understanding and trusted my abilities. Those attributes are what molded me into becoming a very thorough trainer and listening ear for my co-workers.Managerment wasn't fair or understanding. Human resource was for managers not for the employees. Lot of benfit was taken away. Co workers was good. You get blamed for mistakes that supervisors and managers didn't explain the process or produres correct. The most enjoyable part was meeting new friends.Definitely was a great place to get work experience and to understand corporate america, as they say. Helped me develop a certain level of professionalism that I do not take for granted.Good work environment, Good schedule, they really work with you schedule wise. Hardest part of the job was dealing with customers.Expect to work from sun up to sun down. Make sure to ask alot of questions from superior and to attend trainings.Not good on grqining before just tossing you out there to find your way in the mix.I would do transactions as well as have conversations with my customers. I learned a  great deal about banking from my co-workers. The management was fine but mainly learned from my supervisors. The hardest part of the job was really dealing with the rude customers. The most enjoyable part was the co-workers as well as the regular customers that would come in.I have seen many HR issues in the branch and management doesn't do anything about it. They continuously push us with sales and our sales goals are unreal.Great place to work in team environment to meet growing needs of a bank moving into the national spotlight.  Work included meeting with several lines of business in the asset finance brokerage unit, building new software solutions and eliminating redundant capture of data.  Systems included Misys LOAN IQ, AFS COMPASS, Bloomberg, DTCC, Calypso Derivatives system, Impact brokerage system, MTS Money Transfer system, OnLine Treasury Manager and GEAC General Ledger systems.    Regulatory reporting included Dodd Frank Volcker, CCAR Liquidity reporting, Shared National Credit reporting and other ad hoc internal audit requests.Most enjoyable part of the job was working with several lines of business helping them streamline and prepare for growth.  Flexibility to work from home and move around the office buildings to meet staff.Great place to work, Suntrust has a good learning experience in place so that you can learn your specific job and excel in the area of your position and career.Suntrust has a great work life balance.   They also are supportive of new technologies and provide training to those that require it.I did not enjoy this job.  I just wanted to help customers with the needs they were concerned about.  However, banks are only concerned with convincing customers to sign up for more accounts that I, as a teller was constantly told I had to offer to the customers even when I already knew the customer was not interested.SunTrust is a great employer with excellent benefits such as 401K and health, however, there have been many changes to banking regulations in the past 6 months and we anticipate many more in the next year which can possibly result in banker's bonus incentive changing (not for the better).Lots of empty suits walking around. The company is the epitome of corporate America. No one knows who to talk to, there is very little accountability, and the organization is constantly being rearranged with higher turnover than usual. Think of the show ""The Office"" but banking. The compensation is great, above market, however the company does not invest in new technology to keep up with its competitors.Make sure you have a manager willing to mentor you because SunTrust has the worst onboarding and continual development/training programs I and my coworkers have experienced.There are many people working at an abnormally slow pace so they can give the impression of being busy; as a result projects and initiatives take very long, there are delays and project cost overruns, and communication across the enterprise is difficult due to people's lack of accountability and caution to take ownership of anything. High producers are rewarded with more work and more responsibility while advancement is limited because of ""lifers"" waiting (or needing) for a RIF (RIF = layoff, reduction in force). The main advancement one will get is AVP to VP and annual raises. On the Consumer and Wholesale side, SunTrust has antiquated backend systems and infrastructure -from the 80s and 90s that continue to be patched, creating unnecessary errors and work so that people will be ""safe"" in their jobs. The CEO is very concerned with the bottom line and will not make any meaningful (high dollar, high value) investments for the future to build lasting value; as a result the organization is simply  more... a ticking regulatory time bomb, waiting to explode at any moment.In the Consumer division be sure to wear a suit every day. You won't be client-facing but the culture requires business attire, which is totally unnecessary for employees in support roles. There are no happy hours or after work events unless you organize yourself - office managers do nothing to support a positive corporate culture, they only serve to manage Managers' calendars, give out equipment, and make sure employees are sitting in the right cube.  lessA lot of sales involved.  Outbound calling, setting appointments, follow-ups, etc.  Not difficult, but not very exciting either.  Compensation is competitive.  Good bonus program.  I hear benefits are decent (I don't use them).I have no comment at this time about the company, good company to work and good management, sad that many departments are closing. No other comment at this time. Thank youGenerally, this is a good place to work in Atlanta.  Salaries are competitive and most managers are solid.  Company is also active in the betterment of the local community.","10,000+",Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/443eab4c-614e-4b7e-84ef-9607631e27fb?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

80,4944.0,"Scientist, Certifying",Quest Diagnostics Incorporated,3.8,2100.0,"Quest is a good place to work if you are out of college but with it being a very busy and fast pace lab, it makes training slow and also, long work days.A high volume laboratory that constantly keeps you on your toes.You learn how to manage your time in order to do your job productively and efficiently.  Management expects you to be able to do your job without too much supervision.  Co-workers are great and quite easy to get along with and are almost always there to give you a helping hand.  Hardest part of the job is being able to manage the different hours they may give you if they are short handed.  The best part of the job is that your constantly learning new tasks so that no day is ever routine.Used to be a great company, until they hired management with no people skills. Yes fast paced,  yes high volume company. Benefits are competitive and most coworkers are patient driven. Working for this company is an insult to employees. You are a number and can be replaced with PT employees easily. Women get paid less. If you are required to work overtime..... Dont expect to get paid for it. Then you are punished for working more as required by the department. A global company  who preaches ""patients first"" sure needs common sense. Be careful if you become a patient while your an employee. ..why because they truly don't care, no empathy and they steal your life. .Good luck and dont believe anything they tell you..you can see the character of their actions. Previously over 10 years employed. ... Glad I leftI have never posted a bad review on any employers that I have worked for before, but this one was different. At this company you are considered a number and not a person. Some parts of the policy were very unfair to the employees.  Management was not all bad, but some of them were very inconsiderate and obnoxious to say the least. Compensation could have been better, but benefits were good. I am very glad that I have been relieved from this company. It was very difficult to be effective in this position because of the criteria and expectations. We had to sit for hours trying to process the interviews to a suggested perfection expected not to mention how long some of the interviews were. This was not always easy to do because applicants are most sensitive to answering a lot of medical history questions.  No matter how hard you try it was not good enough. This position caused quite a bit of stress .The Company had a high turn-over rate. I would not refer anyone to work here. That is because I do care about people in general.Quest Diagnostics is a horrible company to work for especially as a phlebotomist. The pay is horrible and below other companies pay. The benefits are extremely expensive and you can still expect to pay 80 dollars out of pocket to see a physician. You are constantly under staffed and overworked and rarely get to take your breaks on time. There is a lot of pressure put on you for keeping wait times down but they do not provide the help needed. Supplies? don't count of having what you need on hand to do your job. Constantly running out of tubes and butterfly needles and having to send one of your staff members out of your already short ran location driving around to other locations to find the supplies needed. Management is horrible and do not help with these issues. I do not recommend working for this company! Go else where if you can!They lie, promise raises that never happen. If you are lucky enough to get one it's $0.08 after a year. They do not value their employees. Every day threatened that you are replaceable. Unable to transfer to different positions. Your manager will say bad things about you to ensure that you can never leave or transfer. Never able to get time off, even if planned and requested months in advance.I think Quest Diagnostics should care about there staff. They keep on changing procedures when incident happens. Need to know that some staff working graveyard should get more and the management should listen to us more.There is more to this company then what it could be. We should be able to contact the proper people there. when there is a problem. There are different shifts and the Grave yard shift is the hardest..A good company to work for overall.  Good, mostly helpful employees.  Very demanding supervisors and managers, who did not quite understand the difficulty of our jobs, but would always expect miracles.  Constant mandatory overtime, including intimidating employees to work overtime or face disciplinary action.  Not understanding that us, employees, have a life other than Quest Diagnostics.  Very little salary increase over the life of my employment, actually laughable.Quest drives for process improvement throughout the corporation reflecting in new and innovative ways to perform. Good stable company. Competent management in place. Run like a major corporation which leads to National deliverable focus vs. local deliverables which may be more applicable to your region.In the billing department, the upper management has no concern for most employees, they have their favorites and friends, they were allowed to bully and harass other employees, nothing was done, the managers and team leaders openly talked about other employees and their personal business.I truly loved the work part of my job, the company had great benefits.fun and excitied to be there  the management was awesome  and my co-workers we was a team the hardest part of the job was leaving when i was offered a position the salary was lower if got hired on i couldnt  except but this was a great job orange park floridaThe place is ran like a sweat shop, all about production and numbers. The manger of processing watches people on camera and pretends to be all the good of company but is only to make himself look good. The supervisors are all lying puppets. I wouldn't recommend this as a long term place to work.Very High collection volume you meet great people all day friendly and helpful co-workers. I learned a lot working for Quest Diagnostics the computer systems that they have are wonderful and informative to help accurately collect and process specimens. Although Management may have friendly and even helpful personality traits, It can make or break your experience as an employee. To be honest there really wasn't anything hard about  the it. The Most Enjoyable part of the Job for me would have to be the veni-puncture collection. I love putting patients at ease and hearing them say I didn't even feel that, this really makes my day because I want to assure them that I am concern with there well being and overall health.I love my co-workers.The patient load in high volume. the benefits are great. Management tends to hire outside for supervisors regardless of current employee's experience or education. That the reason I am currently looking outside of the companyI have been with Quest Diagnostics for almost 4 years and it has been a downward spiral. Management and the company only care about numbers. Nothing is uniform. It is hard to get questions answered and the job is tedious, but somewhat easy. The pay is on the lower end of being decent and the insurance is HORRIBLE. Co workers are unprofessional but some are friendly. The only thing enjoyable about this job is hearing the satisfaction in a doctor or patient's voice.This is a good place to work if you are looking for a place to gain experience working in the lab processing area's.  Co workers and management are not friendly or helpful.  No one seems happy there. Long hours.  The most enjoyable part of this job was getting off at the end of my shiftQuest is a okay company to work for, they value their customer, but not their employees so much. They give you 1 personal day per year and they count missing days against you when you have to call out. They 401k is awesome and also the insurance that they provide. I've work for them off and on for a total of 4 years.The manny patients that we see in this type set up  job help me very much in be coming a great phlebotomist, seen patients of all ages taking care of at least 50-70 patients gave me a great practice and experience. The harder part of the job was when dealing with small children its never easy to see them cry! Great team work help me to make my job more essay and enjoyable.Quest Diagnostics offered little room for advancement and lower than average salary for existing employees. New employees come in to company at much higher salary than existing.Very productive company. Hard to balance work and life. Requires mandatory overtime. Good pay and benefits. You get to meet alot of good people from different backgrounds. Management can be better.Quest is a wonderful place to work.  Great learning opportunities, the culture and atmosphere is respectful and kind.  The compensation is above the norm and very fair.","10,000+",Atlanta,Tucker,GA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/b1c68a58-fbee-4d6a-bcdc-34613b0d37da?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=14,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
