Competitive company in the industry, top network ratings.Turner services company is a great place to work if you need to make money, and have experience in A/C repair. For people who think about applying though, need to expect to learn to do thing's different ways. Some of his ways are very different than most places, but they are more effective and safe.Balanced work life and great atmosphere.Flexible hours and management is very professional.Overall it is a pleasure to work for this firm.Was a maintenance electrician with them, the project manager I worked for was VERY unpleasant and had even worse leadership abilities, jobsite was miserable and the company didn't seem to care about the workers at allGreat company but recent changes and layoffs have effected morale and output. New management as well not as committed as long term management that has leftOverall Turner was a wonderful place to work, friendly people, excellent benefits, excellent pay,  room for advancement in some cases, Overall wonderful place to work.Great company once the organizational changes are complete.

Good platform to learn many new things. Discussing with team members and improvising things is most enjoyable.They do not have benefits, 401-K. All the employees I talked to said they are over worked and underpaid and that Turner does not appreciate them.Turner was a great company to work for in the late '90's until 2005 when I left. Great Management, great Company perks , benefits took great care of employees!Definitely didn't expect this as it unfolded. Management does everything to discourage you from changing departments. You have a better chance of raising the Titanic with tweezers. Most of the co-workers are as phoney as a three dollar bill. There are some talented people and some are generally good people. However, even they fall victim to the alphas of various clicks. They are conniving, lazy and extremely underhanded. I'm not sure how some got hired and furthermore astonished that they maintain their job. Which leads me to this. Beware of management moles. I would guess that's how a few of them still are able to loiter masquerading as workers. These incompetent, useless ones will despise you once you show drive, talent and unwavering confidence in spite of their efforts to maintain a hostile work environment. The directors are actually the most miserable of all. Constant nitpicking to those who aren't their chosen ones. Do yourself a huge favor and move on. Lastly, there is zero work life balance.Well in construction we all have our good days and bad ones.And with the technology we have today we are always learning something new. Just always remember to put your safety first on each task you start.Turner is a great place to work. You can definitely move up in the company. Paid holidays, great Insurance, and Friendly work environment. I would go back in a heartbeat.Excellent place to work. Turner simply needs to put forth a more concentrated efort towards implementing  more diversity via the oranization's hiring process and overall talent acquisition; especially within the company's ""sports"" department in it's Century City Office.Spent a long (Too long) in the Technology department.  The management was confusing in the decision making.  Spent money on pointless projects and then never had money for training.  Most new skills came from new hires and then got stale sitting in a cube.  Middle management seemed to enjoy misery of subordinates.  To the point of running out on the tab for department lunches!  OK so now it's all gone, new company with very little staff left.Pipe fitter, do daily progress reports,time sheets, issue work schedule, and read blueprints. Very reliable worker.
