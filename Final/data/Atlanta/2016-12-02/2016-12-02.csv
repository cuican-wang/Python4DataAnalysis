18,4882.0,Sr Data Scientist - Fraud,Assurant Inc,3.7,1100.0,"Sourced and purchased replacement products for people who purchased contracts on computers, monitors, printers, and other electronic equipment.I enjoyed working with my co-workers.the pay is very very good. but you work foriif t.  you don't mind managers breathing down your neck, if you have no family or have anye mergiences this isth e job for youWhen I first started at this company I enjoyed it much more than when I left. I enjoyed having a stack of paperwork that needed done by the end of the day. When it was decided that another department would be merged with the one I worked in, there were too many people away from their desks not working than actually getting the work done.- pour training - rushed at learning - pour slow systems - pour management Pour communication especially with new employees Expecting them to know everything in three weeks I was hired on through a company agency, received no feedback on my progress I was doing my best to learn System navigation was a mess but took my time to learn My agency called me late evening informing me that the company has to let me go, the company didn't have the guts to say that to my face I could not go back the next day to retrieve my personal belongings, company assured me it takes time to learn everything not to rush myself take my time ask questions which I did but I never got the opportunity to prove myself to the company with their lies of training time would be 4 to 6Weeks.Assurant is a great company to work at. Focused on their employees and their development.Has an onsite day care and elementary school for employees kids only.Great Campus. Onsite Cafeteria is amazing.Normally people work there until retirement.This company has some great ideas and talented people, but seems to have trouble moving in a unified direction. Hopefully their reorganization in July 2016 will help them with this challenge.Assurant Health was an inspiring, and fun place to work that gave GREAT benefits. I learned patience working for Assurant. The management and co-worker staff were a great group of people, always helpful and reliable. The hardest part of the job was knowing that it was closing. the most enjoyable part of the job were the Employee Events.Loved the department activities, they allowed you to expand your network and learn about the company. Health insurance was expensive and not worth it since you have to meet all your deductibles first before it covered your claim.Loved working there, unfortunately company is closing for business. Wonderful employees, great management, great hours, benefits affordable, was planning on retiring with the company.When I started there the facility was owned by The Signal and it was an enjoyable place to work.  After The Signal was sold to Assurant the place changed.  Assurant has a good reputation for its various insurances businesses but does not seem to understand how a warehouse/manufacturing facility should operate.  Instead of advancing from within, the company started looking solely to outsiders to fill management ranks.Once you are acclimated with your workload they will send you home to work. I have learned a lot about mortgage insurance and why its needed.Ability to grow and challenge yourself.  Very family oriented and willing to work with you as needed.  Career advancement opportunity are numerous.  Co-workers are willing to assist when able.A typical day at work would be quite strenuous because of work overload, however, it is very easy to manage so as long as one is organized. I have learned numerous positions within this company of how to refurbish a electronic device, and this information is only attainable at a job experience such as this. Management, in my opinion, is poorly structured and should be more organized with each and every department of the facility. I do not believe in making acquaintances nor friends with my co-workers because I prefer a strict business setting, however, if confronted about a situation that pertains to the job itself I will address it properly. The hardest part of the job is most likely being underappreciated by knowledge. I feel, as an individual, that not only does this company respect my eagerness to become more of a beneficial employee, but also does not respect my well being. The most enjoyable part of the job though would be that I get to see new products on the market and refurbish them for many loyal and returning customers.A good place to work.  Unfortunately due to healthcare reform, we had to shut down.The remaining small group, has become a loyal close team.12 hour weekend joyed being busy, you could start at on position and by the end of your day be doing something else, management is excellent they tolerate no negativity nice place to work at.Assurant is a productive but a fun workplace filled with many employee engagement & activities. Its a great balance of work and life balance.A typical day is split between managing the day to day flow of the teams and problem solving new issues. We are in the process of implementing new formal processes in all areas. These require continual refinement. Each day presents learning opportunities in multiple ways. I strive to improve the effectiveness of my management technique with this new knowledge. My co-workers are hard working, dedicated professionals! The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the accomplishments achieved by the associates around me.The work atmosphere is very regimented. You take your breaks and lunch (30min) with everyone else at a set time. You have to remain quiet throughout the day, being social is not encouraged. However the latest pop hits are continually beamed from the loudspeakers, and although its not very loud, it is distracting to hear the same songs over and over again about once every hour. The training process consists of someone sitting over your shoulder watching you work ALL DAY, every day pointing out errors, which makes it harder to concentrate. This goes on for months. It's not at all a friendly environment, very strict with little to no interaction with coworkers. Most just stare at their screens with a scowl on their face most times anyway.Very happy with my overall experience. A good place to work with competitive benefits for employees. But as many companies are doing now a days always looking for ways to save and I was laid off from my position.On any given day you are constantly engaged with employees and customers. The company has done a good job of encouraging continued learning to diversify your skills while broadening your scope of work. Due to regulatory changes the Specialty Property division has undergone some shifts lately resulting in reductions in force. Senior leaders have really encouraged employees to understand a successful change model. There are some great individuals throughout the company.The hardest part of the job is to encourage peers, management, and direct reports during a visible shift and reduction in force. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping employees develop their skill set to better position them for future change.I would test the cellphones to ensure the phone would be operational  ensure the phones would take pictures and work properly for the customers. I enjoyed my job.","10,000+",Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/93b7c706-b32c-431e-8071-a96cadd09e00?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
19,4883.0,Data Scientist Internship (Spring 2017),Cox Enterprises,4.1,18.0,"Cox Enterprises is leading communications, media, and automotive services company. Together we are all family day in and day out. The staff, management, team all work together to make it a safe, fun workplace.This is a good place to work. Be careful about taking extended leave for health reasons. They may realize that you are no longer needed. Corporate really cares about their employees.I truly enjoyed my experience with AutoTrader.com as a Regional Business Manager/CFO within Sales Operations in the NW!  Many colleagues became friends and stayed friends to this very day...a close nit group. A great learning experience and fun time in my professional career!Gather business requirements for technical implementation leveraging virtual infrastructure.  Hardware and software architecture.  VMWare DRS, HA, SRDS, Vmotion, Storage Vmotion architecture, implementation, and deployment.  Documentation, optimization, performance tuning, and critical success factor monitoring.Great company but is transitioning from a family run business to one run by non family who are incented to grow profit at all costs. While this is perfectly respectable it is causing difficulty for the lifers to adapt to and as a result cooperation within the parts of the organization is lacking.I enjoyed my time at Cox Enterprises. I got an opportunity to learn a new technology involving SaaS and be a part of the implementation team for Oracle Fusion Goals and Performance Management tool. The management is really great but it needs more skill to deal with immediate managers. On the whole a good experience.During holidays, the company lets all the employees go home early the day before a holiday. The company is all about family. They give plenty of vacation days and sick time. My co-workers and very intelligent and great to work with.I worked for Cox Enterprises for 10 years, I started out in the mail center and while in the mail center helped the facilities team as well. I whent full time with the facilities team in 2010. I was told several times b y my manager that I would be promoted and was passed up by employee's that I had trained. Those employee's were promoted because Cox Enterprises promotes diversity to look good in the eyes of all that view upon them. The company says one thing and does another. They cheat and lie to present a picture that is false.Coworkers, other staff, and executive team were all productive. This is a very established business and they treat staff very generously. It can be challenging at times however the overall benefits help.This is a fantastic company to work for, and, the atmosphere is laid back.The people you work with are great, and, not a lot of micromanaging at this level.I enjoyed working at Cox while learning new tasks daily.  Supported clients from multiple auction locations across the nation as well as Canada.Typical day consisted of many phone calls to regular customers. I enjoyed creating flyers & brochures to display in lanes on sale day.A 365 nightly job with which drivers used prepared, packaged and and then delivered, using their own cars, newspapers such as AJC, Daily Post, and New York Times, to a provided list of customers.Can not say enough good things about this companyEnjoyed it very much.Enjoyed 15 years so far. good people to work with. Had a good environmentContracted was extended to use my skills and abilities to assistThis company had a look of perks dealing with the auctions. It made me more knowledgeable of what goes into processing documentation, vendor relations, and insurance as it relates to independent and franchise dealership.","10,000+",Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/58644c31-c4ca-40f3-8075-46eeb0240ec5?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
49,4913.0,Data Analytics/Web Developer,Lockheed Martin,4.1,3500.0,"This was a 40 hour a week job but was only given part time status. this was to replace a leaving officer before the installation of a card access security system. This location needed a government Security Clearance. Security handled certain documentation to be destroyed. At this location we had standard tours.Good working conditions but a lot of responsibility for a small salary.They forget that we live in the NYC area and take advantage of the poor labor market. A take home of 700 per week when you and three others are responsible for 30 million dollar program makes everyone have to have two jobs just to break even. That is if you can find another job. Everyone in the office is financially stressed and over half the office is looking for another job including our whole team. They outsource projects for what can be done internally at four times our rate but underpay us for what we doWorked on a secured program, but you walked into work feeling like you were making a difference in the world. Management was great at book keeping and very knowledgeable when it came to asking questions. Lots of overtime was offered. Working at the place everyone wants to work at is awesome. Awesome co workers who meant business. The only downfall to this place is the rocky road to gain seniority. When there are ups they are up, but when things go down, without out the seniority it get cloudy.The interview process was very stress-free. The interviews were friendly. They didn't ask any useless questions such as ""What is your greatest weakness."" I submitted and application, received an email to schedule an interview in the same week, and after the interview, I heard back from the hiring manager promptly.Working on upward mobility program and be more people oriented.Reasonable place to work with a slant on conservative values, and a cautious venture into new technology.  As an aerospace firm, they are subject to the market and governmental variability in opportunities typical of those companies driven primarily by large government contracts.Helped to provide funding for fixed asset requirements for various divisions and tier construction projects.  Helped to maintain big construction project scheduling compliances.  Expedited and processed funding documents.  Presented formalized reports to senior management documenting expense spending and extrapolating future monetary spending throughout the end of the  year. Comfortable in high level management meetings.  Enjoyed my knowledgeable co-workers.You don't miss it until it's gone...or something to that effect but needless to say when you look back at your career you'll always relate back to the companies that had the most impact on your professional life. That for me would be Lockheed. While we struggled to compete in a federal market that was okay awarding contracts to the 80% solution, 'Technically Acceptable, Lowest Cost,' the company still led key markets serving the federal government like space, aviation, and weapons. Following the market value you'll see how the market aligns with the management and leadership of the company as the stock value has done nothing but grow.As a contractor, I traveled around the U.S., Hawaii and Puerto Rico conducting industrial hygiene and radiation surveys at FAA facilities.  I also enjoyed teaching courses in radiation safety and measurement. The program manager in Washington D.C. was very supportive. I learned a tremendous amount health physics and met many wonderful people in the FAA.This company has a wonderful work life balance with a 9 80 work schedule and flex time.  It's nice to be able to control your own schedule when life happens, and not have to notify god and country of needed time off.With downsizing, being able to do more with less as far as staffing goes isn't unbearable, but the compensation is less than par.This was a typical cubicle workplace, easy to fall into a simple and repetitive routine.  The job had very nice benefits and rarely left me overworked or working overtime.  Management rarely impressed, but the workplace was overall a fairly nice place and there were still plenty of fun and kind coworkers.  It is a large complex, so there are a lot of other people working in the vicinity.Lockheed Martin is BIG, with offices in many states and countries, and many different office cultures. You'll find a suit-and-tie culture around Washington DC, jeans in the western and mountains sates, khakis and button-down shirts throughout.  Production facilities tend to be very deliberate and detail-oriented; as you need to be when your products are those of a major aerospace company. There are also research labs which are more flexible and tolerant of failure, but bring your A-game if you apply.The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to interact with various IT (Contractors) and Federal Civilian professionals. The hardest part of my job was having to deal outdated IT systems and software and find solutions related to problems that arose from that. My coworkers were the best...we had the best IT team.Meetings with top officials, customers, business analysis for website development, serving as liaison between developers and customers, extensive quality testing for web development, helpdesk support, preparing presentations, managing projects using the Agile Methodology, and working independently to solve problems.As the work as a Project Manager was fast paced and sometimes because construction can be unpredictable, esp. if it is outdoors, may be hard to plan any type of vacation, but I really enjoyed the work, the people, including the customer and the site...It was a rewarding and fulfilling experience. I only left Lockheed due to a contract change...wish this never happened...since it was all downhill after Lockheed left.The company provided excellent wages and retirement programs. Incentive programs for employees to benefit their department and weekly meetings with department management for problem solving solutions and clean work environment.I was able to start my days at 530am so I could be done early enough to pick up my children from school. It was work that you could do on your own and were not waiting on someone else to finish so you could start.While I was there for 12 years we did have four different managers. At times there was no manager and when a new one would be hired it was myself that would need to train them. The atmosphere was friendly and fun while also getting your job done.Enjoyed sixteen years of employment working several different programs as an engineer with lots of variety and with lots of new challenges.  Great ethical culture.  In all my years there, there was only ONE time that someone lost their temper and yelled at colleagues.  Great compensation package as well.The best, hard working, dedicated people are the company's biggest plus. Perks? Yes, there are perks (free catered lunch, game room, instruments if you like to jam etc.) But, don't come here for just the perks. This is the San Francisco Bay Area. You can practically go shopping for perks and benefits package. But come here if you want to work with smart, hard working, driven people.LM Sunnyvale was a wreck - unqualified people being promoted and put into positions they were not qualified for.  People were not excited about change.LM Colorado was a different place - things got done, qualified people were hired and we had fun making sure our projects got done and were completed with pride.Currently work at Lockheed Martin as a counselor for consumers. I take an average of 60-70 calls a day giving and submitting accurate information into database. Management and co-workers at my current employer are all team players and they all allow me to do my job daily. It can be challenging mentally but it allows me to challenge myself with each difficult task. I like the fact that I can help people are who struggling with specific issues.I actually worked for Martin Marietta before it merged with Lockheed in 1995. The teamwork among the Executive Secretarial staff was outstanding. The two Assistant Treasurers I supported were good at informing me of what they expected of me and acknowledging me when I performed well. They also handled my errors with understanding and retraining.","10,000+",Atlanta,Marietta,GA,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/53c8d166-9257-4c12-9766-0321bf5c1114?mescoid=1500129001001&jobPosition=18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
