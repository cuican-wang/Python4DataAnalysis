55,4919.0,Quality Control Assistant Scientist,NESCO Resource,3.4,221.0,"Jobs assignments with Nesco were nicebakance of work and travelno assignments were avail after NH contractIve have some tough times here and if you cant lift heavy objects tgen this isnt a job for you at all. My title is gp12 and i enjoy doing my job everydayCall office to see if they have a position open or available, typical learn entry level position jobs. Management is very caring and tries to find a job that best fits you. Co workers are great people to be around, hardest part getting the job that you want. Enjoy working with people that want to help youManaged poorly.  would not recommend working here based on the relationships upper management has with office staff. Very unprofessionalIts all factory work, line assembly. Nothing special about it, long hours, standing on your feet for long periods of time. Most places they place you have good working teams. Some times you get a lazy team but that all depends on the management.Nesco is a staffing agency that works to help you get and keep a job.  If you lose it for whatever reason they always are there to help you find another job.  I've never had an issue with getting hired at a factory after being hired through nesco.Work is not at all hard, but requires constant standing, pulling, lifting and pushing product from one place to another for a minimum wage to limit amount with no room for growth or promotion.Since its a temporary agengy , you aren't guaranteed work and they pay is low. I enjoyed the company I worked for through them and they pay weekly. Overall not too bad if you can find permanent placement.They were on top of everything. The coworkers were very reasonable and easy to work with. The managers and employees were respectful to everyone. I learned how to prep parts and materials before painting them. I worked long hours when it was needed.This job was through a temp agency only. It was a small call center and very laid back . Anice place to work for younger or retired individuals.Went into agency and had job placement same day. Paperwork and initial skill testing is somewhat lengthy but worth it. Takes your interests and skills and helps them match you with a job of the same skill and interest set you have. Can only work at the job assignment for 6 months, but at the end of that 6 months the company can offer permanent employment to the temp employees they are interested in.This company was ok at first but I worked one job with them then they told me I couldn't work threw them anymore but a few weeks later they offer me another job wich I accept then they were very rude to me about my abilities to workUtilizing an ipad you would receive and complete your work assignments, order parts, print, and a couple of other thingsyou have to be at work at 7:00 am during the morning. I learned how to run a packing line and load a truck. some of the floor management were professional but others weren't. Most of my co-workers were pretty cool to work with. They always gave a helping hand when needed.The hardest part about the job was to meet the some of the high quotes of completing some of the work that we were doing. Most of the work that we didn't consist of any group work. The most enjoyable part of the day was lunch , why because we got 45 minutes and and allowed use to finally talk to each other about what different jobs that we were all working on.Help me understand how to work in a high productivity area. Made sure I learned skills to take me to the next level of employment. great place to work for.Worked for a plastics company in Dundee, Florida. You end up being treated like garbage. You'll find yourself doing most of the production supervisors duties while he gets the pay. Management can be quite intolerable and very unconcerned about you. If you find yourself working here leave your dignity and self esteem at home. Count on being lied to!Was told job started at $13. Turns out it was $10.I worked in the Norwalk location at Pinnacle and that was the WORST mistake for a job. That place is a joke. The boss treats his workers like animals. There is no organization what so ever in the factory. I applied to work and 90% of the time I was cleaning. I worked there for 7 months and finally got a different job cause it wasn't worth the mental stress after the boss called me a b****.  Most of the time there isn't any P.P.E so got chemical burns and have scars now on my arms from getting cut. I would contact NESCO to let the office know of everything that was going on and no changes were ever made except NESCO contacted the boss and I would get the 3rd degree or he would make me work harderThe job was very unprofessional and full of drama. I never worked the schedule I was hired in to work. What they call training is shadowing another employee while they're on the phone with a customer. No for real in the class training. They fire employees without explanation...feels like you're walking on eggshells.Had issues with management putting me in an awkward positions with potential jobs. Loved working for Nesco Resources. Would recommend friends to try out Nesco in the future. Hope to find other temp agencies that compare to Nesco in IL.They lied about everything from where I was working to the position.  Nice co-workers.  Bad Bosses.  You work as long as they want.  You stay till the job is doneI did not work at Nesco, I worked contract position at Pfaudler for Nesco for 6 weeks.  Typical day was processing invoices, check runs, filing , addressing vendor issues,",,Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-11-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/897c5d82-ba81-4f41-9d0c-feafa33af48c?mescoid=1900306001001&jobPosition=24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
