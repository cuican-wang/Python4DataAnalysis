37,4901.0,Senior Data Scientist,Bank of America Corporation,3.9,14500.0,"A good place to work if you like to work in financial. a typical banking workforce. they provide good benefits that works for youBank of America Relationship Managers are always on the go. It is a fast paced job that demands a lot from you. If you are looking for a career at a Banking Center that is rewarding and thrilling, than the RM role is for you.This bank was a great place to work at. Met a lot of great people here and definitely learned a lot. Also a lot of pressure to open accounts and achieve goals, your job depends on it. But other than that lots of room to grow  and you advance quickly. Great pay and great benefits.My typical day at Bank of America was always eventful. I would always deepen relationships with clients by providing them with accurate information regarding their financial situations.Bank of America is an excellent corporation to work for.  They value their employees ""Employee recognition day"" every year.  The managers incorporate the banks core values in their everyday routines.  Management is very good at communication and the managers and employees support each other.  Each day we worked hard and had fun at the same time.  I enjoyed working with my associates by supporting them and driving them to excellence.   In  my personal opinion every job has its challenges but once you excel through them it gives you such a great job satisfaction.work was great, fast pace, time went by so fast.i learn to process checks for the Bank.Management help as much as they could.Co-workers was fun to work with, some wasn't. But I was there to do a job.The Hardest about the job..There was a limit to how many checks to do in one night. I wasn't that fast.The most enjoyable part about the job was, I was working.I loved working as a teller for this company. Very positive. Definitely recommend anyone who love working with people to apply. My management team was amazingTeam spirit, drive sales and revenue. requires multi tasking and focusing on clients. Relationship management requires direct contact with clients and sales partners to assure that we are meeting the needs of the customer.As a BofA RM you are basically a glorified cust serv rep.  All the bank  cares about is opening checking accounts for as many cust as possible and sell as many CC as possible. Now Ive heard that every branch is different (which should not be the case) but the branch I worked at had very poor management that seemed to just be learning everything as the days go by and the bank as a whole seemed to embrace this philosophy. Inefficient systems that made it impossible to do anything in a timely manner were an everyday nuisance and everyday that I came into work it seemed that there was some new policy or new way of doing things. A typical day of work includes seeing anywhere from 10-12 customers of which the majority have some issues or complaint, resolving that issue and then find some type of product to sell to them. I did not get along with my coworkers in this branch for the most part (I had 10 different in 5 months)  About the only positive thing I can say about working here where the hours. Bank generally closes as 4pmThis company will work you and under pay you. And the more you give the more they demand. On the other hand it really teaches you many thingsI learned many things while working there. I learned how to multitask in a busy, fast paced environment while handling a lot of cash. Learned how to converse with customers and listen when needed too. Learned how to handle customer complaints and direct them to the manger if I couldn't answer it. Overall working at Bank of America taught me many things and my manger made it more enjoyable. She can be a reference if needed as well.I have made some great connections within the firm because I'm a part of an employee network and I enjoy the connectivityA typical day at work starts with a daily staff meeting where we are all caught up on company news, daily accounts, and our daily SLA's that have to be met for the day. A wake meeting so to speak.During the day i process and personalize on average around 7,500 accounts. I am constantly multitasking and trouble shooting utilizing Data Card and Syntera software and hardware systems, until my company and personal goals are met for the day.I learned that I can do anything that i set my mind to. I am a quick learner. i learned to rely on my teamates and to help the team because we all have common goals and valuesthe hardest part of the job is the production aspect.the most enjoyable part of is the relationships that i have built and cultivate on a day to day basis.You were to come in, do your assigned tasks and go home. The management didn't go out of their way to be extra helpful however my coworkers were great!This is a fast pace environment and always have to adapt to changes and updates in processes and procedures as well as management as there are several updates every month.I would not recommend anyone working here. It's very cut throat and there is very little support from management. Everyone is out for themselves.Nothing but stress, high pressure sales, harassing customers to get them to buy more debt that they don't need. You are instructed to be relentless, push and use high pressure sales tactics to bully customers into loans, credit cards or any other det=bt we can get them into. My blood pressure went to the roof, you have to call customers, peruse their spending habits on their bank accounts so you know what products to cram down their throats. If you enjoy doing all that, this is the job for you. If you have a conscious you will never be able to sleep at night doing the things the demand you do to reach extremely unrealistic sales goals.This company has great job security and multiple opportunities for advancement. The job culture makes you feel like more than an employee but an advocate for change.While working for bank of America Edd I was always being rushed by my supervisor and I did not appreciate it very much the were gonna fire me because I was not quick enough on the typingFast pace work place but worked with very nice people. Day went by so fast when working with great group of people. Worked on different projects with different colleges at very high level.A typical day at work was when me and my team were given a task that is normally done in two weeks to be executed in three days due to clients request.This made me learned a lot like being more proactive,work under pressure as a team,stay focused so as not lost concentration and also communication skills. I make sure at every stage of the job,i keep management aware about the progress.Actually, i have a very wonderful team of co-workers whom we always work as a team and make sure we uplift the name of the company.working alone is not a problem but its more enjoyable working as a team because we put our individual talents  together.To me,the hardest part of the job or task was to meet up with the due-date in order to ensure at all times customer satisfaction.The most enjoyable part of the job was when we submitted the job respecting the three days.","10,000+",Atlanta,Atlanta,GA,2016-09-11T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/48945b03-d88c-4457-8a75-3209e7fcda6e?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
