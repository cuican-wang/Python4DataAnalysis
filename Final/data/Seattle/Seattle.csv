0,3942.0,Data Scientist,Amazon Corporate LLC,3.7,10100.0,"Amazon is a fast-paced, exciting place to work. I highly recommend anyone to apply. Management was strong and colleagues were great.A typical day at work here is always crazy because they set new rules everyday. I have learned to just suck it up and go with what ever come my way for that day. Management has no clue of whats going on. they are some good and some bad coworkers as every job is going to have. But I'm a people person anyway so I'm not really bothered by anyone. The hardest part of my job is having no good direction and no routine at all, everything is so disorganized. The most enjoyable part is only when i get the opportunity to learn new things,One of the worst places I ever worked. I hate how they treat their employees like a number, HR is the worst ever!! There is really no structure, rules changes everyday, to many kids. Coworkers are awesome, the managers, ops managers don't have degrees in their positions. Managers have to many favorites. You really have to kiss butt to move anywhere or try to learn new positions. This place is nothing but about NUMBERS....Could be so much better, if only they cared about their employees.Amazon is a great company to work for.  If you enjoy working in a fast paced environment without supervision; this is the company for you.  It is a good company. They give great incentives, especially; during the holiday.  They practice good safety standards for a warehouse. The best thus far. State of the Art facility and equipment. The company is growing and expanding more and more. An excellent opportunity to learn more about the fulfillment industry.Amazon is a job with great positives that rope you in. They have awesome pay, with minimal requirements. As well as immediate benefits and plenty of overtime. Which is perfect for seasonal workers. But when you are looking to advance you realize the dirty game Amazon plays. Incentives and bonuses are not give, after working so hard to be earned. The stress, from the condition of the environment you work in, combats the mental/physical stress of doing the work at benchmark. There is absolutely no kind of job security. The job just take more from you then you'll ever recieve.Everything about this place reminds of prison, from the orange vest they make you wear, to the safety line you have to walk in, to the constantly working on your feet. Your not being paid to think just work. Supervisors always on your back, similar to a Corrections Officer. Your hard work gets unnoticed so don't try and give 110%, try 65% instead. Work is extremely easy but boring. It's hard to get fired, you pretty much fire yourself by constantly being late or not showing up for workI enjoy my position.  Fun working atmosphere with great Supervisors.  Great benefits.  Hands on supervision.  My typical day at work begins with a stand up procedure to receive all updated announcements.  Work starts out with clocking in to your computer and getting the products ready to Prep...e.g., bagging, taping, bubble wrap, etc.Hardest part of the job is standing on your feet for 10 or 11 hours a shift.Most enjoyable is sitting down at break and lunch.  Resting your feet as much as possible.  Sharing important information with each co-worker to be sure the job process is successful.I wanted to make permanent but has worked there during peak season. It seems like management should know a good worker to refer. i enjoyed working on the dock and even got told by the supervisors that they like my work ethics at work .hardest part was lifting things too heavy or finding out who pulled the e brake to rest the whole conveyor belt for the dockI enjoyed working with my co workers who were willing to work with you and the bosses loved that i would always be willing to help and to learn new work task.A typical day at work would consist of safety checks, start meetings about company numbers and progress. I've learned how to work in a fasted pace production environment, I learned data entry skills,shipping and receiving skills and also I learned how to be proactive in going above and beyond (safely) the call of duty. I like the management because of their experience to teach and provide incite. The hardest part of a job for me was being in an environment where I'm not able to grow. The most enjoyable part of a job would be the people that I worked with which made the time go by fast.Amazon is a very cultural  work place its fun to meet different employees from all over the world. Management and everything about the place is very organized very well.In order to work at amazon you have to be able to work hard and work long shifts daily. The hardest part of the job is the parking lot having patience with the long traffic that comes with working at a very large building. I've learned how to stay focus for a long period of time, how to talk to be people who knows little English, how to act under pressure, and how to be a hard working employee.Loved, loved loved my job at Amazon and was more than thrilled to go in. However the men working there are all a bunch of horndogs without a clue. They dont mind to do as they please and grope you at any given point. Management never done a thing to help. Other than the pig like men, its extremely enjoyable, fast paced and a very friendly/diverse environment. Plus SO many benefits and great time off plan!I believe that if they took control of bad situations that they would be able to have a lower turn over rate. In a typical day they would make you go over the same thing over and over and it was incredibly tedious. I felt that if they put people in certain jobs and considered their abilities and put them in functions that would work better for them, they would have a better work atmosphere.There is absolutely no supervision. They can't keep employees because their rate is too low, the main reason being that employees are too busy socializing and flirting with each other to care. Employees are having ""relations"" in their cars, married and single alike. Safety is also not a concern. There is a lot of horseplay going on. Employees locking wheels on a co-workers cart, taping up the wheels, sticking their feet under a passing coworkers cart's wheels, etc. The employees don't go to work to perform their duties, they go for other reasons. Some employees don't care about the work as much as the at work social life they have, and as a result, merchindise gets damaged.•	Working on Software Development in Digital Software and Video Games Platform.•	Created Auditing System which is a real time expert system implementing business rules. It was required for predictive maintenance and process validation.•	Created a Rules Engine to fire and execute rules and perform required fixations as predictive maintenance.•	Designed the application on Service Oriented Architecture, created services and used Guice Dependency Injection for the faster instantiation and execution of services.Amazon can be a great place to work, they are understanding if you have a family to care for. They do many events for the employees to make things fun,but if you are a seasonal employee your chances of being hired on permanently can be very slim. with the good , and the bad it's still a good place to work.U can work really hard for this company and if u mess up just a lil they we let u go really fast, they say they care about u but they really don't.  all they care about is numbers not the people who works hard. ask anybody there about break time, u only get really is a 9-10 min. break for a 10-11 hr days they r crazy. it takes u 2-3 walk to the break room and 2-3 walk back  u do the math.  to many managers telling u what to do. These workers need to get paid more at Amazon.!!!  Walmart's warehouse get's better pay, lot's of people here left Amazon to Walmart  to better them self. U go to work each day thinking em i getting fired today, not funThere's very little work life balance for most people who want to move up, and the managers are constantly changed around between buildings and departments. In order to move up there's a huge barrier to entry level advancement as Amazon needs base labor, so the majority of folks who start at T1 end at T1. That said, there's a lot of opportunity to grow within your area, and if you're seen as a leader you can become an Ambassador.It was a decent place to work for. Working there is good way to lose weight. The amount of work they expect you to do vs the amount of pay they give you isn't totally worth it. They give you a monthly bonus based on the whole builds productivity instead of your own personal productivity which is not right in my opinion. If you place 2 pieces of product into a wrong bin out of 5,000 plus you do a day they will give you a big lecture on how you are doing a bad job and need to do better or you will get a write up.Don't treat British people nice , rude,nasty attitude have no respect when it comes to their employees where I suffered from anxiety and it isn't a nice place to work where they were pressuring people to keep to speed with targets and productivity which is a form of bullying and punishing the sick people too money too badWarn people who to apply for this could happen to yourselvesGreat benefits after 1 year mark , manangent needs a little work.very fast pace and they don't have any problem getting rid of you , your always walking on egg shells , you only have a certain amount of time you can take off, you get personal like 40hrs (4 days) ,80 (8 days) and vacation accruing 1.35 days every 2 weeks for a year(32 hrs)-3 days and 2hours mandatory OT could be called 12hrs before a shift suddenly usually 4 day shifts on 5 with overtime .I learned how to operate the reach truck, PR, PC, clamp and tugger after over a year of employment although I requested it constantly.  They constantly move you around to other departments that you are not very good in instead of cross training other employees so that there is a rotation instead of the same people always being sent elsewhere.  Favoritism was a major problem there.","10,000+",Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-11-01T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/data-scientist-job-seattle-wa-us-175194584.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Also you should be prepared for no clear direction from management, and ineffective training/tools to do the job.  Every decision made is for the company to save money at expense of employees, Job responsibilities are piled on with ineffective compensation. Very little in terms of recognition. Policies not clearly defined.   PTO accrues but if you are let go it isn't paid out.  Hides behind being a ""start-up"" business.  Management lacks clear direction. Management is also very corporate in their attitude towards employees and severely lacks emotional intelligence.  If you enjoy being very nervous and uneasy while you work, then this is the place for you.Fun Place With Good Benefits. If You Like Computers, You Will Like This Job. Not A Lot Of Chance To Advance. Cool Place With Cool People.-no work life balance-no bonus structure-great co-workers-great company values and moral-desk job-good benefits-zulily was a great place to bring forward and implement new ideas.  As an emerging leader in the e-commerce industry, they valued innovation and taking risks.  As a supervisor in the studio, I learned a lot about maximizing creative talent in a corporate environment.  The hardest part of the job was also the funnest part of the job: a very fast-paced environment that kept me on my toes for 2 years.  I would recommend this as a place to work for anyone looking to build their creative portfolio.nice warehouse,  mostly nice peoplethe pay was fair, and work was fair, for the pay except maybe during just a couple days in the holidays when they over rush you and quotas got to be to highI arrive at work about 30 minutes before I clock in, to prepare for the day.  I was always taught to be early and prepare for the day. After clocking in I check the board in my assigned department and see where I am working for that particular day.  I am knowledgeable in all areas of the warehouse, so I go where I am needed.  I train new employees, to go and research items from vendors who send us items that need to be verified, ex. match the picture, and are what they say they are.Everyone at Zulily was very pleasant and willing to help. Everyone worked together as a team to resolve any unsolved answers or concerns. As a International Support Specialist, I assist international  customers with placing, tracking, returning or canceling orders. The goal is to do whatever makes its right for the customer, allowing flexible resolutions.The company is good in general but one can easily observe poor management and coordination. In most cases they are task oriented with little or no concern for the general safety and choices of the workers.Fun place to work but it takes alot out of a person. They take care of the employees and it's a very fun job if you can handle it. Peak will be fun. Good company.I have a chance to help customers all over the world. I have learned an appreciation for retail, sales, postal service and working hard as a team. The hardest part of the job was which of the many offers to give. The most enjoyable part was knowing that I could help and think outside of the box to give the customer great service.Receiving, picking/packing, and shipping. zulily is a retailer obsessed with bringing moms special finds every day—all at incredible prices. zulily is fast-paced, data-driven and down to earth company with unique and challenging tech problems to solveI see Zulily like a baby Amazon.Because it is a baby Amazon for babies, kids, and moms. But now its becoming more and more a bit of everything anyway, I say its good to start off because they will hire almost anyone but also fire almost anyone too. If you work hard you will get far, and if you do poor than you won't have much luck. This was my first warehouse job and I got to know all the stations and all functions really got to know how well a warehouse really works. Management was a problem, there was lack of communication and we would in trouble for things one manager told us to do while the other manager didn't want us to do that certain task. It was odd sometimes but overall a warehouse is a warehouse. And I made good money.zulily is a growing company with strong leadership truly focused on doing what is right for the customers and employees.  It is a fast paced environment and can sometimes be challenging to keep up with.  But they have a strong belief that we learn best through our mistakes and encourage you to take chances.A typical day at work:+ Inventory of product+ Occasionally putting product in their proper locations What I have learned:+ Learned how to work with ipods and Honeywells+ Learned how to pick and pack, receive product, inventory, auditing, stocking product, sorting productMy co-workers:+ Morale among workers very low+ Can be a hostile work environmentThe hardest part of the job:+ Rules constantly changing+ Poor communication between management and workers+ Lack of accountability+ Opportunity for advancement poorThe most enjoyable part of the job:+ The work itself is not hardGreat Place to work in the Columbus, Ohio area.

Employees are highly intelligent and have rock solid values.  The benefits are incredible, and work/life balance is a priority.  The only drawback is that there isn't any growth opportunity for the support staff.  As a non-hierarchical company, employees are all equal, so promotions do not exist.

They are only there because they know someone higher up. It's a great company if you work on the consulting side and starting at the bottom will not get you there. They only hire consultants from top 10% in ivy league schools. If you work as an assistant in procurement, be careful who your managers are. Some will belittle you, yell at you in from of people over the most stupid thing and require you to take a test before being hired which doesn't apply to assistant work at all. Benefits are great if you are a full time employee and they won't let you take time off in the first year. Following year, approach with caution. This place is all about politics and favoritism. If you get on the wrong side of a manager, you won't get a promotion. They are experts are making you believe you will move up and when the time comes they will give you some excuse. They will try to give you the least amount of money and work you like a dog.Only good to put on resume because of the name.The work was pretty boring and kind of a grind but the people here were so nice to work with.

I worked with many good people during my career by continual downsizing has had impact on work environment.They treat you horrible and don't care what you have to say. They never see what good you are doing at your job, only what you're not doing. I couldn't work there anymore.I loved speaking with the various different people every day and the ability to help them. I loved the fast paced environment and co workers.  The hardest part was the mental fatigue of 4, 12 hour days.   LolAssisting customers with their technical support issuesLearning how to utilize the multiple computer screens daily Management team was okMy co workers were all over the place most of the timeHardest part was not being able to give the customer everything they wantThe employers were great created a very comfortable work environment, several incentive programs, and holidays were always fun, very casual, laid back place to work!I worked for Sprint under Xerox. Horrible, horrible horrible. They do not care about employees. Will fire you at the drop of a dime( highest turnover rate). When I resigned( was not fired), 2 months later they were closing the site. Didn't surprise me one bit.A typical work day is good. I learned how to give customers the satisfaction if they are irritated.My co-workers are helpful we all help each other and try too direct each other in the best direction.There really isn't a hard part on my job everything that I do, I try my best to make no mistake. If I make a mistake I learn from it and not dwell on it. Make sure it doesn't happen again.The most enjoyable part is De-escalating the caller on the other line.Xerox is a great place to work there are plenty of opportunities and advancement in the company . Definitely is a great place and has great balance between job and home lifeManagement is mismanaged, high turn overrate. High pace environment. But turn over rate is so high easy chance for advancement. Low pay rates for the amount of work that is asked of you.long hour that did not pay well enough for the amount of pressure that was put on me. the training did no adequately teach me how to perform well.Training is a pressurized joke and not complete.Will be thrown into cold water early stating ""need"" of people on the floor ... it's a ruse they do to everyone.Will not work with your scheduling needs and put pressure on your personal/family life for company purposes.Is willing to risk employee health & safety on the bad winter weather days in order to stay open!!!What enjoyed most was the flexibility in you schedule.  I was afforded the opportunity to work from home 2 days a week (Monday & Friday's, selected by the Director).I worked there for a year and a half very poor management You can ask a supervisor a question and they never know the answer. Stressful and drama environment all upper management talk about each other and complain about eacother to employees about work not getting done. They expect you to never ever  be a minute late ( like we can controle weather, highway crashes etc.) and never miss even if family emergencies.I would go in call center be sure all updates needed were posted and received calls to assist with Humana.  It was a different job culture for me I do not prefer working in call center environment.Let this be your last option/choice for a job. This job will leave you with no life, over worked and under paid. Management dont care about issues that may arrive in you life. You need to be at work when you are suppose to be there no matter what.Overall, Xerox is not a bad place to work. One of the biggest benefits is that you can work from home, saving a great deal of money on commuting, among other things. You also get paid-training, and get to be a part of a team generally filled with interesting individuals from all over the United States. Work is fast-paced, and there is never a dull moment.However, there are some glaring problems that stick out like a sore thumb:- Disconnect with management. From the upper management, down to our supervisors, down to our advisors, there is a terrible disconnect. Misinformation gets strewn around constantly, and at times it seems like our upper management team has no idea what actually goes on or how to fix certain problems (such as attendance).- Poor compensation. Base pay is excellent, starting around $10/hr, and you can qualify for RBC (results-based compensation). However, maintaining any significant level of RBC is nearly impossible, and how it works is not very apparent. Additionally, there are no raises for tenured employees. You could be there for 5 years, and still be making your starting pay.- Lack of opportunities for advancement. If you're looking for a place where you can grow as an individual, this may be the right job for you. But if you're looking for the opportunity to move up into a leadership position, this is not an excellent place to be. Lower performers tend to be promoted before the highest-performing employees, and its possible to have a top performer that's been there for 2 years still stuck in an advisor role while someone who has been  more... there for 3 months advances and moves up.  lessxerox has really good incentives and bonuses but if you have kids i wouldn't recommend it, the schedules are trash, the supervisors are lazy and the policies they have in place are a little to drastic. in training we were told the schedules go by attendance but that was a lie , i was there every day on time and still got a trashy schedule. i hated it there, and the distance i had to drive to get there was absolutely not worth it. if you do not have kids and your young i do suggest you apply because the money is the only thing good about the company, everything else,  i could honestly pass on.Company itself offers decent benefits. Hired us at a certain time as to not offer us holiday pay it was all a strategy they planned to hire tech support reps for the iPhone 7 release.I get to travel to different Xerox clients and work in a variety of industries at the client locations. I have also had permanent on site assignments.Attendance policy needs to be changed. Also needs to give further review to staffing as they are giving people days off for OT but not seeing shortagexerox is a great place to work. i enjoy everything about it from the actual facility itself. its beautiful not a uptight everybody stressed out environment like you would typically see in an corporate setting. even down to the management the supervisors and instructors are phenomenal.","10,000+",Seattle,Redmond,WA,2016-12-01T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/data-scientist-job-redmond-wa-us-176966814.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

21,3963.0,Data Scientist (Natural Language Processing),Xerox Corporation,3.4,7900.0,"Organization that values diversity but can be very slow and bureaucratic when it comes to making decisions. I worked with many good people during my career by continual downsizing has had impact on work environment.Most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with the people I support and fixing technical issues they have.Worst parts...Labor reductions at the lowest levels while upper management continues to create new management positions to alleviate their workload.  Tight spending controls.Outdated and out-of-service IT infrastructure.  Understaffed with few advancement opportunities.Underpaid by Xerox standards, grossly underpaid by State averages.Expensive/poor healthcareGood management, but a rather limited traditional work culture.  Business oriented, segmented work place.  The culture appeared fragmented.  Some areas/ divisions were singularly focused on narrow tasked based, goal oriented accomplishments, while others areas offered a more open environment. This was probably due to the old business genesis of the copier business.  However Xerox is known for their technical inventions.  They were the original creator of the window based graphical operating system made famous by apple and Micorsoft.  They invented the ""mouse"", as well as modern computer networking.  They are also know for having started more startups by former employee's than any other business.  Good people with unimaginative management.When I say 12 dollars, I mean it. That's all you will make. Unless you make friends with someone in management, then you can get some side deals where they add hours to your check. There is no advancement and no raises. It's almost impossible to get fired so everyone works (or doesn't work) as much as they want. People show up whenever they feel like it and everyone else has to suffer.If you are one of the few that believes in pulling your own weight, management will take advantage of you, and you will be pulling everyone else's weight too.You will be promised the moon and given nothing.Nepotism Trump's merit.It was the worst 10 months ever. I was mad everyday and it raised my blood pressure. I didnt enjoy working there. The management is a joke and turn around rate is outrageous. If they stop feeding the new hires pizza and donuts everyweek to cover up lies and deception that this place was a good place to work, maybe just maybe they could keep their other employees happy. Stop worrying about my starbucks cup on my desk and pay me more for the under appreciated work i am doing instead of worrying about petty things. Run a functional business and not this horrendous storm you call a business opportunity.A typical workday / call flow was moderate, I learned a lot about payroll and benefits. Management could have been a bit better about being knowledgeable and the co workers were great and helpful. The hardest part of the job was when the call flow increased and i still had other admin duties to attend. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers and co workers. There was no room for advancement; the were no raises or bonuses; management was not very knowledgeable; the attendance policy was not great; benefits could have been a lot better, and training was not good at all. Everything that you learn you had to learn on your own or through co workers.Xerox is a great place to work. They provide many benefits to enrich the work lives of employees. Company training is plentiful so that career advancement is possible. Expectations are set to allow employees to work toward specific goals and objectives. Performance issues are dealt with in a way that allow a struggling employee the change to correct the problem and management offers assistance. Pay is fair, employees are rewarded if the expectations are met or exceeded. Benefits are very good. A very professional and fair work environment.The work day is steady with filling customer orders, fixing paper jams, and stocking supplies. If you are a good worker who does above and beyond for customers, they will show more appreciation than my coworkers. I was an employee with Xerox a year and about to get a pay raise when they fired me for no reason. I learned later I got hired so a managers friend could work there. For this I can't recommend this company to anyone looking for job security or an advancement in their career.Xerox will hire anyone and they usually let the good ones walk. They do not give raises for any reason. They promise advancement in the company, yet can't make up their mind on what they are going to do. I've seen people go through training to get higher in the company and that training completely come to a halt. We get promised bonuses and commissions but never receive them. Management is usually of hiding in a bathroom or their vehicle or the break room and sometimes even in the back of the empty cubicles playing in their phones, of which aren't even allowed the floor. The stress caused by the company is far worse than that of what customers for Verizon could ever put us through.Xerox has a well rounded management staff and offers a level compensation package. While also proving to be an equal opportunity employer allowing employees to interview and relocate to other positions in the company.However the ability to receive raises in regards to knowledge and experience obtained is a short shot at best.Very poor management. Employees not accredited for their work. Harassing work environment. Overall, the job itself was enjoyable and interesting on a day to day basis, but management made the position not enjoyable at all. Management only focused on the negative portion of the job. Very little praise and/or credit was given to any employeeWorked there for 4 years for decent wage, other than that its one of the worst companies you can work for. The management is unprofessional and are incompetent. They have favorites and those can get away with anything. The rest are treated like dirt. They also seem to hire all the bottom feeders that no one else would hire, not even Walmart. Stay away if you can.Every morning we will do quality control on all bank levies. Once it hit 10 am, we will then start our deposits for all the banks. we send our checks electronically as an image cash letter to nine banks. when this is completed, we will then work on all reject checks and return it back to remitter. At the end of each day we will reconcile and balance into an excel spread sheet.I have worked for this company on two occasions and my expectation was higher the second time around. The company has a high attrition rate due to job dissatisfaction and low compensation.A typical day at work is very stressful because there are client and employee needs which requires undivided attention, so it make the work day extensive.I have learned about time management and had the best attendance rate for my team, which went unrecognized.The hardest part of the job is keeping everyone happy at the same time and the most enjoyable part of the job was training and coaching a great team to exceed expectations.Xerox values the contributions of it's employees. The listen and have good compensation; both monetary and nonmonetary.  The management team is great to work with on all levels.  The team atmosphere keeps everyone dedicated to their jobs and contributes to a very pleasant, yet stressful at times, environment.I came from a company that compensated their employees well. When I came here, I was shocked at the salary. After all, Xerox is a well known global company. I'm trying to give constructive criticism. I don't see how people or families survive on the salary. The pool time needs to be revamped. People need ample time off, come back to work & feel good about it. I hope someone from the company takes a look at pool time. I really enjoyed meeting & working with the people. My co-workers are great & helpful. Everyone is nice, including Management. If Xerox is going to make changes, they have to pay their employees and revamp their benefit package. Why should someone wait a whole year to get matched by the 401K Plan? I hope this helps!I've been working at the company from 2011 till 2016.  The upper management at Xerox seems interested in doing their best to sustain the workforce and came out with a Call Center of the Future model which included getting rid of desk phones and replacing them with Avaya software and improving the break room as well as installing large flat screen TV's on the call center floor.The best part of the job is building friendships with those you work with and being able to positively impact the lives of thousands of clients.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with an extremely high call volume during certain times of the year.  It is no fun getting back to back calls with no breaks in between calls and just being over-worked in general.If you are a high school graduate looking for your first job this is a good job for you. It has decent benefits and the pay is one dollar above Taco Bell. However, management is very unprofessional. It is extremely hard to promote. Its almost like being in high school again. The job demands are great and it can be frustrating being so worked with so little pay. No holidays off. I even had to work Christmas day without holiday pay. With over 500 employees one is easily recycled until the next individual comes along. Good for a first job, but definitely not a career.Very layed back easy work. Management has their days. Poor communication skills, and employee courtesy. Most employees are in their very early 20's and have a lack of work ethic. Hardest part of the job would probably be when the machine is not working correctly. They do not have many incentives. NO raises or any kind of employee appreciation except pizza delivered maybe once a month.It was chaotic, high turn over and most of management looked through you or at worse at you as a number not a person. High stress environment and don't expect them to remember who you are. When I left the company they screwed up on either A. sending the message along or B. Mistook me with another employee, as they had me marked down as having left 3 days after I actually quit. When I went for unemployment and the unemployment group called them, they DID mix me up with another employee and got my benefits denied as a result.The only good thing at the company was the pay was above average and the health insurance was good and not expensive.The DVP that I reported to as well as our RVP were to great leaders whom I learned a lot from because the kept feeding an employee who wanted to do more.   I managed business in 5 call centers, 4 US, 1 in Canada.  I also managed a global work force management team. I was reasonable for the budget creation and P&L of my client portfolio.  The only reason I left was at the time I had two young children at home and I was missing too much of their lives.  It was one of the toughest decisions I have had to make in my call center career.","10,000+",Seattle,Redmond,WA,2016-12-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/5a6aa69f-2d40-4c3e-9971-ea06a0e16f50?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

78,4020.0,"Associate Scientist II, Biomarkers-Seattle","Gilead Sciences, Inc.",3.8,76.0,"Its a good company to work. It enhanced all my skills and also the management was very friendly. I love working in this environment. The colleagues were very encouraging.Working at Gilead is an great experience getting to know people through different departments. Sometimes  a day can be very busy to a calm day like on a Friday.  Lastly enjoying the happy hour on Friday and just catch up with your friends at work.  It something good to feel about coming to work everyday.A typical day at work is a mixed bag of  lulls and a deluge of challenging tasks.What I've learned is to expect anything.Management is autocratic; this is unfortunately consistent with the industry, and shows no signs of abating.Co-workers are on edge, most are contractors and are pre-occupied with job security.Hardest/unpleasant part of the job is that communication style from management is uni directional.Most enjoyable part of the job thus far is the cafeteria, If I'm being hones. But I'm fairly new so there is hopefully room for that to change.Great place to learn. Lot of cross-functional exposure. Good management. Great co-workers. very busy place. Can keep you working for ever. More work less fun though.The most discouraging place I ever worked, A company chock full of individuals that are not collaborating, and encourage a trickle down system of information.A telephone game of long hours, on call, and pour treatment.My supervisor once told me that a coworker could not be sleeping on the job, he was "" A good Christian Brother"" and this was just another day on the job! This place is terrible.Company runs very lean and IT management is not mature to operate under lean workload. No employee reward, management is disconnected with individual contributors.I was originally brought on as a Front-End Developer, however after working with management and assessing user needs based on UX analysis methods it was clearly evident that the current UI wasn't addressing the complex user needs. Gradually my position transitioned to redesigning the UI and conducting UX design research to gather data.Overall my experience was great! I had the opportunity to work with and learn from talented and seasoned developers. A typical day would consist of brief in depth meetings to assess daily workloads & how to implement and leverage technologies such as Angular JS, JAVA, javascript libraries, UI design sprints and timelines.The benefits and stock options here are great but the company culture and work life balance are pretty bad. Most employees are doing the work of 3 people and it is impossible to work just a normal 8 hours day. The workload is not only heavy but very demanding as alot of the work is very urgent. The political nature of this company doesn't allow for quick progress unless a manager personally likes you. Promotions aren't based off of what you know or the work you put in, but instead on if that manager wants you to be promoted or likes you enough to do it.Fast paced environment, excellent team and stable product pipeline. Access to the latest recruiting tools and technology and a sense of team support that is positive and geared towards learning.Great company with outstanding product line.  Very ethical.  Outstanding leadership team and winning corporate culture.  I no longer work there, but often wish I still did.Best place to work i loved working over there all employeeres are friendly. management was excellent. The best part of my job is My team. I am so fortunate to be part of a team that, despite everyone’s differences and eccentricities, manages to make every day at work seem like an episode of tosh.0.fast paced environment, high expectations, not enough work life balance, no WFH policy, different rules for different folks, not enough focus on employee development from managers due to pace of organization (managers themselves are swamped, and don't always know or have patience to understand employee's needs),  not always objective, emphasis  how one's image is portrayed to the team rather than collaborative approach of working together towards common goal, significant turn-over within organizationNice very expensive cars all across the campus.Really bad culture that claims "" it all about the science"" when in reality its all about the profit. Need a new CFO ASAP.Oracle EBS Functional and Technical.Good Job Culture.Participated in all Design phases of this project.Learned more anout OPM and had adapted to different project reuirements,We have a team size of 5 with developers and Functional consultants.The harderst part of the job is to meet the complex req's which are solely in OPM .The most enjoyable part of the job is despite stringent deadline we could meet all the req's and development with minor issues during Golive.The people and policies reflect a culture that is toxic to professionals. Asking questions is prohibited and career advancement is at the expense of personal dignityI learned a great deal about clinical research conduct within the US and globally.  I had the opportunity to work with a great individuals who shared their wealth of knowledge and support for my growth and progression.Depending on the division your in makes a difference in the job culture you are subjected to.  IHD is the red headed step child of the organization and is treated poorly.  Minimal support for Managed Care Contracting.Gilead was a great work experience for me, especially as my first major company. Management not only managed, but also did a good portion of the work which made myself and fellow employees feel as though it was a team effort. There were definitely opportunities for advancement and the compensation was good.Not a place to go to develop in a role. You are on your own. There is a very negative company culture that applauds over working until the point of burn out.There is essentially no work-life balance  and they can care less about your well being and your family. All they care about is making money. ""For the love of money is the root of all evil!"" Gilead demands you to work untill they tell you to go home. I'm not joking here, I slept in my car after working back to back 15-20 hour shifts. I have the many time card printouts to prove it! Gilead clams this is the best package you can find. Well these people haven't worked anywhere else in alot of years, they are inexperienced in what is offered out there now a days. What good is having benefits when you cant even take time off to go to the dentist or doctors because if your not at work your missing deadlines which hold up production which equals loss of money. This place is cancerous and I was out of there before that cancer killed my relationship with my family. You can make money anywhere, this place is not the only place in the world to make a great living in. If you care about your family and your well being look for employment elsewhere. If you just care about making money this is a place for you. But let me tell you all the money in the world cant buy happiness.A lot of one-on-one opportunities to really talk about your goals, your future, and also the future and state of the company itself.","5,001 to 10,000",Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-11-10T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/associate-scientist-ii-biomarkers-seattle-job-seattle-wa-us-175840409.aspx?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

92,4034.0,"Decision scientist, Retail Operations, Business Strategy - Seattle, WA",Starbucks Coffee Company,4.1,10300.0,"The company is willingly to develop their employees as much and as far that employee wants to go.work days varied, all co-workers worked together  and had good customer service., benefits were very good, regular pay raises, insurance.and free starbucks coffee.Colleagues were amazing. Fun and eventful days at work. Making coffee, practicing the foam art, all in a days work. When we weren't getting orders through the window, cleaning and ensuring the areas were clean, were also a part of the daily duties.I enjoy this job and my team.  Position can be enjoyable, yet stressful. Toughest part of the job is the toll on me physically.i just didn't  like unstable they were with their hours, you would get sent home early so they could cut labor, i liked working in a team. the hardest part was having to be on the floor on your ownThis job is great. I love my coworkers and the management team, although the customers can be very difficult to deal with at times. Overall a great job, however consistently burning your hands on hot coffee is hard to handle.Depending on the shift, my day typically differed vastly. The store had a great workflow established for morning, mid and evening shifts. I was initially filling in positions to help the store since I was new. So I would warm pastries during the morning rush and run the to the front counter or drive through. I'd brew coffees/teas, refill milks, juices, cups, lids, straws etc. I'd open another register to help clear lines during rushes. I'd clean dishes, lobby, the bathrooms, the store. Other days I'd be focused on making drinks on ""the bar"" or I'd be assigned a register.Starbucks is an amazing company to work for. I was hired while in high school and continued to work there through graduating college. They offer amazing benefits and are very flexible with school or other work schedules. There are always opportunities for advancement!It was a very rewarding job with many perks. I experienced a new atmosphere and learned many new skills. I enjoyed the job but the management was terrible and was the reasoning for my resignation.Great place to work at . NIce vibe to it . Free drinks. Free food. Free markout every week. Great benefits. They have a college achievement plan !Customers are amazing and loyal once they know you put them first.  Working in a drive thru store requires multi-tasking at a whole other level if you are a shift or store manager.  Must ensure routines are followed at all times, otherwise good intentions from staff can cause chaos quickly.  Great company and AMAZING benefits if you work for corporate store.  Don't waste your time with license store though, because it doesn't come close in benefits.Have a positive relationship with your co-workersProductive dayBe efficientStay motivatedFollow instructions from management Contribute new ideasStarbucks is a great job and I miss it. You start your day off by prepping the coffee for sales. I learned about how communicating with customers can make the business a better place. there is nothing hard about this job, it is so easy-going & fun. the  co-workers are really fun to be around.A day working at Starbucks is so much fun it's like you never know what to expect when you walk into work, you meet new people everyday the customers are always nice and welcomeStarbucks is great at fitting to your schedule whether it is early days, short shifts, etc. But the real plus is the benefits, health, stocks, free coffee, tuition reimbursement. The pay is good for a part time job but not something that you can live off of comfortably.Lots of customer service with a smile! I learned how to balance many tasks and prioritize between them. It was a very busy job that required full engagement to do the job right. I learned a lot from this job and it helped to have the management that I did. The hardest part of this job was the continuous mind numbing customer service in the early mornings, but the best part was also the continuous customer service. I enjoyed being the smiling connection that helps others jump start their morning and get their day going.I loved working for this company. The atmosphere is always great and the people you work with are just as good. i learned a lot more about customer service working here because it is such an engaging job.Rewarding in every aspect of the job.  Excellent Mission and Values to live by both inside and outside of the job.  Excellent work life balance.Overall Starbucks is a great company. The people here are generally uplifting and the workplace is mostly cheerful.I would recommend working here for sure.Starbucks used to be a great company to work for. But as of late, the standards and expectations are on the rise while we labor is cut and we are meant to do the work of 2-3 people at once. It feels impossible. One of the more frustrating things is the fact that tenured partners' wages have been ""bumped to the new minimum"" so that people that are just hired or just been promoted are all making the same amount of money. A new supervisor that has been promoted is making the same amount as one that has been doing the exact same position for 3 years. Morale is at an all time low all around.This was my first job. I was not trained for very long at all. I was hired during the busiest season and we were short staffed so that put a lot of stress on me. My co-workers were nice and understanding though.","10,000+",Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-11-19T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/decision-scientist-retail-operations-business-strategy-seattle-wa-job-seattle-wa-us-176375023.aspx?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

My Boss at th time was a wonderful women and the HR department was the best. I loved the fact that the engineers treated me like I was family. The location was wonderful and I really enjoyed working with this company for almost 8 years.HDR had one of the easiest environments to work in that I have ever experienced. The people are wonderful, the management let's you figure things out on your own but is always there to answer your questions, and they make an effort to allow you to work on tasks and get involved with the company when you express certain desires to do so.Wonderful company in every aspect. Highly recommended.Lots of large complex projects with many challenges daily.  learned many things about working in large national teams.HDR is a great place to work at.  Lots of projects and oppurtunities.  Large room for growth and advancement to management.This was a type of contract job.  I learned contract jobs have you feeling a bit used and unappreciated. My direct Supervisor is nice and my coworker is great.Im needing to find a job as soon as possible. Hdr was not a great job for me due to the lack of help and communication from the supervisor there is no set job at HDRI love coming to work and do what I do everyday. Learning new things, Helping people with anything the need. There is good and bad days but always make the best out of it no matter what. There is always a solution to everything.The job was very interesting and provided excellent mentoring for a young engineer right out of college.  Commercial buildings and industrial plant experience combined.In the short time I have worked with HDR as I have been on contract with them I have come to respect their work and their management. Compensation is fair, and working expectations are reasonable. It is a large company and seems to have great opportunity to work worldwide.HDR has a strong benefits package including a well performing ESOP. Leadership is honest and hardworking and doesn't take cutting people lightly just to make a few extra bucks. HDR is a nice sizde firm to work for with all the resources of a large company but the feel of a small one.A typical day would include processing all AR/AP entries in QuickBooks.  Handling payroll for a small staff of 5 employees.  Responsible for finalizing and submitting quotations to potential customers both in the industrial and municipal markets.   Manage inventory of spare parts and arrange for shipment of equipment to locations nationwide.The management and people in general at HDR are fantastic.

Well managed and productive office. It's just too bad it's in Houston, Texas. Friendly co-workers, family atmosphere, lots of office functions to make for a real team feel. I have done work for several states because HDR is one of the best at work sharing between offices.This can be a great company to work for in the right situation. I was an employee for the Chicago office for 6 years remotely. I worked out of an office in Springfield, approximately 4 hours south if Chicago.I was laid off due to reduction in work in the area. I firmly believe the Department Heads there did everything they could to not let me go, but ultimately were forced to by the corporate office.I was asked to rejoin the office in 2014 as a remote employee working out of my home. I was glad to do this as HDR has always been very good to me and to work for and with.Strong culture of excellence while rebuilding interstate roads and bridges. Accelerated pace of construction which inspired ingenuity and problem solving while offering much experience in a compressed amount of time.This is a very fast-paced company with major responsibilities.  The crew is among the hardest working people that I've had the pleasure of working with.HDR offers excellent benefits and I loved the culture. I worked in the Claremont branch and was laid off after 3.5 years of employment.  Since I have been unemployed from the company many employees have been laid off or have left due to poor management specifically the department manager.The employee benefits and PTO are excellent. Management could have been more in touch with employees. Communication from management was lacking. I worked with many good and hard working people.","5,001 to 10,000",Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-11-17T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/sr-marine-scientist-acoustician-job-seattle-wa-us-176282388.aspx?mescoid=1900265001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The hardest part of my job was when my voice wasn't heard  when it came to stating my opinion about certain situations, such as behaviors and my advice on what I thought would be the best way to deal with it.The most enjoyable part of my job was making sure my consumers was well taken care of I went beyond my job many times to make sure that they were, I listened when i was needed to do so, I was always considerate and mindful of their feelings.The company knew them through paperwork, I new them by being there.This organization does what is needed to promote a healthy work environment. Every individual contributes to your knowledge of the organization. No one says, ""That's not my job'Wonderful co workers. Ability to work with individuals that have faced much adversity. Being able to house individuals that have been homeless.Extremely interesting and rewarding work. Wonderful group of people. Just not enough work. Would often come out of a session emotionally drained, but in a good sense. Felt I began to truly understand how it must feel to be a seriously ill person. Therefore very rewarding to feel one has a part in alleviating people's pain by helping to train a new generation of doctors. Love the medical students ! Extremely bright and dedicated young people. And it's wonderful to see people from all different parts of the world and different religions and nationalities working together as colleagues.In the outside world these people would have been enemies but here they are brothers and sisters. And each time, at each session one learns so much from the professors. It's like going to medical school without having to pay for medical school ! And the more I learn the better I feel my work is, with a deeper understanding of all the subtle complexities of human illness. I love this company for its seriousness of purpose and yet for the very human way they treat their employees. The light touch, not the heavy hand. And there is no sense of routine, but rather of constantly searching for how one can improve.Co-workers are very helpful and make working environment comfortable and less tedious. Hardest part of the job is seeing clients becoming discourage in their abilities to do different things and when they begin decompensating. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping others achieve their goals.I enjoyed working at PATH, Inc. But his was a temp position and I wanted to remain there full time. Staff was friendly and helpful. I would have enjoyed working there for a longer period of time.Assisted Behavioral Health Office Supervisor with reminder calls to clients.Processed information for doctors and physical therapistsCopied, filed and faxed information for doctors and therapists as requested.Backup ReceptionistIt's a wonderful place to work--meaningful mission, plenty of smart people and a friendly environment. Each individual's input is valued Work-life balance is great. Pay is not bad and the benefits are very good. The only minus is the funding uncertainty since projects are funded by grants.I've been an employee of PATH-CONNECTIONS HOUSING San Diego since the doors opened in 2013. What I've found about the San Diego office is management allows staff to be creative, which promotes ""Thinking Outside of the Box."" Since working working with this organization I've elevated my skill-set, tailored my communication skills, build comprehensive community partnership, and most of all strengthen my self-confidence. I'll admit if you're there for the money, than expect to work for it. As for management, there was a time I experienced discourse, but once that was handled I have nothing but praise toward our management team. I'm grateful to have a organization that is not just a leader, but also has the ability to follow(staff suggestions).Lastly when it comes to case management, I decided to give it a #.......#WeAreCaseManagement. If you're innovative and a 360 Thinker than come join the team. A Catalyst for Change.Not a place for aspiring mid career professionals with experience. Great for a first job or established executives. Great exposure, but instability and lack of management throughout organization.Did a lot of paperwork making due had all documentation to order prescription meds. Worked with diverse populations most of them in poverty level.My time working at this agency was rather unpleasant. Upper management neglected mid management and other staff. Some employees and security often stole cleaning supplies and the best donations. There was negative competition between departments which lead to staff trying to embarrass one another. One example of pettiness was workers sending inflammatory emails and copying other workers plus upper management. One worker smiled and told me it's the PATH culture too highlight through email perceived staff errors. Less than stellar front line staff are constantly hired to work with the clients because the agency chooses to pay 25k or less while paying 90k and higher to upper management. Many of the workers do the least required to maintain work. The agency seems afraid of lawsuits and allows stealing, repeated tardiness, case managers who refuse to meet with clients regularly, harassment, childish behavior, inappropriate behavior with clients (talking down to clients, exchanging personal phone numbers with clients, friend in them on social media, and using clients as servants).Enjoy helping patients with daily living.Administer MedicationsPrepare mealsTransport to AppointmentsAssist with daily activitiesEnvironment very friendlyThis was and it continues to be thriving. As a Psychology major it has been a learning lesson for me. I was able to pick up what I learned at school and apply it to work.PATH (People Assisting the Homeless) is a great place to work and the rewarding feeling of assisting one individual at a time to not only find permanent homes but following them for a minimum of 12 months to ensure they are successful in transitioning into housing is a part of PATH policy and procedures. I love this about PATH because you truly are changing the lives of individuals as a whole and it is not only about the agency. The administration always put the clients first and for me this was a plus.I have been working as a biostatistics consultant for PATH for almost a year.  I love the projects that I get to work on, because I believe in the innovation that PATH brings to its research projects.  I like being able to work from home, but feel connected to a broader team of PATH employees, consultants, and field workers around the world.  My favorite part of the job is working with like-minded people who want to change the world, and who need me to use my specialized skills in biostatistics and computer programming.  Unfortunately, the work is contracted, and I am looking for a little job security, ideally in a full-time position.The staff at PATH are so kind and loving, you can tell they really love their jobs. They want to be there for people, and do what they can to help their clients get the best service possible.It has been a pleasure developing my teaching ability and communication skills.  I work with a variety of people and love the interaction amongst a variety of individuals.Outreach, SOAR program, and case management with individuals experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness.",,Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-10-19T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/biostatistician-center-for-vaccine-innovation-access-job-seattle-wa-us-174419229.aspx?mescoid=1500153001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

244,4186.0,Research Scientist II - AMZ1564,Amazon.com,3.7,10100.0,"Amazon is a fast-paced, exciting place to work. I highly recommend anyone to apply. Management was strong and colleagues were great.A typical day is a 10 hour shift where management is expected to arrive 1 hour early and leave 1 hour late - in order to prepare for the day and then report on the days results to upper managementI have learned a lot working for Amazon, i have developed my leadership skills tremendously. I have gained experience in developing a team, in performance managing hundreds of direct reports. I have gained knowledge in lean methodologies and performed a multitude of process improvement initiatives.You have to be a certain type of person to succeed in this role. It is most definitely not a 9-5 type of job. The hours are long and the expectations are high. The payoff is good when you have the right team and are in a department where you can flourish.Amazon allows its associates to advance and develop their career opportunities through different programs but the amount of work and mandatory overtime required makes it a very hard and exhausting place to work. The balance between personal and work life becomes difficult to manage due to the amount of hours required to work and the compensation and benefits are not worth it.Even though Amazon can be a fun place to work with many incentives, fun activities, holiday celebrations and more, the tasks become repetitive and boring after a few months making it difficult for the associates to stay motivated.I worked at Amazon for a few months, as well as Integrity Staffing. For one, they are very unorganized. They provide very poor training but expect high rates with little errors. I only got trained for 5 hours on my first day and the other half of the shift I worked in the MOD. I got fired for productivity, which was due to poor training. I learned how to  perform my job better while I was on my final write up and getting retrained, however it was too late. I asked managers several times to move me so I wouldn't lose my job but nobody seemed to care. I worked there for 2 months and got fired. Managers were very rude to me as well. One manager told me if I didn't speed it up I was going to get terminated. I really didn't enjoy my time at Amazon, I feel like they didn't give me a chance.Though Amazon is a growing company, upward mobility only exists for those straight out of college or former military. The pay is well below industry standard at all levels. Management is typically inexperienced and unguided. Though there are many different schedules to work, Amazon is quite rigid with transfers of shifts and departments. Mandatory overtime is commonplace and there are more than six weeks of black out annually, in which vacation time is not allowed to be used. The education program is a joke as you are only allowed to pursue a handful of career paths, all of which amazon only assists to an associates degree which is useless in almost every field. The hours are long, tedious and physically demanding. Injuries are commonplace but the onsite medical staff is extremely rude and uncaring so most people hide injuries and seek out their own medical care.10 hours spent on your feet all day and constantly moving across an incredibly large three level warehouse describes a normal day.  Half of my coworkers did not want to be there and their lack of motivation or sense of doing things correctly ultimately made the job far more difficult to accomplish.  Management seems only to care about the numbers, nothing else.  Since speed of work is everything you better hope you don't run into a problem (there were always problems) since resolving it means you need to walk to a specific station and you also need to hope you aren't 5th in line.good benefits but not a job to make a career out of, they treat their workers poorly. The management team needs some improvement and the pay is not worth the hours they are asking for.The co workers don't work together as a team and everybody is for their self.To me its a great job to start out from but not a job to stay for years.The only thing that's good about this job is the benefits one of the main reason why i still currently work their but the money doesn't support my family needs.The hardest part about this job is all the changes they make unannounced.,the relationship with the management teamand the empolyees.I do not enjoy this job so i'm currently searching for further employment.I worked there for 2 years and took the buyout. They have little events and play games sometimes that are fun but...Never have I been anywhere so micro-managed in my life. If you were breathing wrong, they dinged you for it. They set high rate goals and play favorites heavily. I was a favorite of my manager and got a lot of perks. I tried to work hard, but once they terminated that manager, I was sent back to packing from being a Lead. If you can suck up and don't mind a brown nose, you can make it there no problem. If you want a paycheck and that is it, you can do it. If you want to make a career, keep looking unless you have a MBA.Being a quality auditor for Amazon.com was a great job. Although it was sometimes repetitive warehouse work, I was always rewarded with great wages, challenging situations, and most importantly an unlimited opportunity for advancement. I was also inspired by a CEO that has a devotion for community, family, and the less fortunate. A humble man who wants to see the world improve. That simple idea provided me with motivation. This is a perfect example of a self-made man who started with a small garage operation and turned it into a huge success. The company also excels at the most important part of business, phenomenal customer service.I enjoyed  working  there, was fired  due  to not meeting  rate, which I wasn't  informed  of a rate system  being that I never worked  in wherehouse before, they should  inform new hires of the productivity  requirement,  which they don't, so they will know what to expect, they make everything sound  good at orientation, meanwhile  never telling  new hires what is expected  of them in order to keep your jobs, there  more harder on pickers than packers, that company  is not fair to all there employees, a lot of favoritism. They are a very unfair  company  to work for, I couldn't  even appeal my termination, they made a mistake  and I wasn't  employed for 90 full days, so I can't appeal there  decision, totally  unfair, so I could never work for  them again. Wow  what an incentive for being  fired  you guys suck to the fullest.The particular site I worked at was not adequately staffed since day one. This caused a lot of strain on staff with daily tasks, reports and case load. First site I worked for was great, however the last site was severely lacking in all areas. It depends which site you go to as to the individuals success. This company is very metric driven and does not put the needs or care of the customer or associates working for them ahead of the metrics. Their processes need significant improvement internally. Otherwise it was a great experience at my first site, which is how most of the sites should be run.Awesome managers who listen and work hard to resolve any issues you have. Positive work environment and feedback from co-workers all the way down to human resource.Hardest part of my job was adjusting to walking on the cement floors for 10 hours and finding smaller items quickly.Most enjoyable part of the job was the prizes we won for our efforts and meeting my co-workers.I learned how to work hard and feel proud to finish a job to completion and that hard work pays off! I also learned great time management skills and how to be attentive to detail.One of the worst places I ever worked. I hate how they treat their employees like a number, HR is the worst ever!! There is really no structure, rules changes everyday, to many kids. Coworkers are awesome, the managers, ops managers don't have degrees in their positions. Managers have to many favorites. You really have to kiss butt to move anywhere or try to learn new positions. This place is nothing but about NUMBERS....Could be so much better, if only they cared about their employees.I recently quit working with Amazon and had many reasons for leaving. I had a difficult commute which was the primary factor in my departure. During my time there, my leadership team was always vigilant in making things better for our associates and our customers. I have had the opportunity to work with some really great people and the culture and internal advancement opportunity was great. The majority of my managers were really wonderful people that worked hard to support me and help me develop in my career.Amazon is a continuous improvement environment. They stand behind their principles, one of which is dealing with ambiguity. With stock prices soaring, the prospect of receiving compensation in the form of stock, as well as competitive wages in management roles the job seems alluring. All management roles go thru a rotation of departments, times, and days. This is an effort to round out each candidate to help them rise thru the ranks. This can be tough for anyone with smaller children. The fast paced environment can also lead to meteoric rises for some and wastelands of underdevelopment from others. Conference calls are attended by yes men and eager pleasers who aren't willing to push back on the view from the top.Amazon is a difficult place to work. My job was not stable you never new if you were going to have a job then next day. The management was very poor. They would always run out of equipment and you would have to figure out how to do your job with out your tool. Co-workers were very plesant, we would all try to keep a positive attitude and be up beat.Working at Amazon I learned a lot. I have learned how work threw difficult time in a work environment and how to suck it up and work with whom ever you may have to work with. Long hours and hard work is a lot easier with a positive attitude.Everything about this place reminds of prison, from the orange vest they make you wear, to the safety line you have to walk in, to the constantly working on your feet. Your not being paid to think just work. Supervisors always on your back, similar to a Corrections Officer. Your hard work gets unnoticed so don't try and give 110%, try 65% instead. Work is extremely easy but boring. It's hard to get fired, you pretty much fire yourself by constantly being late or not showing up for workAmazon.com fulfillment Center is an okay place to work. They work you like a dog with working long hours for minimal pay. The benefits of physically working there do not outweigh the costs associated with this type of manual labor. Amazon benefits are good for healthcare, time off, and having an annual picnic. The management always is new and don't necessarily know what they are doing, thats why there is a high turnover rate with management and other employees.There is nothing but drama, drama, drama, backstabbing at this place i mean you have a CEO who is the 3rd richest man in the united states and we work for pennies! Ive been employed almost 5 years and just this week got a 75 cent raise so i make 13.75, but new employees starting are making 11.50 to 12.00 and they just started, does anyone see a problem with that? We have a very big turn over especially MANAGEMENT most of the are kids and dont have a clue! AMAZON cares about its customers, but as far as its employees they dont care how much time we are away from our familes, terrible attendance policy, try to limit our time to go on a BATHROOM BREAK! They claim they do so much for us, we work for everything we are entitled to like our stocks we are given but we have to pay the taxes on them, so basically we are paying for them twice we have to work for them then pay the taxes on them. Our HR department is a joke they are not nice and hateful! You ask a ? And you will get 20 different answers, or i dont know i will have to get back to you ( weeks later)You cannot get full time work.  Management seems disorganized. No explanation of what a PA's job actually is so they appear to be doing nothing but staring at computer screens.  Same with management. Staring at computer screens.   High turnover rate.   No promotions, no raises.   Option to become ambassador and take on more responsibility without more pay. Training was a joke.   Weird clapping and chanting at beginning of shift. All about increasing productivity without any rewards.Amazon is an amazing place to work, it's diverse culture, meeting people from all walks of life is just a blessing. Management's open door policy, where everyone is there to support you and make your work easy, fair and achievable goals are set. your opinion no matter how small is heard, makes me feel belonged and important.Priority to safety, amazing healthcare benefits, career choice plan, outstanding maternity/paternity leave, paid personal time off etc.. i could go on and on.","10,000+",Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-11-11T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/research-scientist-ii-amz1564-job-seattle-wa-us-175862710.aspx?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

269,4211.0,System Application Programmer - Analytics,Virginia Mason,4.0,75.0,"Satellites offer a flexible culture. Seattle location is connected to the Virginia Mason Hospital. This requires clinics adhere to hospital standards making it a somewhat oppressive work environment.Most of the drs are behind, but typical for everyday. Front desk is great. MAs are all wonderful and hard working. Management lacks. always switching schedule's, isn't qualified for what they do, unorganized, and all over the place. Doesn't know what a MA does on a day to day bases. more worried about numbers and how they lookthen the MA's that run the clinic. Patients were kind and great full for the hard working MA'sWork days as an operational leader here were hard and long, but most importantly, rewarding.  Learning opportunities were always available, and they have a population of support for each other and the community.Management was poor. Not a organized environment.Expectations and communication poor. I found the Drs to be somewhat pressed for time.Loved working there. The atmosphere was friendly and welcoming. I learned so much about the pancreas working there. Best place for an EGD.I enjoyed getting involved in Toastmasters (covered by the hospital), was a part of the Green Team, and started the Staff Support Networking Group.  I learned a lot about scheduling meetings that involved executives with very busy schedules; learned about various technology (tele video and lite projector).  I always prepared myself for the unexpected which I enjoyed a lot.  My workers were very supportive and I developed many close friends during my time there.  I learned to pay attention to my director's calendars so I could maximize my support for them.I look forward to my day and my work. It is challenging and the MD's I work for are just as nice and I keep a smile on my face. I normally work on complex scheduling in the morning unless there are other mandatory items that need my attention. I prefer to work with people and have fun as well. I look forward to change that is coming with my current job. I also would prefer to work for one department instead of being split up into two.I learn something new everyday as I came from a banking background. The Hospital setting is very educational and I enjoy all my peers and management.I enjoy helping with events and I admire my manager.While going through financial struggles with layoffs,  the managers still get bonuses while working 8 hour days. Excellent doctors leaving the organization or being worked to death along with their nurses and assistants.Japanese business ""masters"" flown-in to observe but nothing improves,.No one cares how far the real workers need to commute, education and experience are not appreciated unless the manager has a crush on you.Our voices not heard, even if it's an issue with patient safety. Very fake  quality place that's out of compliance and never gets inspected.Most enjoyable part of job is working with patients and serving them.  Applying and removing casts.  Getting to know patients and having great conversations with patients.The best company I've ever worked for and I will highly recommend anyone to work for this company. Great benefits and awesome work culture. Excellent company when it comes to team work.During my 19 years at Virginia Mason Medical Center, I enjoyed working there very much. The work was challenging and rewarding, and I made many friends in my department and outside of my department. My job was eliminated due to a reduction in workforce,  brought about when a long-standing alliance with Group Health hospital ended.I am currently still working there, and my final date there will be in February 2016. After that, I will be actively searching for new employment.The most enjoyable park of my work in helping patients, taking care of them, making them happy and see the smile on their faces when they leave me.Individual responsibility for one's own productivity; excellent opportunity for self-direction with limited supervision. Great learning environment at a self-paced level.Hospital and Clinic are just side by side.  Doctors and Nurses have good Personal contacts with patients.  They really take care of you.Level 15 (general surgery) is a new unit that just opened in Feb 2015. This is an amazing floor to work on as the nurse manager, assistant managers, nurses, and PCTs are all extremely friendly, fun, young, outgoing, and great at their jobs! Typical day is 12.5 hours, with 1 15 min break, 1 45 min lunch, and another 15 min break. You learn as much as you want to, as the nurses love to teach you things like show you how to put catheters, IVs, etc. in the patients. As a PCT at VM, you are given much more responsibility than many other hospitals and workplaces. You get to remove catheters, IVs, and other fun and exciting things :)If it was not for the money they hand out for their doctors this company would fold. Poor management. They only listen to their employees when it benefits them.this a great place to work, if you like a challenging work environment.This place is a very fast pace work not time to stop.My work days usually go by pretty quick because we are always so busy.  I usually end up doing anywhere from three to five different jobs throughout the day because I cover other staff lunches.I am happy that I get to meet such a diverse group of people on a daily basis whether that be patients or employees from other departments.I learn a lot from the many different patients that come through the clinic, as well as the employees I work with.  If it had not been for this job I would not know how to interact with so many different cultures and personalities, and that makes everything I do have real meaning,The staff I work with are all very helpful and friendly, and we all treat each other like family.  When we get new staff, we all pitch in to make sure that they are comfortable and welcome, which is wonderful.Our management team is accommodating and is always asking if staff members have suggestions on how to make things flow smoother.  We have rapid improvement workshops where the staff will have the chance to try out any suggested changes to see just how functional they are and if they are better than the old process.The hardest part of the job for me would be loosing so many people I have come to know and care about.  I value each patient that comes into the clinic and that makes it much harder when I find out they have passed on.  I think I mourn their loss as though they were family, which makes my job very tough at times.The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the peace I have with what I do.  Each day I get to help dozens of people in some way  more... or other, and that makes my life have meaning which is what we all are looking for most.  lessVMMC is a wonderful place to work.  They recognize hard work and you get recognized for it.  There are plenty of chances for advancement and that's what I admired most about working for VMMC.A typical day at work would be transporting patients to and from appointments and various other locations through out the hospital. I learned a lot about time management. My corkers were a great team also fun to work with. The hardest part of the job would be getting incorporative patients to their appointment. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with doctors in meeting new patients.Lots of phone work, surgery scheduling. Working with wonderful physicians. Most of my co-workers were good team players. The hardest part was having to be very multi-tasked.  Most enjoyable was caring for patients needs and feeling very fulfilled.","5,001 to 10,000",Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/a18ca3ba-3512-45bc-bd2d-779a75a2bc50?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

System performance and uptime is 99.9.Compensation:Salary is middle to slightly below market value. Health plan is acceptable as a single person and is wonderful for employees with a family (family partial inclusion in plan). Depending on location and type of work, advancement is either slow or nearly impossible. Culture:Relaxed and slow-paced with intermitting rushes. Company tries to modernize in technology and mentality. Minimal sexism, racism, elitism; however, noticeable ageism. Younger (1-10 yrs) sometimes viewed as severely inexperienced or incompetent, more so than justified. Management: Variable depending on position. However, a noticeable aspect about some of the managers is that they put an extensive amount of energy into pleasing upper level management; so much so that their leadership roles take a toll. Lifestyle:40-45 per week is typical in most non-management positions. Most have paid overtime.Best company wage wise.   Management does not know how to manage people. They have taken all incentives away from us. They tell us lies about a union and workers on the floor just don't care anymore.  It's just a job now.  Nothing special.We really need a union, for wages, benefits and our future to take care of our families.  All they care about is the numbers game.They are willing to bring in union buster people for months and pay them and put advertising on radio and tv to stop the union.  Then they throw a big party for the management for a job well done.   They could have given us a raise with the money they spent on the campaign to stop the union.Now management treats us very poorly. They have the edge to fire us if we don't do what they say.  Bad situation for everybody.Wish I never would have taken this job 5yrs ago.Keeping a globally distributed, non-standard infrastructure available with minimal down time takes many hands. Management either rotates or changes every few years which made career success a moving target. Co-workers tend to be close knit, even to the point of being like family, which makes departures very hard on morale. The allure of short term cost for outsourcing critical functions seems to blind managers to the loss of control, quality and reputation of the IT department. Rebuilding the IT department from the ground up may be the only way to keep it from collapsing in upon itself.The most enjoyable part of the job was greeting new people to the team, making them feel welcome and valued; the hardest part was watching them all leave, mostly involuntarily.My days at Boeing are filled from start to end with challenges. I have learned patience, time management, how to work with different types of individuals and how to focus on customer satisfaction. I find myself having such a heavy workload that I have little if no free time for family and personal growth. I enjoy seeing my team grow into a organized and proficient unit. I have had the luxury of meeting many helpful managers, HR, management support, and co-workers, and I have learned so much from them.The quantity of work is dismal. It used to be thriving but has significantly dwindled since the contract has changed hands. The management gives no consideration for it's employees' well being. They hide behind the shroud of a government contract, blaming its literature for the severe lack of fringe benefits. Pays it's employees the absolute bare minimum as mandated by the US Government.  No performance raises, ever.Boeing (IT specifically) is a good place to launch a career, but don't count on advancing even if you are walking on water. Too much bureaucracy in management will stifle your growth. On the flipside, if you are a minimum effort type of employee, Boeing IT is a great place to work. You will be compensated the same as the guy next to you pulling all your weight!I'm salaried, work in an office.I don't want to come in to work. I've been here for 10 years and I think I get treated worse every year. The managers are more interested in doing what their boss tells them then growing their people.If you suck up and find the right ""mentor"" (read executive cheerleader) you'll do great. If you have opinions and share them (I've seen people share them well and people share them poorly; all with the same results) then you are labeled a troublemaker.After 4 years in a role, I went from the minimum pay at 0.75 of market reference to 0.80 of market reference. My job duties are insulting. There are no growth opportunities to speak of.Just nod your head and back away slowlyGreat company with lots of opportunities.  Great benefits.  The most enjoyable part of the job is solving the most complex issues and opportunity to work with the brightest individuals and be part of the aerospace and defense industry that connect and protect the world. Boeing Management CEO and CIO are top notch.  Typical day at work includes working on the most complex issues in Information Technology with a great team!   Challenges are frequent layoffs, and hard to get a promotion at senior levels due to high number of senior team members.I am a young, intelligent, hard-working communication professional. I was at Boeing for almost a year, and I have been thoroughly traumatized by my experience. There are many, many corrupt, unethical, incompetent first-level managers it's astonishing. I was bullied by management and unfairly treated. I developed extreme anxiety and depression as a result. I did not feel safe at Boeing.The company is disgustingly regressive and bureaucratic. It's policies and practices are very outdated and make no sense. Boeing is not evolving. They will not last at this rate.What I have outlined is just the tip of the iceberg as I am not willing to spend any more time, thought or energy into The Boeing Company, other than the all of 5 minutes I spent crafting this review.Executive-level calendaring • Compose correspondence based on subject matter and awareness of executive's business priorities • Appropriately fields calls and requests to determine necessary action • Facilitate business conferences, team meetings and events • Track action items and distributes them based on commitments and deadlines and process travel expense reports.Worked on a 6 month contract as a Project Manager. The work was very interesting and important to making Boeing more competitive. The company and the people working for the company are very talented. My advice to senior leadership: There are too many levels of management in the organizational chart and a culture of ""consensus decision making"" which makes it difficult to implement necessary change.The company provides outstanding benefits, to include tuition assistance, paid training, health care, and a fair salary.  However, the culture of the business leadership is generally unwelcoming to new ideas to cut cost and increase profitability.  The multiple layers of management typically act as a filter, leaving most good ideas from employees on the desk of a mid-level manager somewhere, decaying before it can reach someone capable of funding the idea.Overall Boeing is a good company to work for.  They have recently hired a lot of younger people and let the more experienced employees go.  They have great benefits, opportunity to move around the Company doing different jobs.  They have a great educational benefit.I loved the work.  There was just too much of it.  The jobs are extremely stressful.  There is little work life balance.On a cost-plus USG contract, it was Boeings upper level management advising Project Managers to do construction projects incorrectly and utilize inexperienced and cheaper Project Managers who would process change orders and think this was a good thing, as these same Boeing upper level managers terminated all the older and much more experienced but more expensive Project Managers who would save the government customer time and money on these projects. The individual Project Manager salary, if reduced allowed Boeing to keep the delta.The Boeing company cares about its employees and provides great benefit and healthcare. Also, the salary is wonderful. Boeing culture is deeply strong and long lasting. I would work for this company again, if the opportunity is present itself again.I enjoyed my life when working with such an awesome company.  It came to a stand still when there was no room to advance in my field.  It is almost impossible to change fields unless you know the right people and get the right support from your direct manager.  They have to fight for you to do anything different than what you were hired to do.  And some are not sure what that is when it comes to Staff Analysts.  Yes you can have a manager that doesn't know how to manage you. They do great with the engineers but for administrative personnel they are lost.  So you have to make it your business to not get comfortable and try your best to move around the company so you can learn new skills and have longevity in your skill code or advance to another skill code.For the money that they pay, this is a very easy job to do.  With the training they give you, and the teammates around you, the work is clean, simple, and the workers are generally compensated well for their time.  That being said, there are management issues.  there are some excellent managers there, but they seem to outnumbered by mediocre or outright bad ones.  And the managers are rotated periodically among the teams, so an employee is not stuck with a given manager.  But you never know what manager you will get next.  might be good, might be someone trying to make their name and now they have a whole new team of people they don't know anything about.I was with the Boeing company for over 10 years.  It is a great place to work and grow, but it is hard to advance in certain areas or to even get employed with the company.  But once you are employed you do have access to a great deal of knowledge and training.  The downside about working for Boeing is job security.  Whenever there is a change in management there is almost always a layoff or a tightening of budget, that's just the nature of the beast.Labored, but productive depending on where you were working on the airplane.I learned that the union has a big influence on how things can be ran on the production floor.Management varies depending how long they have been in the position and if they are trying to make a war with the union.Co-workers are ok as long as they aren't pushed too hard by management. Retaliation is a big issue in this environment.No team work. You are left to sink or swim on your own. No help for team mates if you are verbal about the union in any way.Being able to work with my hands and getting some of my team mates to work together to meet requirements.Boeing has given my family a great lifestyle, and of course a great income with benefits. I personally have been evolved in programs starting building new tool for the 757 & 767. Worked 707, 727, & 757 which are not being made now. I work all commercial aircraft in Boeing great line of products. I've also work military project B2, space station, AWACS , one shop I work in built the Lunar dune buggy. Which is still on the moon. During two layoffs I had job such as white river bus driver, & manufactured home warranty repairman. I have other experience such as street maintinence in Tacoma. Auto service work for Tacoma police, & small engine repair.","10,000+",Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-12-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/f0b35830-00e3-400f-bc81-192c7e692ec4?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

The company direction with Satya Nadella at the helm has been very good, and many internal changes are improving the culture and environment over time.  Very competitive, and there are some managers who are better than others (as is true with any employer).  Best if you're willing to work in Redmond, WA as remote opportunities are not nearly as extensive.Microsoft is a great place to work- the pay is good, the benefits are good, too.What is difficult is the opportunity for advancement.  If you have any scarce skills and are placed on a team that knows very little, then you're to fend for yourself with little to no help from management.Old way of working of save your skin and compete with each other is going away but very in a very slow pace. lots of flexibility and some work life balance but you will have lot of pressure and sense of not doing it right even when you are doing it right...changes are constant and that's can worn you out.Dynamic but relaxed team environment.  Always challenging and fun, and populated with some of the best professionals from around the world.A lot of learning, very good work culture. Excellent environment. Enjoyed working on the SharePoint team developing and handling TFS administrator part.Greet customers as they walk in the store while asking if there was something specific or pointing out the different sections of the store.  Interacted with several customers and co workers on a daily basis as well as cleaned, organized and restocked product on the floor.You can change careers multiple times without needing to change companies.  The compensation and benefits are outstanding, and the culture rewards delivery and innovation.I have been with Microsoft for almost 4 years. The company treats their employees (myself included) very well. Schedule flexibility is great, hourly wage is manageable, and the overall energy and support that other employees give out makes the retail environment a lot more manageable.Microsoft has an amazing company culture all the way to it's retail sector. Great room for advancement, lots of talented people and awesome culture and work environment.Microsoft benefits and compensation is one of the best, but unfortunately it has a horrible culture of work politics. Hard work is not appreciated, but ability to make relationship with utmost importance. Basically ignore any emails from peers and people below and only spend time to do bare minimum for your job. Focus your time on your skip level and director/VP level. The more face time you have with them the better your review will be regardless of your work. Annual review system is basically a popularity contest with your higher up with the most say. Microsoft is a large company, I am not sure if it was just the department I was in. I would like to work there again one day but not in the same department to see how other parts of the company is like.troubleshoot calls for customers and help them be able to locate products, customer love when I do the first part of my call. I was very upset when the acct was shut-downDespite a great transformation thus far, the company does not do a good job retaining great employees and has lost quite a bit of great talent this year.Very smart and awesome people.  Teams looked after each other and did what needed to be done for the customer.  Very thankful for my time there and always rooting for them.Microsoft is a great place to develop your professional career for full-time employees. Beyond the impact employees get to make on customers is the impact they make on the community. Perhaps the most unique aspect of the workplace is the emphasis we place on social responsibility and giving back to the community.Microsoft treats their employees with great respect.

325,4267.0,Data Scientist - Entry level,Kforce,3.7,554.0,"They kept me busy with contract work and the pay was pretty good.Great employer and co-workers that create a true team atmosphere. Management not only lead, but helped broaden my experience and develop my pricing analysis skills.Management doesn't care if you fail or succeed they will allow you to continue to fail without any proper training and then blame it all on you. people get fired left and right so your job security it shaky. you won't advance unless you completely suck up, which isn't my style. your coworkers are pretty chill and laid back but its all sales and competitive so watch out for the snakes. in the sales role they tell you to be out of the office and bringing in new business 3/5 days of the week and then complain you weren't in the office at all. commission ladder is completely whack. all this place wants to do is have a million meetings verses letting you actually work.Not the company it once was. Over the last few years Kforce has undergone a lot of change to make the company more profitable but not organically. The company is not able to obtain organic growth so they tweak comp plans, set new rules around splits that benefit the house, and focus to much on taking from instead of investing in. When you start to do things like this, you have issues with keeping talent. Kforce loses a LOT of talent to competitors and larger tech companies because they simply pay better. These tactics to push stock prices up help no one in the long run. Recent restructuring was an attempt to shake things up as the company was not achieving growth and has been quite flat over the last 3 years. It was also an attempted to thin the herd and pay less salaries at middle and upper management. Pockets of the company find success but it's counter balanced by other markets. They are starting to talk about reinvesting back into their company and employees, finally, but it was a shaky promise. Time will tell if they deliver.Kforce is a great place to START your staffing career. You can get great training and some of the local management is outstanding. But this is not where you will stay long term. New upper management across the markets has a ""my way or the highway"" approach. You may have the chance to work with great people, but it will be short lived.I gave Compensation 4 out of 5 starts ONLY because I was on a plan they no longer offered. Their new comp plan would have paid about 15% less. Culture for where I worked locally was great until about the last  more... 3 months of employment with them.  lessI had zero training for the actual job that I was doing. It was your basic boiler room. I would basically build call logs and call people for jobs all day.There is a cliquish environment.  The hours and work expectations are unrealistic.  Very numbers driven.  Not a great place to work if you are looking for a real team environment.A very tough environment. Management was tough to adjust to. Attrition occurred every month. It was tough but I ended up pulling through and found myself successful.Kforce is a good place to work.  The people are very friendly and look out for you.  They are a contracting company though so you will work for another company.The company is big enough that they will give you enough time to ramp up.  The company does not provide enough training if new but they do give you enough time to be able to succeed.My account manager was very good and helped me with the job transition. it was a short contract. this was the end of a data center move and they decided to close down the data center and end the contract.kforce is a staffing agency. great one at that.where they placed me for an assignment was not. the name of the company is Related Management. the manager in that facility is horrible!!! working with hitler every day.Working with banks to collect invoices.  Nice company, friendly co-workers.  Busy work environment. Clean office cubicle work space.  Area was a bit noisy.Management was engaged and cared about how the employee was doing. Management was frequently in contact to ensure everything was up to standards and needs were being met.awesome company, but its a big grind. Get ready to work 55 hours a week.Learned a lot- from my managers, typical day 8am- 630pm... but you always have to answer emails at all hours. LOVE my coworkersThe culture at Kforce was great- our team got along very well, and often went out for drinks together after work.  That being said, some work could be done to improve the commission structure and management.  As someone who had limited experience coming in, I did not find management particularly helpful, and training was limited to online workshops that covered only the bare minimum.  Because of this, it was difficult to develop the skills necessary to climb the commission ladder.Too many managers that micro-manage.  You have 5 different bosses who all have a different objective.  Make sure to produce numbers quickly or you wont be here long/Kforce is a fantastic place to start in recruitment. The headquarters in Tampa, FL is an amazing organization. The environment forces you to work hard, but they are great at injecting breaks with activities where the whole team participates. The training and education is a continuously evolving and ongoing. Internal promotions are constantly happening in the organization which is nice to see firsthand.Kforce is a great environment when you work with the right people. There is potential to make tons of money, but you have to be ready to devote 60 hrs a week.Management is very clueless. Support and training is none existence. Enjoyed most of my co-workers. The work was easy but required better training to complete. correctly. Management on site was nonexistence, did not come in or only for part of the day.I would report to the store that was on schedule . Than I would clock in and go find the manager of the department that I was going to work in. I would let them know that I was there to Help their associate in this department.  This job was taking care of flowers and setting them up for display.  Than making sure all plants were watered. Taking plants down if they needed to be tossed or marked down.I enjoyed my position in this job. Enjoyed the people I worked with.

330,4272.0,Sr. Data Scientist,Expedia,3.9,320.0,"Great hours, very quick and easy to get through the day. They had fun games during break times and provided candy during the shift. Worked with several other college students - worth it!I used to love this job when I started as a Lodging Support Agent. After you've been there for a few months the cracks start showing. Management lacks expertise on everyday work tasks and one is forced to ask other peers for guidance and support. If you are able to reach one of the leadership positions then you'll have a bit more job security. Overall the place was fun to work with, good peers, more bad than good supervisors. Benefits are ok, but as far as receiving good travel benefits, then you're better off looking elsewhere.Over 250 employees lost their jobs to outsource overseas. I wish that would not have happened, I enjoyed coming into work and they were a great company to work for.Little that we knew at the time, they sent several employees from our call center to train call centers Philippines, El Salvadore and other countries. Not even two years later, they closed Flagship call center where Expedia all started in Tacoma, WA.This position has given me the most creative license in coaching and developing employees.  Expedia breeds a culture of working hard, but also being playful at work.  They are not afraid to try a new process, fail, learn and move on.Great place to work.  Great work and life balance and excellent benefits.Management were great and very diverse. They believed in having fun at the same time believed in taking care of business.Enjoyed working at Expedia. Very good work culture. Nice work-life balance. Pleasant working environment.Was able to learn new tools.I'd almost bet there is no better company than Expedia to work for. Their benefits , culture and work life come in second to none. Best company I've ever had the chance to work for. I will be back aboard at the first opportunity. Dream job for sure.Company has several struggles of running the office. The overall atmosphere is highly stressed, and no one talks about in fear of losing his/her job. Micromanagement is extremely high as well. There are good people there. Their benefits are wonderful.I loved working for Expedia, Inc. The workplace environment was as if I was spending the day with my family.  The benefits were great. The training was extensive and on going.Company provided wonderful training for new mortgage professionals as well as seasoned veterans. However the training doesn't provide you with the reality of the hard work you needed to put in.  You would need to provide your own book of business or cold call or network constantly in order to live because you have no salary or any kind of compensation even though you were required to be there between certain hours.I love my job. It is fun to be able to be apart of the guest experience. Management is awesome and so are the benefits. The most enjoyable part is being able to interact and meet new people from all over the world. A typical ay at work is answering the phones, guests questions, and planning their vacation.I did a 10 month contract at Expedia.  It was a great experience.  The team I worked with were fantastic. I respected the management who seemed genuinely interested in the development of their employees.  There were several programs to develop and grow their existing employees skills and career.It has as any other companies many pros and cons.Not bad office. Coffee, tea, clean water, snacks, mac book pro.Colleagues aren't that helpful (especially from different teams). Everybody are scared for their own job.Excellent place of employment. Able to use travel benefits to see the world and also learn many different levels to travellingFace-paced environment with good people to work with. Stand out individuals within the organization. Benefits and perks are great.Expedia is a wonderful company to work for. Great enviroment. Excellent benefits. The harder your work the more money you'll get paid.Pay is great and benefits are good, local HR and managers - not so much.  Other sites have free soda, free snacks, and even free beer IN THE OFFICE on a regular basis.  The Springfield site is very different, people have gotten fired for drinking in Springfield.I have been working in the customer service industry for almost 8 years and I found my experience at Expedia to be disheartening. Training was an absolute joke and the agents that are released to the floor are no where near ready to take calls. As a Tier 3 agent I feel we should have the  knowledge to perform our job duties, especially since we are dealing with  customers who have spent thousands of dollars. The lack of support from supervisors and leads is sad, they could careless if u fail or succeed until one of your actions cost the company money.  Proper training helps build any successful company's foundation and without it you'll find that your costing yourself a lot of money correcting employee mistakes.Expedia is great for work life balance. Its not fast paced like Amazon and people here tend to get into one position and never leave. You wont advance your career here much but if you want a comfortable job its a good place.great place to work as family center person. Balance work and family life. You will be sure to have time to accompany with your value family members. Also you can improve your skill set in this company.I've had a difficult time here at Expedia, which is opposite to my previous Corporate experience. Many of the people are great to work with, the overall culture is fantastic, but pay is low (comparatively) and advancement difficult for me to understand. Mgmt speaks to a ""work-life"" balance, but when I'm called as I'm entering the movie theater at night because they need something within the hour I don't much feel balanced.","5,001 to 10,000",Seattle,Bellevue,WA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/305ba0b1-700d-4acf-8488-cb5fbeb3788a?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=10,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

335,4277.0,"Data Scientist, Internet Services Team",Apple,4.3,2700.0,"As a specialist, your duty is to help customers. Whether that is purchasing Apple merchandise or helping them trouble shoot. I learned more about communicating with customers. How to figure out more than one solution to one problem and to always keep the customers interests ahead of mine. Hardest part of my job was dealing with tasks that I was in no way required to do. Some customers would come in with issues that you had to resolve despite it not being an Apple app problem or software malfunction. But keeping Apple loyalty among customers is very important, so it had to be done. Enjoyable part of my job was helping people. As well as interacting with customers. I was able to learn new tasks and solutions every day. My coworkers were more than willing to lend a hand if needed and were so diverse in their education, backgrounds and fields of expertise that they had so much to offer myself as well the customers.Apple is a great company for bringing people together. We were a team of 300, and for the most part we were all into having big group events and hanging out together after work. Coming to work was a positive experience every day, and you learn a little bit about your job every day. Even at 2 years in the same job position, things change constantly and I am never bored. Pay could be better, and I wish that promotions were more frequent. Apple brings in new people constantly, and sometimes a transfer will come in.I had two internships at Apple, and the support from my manager and co-workers was outstanding. I learned something new each day and was able to have control of my own project and implement my own engineering design decisions to make a great impact. The compensation and benefits were generous, and the job occasionally required longer work hours.Overall, working for the Apple Store is an amazing opportunity. Their entry level pay is higher than most places, and you get plenty of benefits, even if you're part time. You just need to be willing to handle an extremely fast paced environment with a constant flow of customer traffic. Your skills with customer focus, product knowledge, and learning on the fly play a huge part in being a specialist for Apple.Most of the coworkers are friendly and willing to help, but unfortunately, the management uses personal favoritism in order to determine who gets to grow within the company.One of the best places I was able to be myself and strive at what I do best. With the addition of being able to help both co-workers in their training and development in growth and customers with any need.Being a Home Advisor for apple gives you the ability to work in the comfort of your own home office, while being able to work very closley with others within your team and departmentWonderful place to work.  I would have stayed longer but moved.  I became apple certified in a lot of different areas.  I love to be challenged and I'm very good worker.great place to work. However if you are considering advancing in the retail work it's a lot of politics with management.This is a great place to work! The team culture is awesome and great and the benefits are off the chart! The option to work from home and the company advancement are great!I always loved walking into work because I knew I was there to do something that mattered. Apple taught me new ways to look at the relationship between a customer and a product. The ways in which I learned to communicate with people and act as a professional are lessons I will not soon forget. The benefits for working at a company like Apple are hard to find anywhere else. From the Employee Stock purchase program to the ability to access some of the best software on the market for little to no charge, Apple takes care of their employees.Working for Apple was one of my best job experiences. The only downside was that once I was determined to be a ""rock star"" in sales, it was almost impossible for me to move into a different position within the store. I was only able to recieve my technician liscense after having surgery, and not being able to be on the sales floor, which allowed me time to study and pass the test. Even then, I was only allowed behind the genuis bar when they were shorthanded.Advancement is difficult but if you are persistent you can excel. There is a great discount for employee's and it's a super fun place to work! Very friendly staff and the management is extremely receptive to feedback as long as you are. Keep in mind though, you are getting paid to smile.good food at cafe and great co workers that led to a fun work environment.  great monthly beer activities lot of free beer, free beer. and lots of free beerI worked at Apple, Inc. for more than five years, in California, Oregon and Idaho as a Business Expert and Business Mentor.

If there a problem I mark it down on the system to forward it to my manager.Each and every day you will meet amazing customers from all over the world who have one thing in common... The love for Apple. Not only will the customers and the busy atmosphere make your day go buy in a jiffy, but the hundreds of employees you work with day in and day outWorking for Apple is great, they open doors to endless possibilities, have great benefits and perks and are just overall a whole different environment then you are used to.They are always changing the goal you need to meet. but overall it's ok. I loooovvvveeeee my manager but the HR is not as greatApple provides paid training and it is really good training they do not just shove you though and put you out to get eaten alive.

336,4278.0,Principal Data Scientist I,Concur,4.3,84.0,"You work very hard, you report very often to superiors about pipeline and activity, if you exceed quota income is great.  Quarterly driven!!!  Don't miss your number.  If you exceed quota in Q2, Q3 is, ""What have you done for me lately?""Occasionally, managers take senior leadership's no nonsense style and direct approach a little too far downstream.  It can become insensitive with the inexperienced managers trying to prove they belong. Concur is a software company at heart, and what amazingly awesome software they make.  Customers LOVE the software.  Concur is without doubt the industry leader, dominating the competition.  Service delivery and particularly support and implementation can be difficult for them.  Ask Concur customers and you'll get the feedback you're looking for.Concur is a great company that recently became part of SAP. They have maintained their own corporate culture. They do have some really nice benefits like paid maternity leave, generous PTO, work from home, and free sodas at the office. A downside to working at Concur would be the lack of internal training. If you were interested in taking an external training class in Excel or something, they will cover that. However, trying to get information on their own systems (CTE and ConcurGov) can be really difficult. Frequently it seems that each department doesn't know what the other is doing. They have grown really fast, and perhaps they don't have some of the corporate infrastructure in place that one expects from a company of this size.Coworkers are friendly. Provides flexible work from home options.Salary not up to industry average. Career path not clearly defined.Concur has suffered from a mass exodus of Sr leadership combined with exponential growth. Currently there is a lot of confusion internally and externally, stemming from rapid growth.It's very difficult to be positive in a workplace where favoritism is so obvious. Once you become that person you never recover. Management micro manages to make sure their butts are covered.There was never a work life balance & Senior  management does NOT care about you. After I left I was talking with a job recruiter who told me this company has a reputation of "" burn them & churn them""The company mentality is all work!!!! 7 days a week.Yes you will be compensated  very good but you are living only to work.Kiss your family life good buy. It's all a numbers game.My manager is someone who Micro Manages our team daily/hourly.  There is constant change in job responsibilities strictly based on the managers whims.My most enjoyably part of the job is working with the clients.I was apart of the HR department, mainly assisting with the Permanent Residency Recruitment process.  The goal was to prove to the Department of Labor that we were not displacing any U.S. workers for positions held by visa dependent employees.  First, we posted the job on various websites and newspaper ads, candidates would apply, and I would review each application to determine if their qualifications met the requirements.  If so, I would conduct initial phone interviews, and if their qualifications remained strong, I would then schedule a second phone interview with the hiring manager so they could delve deeper into their experience and skills.The work in itself was slightly challenging only because this was a different type of recruitment, and after I had tracked and updated all the necessary information, our legal team had to review everything until they submitted the files to DOL (Department of Labor).  The legal team would thoroughly review the files and if anything was deemed questionable or needed to be revisited I was responsible for going back and making sure everything was 100% perfect.  Overall, I did like the people I worked with, I just felt that management was unprofessional, and were disorganized themselves, which made my ability to do my job a little more challenging.  I was grateful for the experience, but in the end the role just wasn't a good fit for me, or my future goals.The reason Concur has so many loyal customers is because our company culture puts an emphasis on employees, customers, integrity and innovation. Working here means being passionate about what you do and never blaming others.Employee benefits are generous and all levels of management are accessible. Office accommodations are very nice and well maintained. Opportunities for professional growth and promotion are readily available and it's common to find people who have moved from entry-level to much higher positions.Flexible schedules, free beverages and ride share subsidies are other perks that help make working here even more fun.When someone asks me to describe Concur the first thought that comes to mind is “Opportunity”. Opportunity to learn and grow. Opportunity to contribute and be part of a team. Opportunity to be innovative and make a difference in the world. Concur is one of those unique places where you feel as though you have made a key contribution to the bigger plan. They genuinely care about their employees both in career success and personal well-being. Concur prides itself on upholding the core values that the company was built on. Everyone who works here lives and abides by these values which are a key contributor to the unmistakable positive energy and personal success of each individual. I cannot think of a better place to be right now then here at Concur.Concur is a market leader which continues to innovate creating ongoing opportunities to keep learning and bring new solutions to the client base. The company supports work from home and although has high expectations for delivery of results, also encourages healhty work/life balance. Leaders communicates their vision, setting broad objectives and principles and has a deep management team, most with many years of tenure able to execute effectively.I had worked for a Top 500 company for many years, leading multi-year, complex projects. I was looking for something different. I wanted a job where I would look forward to going to work every day. One that offered flexible hours, shorter, less-complex projects and where I could work from home. My dream job!! I became a member of Concur's family one year ago, and I can truly say that I love my job!! They had everything that I wanted, and I was getting paid very well for something that I enjoy doing. The benefits are great and there are so many opportunities for growth and advancement. Concur has a 5-star rating in my book!!I have been with Concur for two years, and have never been happier or more excited about what I do and the people I work with. The leadership is committed to accelerating our innovation and leadership in the Cloud Computing/Social Enterprise space, and continuing to deliver significant value to companies large and small. There is tremendous growth potential for our company, and for every employee here (or soon to be here). If you are committed to realizing your full potential, and contributing to the success of the team, then I would highly recommend you join Concur.Open applications Internet explorerMicrosoft outlookARC (each different account number)Back office dataGDS (sabre, amadeus word span) ExcelAs many of the account have errors. Each error need to be work individually and check  in the GDS (Global Distribution Service) for each passenger travel needsHaving worked for Concur for over a year, I still go to work excited to be a part of something great and innovative. I have not ever worked for a company that not only says that the culture is like family, but also lives that mantra everyday. Everyone understands that they are critical to the success of the company and the leadership team regularly reinforces that with the employees. Additionally the leadership team does not sit off in an ivory tower, inaccessible to everyone. They are out in the office everyday, grabbing conversations with you. Finally, I would say that working at Concur has afforded me many diverse experiences that I can add to my tool belt that I might not have gotten with any other company.outsources, doesn't care about employees, very bad company some friendly smart employees bought out by SAP. A terrible example of a veteran with an honorable discharge is terminated while foreigners working on a visa promoted.The company is growing quickly and there is alot of room to advance. Flexible hours and the ability to work from home fosters a great work/life balance. Excellent company culture and they work hard to maintain the small company feel. Competitive pay and benefits.Concur offers a wealth of opportunity for those who seek to pursue it. With it's growing global presence, Concur provides an individual career trajectory that also facilitates travel to many parts of the globe, EMEA, APA and of course the domestic US.For the motivated and energetic individual, there is no shortage of work and possibilities.The culture at Concur is great, people willing to connect all over the globe, along with some fun monthly moral events mixed in and around the offices.Such a fun and innovative culture and the employees are all great. Has the startup feel while still a fast-growing company.I've worked for several companies, large, small, well established and start-ups. Concur is one of just a few where I feel challenged on a daily basis, my ideas are sought out and new methods are welcomed. Constantly striving to improve and come up with a better solution to new and old problems is just part of the job. No one is bounded by a ""box"" - you determine how much you take on and how you can contribute.Just within the database group, we manage SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL and Mongo. Working closely with development on a daily basis to find and resolve potential problems before they arise. There's never an ""finger pointing"", problems are identified, corrected and we move forward.Concur is overall great company to work for. Offering amazing benefits such at 22 days off PTO to start.

Fun and eventful days at work. Making coffee, practicing the foam art, all in a days work. When we weren't getting orders through the window, cleaning and ensuring the areas were clean, were also a part of the daily duties.I enjoy this job and my team.  Position can be enjoyable, yet stressful. Toughest part of the job is the toll on me physically.i just didn't  like unstable they were with their hours, you would get sent home early so they could cut labor, i liked working in a team. the hardest part was having to be on the floor on your ownThis job is great. I love my coworkers and the management team, although the customers can be very difficult to deal with at times. Overall a great job, however consistently burning your hands on hot coffee is hard to handle.Depending on the shift, my day typically differed vastly. The store had a great workflow established for morning, mid and evening shifts. I was initially filling in positions to help the store since I was new. So I would warm pastries during the morning rush and run the to the front counter or drive through. I'd brew coffees/teas, refill milks, juices, cups, lids, straws etc. I'd open another register to help clear lines during rushes. I'd clean dishes, lobby, the bathrooms, the store. Other days I'd be focused on making drinks on ""the bar"" or I'd be assigned a register.Starbucks is an amazing company to work for. I was hired while in high school and continued to work there through graduating college. They offer amazing benefits and are very flexible with school or other work schedules. There are always opportunities for advancement!It was a very rewarding job with many perks. I experienced a new atmosphere and learned many new skills. I enjoyed the job but the management was terrible and was the reasoning for my resignation.Great place to work at . NIce vibe to it . Free drinks. Free food. Free markout every week. Great benefits. They have a college achievement plan !Customers are amazing and loyal once they know you put them first.  Working in a drive thru store requires multi-tasking at a whole other level if you are a shift or store manager.  Must ensure routines are followed at all times, otherwise good intentions from staff can cause chaos quickly.  Great company and AMAZING benefits if you work for corporate store.  Don't waste your time with license store though, because it doesn't come close in benefits.Have a positive relationship with your co-workersProductive dayBe efficientStay motivatedFollow instructions from management Contribute new ideasStarbucks is a great job and I miss it. You start your day off by prepping the coffee for sales. I learned about how communicating with customers can make the business a better place. there is nothing hard about this job, it is so easy-going & fun. the  co-workers are really fun to be around.A day working at Starbucks is so much fun it's like you never know what to expect when you walk into work, you meet new people everyday the customers are always nice and welcomeStarbucks is great at fitting to your schedule whether it is early days, short shifts, etc. But the real plus is the benefits, health, stocks, free coffee, tuition reimbursement. The pay is good for a part time job but not something that you can live off of comfortably.Lots of customer service with a smile! I learned how to balance many tasks and prioritize between them. It was a very busy job that required full engagement to do the job right. I learned a lot from this job and it helped to have the management that I did. The hardest part of this job was the continuous mind numbing customer service in the early mornings, but the best part was also the continuous customer service. I enjoyed being the smiling connection that helps others jump start their morning and get their day going.I loved working for this company. The atmosphere is always great and the people you work with are just as good. i learned a lot more about customer service working here because it is such an engaging job.Rewarding in every aspect of the job.  Excellent Mission and Values to live by both inside and outside of the job.  Excellent work life balance.Overall Starbucks is a great company. The people here are generally uplifting and the workplace is mostly cheerful.I would recommend working here for sure.Starbucks used to be a great company to work for. But as of late, the standards and expectations are on the rise while we labor is cut and we are meant to do the work of 2-3 people at once. It feels impossible. One of the more frustrating things is the fact that tenured partners' wages have been ""bumped to the new minimum"" so that people that are just hired or just been promoted are all making the same amount of money. A new supervisor that has been promoted is making the same amount as one that has been doing the exact same position for 3 years. Morale is at an all time low all around.This was my first job. I was not trained for very long at all. I was hired during the busiest season and we were short staffed so that put a lot of stress on me.

339,4281.0,Data Scientist - Applied Machine Learning,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory,3.9,40.0,"Depending on your group, you can have very interesting work. But in many parts of the lab, funding is very tough. And a long-term career path (at least in the sections with which I am familiar) is extremely hard - I know many senior staff who have left.Management wants to have its cake and eat it, too.  They treat scientists/engineers like hourly employees, enforcing charging policies not sustainable for any reasonable work/life balance while expecting salaried work.  Definitely a political minefield, as well.  Look at the wrong person with a perceived wrong look, and good luck finding work in that group again.On the other hand, if you know the right people, you can make moves around the lab to do virtually anything you would want, given someone is paying for it.Another problem is that they expect post-graduates to be short term help, not really expecting them to stay on as permanent staff.  This is in direct conflict with promises made at job interview.Perhaps I had a bad experience, but other people have said similar things.The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is very good at producing results, but not very good an retaining researchers. There is a significant turn around because people are hired without a plan to pay them. This would not be a problem if there was a way for those with funding to find employees that fit their needs, but there are not so people with funding will hire new people.The facilities are excellent and there is plenty of opportunity to do some real science. Initially things will be a bit slow because there is nobody who's job it is to train you in the use of the equipment and you are not allowed to use the equipment until you are trained. I recommend turning to people who are in your group. They will be able to help you navigate the minor pittfals there are and avoid internal politics if it should ever become relevant.Overall it is not a terrible place to work, as long as you are realistic about you situation.Innovative operation-EH&S served all Directorates,  Excellent EH&S staff.  Enjoyed providing solutions to EH&S challenges across the organization.I liked this job a lot because I learned in depth proteomics by doing lab work for a Chemical Proteomic Group.

This particular laboratory located in Richland, Washington is one of the largest in the United States employing over 4000 staff.It is not a bad place to work especially if you are passionate about the job.  I was in operations and it is really just about maintaining the status quo.  Typically all you need to do is log in and make sure all the lights are still on and then monitor your inbox for the rest of the day.  Occasionally there are some administrative tasks or projects to work on.  I learned a lot about operations while I was here and the people do try hard and are probably some of the smartest people on the planet.  There are some strong personalities but for the most part people are pleasant.I have worked in worse places but man am I bored.Designed projects from inception to final product and novel circuit designs. Worked with nuclear physicists on unique, cutting edge nuclear detection circuitry.PNNL is a great place whch balances research and industrial development works and provides a lot of flexibility and career potential.My days are spent typically designing PC boards and helping design novel circuitry for radiation detection. I also help scientists with documentation for proposals and papers.I have leaned a LOT about radiation, and how it is detected, from large amounts to very tiny amounts. I also learned how to design circuitry to detect this radiation.Our management tends to be rather ""hands off"" which I consider a good thing.The people I work with have got to be the best part of my job - I only have a BSEET in electronics, and I work with PhD level folks who treat me like an equal - they are some of the nicest people I have EVER worked with or for!Hardest part of my job is everything is charged to a project, and if you don't have a project to charge to, you don't get paid!Best part: Again, the people I work with,If not for management that was ""good old boys"", this would have been an ideal job. It is intellectually alive, fun people, well run, but very old fashioned in its values.I was an independent Contractor for PNNL providing maintenance of US SLD Megaport Initiative in the port of Cortes. I was enjoyable and challenge experience.The SULI internships are great! They allow for students to become familiar with particular technology subjects, meet a variety of experts, network with peers, and learn how to perform experiments.PNNL is a great place for an internship as a student. Getting to work closely with scientists at the national laboratory provides a great opportunity to learn about a variety of technical fields. The quality of staff is great, although projects tend to move slowly.This is undoubtedly the best place I have ever worked! They ""get it"" when it comes to taking care of their employees. They understand safety, family obligations, and having a life outside of work.

345,4287.0,Data Scientist (University Grad),"Electronic Arts, Inc",3.9,257.0,"During my time at Electronic Arts I implemented multiple training programs and agent assistance training. I created and led multiple customer satisfaction improvement projects as well. While Electronic Arts is relatively new it the customer support industry, the lack of room for advancement was a hinderance.Really just not very good.  No room to move up and poor choices on the part of management.  Really more of a glorified babysitter.While I knew I couldn't work there for much longer than the summer because I am a full time student at LSU, it was a great experience working with colleagues to work hard and figure out the bugs in the builds. I learned how to manage my time, where to look for bugs, how to use TestRail and JIRA, tracking in X-Code, and communicating with my team and the developers.Provides good work/life balance. Competitive salary and benefits. Provides employees with multiple concierge services on campus.Great community outreach programs.The app is 4.5 stars in both the iOS App Store and the Google Play Game Store and proves that my coworkers are an amazingly talented group of people who are dedicated, passionate, and good at what they do.EA offers a very flexable work schedule. the work environment is very fun and very diverse. They are also a very laid back company to work for. i love EABig company with so much potential that is realized through large, well organized teams committed to making the best games they can.Prominent franchises are given time to develop with the backing of intelligence that explains where the industry is going.Working for Electronic Arts opened my eyes to the gaming community and I was able to talk to fellow players and help them with their jobs. Getting excited for up coming games and enjoying the atmosphere and fellow employees and team. With training that was provided helped me get my foot in the door, well done!The company moves very fast so you need to be okay with change and lot's of different ;challenges.  The people are amazing to work with and talented. Always fun but intense at the same time.  It's truly a relationship focused company.  I would recommend to anyone looking for a fun challenging environment to work in.Very enjoyable and productive day to day job envirroment, management is very people oriented co workers are very nice as well, they support your PMO deliveries.Not only do they create entertainment for millions of people, they took care of the people who help create games for those millions of people.This is not a job where you go in and play video games all day.  that is not your job!  Your job is to do things over and over again trying different things to try and make the game do something unexpected. If its to cause a crash, a soft lock, or a graphical glitch.Background designs were done daily. Loved the pace and challenge of the production and the people were great.I thought this was an amazing experience. I was given all the props of a great employee and really enjoyed it. Most people love it so this is not uncommon.Definitely a place for computer savvy, or technologically inclined workers. Gamers are treated with great respect and constantly motivated and rewarded.Learned about porting Unity to the unreleased 3DS. Worked on the huge Sims 3 franchise. Unfortunately the studio lost it's way and had to lay off almost the entire company.What once was a fun workplace with advancement opportunities has changed over the years to a rather stale office with little advancement opportunity. Management changes regularly and will often totally reverse old policies without notice. You're paid at a flat rate with no raises no matter how many contracts you return for.I highly enjoyed working for Walgreens. Only issue i had at the job was a bit strict of a manager. Other that than it was great. Only reason i left was for a job that paid more.It is a very nice place to work if you enjoy gaming and gamers. The atmosphere is very inviting. The area is very nice.Typically, I was in-game testing and reporting bugs with the software. Before new policies, I was the one who took notes for the Artworks department's sync meetings and disclosed them to the entire team (immediate area and partners in Canada included) via email. What I loved most was that I felt like I belonged there, like people valued the work I did and effort I gave.It was super cool to work here. You had set, paid, time to play video games. $.25 vending machines. Free games and merch all the time. Generally fun!One of my first jobs out of high school.  Had lots of friends that worked here.  Fun place to work but very high call volume and impatient customers, but I was always able to make them smile & laugh by the end of the call.",,Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-10-29T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/b3b66164-14cf-46dc-ba3e-96f4e76d6647?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=7,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

347,4289.0,Principal Data Scientist,Nordstrom,4.0,4200.0,"Love Working for Nordstrom, I love fashion and customer service, same office politics that hinder progress at any workplace.Great place to work! Nights and weekends are a must and holidays are hard to get time off. Sales goals are high but achievable and has a great environment for customers! I learned how to creat repeat customers, laid back sales techniques, giving five star service and teamwork excercises.Its a great place to work new company just opened new location. management could use work very new. I learned various new things there logistics has more things that i knew. The work staff was great everyone was fun and outgoing.Nordstrom was a wonderful company to work for! The management really cares about growing their associates into leaders if they see you are eager and willing to put in the work. It's a very fast paced work environment so be ready for your feet to hurt at the end of the day.Its very hard to have a set schedule for this type of job(Retail). Great company and great benefits. Hardest part of the job is not having a set schedule. My co-workers were great and overall I love this company.Nordstrom is a great company for EVERYONE. If you're a student looking a for extra money or if you're seeking a career with growth opportunities, Nordstrom has a place and position for you. I am so blessed to be apart of a company that feels like family. They are quick to take care of their employees just as quickly as they take care of their customers. I never feel like I don't have a voice. Also, because they have so many locations including their Rack division, opportunities exist all over the country and now in Canada as well. I've always felt well compensated since day one and the benefits have continued to grow in my almost 4 years with the company. I'm grateful.Everyone is like family and you can count on the staff to be right there with you. Service experience and training was awesome.I am so thankful for the experience I have develop while I have working at Nordstrom.  I have taken and have used alot of what I leaned in all the jobs I have held.  I will always be greatful.Very unorganized, definitely a place to start if you want to move to there corporate side in Seattle. Work is not rewarding and you job security depends on your ability to acquire new rewards members.Definitely a lot of favoritism, kind of like high school, if you suck up you move up not because you are amazing at what you do.  A lot of discrimination based on race.Great college job, minimum wage, competition for commission, nice coworkers, good managers, 20% employee discount, yummy food at the cafe, nice lunch room, good training.I was only a part-time employee and they still set-up a 401k for me. They had a great training program. They went out of their way to work with your schedule.The Nordstrom way is always make your customer feel at ease. Everyone works together to increase sales. Helping people find exactly what they want for that special occasion, and coming back for the nextNordstrom is a great company to work for. The typical work day was between 6am and 3pm. It was a very fast paced environment, you are always going to be on your feet and very busy. The stock support team was almost like family.clock in have fun selling and very competitive environment . fantastic management wants you to be as successful as you can be. great place to start learning retail . many opportunity for growth in company.This is partly due to the particular store I was in and the dreadful environment born due to the worst store manager I've ever experienced in my life. Favourtism, sexism, lack of support and a lack of positive acknowledgement were all prevalent on a day to day basic. Money isn't that great. They think bc they start you more than minimum wage they are better than other companies.I learned a lot in depth on how to give great customer service, they allowed me to express individual ideas when it comes to merchandise. Over all great to learn from in regards to selling and aiding people to have fashion.Large company but runs more like multiple small businesses so work-life balance and environment vary within the company.  My experience has been good. Overall good corporate culture and benefits.Nordstrom is a great corporation because they are committed to promoting talent from within and ensuring career advancement to top performers. Retail commission based sales positions are great for college students who need part time jobs that offer autonomy, flexible schedules, and a competitive and fast paced work environment, and Nordstrom is no exception!A normal day a t Nordstrom's starts with morning meeting, putting out any product from the nights  before truck. servicing the customer is the number one priority at NordstromYou always had the opportunity to grow within the company. Everyone was always very friendly and willing to work together as a team. Management was excellent.","10,000+",Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-10-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/c4dca55b-04bf-44db-83e1-7f29c9d892aa?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=9,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

356,4298.0,Principal Data Scientist I,Concur Technologies,4.3,84.0,"You work very hard, you report very often to superiors about pipeline and activity, if you exceed quota income is great.  Quarterly driven!!!  Don't miss your number.  If you exceed quota in Q2, Q3 is, ""What have you done for me lately?""Occasionally, managers take senior leadership's no nonsense style and direct approach a little too far downstream.  It can become insensitive with the inexperienced managers trying to prove they belong. Concur is a software company at heart, and what amazingly awesome software they make.  Customers LOVE the software.  Concur is without doubt the industry leader, dominating the competition.  Service delivery and particularly support and implementation can be difficult for them.  Ask Concur customers and you'll get the feedback you're looking for.Concur is a great company that recently became part of SAP. They have maintained their own corporate culture. They do have some really nice benefits like paid maternity leave, generous PTO, work from home, and free sodas at the office. A downside to working at Concur would be the lack of internal training. If you were interested in taking an external training class in Excel or something, they will cover that. However, trying to get information on their own systems (CTE and ConcurGov) can be really difficult. Frequently it seems that each department doesn't know what the other is doing. They have grown really fast, and perhaps they don't have some of the corporate infrastructure in place that one expects from a company of this size.Concur has suffered from a mass exodus of Sr leadership combined with exponential growth. Currently there is a lot of confusion internally and externally, stemming from rapid growth.It's very difficult to be positive in a workplace where favoritism is so obvious. Once you become that person you never recover. Management micro manages to make sure their butts are covered.I was apart of the HR department, mainly assisting with the Permanent Residency Recruitment process.  The goal was to prove to the Department of Labor that we were not displacing any U.S. workers for positions held by visa dependent employees.  First, we posted the job on various websites and newspaper ads, candidates would apply, and I would review each application to determine if their qualifications met the requirements.  If so, I would conduct initial phone interviews, and if their qualifications remained strong, I would then schedule a second phone interview with the hiring manager so they could delve deeper into their experience and skills.The work in itself was slightly challenging only because this was a different type of recruitment, and after I had tracked and updated all the necessary information, our legal team had to review everything until they submitted the files to DOL (Department of Labor).  The legal team would thoroughly review the files and if anything was deemed questionable or needed to be revisited I was responsible for going back and making sure everything was 100% perfect.  Overall, I did like the people I worked with, I just felt that management was unprofessional, and were disorganized themselves, which made my ability to do my job a little more challenging.  I was grateful for the experience, but in the end the role just wasn't a good fit for me, or my future goals.Coworkers are friendly. Provides flexible work from home options.Salary not up to industry average. Career path not clearly defined.Such a fun and innovative culture and the employees are all great. Has the startup feel while still a fast-growing company.There was never a work life balance & Senior  management does NOT care about you. After I left I was talking with a job recruiter who told me this company has a reputation of "" burn them & churn them""The company mentality is all work!!!! 7 days a week.Yes you will be compensated  very good but you are living only to work.Kiss your family life good buy. It's all a numbers game.My manager is someone who Micro Manages our team daily/hourly.  There is constant change in job responsibilities strictly based on the managers whims.My most enjoyably part of the job is working with the clients.The reason Concur has so many loyal customers is because our company culture puts an emphasis on employees, customers, integrity and innovation. Working here means being passionate about what you do and never blaming others.Employee benefits are generous and all levels of management are accessible. Office accommodations are very nice and well maintained. Opportunities for professional growth and promotion are readily available and it's common to find people who have moved from entry-level to much higher positions.Flexible schedules, free beverages and ride share subsidies are other perks that help make working here even more fun.Concur is a market leader which continues to innovate creating ongoing opportunities to keep learning and bring new solutions to the client base. The company supports work from home and although has high expectations for delivery of results, also encourages healhty work/life balance. Leaders communicates their vision, setting broad objectives and principles and has a deep management team, most with many years of tenure able to execute effectively.The sale of the company led to concurs entire culture change.  Middle management leave something to be desired.  Work/life balance is Ok.outsources, doesn't care about employees, very bad company some friendly smart employees bought out by SAP. A terrible example of a veteran with an honorable discharge is terminated while foreigners working on a visa promoted.When someone asks me to describe Concur the first thought that comes to mind is “Opportunity”. Opportunity to learn and grow. Opportunity to contribute and be part of a team. Opportunity to be innovative and make a difference in the world. Concur is one of those unique places where you feel as though you have made a key contribution to the bigger plan. They genuinely care about their employees both in career success and personal well-being. Concur prides itself on upholding the core values that the company was built on. Everyone who works here lives and abides by these values which are a key contributor to the unmistakable positive energy and personal success of each individual. I cannot think of a better place to be right now then here at Concur.The company is growing quickly and there is alot of room to advance. Flexible hours and the ability to work from home fosters a great work/life balance. Excellent company culture and they work hard to maintain the small company feel. Competitive pay and benefits.Concur is very focused on technology and I have the opportunity to use some of the latest equipment.In my time with Concur I've had several opportunities for advancement and feel that I am fairly compensated.The nature of my particular position requires periodic after-hours and on-call work, which is the only reason I didn't rate work/life balance as 5 stars, however management is flexible with comp time to help make up for that.Although Concur is over 15 years old and has experienced rapid growth in the past few years, it still has that startup atmosphere in many ways. Due to this rapid growth, there have been some ""growing pains"" such as organizational changes and increased oversight, but this can be expected as any company matures and makes adjustments to run more efficiently and productively. Because I am participating in this growth, I feel like I am really making a contribution to how things are done here.Concur offers a wealth of opportunity for those who seek to pursue it. With it's growing global presence, Concur provides an individual career trajectory that also facilitates travel to many parts of the globe, EMEA, APA and of course the domestic US.For the motivated and energetic individual, there is no shortage of work and possibilities.The culture at Concur is great, people willing to connect all over the globe, along with some fun monthly moral events mixed in and around the offices.I have been with Concur for two years, and have never been happier or more excited about what I do and the people I work with. The leadership is committed to accelerating our innovation and leadership in the Cloud Computing/Social Enterprise space, and continuing to deliver significant value to companies large and small. There is tremendous growth potential for our company, and for every employee here (or soon to be here). If you are committed to realizing your full potential, and contributing to the success of the team, then I would highly recommend you join Concur.I had worked for a Top 500 company for many years, leading multi-year, complex projects. I was looking for something different. I wanted a job where I would look forward to going to work every day. One that offered flexible hours, shorter, less-complex projects and where I could work from home. My dream job!! I became a member of Concur's family one year ago, and I can truly say that I love my job!! They had everything that I wanted, and I was getting paid very well for something that I enjoy doing. The benefits are great and there are so many opportunities for growth and advancement. Concur has a 5-star rating in my book!!you drive the activity to generate revenue in your territory. You must be self-sufficient, a self-learner and driven by competition to succeed.the job consists of connecting with existing clients to sell additional products.  Much of the sales success depends on timing, luck and territory.Having worked for Concur for over a year, I still go to work excited to be a part of something great and innovative. I have not ever worked for a company that not only says that the culture is like family, but also lives that mantra everyday. Everyone understands that they are critical to the success of the company and the leadership team regularly reinforces that with the employees. Additionally the leadership team does not sit off in an ivory tower, inaccessible to everyone. They are out in the office everyday, grabbing conversations with you. Finally, I would say that working at Concur has afforded me many diverse experiences that I can add to my tool belt that I might not have gotten with any other company.","1,001 to 5,000",Seattle,Bellevue,WA,2016-09-30T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/bdb4b801-5c84-40c7-ba6d-761bc7e012df?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

I've learned a lot over the years but the one comment made by my boss that has stood out over the years is: ""communication is all in the delivery"".  The hardest part about the job can be resolving conflicts between differing opinions in each department to accomplish a set goal, but in the end, respect and collaboration will get to the desired results.  And, the most enjoyable part of the job is definitely the people and having a great boss, without these two elements the motivation can be lacking.",,Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-08-09T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/c62660ba-ce00-4f13-bed2-70e7855b654b?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=22,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

468,4410.0,Research Scientist/engineer - Assistant,University of Washington,4.2,337.0,"Overall the University of Washington is a great place to work with awesome benefits. Easy work life balance, one in which you can feel free to pursue your passions!I had the pleasure of working for one of the most respected professors in my department. He had my best interests at heart, and is truly a genuine person. The work was always challenging and interesting, and I have him to thank for a lot of my successes thereafter.The University of Washington has a problem with micromanaging. we would have the manager, front supervisor, back supervisor and lab supervisor under one roof at one time. We were a new clinic at the time so not much to do.Incredible work is done at the University of Washington, in so many different ways. In the health sciences alone, people are looking for cures for cancer and other healthcare issues, trying to solve public health problems, environmental issues, and diseases, It can be an intense place to work, but it can also be a lot of fun. It's people are the best.UW is a great place to work. Great life/work balance, great benefits. nice and beautiful Seattle area.UW has strong scientific records, great place for medicine, EE and CS. However, if you want to learn chemistry or Materials Science, you'd better think other places.Great place to work if you need a foot in the door or if you are close to retiring. I like the flexibility of my position and that I feel comfortable going to my supervisor for questions.Most enjoyable part is learning and overcome the challenges through confidence and positiveness. I liked solving problem there. Environment is very good here.Overall it's great. My only qualm is that I've been talked to about full time for almost a year now and it's never happened. Other than that it has been great.Nice and friendly environment to work in, it was a job that you could work at your own pace. Coworkers are helpful when i need help. It was a job where you mainly work independently, which is great work experience. Hardest part of the job was transporting heavy or large quantity of orders around campus with only a hand truck. Due to construction work I had to take detours on unbalanced terrain making it hard to deliver. Enjoyable part of the was seeing people so happy to receive their orders.Well organized and Team player, 10+ years of custodial experience of hotel, hospital and school maintenance, and following safety regulations and working with teams to achieve institutional efficiency goals. Fast learner, work quick, self motivated.Good communication and some computer skills. I am a dedicated worker with a strong ethic. Excellent and co worker is very friendly. I'm doing my job well and followed the rules and my obligation.Worst work experience in 30 years ... horrible, nasty, mean, hostile boss.  Mgmt unclear on the concept of how to build and keep a functioning team.I really enjoyed my time at UW. I was able to flourish during my time there and really appreciate everyone I had to chance to work with.I am a formal facilities employee who's job it was to put band aids on buildings with failing systems. Management does not have any respect for trades people because most of them do not have a clue about what we do, that should make you understand the condition of the buildings. Last month there was an article in the paper that told about a Billion Dollars worth of deferred maintenance at the UW, I wouldn't be surprised if it is more. I was hired into a job that did not have any licensing requirements yet during my probationary period I was signed up for a certification class. The UW did pay for the class but is too cheap to pay for you to use any extra certificates or to pay for you to keep them so if you are one of the lucky ones who ""gets"" to have a certification the UW wants in the end you will actually be making less than your uncertified fellow employees.University of Washington is renowned for its advancements of research, technology, and innovation. However, what it lacks in is a solid cohort of a support network, particularly in STEM-related areas.University offers an excellent Work/Life balance which is difficult to find in today's work force.  I would recommend the University to anyone looking for a job.Enjoyed working with students and faculty alongwith the curriculum that was provided. Challenging and rewarding at the same time.Poor management that have never done lower level clinic support jobs telling you how to do your lower level clinic support job. If I hear the word data one more time my head might pop. They expect more and more from us as they eliminate positions or just don't fill vacancies. Seems the toxic employees outnumber dedicated ones. I've never seen/heard so much backstabbing and lies from grown people. If you don't participate you're marked as aloof. Pass on this place if you want to go to work and contribute to good patient care unless you'll have your own office and can lock the door or you just want good benes.Great opportunity to learn about different types of things related to my field. Gives key job skills as well as an insight into different areas of industry you could pursue.I'd like to work in a place where I could grow to my fullest potential. A fun, productive workplace. University of Washington really care about me s as well as your advancement in the future. The office has a very good balance of work with great opportunities to learn and to grow.Was great working in Seattle at a premier healthcare facility.  Got to work with several homeless shelters and meet many diverse people.  Management style was easy to work with, benefits needed to be increased along with compensationWork schedules could be better organized. Class assignments were given at the last minute, and changes to class locations was confusing. Management seemed threatened by the experienced consultant staff. This prevented the establishment of a collaborative working relationship.",,Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-12-03T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/674079fa-555b-49f0-91c6-8fdeb78fd1ed?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=25,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The pay is good and the benefits are good as well.They were all amazing. Everyone there was very nice and gave me projects to work on, though sometimes it was a difficult seeking them out. I got to work long-term on a couple projects and short-term on a bunch of others, so I got to see a lot.They were also good with their culture - lots of intern events going on (from social to professional, like employee talks and lab tours), got to see a lot in a short period of time, was noted for my worth and not for my gender/ethnicity/sexuality/etc. Overall a great company to work for.Only downside was that it was a little slow to start. I had a project I was assigned to initially, but that didn't get started up until late in the summer. They were able to assign me to other projects, and my boss was very receptive to this/actively worked to get me on more projects, but it was a little frustrating.Great work environment, with excellent team members. Improved on management skills and interaction with workers. Increased awareness of Quality procedures and practice. Ensuring the workers are performing at a high standard. Working with the Army on Force Protection of the troops.Battelle promotes a healthy culture throughout their staff members. There are programs in place for you to attempt to lower your healthcare premium and a cafeteria with fresh cooked food and snacks. The benefits are much worse than other companies of this size as their primary focus is on income rather than employees.I worked at Battelle for 5 years.  I worked for a great RDML.  I enjoyed working there and doing what I did.  I was appreciated for my support and work.  I was allowed to continue with my volunteer work and also allowed to involve the organization.  I felt job security and the location was wonderful.  I was able to take subway, bus or drive my car.  The hours were flexible.  There really are family oriented and have great holiday parties.  The people are friendly and helpful.  There is also a possibility for advancement.  They will allow you to take classes and improve yourself and education while working.12 hour shifts, no paid lunch even while being required to wear PPE during your lunch. Management seems content in not answering employees questions and berating them for seeking guidance from corporate.I feel very disappointed that tons of American companies are unfriendly to international students. Battelle is one of them.A great company and great people.  Unfortunately, the position ended because Battelle was developing a product at Battelle's expense. The expectation was that another company, ID Quantique, wouldpurchase the product. Unfortunately, ID Quantique did not purchase the product.I worked as a contractor in a government facility and alot of the work enviroment was structured to that so I can not fairly rate the company as a whole.It is a very good place to work at. the only thing not good as a contractor is you do not get any Benefits. Management for the most part are friendly and very nice.job is challenging for various reasons1. lay offs 2. retireesleaving the ppl behind with lil knowledge of job dutiesHowever, it is a place where you learn a lot and grow within the company. Very competitive and passionate ppl work in this place.The overall mission of Battelle is great.  However, because of previous management/investment errors, the Business Services group of the company is in some disarray.Factory style work. Very little upward moving possibilities. Work life was alright and management was very understanding and accept short notice of absence.Great company , very employee oriented.. A non profit company that put all its earnings back into research and employee benifits.It's a very good job. The animals I worked with were the best. You just couldn't help but fall in love with each one of them.I was incredibly lucky to have such great co-workers. Staff are extremely talented, intelligent, have integrity, and are committed to providing quality work.Most enjoyable part of the job i had their was or team was like family.  I learned alot from the people i worked with and got to do alot of cool things.There have been a few organizational changes and scares, but overall this is a good place to work. People are friendly and there's a lot of perks to working here, including the onsite gym and cafeteria which houses guest vendors daily from outside of the restaurant. There seems to be a good opportunity for advancement both lateral and vertically.Flexible environment. Allowed for multiple off-site training sessions. Encouraged continued education.  Quiet environment allowed for Developed a Battelle specific schema based on DocBook using Altova XMLSpy for the vendor to validate documents against.Significant travel made this company more attractive when I was younger than now that I have a family.  Constantly need to keep selling yourself both internally and externally.","10,000+",Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-11-25T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/6bf39410-d9e2-4ea3-8402-6e6e31aacb17?mescoid=1700179001001&jobPosition=34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

512,4454.0,"Scientist I, II- Ingredient Technology (146-221)",Continental Mills,3.8,15.0,"I've done a lot more for a lot less. It could be a very good place to work. The leaders there seem to be afraid to learn from their mistakes and are not very open to suggestions. The job security is great and the pay and benefits are about as good as you can find now.Running production is a very fast pace environment which makes the job great. Must be a person that doesn't mind to be on the move.  While running all the different products means it's not the same day in and day out.  It is something new everyday!!  The best job I ever had!!!I left a good place of employment for Continental Mills. Or rather the promise of something better there. The grass is not always greener. It is a place that beset with the same problems as any factory in this. Morale is not so great. Emphasis on making money at the expense of employees personals lives. Benefits were slightly better. Pay was marginally better but the hoops one had to jump through to improve that were comical. No hope for forward progression to management. I had a hard time adjusting to the by the book approach they stressed and my training was thoroughly frustrating. I dont want to condemn it completely. Some people can thrive there at the expense of integrity and honesty. Alot of you will find the reputation of being a good employer a little bloated ... Its a factory just a different kind of one, with a the failings of any factory.CM is a great place to work, they have excellent benefits and the people for the most part are awesome to work with.  Overtime to get job tasks completed during busy seasons or month end is rarely available. Cubes for work space unless in supervisor or manager positions.Awesome company to work for because of its open door policy,management encouragement on committee participation,training to improve on process skills.Co-workers were always lending a helping hand.Hardest part of the job was working at nightMost enjoyable part of the job was trouble shoot issues and be able to overcome any problems to accomplish goalsA company you can grow with.  Great benefits.  Always growing. Incredible employee relations and always wants the employee to succeed in their career and gives the employee the tools to succeed.the work will tear up your body.  advancement is given to people who kiss butt to the right people.  it doesnt matter if you deserve or are good for the advancement it matters if they like you enough to give it to you.Great company with room to learn and grow. Great employees and management team.This company is the worst. They don't care about their employees at all. The HR department is an absolute joke. Nobody cares about safety or the health of the workers. There might be some departments that are okay, but I never saw them. Just a lot of unhappy workers. No thanks. I'll look for something that actually makes a difference.I'm thankful for the Job but there is not but room for advancementGreat place to work! Good pay with benefits. Some team leads need a pride analysis.The women are horrible! Racists! If the women don't like you....you are gone. They do not like white girls.there are too many women in packaging..... it makes it a horrible place to work.... if you get a job in the warehouse or in processing youll be just find if you are a maleEverybody was friendly and very helpful, enjoyed the experience working with themGreat company. Great group of people.

543,4485.0,Source Control and Stormwater Engineer (Environmental Engineer 5),Washington State,4.1,30.0,"The people are friendly and happy generally. Fun place to be. I work here as a freelance artist because it gives me a new look at business and companies that most do not get to see.I was to inspect the property, secure all entries and determine any damage. After this I was to place bids and repair damage to the home.Helping communities and individuals can be a very satisfying opportunity. Having the public questioning the value of government work is a constant stressor, as is the frequent uncertainty of each budget cycle.  Currently there is a focus on Lean management principles and responsible accountable practices which is a good trend.  People are very knowledgeable on a wide variety of things and there are opportunities to do project work to gain more experiences.Moving product in and out of warehouse, my co-workers were fun people to work with, some days were very fast paced, but at the end of the day I enjoyed it.The job was boring. The old saying that state workers take a 2 hour 1 hour lunch is pretty much true. It is hard to really get anything done due to all the red tape.As a trainer for Washington State I had the opportunity to set my own hours and develop my classes centered around my interests. I met a lot of people that enriched my life and helped me grow personally and professionally.Washington is a go and go state, always improving itself in some way or another.  Life is what you make it but this state helps improve it.It is a privilege to work for the WSDA. The work culture is serious about safety and keeping the department compliant with all safety standards.What a great bunch of people doing really interesting work.  I'm glad I had the opportunity to work there.  I learned a lot and am glad for the opportunity doing this kind of project.At this position I was able to utilize my talent in Sales and Marketing. I worked as a 1099 independent contractor for a major brokerage. I was responsible for developing and maintaining client relationships through marketing and referrals. I had to keep up to date on all the properties in my market and at what price point properties were selling. I used my negotiation skills to benefit my clients during each transaction. It was essential to follow each and every transaction through to final close. I kept up with my data base to grow my business. I enjoyed every aspect of this career.My day to day included making sure my client was happy and hopeful. I monitored overall health and medications and daily activities 24 hours a day at times. I worked alone most of the day and very long hours but at the end of the day it needed to be done and was worth it. The best part about doing this job is knowing my mom is being taken care of by someone i trust and know. Taking care of a cancer patient was the most difficult thing i have done to date but proud of how well i was told i did..Long days, great learning experience with many issues and interesting people. Learned a great deal about passing new and amending existing law...learned to be aware of unintended consequences of both. Built many valued and lasting relationships.I had a lot of fun working with company and the staff that I worked with it was sad to see the store close it was a big experience for meAs a property manager of twelve years in over 6 markets, I am eager to contribute my abilities and experience to a well established and progressive company.  Given my extensive experience in all phases of property management and my eye for financials, I believe I can help a company to achieve its mission and goals as a leader in the property management field.Through my career I have had the opportunity to work in a variety of markets with vastly different demographics.  I have established myself as an aggressive sales agent with a 90% closing rate, an effective manager managing large number of employees, and an expert at compliance and HUD housing projects.Opened and closed store when scheduled. Checked band deposit from previous night. Set up tills, re-counted safe, unlocked doors, turned on lights, Ready to begin day. Pulled bottles forward, faced all merchandise, filled empty spaces, greeted customers, assisted when needed. Supervised other clerks, and gave them duties to complete by the end of their shifts.I enjoy a fun and challenging job where the solution to problems are not always evident, yet the time frame for delivering the project does not change. The environment frequently requires unique approaches to project solutions.Noble mission.  The agency mission statement is ""Serving Those Who Served"", and they serve the veteran population.While working for Long Enterprises, LLC provided me with a myriadof experience from security monitoring through all the layers of running a business and record keeping.  I also wrote many reports onthe status security at many locations and countries.  We did not have a traditional work day and many times worked seven days a week.  I enjoy talking to people at work and always got along very well with co-workers and clients.The most important part of my consulting was meeting new peopleand seeing different parts of the world.I worked from my home and made my work schedule to my needs each week. I also traveled around the state everyday and met a lot of great people.There  were only 4 employes at the store  - you were required to work your shift - only 1 day off at a time with 2 days in a work week. This was my only problem with this position. I enjoyed working with the customers.Thoroughly enjoyed working for the State of WA. I was given an ample amount of autonomy with my daily duties. There is an abundance of opportunities to both educational and job advancement. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and clients. I would love the opportunity to work for the state again.",,Seattle,Bellevue,WA,2016-11-05T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/9bab7adb-9b8e-4767-93d7-a9ff62791952?mescoid=1700173001001&jobPosition=30,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

In true start-up fashion, there's always a fire put out somewhere, but the culture thrives on the set pace. The culture in general is good and is being maintained fairly well for how fast we've grown and are growing. Change does happen, albeit slowly. There's also free food, massages, beer bashes, and GREAT health benefits!I spent a lot of my day cold calling and prospecting, it was a hard job but very rewarding. My team is very supportive and I enjoy my job.Friendly teams and good life-work balance.

577,4519.0,Engineer I (Stormwater Inventory Specialist),King County Sheriff's Office,4.1,7.0,"Overall the King County Sheriff's Office (KCSO) is a good place to work with many benefits and job security. However, working as a 9-1-1 operator the culture was entirely different with more time spent at work than at home. There is no room for advancement once one becomes a dispatcher. Periodically a supervisor job will come up and that is rare and not available to those that just take calls. Management is under a lot of pressure and trickles down to dispatchers and call receivers and adds to an already stressful environment. The Records department is entirely different with a laid back atmosphere in a high paced environment that allows a balance between home and work. All the co-workers in 9-1-1 are A personalities and such many clashes occur. There culture here will not be found anywhere else and is a very negative environment.Coworkers are great.  Working for the Sheriff's office makes you feel like you are part of something meaningful.It is not an easy process to get any internship including lie detector test but I had great co-workers willing to teach me and help me with any issues that I did not know how to handle.We are the first person people in crisis speak to.  Developing rapport and keeping the caller calm is essential to get all of the pertinent information that the officer needs, starting with location.  Once a call is entered it is sent to the radio dispatcher who assigns officers who are available to provide public safety.  We work as individuals yet are one.  This is a very rewarding, yet thankless job.  The public doesn't realize the amount of stress we deal with on a daily basis to ensure that we are providing them with the correct medical, fire, or police response needed.  At the end of the day, the I leave my stresses of my job at the office doors feeling a sense of rewarding accomplishment for my days service.King County is a great place to work but the Sheriff side was not for me or my family. I was switching between to many trainers for the short time that I was with them.Police work has many levels, and working for the King County Sheriff's Office has been the best experience I have ever had.I had great sgts. to work for they were all very supportive in the cases I handled.",,Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-11-30T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/1d3d4f17-b376-4b64-8211-e0eafd76b638?mescoid=1700173001001&jobPosition=30,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

587,4529.0,GIS Analyst – Bothell WA,"Tetra Tech, Inc.",3.5,124.0,"Very enjoyable place to work with opportunity for professional growth. Full service engineering design firm with a variety interesting large and small projects.Tetra tech is an honest and fair company.  They are diverse and believe in equality opportunity employment. From my observation this is a good company to work for.Tetra Tech is a wonderful place to work and it provides numerous opportunities to develop a wide skillset. The work and the atmosphere are both great, the only complaint is that pay, relative to other environmental companies, is low. It also seems like the payscale isn't consistent with experience, education, etc.Great place for advancement, Learned a lot about manufacturing and shipping. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the CEO's predjudice against bigger people.Learned a lot from a lot of great people. Cheery atmosphere, flexible schedule, lots of opportunities to work on different topics.My office relies heavily on government contracts. Not a bad thing but can be at times uncertain for the future.  I do love the people that I work with.While working directly with the DPW, I interacted with the director, the arsenal general manager and all administrative and maintenance personnel.It was a challenging but exciting opportunity to identify various conservation measures to lower operating cost on the post for the U.S. Army.Nothing bad to say about Tetra Tech over 14k employees.Several projects that I was involved in were fun and not bothersome. They are very unique with several business units.Worst company I have ever worked for. I have worked hard jobs and not complained about it and I have done a lot of tough hours but nothing compares to this company and the way the lie cheat and steal hours and work from you. They tell you one thing and do another. Promise you great things and never come through. Steal workers from other companies while they still work for other companies and tell you that there is no work when they give the select few they like 100's of hours a week. I wouldn't take this job if your life depended on it. I was behind on bills due to lack of work and took this job and they enjoyed seeing me struggle. They work very unethical and only look out for themselves.Waited 90 days then was given 2 days work. This company is good to work for if more hours were available sooner. Would definitely travel with them if ever offered.This is a great way getting Documention experiece. As a Task force leader working at the Portable scales I Weighted and documented All Roll off bins, End dumps, Rocket launchers hauling off debri to land Although it is only a tempory job I have enjoyed it. If i want to continue with this company i would have to travel but i have a family i would like to see on a daily basis and unfortuanatly  i could not continue working at tetra tech after this project is over.This was an excellent place to work. The employees were very kind, they were very flexible, and the pay was more than reasonable.I love this job except for the fact that I never know if I am going to have hours or not.  At this point in my life I need consistent work and Tetra Tech is just not providing it.Good place with cafetria and free gym. Global projects are good opportunity to learn from. However, project managers and senior engineers are not organized, they need to communicate more effectively and have junior engineers know their responsibilties.I don't recommend working here if you have a better job opportunity.Working at Tetra Tech was great overall. The people there are nice and professional. Typical workday hours and environment. Opportunities to travel/be outside exist. Great pay. Free lunches weekly.-Various projects to work on and more freedom on the design and input in the projects. Learned about writing techniques and client interaction. -Work with staff with different backgrounds and experience.Engineers need to communicate with each other more to have the same out come to be able to present to client or drafter. some of the dead line were ball park and were never set or communicated to designers so it was a hurry up and get it done most of the time.Employers have flex time, and they have to have their 40 hours in by the end of the week.  The benefits are poor same with vacation/sick time.  You get 23 days a year and 7 of them are paid holidays - New Years, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Christmas.  The job security is poor, and that comes with the job considering you have to win jobs to keep your team busy.  The people working there are great and friendly, which is the upside of working there.  Most of the work is done behind the desk and on the computer.  Great help and assistance if you need it.  Sometimes there is poor communication and certain individuals aren't available when you need them and they didn't let you know that they weren't going to be there.I enjoy working at this company because it's always new things and materials. Everyday is a experience. I have learned so many things about different ways to clean, cute, prepare pipes.Sit at workstation, for ongoing auto-cad work activities, and coordinating work with co-workers. Client projects duration could be one month to one year to complete. The hardest part of the project is, receiving the client requirements.I learned a lot about chain of events in a large company and how procedures effect other departments.I learned how to effectively work with various personalities.There was no typical day at work. Depending on if there was a project ramping up, the work day could be extremely hectic and fast paced.When a project was not in the immediate future, my typical day consisted of processing expense reports and reconciling various company credit cards.","10,000+",Seattle,Bothell,WA,2016-08-27T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/84dee326-335a-4e8d-b993-cf1f3c5809a5?mescoid=1500140001001&jobPosition=6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

610,4552.0,Lead Analytics Engineer - Predictive Analytics,NAVTEQ,3.7,36.0,"Pleasant group of developers to work with.Management was kind and considerate.Leads were eager to teach what they knew.Leads sometimes were open to new ideas. CEO transitioned from founder to lawyer - uh oh!Navteq provides an individual the opportunity to experience and learn in an ever increasing demand for up to date maps pertaining to GPS systems. It affords people the chance to work in a IT driven, multicultural environment. Navteq offers the chance to work within databases, learn brand new software, while maintaining a work friendly environment. The best part of the job, the experience you will learn from working with new technology and the training offered. The pros and cons like many organizations are the people you work with. Navteq has a great number of amazing individuals who make working for this company a pleasure most of the time. The negative benefits being: the lack of advancement and communication with the management teams which is the significant factor one should consider before looking for work with such a company.Healthy working environment, Good compensation compare to market, very helpful peers. Management has no idea of technical ground but helpful. I worked as consultant but received friendly treatment. No complainsThe company became more disorganized and poorly managed as it grew and got sold back and forth. The people I worked with directly were amazing. The job itself was a good job. It was fun and served an important purpose. Without working here I would not have been able to gain valuable experience to help me in my career path.Good corporate culture and work amenities. C Level Management are top notch. Great advancement within but parent company's market share erosion depleted the moraleit is very good company to workAll cutting edge technologies are used here Management is okaygood peopleHardest part of job is production supportmost enjoyable part of the job is every day Work hard and play hard type of culture.  This was the first job out of undergrad and it was a perfect fit for me.  I moved to a field office in Little Rock, Arkansas to work with one other colleague.  Lots of travel opportunities within the state, country, and international as well.Following all new construction across western Illinois and northern Missouri is a task in itself, followed by field data collection to implement quarterly database upgrades. Creating new products in the navigation industry was a challenge, as our company continued to grow and lead in many navigational aspects across the globe. Travel could be long in duration at times, but I remain readily available to complete all company goals and objectives. I value all contributions and relationships from co-workers across the US, Mexico and Europe during the creation of project specific builds.A typical day working at Navteq/Nokia requires extensive communication between internal and external departments involving database closure windows, project management, planning with project managers, field teams, vendors, and Overseas Production Centers (OPC's).

If I've learned anything through my experience within this company. It is the chance to have been given responsibility over managing multiple projects/teams and how to handle ever changing situations. I was fortunate in working with many fine men and women throughout my years at this company. If I have any negative things to say about this company, it is simply to state that those that truly strive to make this company the best in the market, often times are overshadowed, or tasked with too much responsibility and low wages for the work involved.my typical day consist of making route preparations and all travel arrangements for upcoming trips for our dept.

685,4627.0,Lead Research Scientist,PMSI,3.8,51.0,"A typical day at work calling Medicare to check lien assignments. Working a diary everyday. Submitting signed authorizations to the MSPRC and follow up for the Conditional Payment Letters. Work with management with Special Projects as necessary. I learned a lot about how Medicare works and what they will and will not approve. Management was strict and approachable. My co-workers were great and a lot of fun. The hardest part of the job was waiting on the phone with Medicare which could take up to 40 minutes or longer. The most enjoyable part of the job was the variety of lunch vendors who fed us.This job is a good place to work. The management is not very good but other than that it is a good job. They fired me for putting the work truck in a ditch. They would not give me my last paycheckMost days were busy, but enjoyable, because in so many ways I was helping people.  Either on the phone or checking in patients, or checking them out with their next appointment,  Sometimes there were some that  had a need to talk, and i listened with patience, because we all need someone to talk to sometime.  Every now and then some patients would get upset, and we (as well as myuself) would do whatever we could to keep them calm, and try to resolve their issues.  Really enjoyed being to make the patients happy, but it was hard when you were not able to get them in for an appointment when they wanted it, but did the best I could to satisfy them.  A lot of days were a challenge, but yet it was still enjoyable and rewarding.Good company to work for. Learned a lot about medical equipment, vendors, and the flow of the relationship as an DME account manager. A lot of organizational and technological changes during my tenure. Friendly co-workers.Great company to work for. Awesome potential to promote and relocate when merited. Highly recommended for anyone degreed or not.A typical work day would consist of inbound/outbound calls/emails. I learned how to multi-task and how to give excellant customer service. Management and co-workers were pretty decent. The hardest part of the job was not having control of your incoming calls and being able to notate each file accurately in the amount of time given. The most enjoyable part of job was to be able to assist the clients in receiving their meds in a timely matter.I worked at PMSI in several capacities starting in 1997 as a pharmacy tech, and have always been able to grow thru my own merits and efforts.When I resigned from there it was only to maximize my potential professional growth, I still believe in the company, and would be honored to return in the future.This company has very poor management. The management team is never on the same page and the work is very stressful. The pay is very low and the benefits are great at allI constantly follow up on denied claims and I also work patient collections. I post payments and I know how to read explanation of benefitsPMSI can use some improvements in several areas.  The people were not friendly for example when my Aunt & Brother died I didn't get any sympathy from anyone not even a cardHard work , hard on your body but good pay. lots of traveling. You have to be willing to work long hours,The corporate culture was that of a large ant hill.  Many people always running around trying to do what is best and getting in each other's way.  Many chiefs and no cohesiveness.  I worked with some of the best people in the pharmacy benefit management industry.  I know I will never have such an opportunity to work with people that I could not find fault in any one of them, ever again.  I left when I realized that I would not be able to get ahead professionally or financially and when my vacations were all work vacations.Excellent Company with excellent potential.  Enjoyed working with a group of excellent people with a wealth of knowledge.I loved working for this company.  The had great benefits and a great staff.This company could be something great if it didn't keep shooting itself in the foot. Lack of direction from upper management leads to missed deadlines and low morale among the ""worker bees"". Because PMSI is under the ownership of a holding company, we are always under the fear of being sold. It seems most of the effort here goes into ""fattening us up for market"".If you are desperate for a meager paycheck and just need a place to land between jobs, then this may suit you in the short term. I wouldn't recommend making a career here.Spent most days collecting and scanning medical documents from adjusters. I learned to hone my multi-tasking skills at this job. Management was very helpful. I worked with only 3 other people in my market but all were very good at their jobs. The hardest part of the job was finding time for family as you worked almost every day and into the night some nights. The most enjoyable part of my job here was working with the adjusters and forming ""friendships"" and building trust so that they would continue to bring you more work.This is where I first learned all the Do's and Don'ts of customer service. Longest and by far, most rewarding of all my jobs. Learned so much of my skills set from the training I received here.I enjoyed working at PMSI everytime  when someone had a birthday we always had our desk decorated and birthday cake. It was a very fun place to work , we had fun  but  always made  sure that the patient was always satisfied because they were our  customers  . When we satisfied the patients then we new  we did our job right.   The management was the best every .They knew when we was at work that we gave our all to satisfy the customers and they let us know how much they was proud of us. The hardest part of the job was we did get close to the patients and when one would pass away it would upset some of us. Over all it's a great place to work.The best part about the job is the employees that you work with. The patients are great as well. A lot of the same patients are seen and it is nice to see their smiling faces.days are full, there is always something new, supervision is cool. The hardest part of day is the most fun. Everyone works together well. The best part is the pay, it is great.9-11 hour days, fast paced, revenue based end of month crunch...every month.While I have had the opportunity to be mentored by incredibly successful people, I find that in any relationship actions speak louder than words, and from where I sit I'm hearing a lot of words but not seeing a lot of action. It's disappointing as an associate.The most enjoyable part of the job is I am able to bring different idea's to the table to help with efficiency within the departments. The hardest part of the job is maintaining the team spirit throughout the floor with already low morals.",,Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-05-06T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/fa2e176b-91e2-4a2b-ba62-7ba07d8785bf?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=35,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

784,4726.0,Research Scientist - Swedish Neuro Institute Research Labs,Swedish Medical Center,3.9,170.0,"This is not a horrible company to work for. However, the benefits can be better. Also, paid time off can be better as well. All sick, vacation and holiday pay must come out of your own PTO bank.My typical day at work consist of me filing all employees paper work for all of there hospital and I was the only file clerk, the one thing I learned was workers compensation work in the departments. Management for this job was great no micro management I loved my coworkers all was had fun on the job as long as work was done. On this job was when I could not find a file that was need asap. My most enjoyable part was that I did not work on the weekend.Always learning and growing.  Management is typical management, under the gun to get the job done and under budget.  Co-workers vary from nice to mean.  Patients are the most enjoyable part of my job.  Mean co-workers are the hardest part of my job.In the 3 years that I have been with my current organization I have learned so much and have created new, lasting relationships with my team members. I have overcome obstacles, retained 80% of employees, been a go-to person for work and personal issues and gained knowledge from my superiors in management styles.Swedish has completely changed from the company I started with and has only gotten worse since being purchased by Providence Health Systems.  In addition, they have gotten completely top heavy and have promoted people with little or no managerial training.  This has resulted in unfair management practices and a climate of fear with high turnover and no security.  Definitely do not apply for a job as a social worker at Swedish - you will be sorry.Swedish provides all employees the ability for growth and is a wonderful place to learn and gain work experience. If you work hard enough and are willing to take risks you can go very far within the Swedish network.As a part of the Swedish Medical Center staff I felt that I had the opportunity, physical setup, and the support of management to do the best possible practices concerning nursing care for the hospitalized patient. The culture of care encouraged continual growth, respect for patient's individual needs, and distinguished Swedish Medical Center as a community cornerstone. I am grateful to have been a part of that team.If you're looking for employment at a clinic with high turnover (I'm talking FIFTEEN employees in a one year period out of 36 employees not including providers) then this is the place for you!1)  Unqualified management without proper resources.2)  Culture of tattling telling instead of addressing any of your concerns or questions directly with your colleagues. 3)  Frequent ""rounding"" from Swedish HR without follow-up and any resolution. HR is not on your side.  HR is here to save Swedish's hide and they have no desire to help their employees.  4)  Abrupt and inappropriate physicians who are not reprehended for breaking policies, bullying, name calling, and poor patient care.The most enjoyable part of the job is absolutely the patients, but unfortunately that alone is not enough to be satisfied with your job. I strongly urge you to consider other employment options.I have learn somethings but I fell that I am not using all the skills that I have and I would like to make sure I'm suing the skills I have gained, I enjoy my coworker, everyone is pretty nice, but I need more of a job were I am interacting with patient and coworkersI would love to say the people I worked with for so long at Swedish were like a family.  The teamwork was always excellent and it made the demanding/busy work of a clinic smooth and fun as possible.  I tip my hat to those who continue on.  I will miss everyone. I learned how to succeed as a leader being there the longest.  I was the resource for vaccines and inventory and EMR procedures.The hardest part of my job was justifying my position as new management came in.SMC offer's competitive wages, & overall good benefit plan. The biggest drawback of working at SMC is the very high-cost of living in the greater-Seattle area. Housing prices in Seattle go up on a daily basis, this trend doesn't show any signs of ending soon. Seattle is simply growing way too fast, we're second only to Dubai in the number of immobile cranes on building sites.but just enough so you come to work the next day. Little to no room for advancement.We nearly had to strike last year for better benefits.Its a large, healthcare company, with a culture of promoting from within, sometimes things can be slow to get things done, which is often the case in similar organizations.I will give them 5 stars, I work the overnight shift I have a great team I worked with.  The people; I enjoyed the workplace I enjoyed all the staff nurses doctors etc.  My management was nice.  I learned that I liked the administration sides of Healthcare. I would say that the most enjoyable part of the job are the patients.  The hardest part of the job is when we are under staff.Great place to work some, had a great director and some co-workers where great. I think Swedish needs to work on their advancement for those who have the skills and drive to move up form the bottom.A typical Day at work was mostly customer service related (unlocking doors/offices, giving directions)Learned about Lenel & OnGuard Security Systems.The hardest part about the job was when staff or management was second guessing my decisions. It seemed to happen too often.The best part about the job was being able to help people.A typical day was working on a team of 4 to 5 IV nurses covering 600+ inpatient beds as well as outpatient areas. Responsibilities included starting peripheral IV's including ultrasound guided peripheral IV placement. Accessing and de-accessing port-a-caths, daily monitoring of all central lines and central line dressing changes. I learned many skills as part of the Swedish vascular access team including PICC placement, ultrasounds guided peripheral IV placement and intraosseous device placement.Pretty good place to work, we have good team work on our floor but I can't say the same for other floors I have floated to. Staffing can be an issue and then management tries to over fill our floor so each nurse has 6-7 patients.Co-workers were amazing. I enjoyed the patient access department and the overall culture. Work was easy going, the doctors were amazing and fun to work with.1:6 ratios. That not all work environments serve all people. Did not communicate well with staff. If you were not liked by the powers that be they would get the worst assignments disappear from the floor and constantly debase you. Staying at the facility passed my 90 day probation was the hardest part of my job. Finding another job and leaving was the most enjoyable part of my job.I enjoyed working here because of how busy it was day to day, it kept me in shape and occupied. everyone was respectful and hard working. Most days were the same and consistent. It was nice seeing patients with familiar faces who always looked happy. Working here was my favorite job, I only left because I moved out of town.","5,001 to 10,000",Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-12-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/1702a35d-e7c6-4e8e-a07c-4701f1c0280b?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

803,4745.0,Senior Medical Science Liaison (Oncology),Astellas Pharma,3.7,50.0,"Territory sales within a defined area which meant to go where the business was.  Learned effective time management and sales targeting. Management was mediocre and fleeting.  Co-workers for the most part were top notch.  Hardest part of my job was trying to make my territory comparable to the south and east coast.Nice place to work, Friendly people . more work ,good environment to work. and this is the one of the company that i love to work withI like working at Astellas,  The people and management are friendly.  It a relaxed and flexible work environment,  I like how they support all ethnicity and lifestyles.Very nice work environment. A very good work/life balance. Management is done well well. Good Company culture. A very good team.We all know that painful feeling waking up in the morning to get ready for a job that we don't like.  Going to work each morning for Astellas was not that way for me.  This is a wonderful company that provides exceptional compensation and benefits for their employees.  This company truly cares about their employees lives and well being.  The flexibility and vacation time provided is nothing less of exceptional.  I greatly enjoy working for this company.  Astellas has set the bar very high.Good place to start your working life out of college. The pay isnt the best but its solid for a good resume builder. Get in and get out. The staff and people who are in management are great.I learned much about the sales and marketing aspects of product promotion, as well as the technical aspects of the product.  The sales team that I worked with was exceptional.  I enjoyed getting out in the professional community and networking with others in my profession.Solid work place environment. Good opportunity. Supportive colleagues and well intention-ed management. Since my stay with Astellas was short, I had little to complain about.OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was bought by Astellas, so I worked mostly for OSI.  My co-workers were wonderful; very supportive, eager to teach and learn from each other, always striving to improve. In my time there, we had several directors, most of whom were knowledgeable, helpful and approachable. Being in cancer research, management made a real effort to show us how our work was impacting patients by holding talks given by Medical Affairs, Clinical and Marketing. We had great educational benefits; they reimbursed for classes you took related to your career path.Excellent company with great products. Top in industry for benefits and work life balance. Great teammates in all areas of the business. Ability to run your territory as you see fit to move the business.I was hired as Transplant rep and worked here for a year, the company was great , the pay and benefits were excellent. I left the company  as my position was not a good fit for me on a day to day basis based on calling on only 4 accountsI enjoyed my job doing various tasks.  My favoriate was Manageing Translations.  The customers were interestion to work with, I learned daily.I loved the job I was doing and looked forward to going to work. Enjoyed working with management, employees and suppliers.Astellas is a Japanese company. All employees try to be honest and work hard to release new medicines in the world to save as many people who need to be cured. Astellas has been trying to have diversities and they have now.I've worked in other corporate positions but none of them were the right fit for me and balancing all of the things I'm involved in outside of the office. Not only does Astellas offer great benefits, the flex scheduling and work location is essential for work-life balance for my entire team. The professional development opportunities are abundant and make me very excited about my future at Astellas and proud about the change my work does to further our mission and our ability to improve the lives of patients around the world.Great company who had some excellent products.  Worked with others and didn't have to be micro managed.  We had a steroid free product that dermatologsits wanted.Good products and good field sales leadership. Smart people who know what they're doing in the field. In the home office, there are many excellent people who have strong technical sales. There's an over reliance on consultants who bring in fresh ideas and milk millions of dollars off the bottom line. The best technicians rise to the top, as long as they're likable people. This results in poor leadership in the home office. But, nobody really cares about home office leadership because technicians are replaceable and the field sales folks continue to bring in the dollars.Run don't walk.  Hands down the worst management and pharma company in the industry.  Nightmare to work for and no I'm not being bitter or unfair.  It is very unhealthy work situation.It is a great company to work for. I enjoyed my time there. I had a great mentor to shepherd me through the organization. Management was very supportive and co-workers were willing to help when necessary.Astellas Pharma is a fast paced growing company, that offers an  atmosphere that promotes teamwork, and empowers employees to  thrive in their career.I was the maintenance manager for a two/three shift operation.  I would arrive at work before the third shift was over in order to talk with the maintenance techs to find out what had happened during their shift and know current equipment status.  I would then review the Work Order System to assign new work orders and verify status of urgent work orders.  Daily activity was determined by priorities, downed equipment repair was number one priority, then projects and then necessary meetings for production scheduling and other needs.  Since this was a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility we work under clean room conditions.  The nature of maintenance required the maintenance techs to use extra care and caution when performing normal procedures to the equipment.  In addition to maintaining the production and support equipment our team also performed the majority of calibrations for the site, this averaged to about 650 calibrations per month, we never missed making schedule. Upper management was very open to discussion but still demanding schedules were maintained.  Projects were scheduled during site shut downs unless it was a equipment modification that required immediate attention.My management team was primarily consisted of operations managers, I was the only maintenance manager.  We worked well together covering production and project work making equipment and resource schedules that made everyone's schedule as much as possible.The hardest part of the job was keeping the right combination of maintenance tech skill sets distributed to each shift during high work rate  more... schedules without hiring additional techs or working excessive overtime.  We went from a five day two shift production schedule to a twenty-four seven day schedule for approximately six months, this was a challenging time for everyone.I enjoyed seeing the monthly schedules completed early or at least on schedule especially when we had trying situations to overcome in addition to our normal work load.  I also enjoyed seeing a project come to completion weather it was outside contractors or our maintenance techs or a combination of both.  I also enjoyed observing maintenance techs learning new skills and growing their proficiency in all areas of their work assignments.  less",,Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-11-23T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/6c68c052-f9a0-40e0-8a9c-2e07d4163d9e?mescoid=1900254001001&jobPosition=15,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

871,4813.0,GIS Analyst I,City of Renton,4.4,5.0,"Managed daily customer transactions, collecting money for greens fees, driving range, and merchandise. I learned time management, communication skills, handling difficult customers, and learned what it is like to work in the customer service industry. Positive relationship with co-workers, boss, and upper management.Was a great summer job and liked my co-workers.  Learned a lot about customer service and dealing with the public.  Loved working outside everyday.A great place to work, and although it's only summer seasonal, I worked there for 8 seasons. Regular communication with customers and their needs kept me on my toes, but a reliable team helped alleviate the regular stressful burdens that came with a very busy environment. Typically would work either 4 or 8 hours days, perhaps longer, depending upon staffing needs.My mornings with the City begin with meetings and planning. Normally on Monday mornings, I review the weekly schedule with my fellow directors, and assign duties to the recreation staff; the staff will then follow the given directions. For the past seven years, my time with the City of Renton has been quite the learning experience. I have gained experience through growth and management responsibilities. All in all, this job has provided me with a skills set that I can apply in my future career.The positions I held had the caviat of ""opther duites as assigned"". I was in a non-union, management positon so if it took all night... the job still got done. It was a very hectic pace, but I found that I thrived in that environment. I was able to accommodate for anything that was tossed at me and succeeded in each task well beyond hopes or expecttionsof supervisors.",,Seattle,Renton,WA,2016-10-08T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/193a89ce-ae44-48ad-8629-e89bfb7af8e9?mescoid=1500140001001&jobPosition=14,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
