18,3960.0,Data Scientist,Xerox,3.4,7900.0,"Organization that values diversity but can be very slow and bureaucratic when it comes to making decisions. I worked with many good people during my career by continual downsizing has had impact on work environment.They treat you horrible and don't care what you have to say. They never see what good you are doing at your job, only what you're not doing. I couldn't work there anymore.I loved speaking with the various different people every day and the ability to help them. I loved the fast paced environment and co workers.  The hardest part was the mental fatigue of 4, 12 hour days.   LolAssisting customers with their technical support issuesLearning how to utilize the multiple computer screens daily Management team was okMy co workers were all over the place most of the timeHardest part was not being able to give the customer everything they wantThe employers were great created a very comfortable work environment, several incentive programs, and holidays were always fun, very casual, laid back place to work!I worked for Sprint under Xerox. Horrible, horrible horrible. They do not care about employees. Will fire you at the drop of a dime( highest turnover rate). When I resigned( was not fired), 2 months later they were closing the site. Didn't surprise me one bit.A typical work day is good. I learned how to give customers the satisfaction if they are irritated.My co-workers are helpful we all help each other and try too direct each other in the best direction.There really isn't a hard part on my job everything that I do, I try my best to make no mistake. If I make a mistake I learn from it and not dwell on it. Make sure it doesn't happen again.The most enjoyable part is De-escalating the caller on the other line.Xerox is a great place to work there are plenty of opportunities and advancement in the company . Definitely is a great place and has great balance between job and home lifeManagement is mismanaged, high turn overrate. High pace environment. But turn over rate is so high easy chance for advancement. Low pay rates for the amount of work that is asked of you.long hour that did not pay well enough for the amount of pressure that was put on me. the training did no adequately teach me how to perform well.Training is a pressurized joke and not complete.Will be thrown into cold water early stating ""need"" of people on the floor ... it's a ruse they do to everyone.Will not work with your scheduling needs and put pressure on your personal/family life for company purposes.Is willing to risk employee health & safety on the bad winter weather days in order to stay open!!!What enjoyed most was the flexibility in you schedule.  I was afforded the opportunity to work from home 2 days a week (Monday & Friday's, selected by the Director).I worked there for a year and a half very poor management You can ask a supervisor a question and they never know the answer. Stressful and drama environment all upper management talk about each other and complain about eacother to employees about work not getting done. They expect you to never ever  be a minute late ( like we can controle weather, highway crashes etc.) and never miss even if family emergencies.I would go in call center be sure all updates needed were posted and received calls to assist with Humana.  It was a different job culture for me I do not prefer working in call center environment.Let this be your last option/choice for a job. This job will leave you with no life, over worked and under paid. Management dont care about issues that may arrive in you life. You need to be at work when you are suppose to be there no matter what.Overall, Xerox is not a bad place to work. One of the biggest benefits is that you can work from home, saving a great deal of money on commuting, among other things. You also get paid-training, and get to be a part of a team generally filled with interesting individuals from all over the United States. Work is fast-paced, and there is never a dull moment.However, there are some glaring problems that stick out like a sore thumb:- Disconnect with management. From the upper management, down to our supervisors, down to our advisors, there is a terrible disconnect. Misinformation gets strewn around constantly, and at times it seems like our upper management team has no idea what actually goes on or how to fix certain problems (such as attendance).- Poor compensation. Base pay is excellent, starting around $10/hr, and you can qualify for RBC (results-based compensation). However, maintaining any significant level of RBC is nearly impossible, and how it works is not very apparent. Additionally, there are no raises for tenured employees. You could be there for 5 years, and still be making your starting pay.- Lack of opportunities for advancement. If you're looking for a place where you can grow as an individual, this may be the right job for you. But if you're looking for the opportunity to move up into a leadership position, this is not an excellent place to be. Lower performers tend to be promoted before the highest-performing employees, and its possible to have a top performer that's been there for 2 years still stuck in an advisor role while someone who has been  more... there for 3 months advances and moves up.  lessxerox has really good incentives and bonuses but if you have kids i wouldn't recommend it, the schedules are trash, the supervisors are lazy and the policies they have in place are a little to drastic. in training we were told the schedules go by attendance but that was a lie , i was there every day on time and still got a trashy schedule. i hated it there, and the distance i had to drive to get there was absolutely not worth it. if you do not have kids and your young i do suggest you apply because the money is the only thing good about the company, everything else,  i could honestly pass on.Company itself offers decent benefits. Hired us at a certain time as to not offer us holiday pay it was all a strategy they planned to hire tech support reps for the iPhone 7 release.I get to travel to different Xerox clients and work in a variety of industries at the client locations. I have also had permanent on site assignments.Attendance policy needs to be changed. Also needs to give further review to staffing as they are giving people days off for OT but not seeing shortagexerox is a great place to work. i enjoy everything about it from the actual facility itself. its beautiful not a uptight everybody stressed out environment like you would typically see in an corporate setting. even down to the management the supervisors and instructors are phenomenal.","10,000+",Seattle,Redmond,WA,2016-12-01T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/data-scientist-job-redmond-wa-us-176966814.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

784,4726.0,Research Scientist - Swedish Neuro Institute Research Labs,Swedish Medical Center,3.9,170.0,"This is not a horrible company to work for. However, the benefits can be better. Also, paid time off can be better as well. All sick, vacation and holiday pay must come out of your own PTO bank.My typical day at work consist of me filing all employees paper work for all of there hospital and I was the only file clerk, the one thing I learned was workers compensation work in the departments. Management for this job was great no micro management I loved my coworkers all was had fun on the job as long as work was done. On this job was when I could not find a file that was need asap. My most enjoyable part was that I did not work on the weekend.Always learning and growing.  Management is typical management, under the gun to get the job done and under budget.  Co-workers vary from nice to mean.  Patients are the most enjoyable part of my job.  Mean co-workers are the hardest part of my job.In the 3 years that I have been with my current organization I have learned so much and have created new, lasting relationships with my team members. I have overcome obstacles, retained 80% of employees, been a go-to person for work and personal issues and gained knowledge from my superiors in management styles.Swedish has completely changed from the company I started with and has only gotten worse since being purchased by Providence Health Systems.  In addition, they have gotten completely top heavy and have promoted people with little or no managerial training.  This has resulted in unfair management practices and a climate of fear with high turnover and no security.  Definitely do not apply for a job as a social worker at Swedish - you will be sorry.Swedish provides all employees the ability for growth and is a wonderful place to learn and gain work experience. If you work hard enough and are willing to take risks you can go very far within the Swedish network.As a part of the Swedish Medical Center staff I felt that I had the opportunity, physical setup, and the support of management to do the best possible practices concerning nursing care for the hospitalized patient. The culture of care encouraged continual growth, respect for patient's individual needs, and distinguished Swedish Medical Center as a community cornerstone. I am grateful to have been a part of that team.If you're looking for employment at a clinic with high turnover (I'm talking FIFTEEN employees in a one year period out of 36 employees not including providers) then this is the place for you!1)  Unqualified management without proper resources.2)  Culture of tattling telling instead of addressing any of your concerns or questions directly with your colleagues. 3)  Frequent ""rounding"" from Swedish HR without follow-up and any resolution. HR is not on your side.  HR is here to save Swedish's hide and they have no desire to help their employees.  4)  Abrupt and inappropriate physicians who are not reprehended for breaking policies, bullying, name calling, and poor patient care.The most enjoyable part of the job is absolutely the patients, but unfortunately that alone is not enough to be satisfied with your job. I strongly urge you to consider other employment options.I have learn somethings but I fell that I am not using all the skills that I have and I would like to make sure I'm suing the skills I have gained, I enjoy my coworker, everyone is pretty nice, but I need more of a job were I am interacting with patient and coworkersI would love to say the people I worked with for so long at Swedish were like a family.  The teamwork was always excellent and it made the demanding/busy work of a clinic smooth and fun as possible.  I tip my hat to those who continue on.  I will miss everyone. I learned how to succeed as a leader being there the longest.  I was the resource for vaccines and inventory and EMR procedures.The hardest part of my job was justifying my position as new management came in.SMC offer's competitive wages, & overall good benefit plan. The biggest drawback of working at SMC is the very high-cost of living in the greater-Seattle area. Housing prices in Seattle go up on a daily basis, this trend doesn't show any signs of ending soon. Seattle is simply growing way too fast, we're second only to Dubai in the number of immobile cranes on building sites.but just enough so you come to work the next day. Little to no room for advancement.We nearly had to strike last year for better benefits.Its a large, healthcare company, with a culture of promoting from within, sometimes things can be slow to get things done, which is often the case in similar organizations.I will give them 5 stars, I work the overnight shift I have a great team I worked with.  The people; I enjoyed the workplace I enjoyed all the staff nurses doctors etc.  My management was nice.  I learned that I liked the administration sides of Healthcare. I would say that the most enjoyable part of the job are the patients.  The hardest part of the job is when we are under staff.Great place to work some, had a great director and some co-workers where great. I think Swedish needs to work on their advancement for those who have the skills and drive to move up form the bottom.A typical Day at work was mostly customer service related (unlocking doors/offices, giving directions)Learned about Lenel & OnGuard Security Systems.The hardest part about the job was when staff or management was second guessing my decisions. It seemed to happen too often.The best part about the job was being able to help people.A typical day was working on a team of 4 to 5 IV nurses covering 600+ inpatient beds as well as outpatient areas. Responsibilities included starting peripheral IV's including ultrasound guided peripheral IV placement. Accessing and de-accessing port-a-caths, daily monitoring of all central lines and central line dressing changes. I learned many skills as part of the Swedish vascular access team including PICC placement, ultrasounds guided peripheral IV placement and intraosseous device placement.Pretty good place to work, we have good team work on our floor but I can't say the same for other floors I have floated to. Staffing can be an issue and then management tries to over fill our floor so each nurse has 6-7 patients.Co-workers were amazing. I enjoyed the patient access department and the overall culture. Work was easy going, the doctors were amazing and fun to work with.1:6 ratios. That not all work environments serve all people. Did not communicate well with staff. If you were not liked by the powers that be they would get the worst assignments disappear from the floor and constantly debase you. Staying at the facility passed my 90 day probation was the hardest part of my job. Finding another job and leaving was the most enjoyable part of my job.I enjoyed working here because of how busy it was day to day, it kept me in shape and occupied. everyone was respectful and hard working. Most days were the same and consistent. It was nice seeing patients with familiar faces who always looked happy. Working here was my favorite job, I only left because I moved out of town.","5,001 to 10,000",Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-12-01T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/1702a35d-e7c6-4e8e-a07c-4701f1c0280b?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
