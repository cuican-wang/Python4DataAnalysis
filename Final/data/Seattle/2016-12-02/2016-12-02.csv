269,4211.0,System Application Programmer - Analytics,Virginia Mason,4.0,75.0,"Satellites offer a flexible culture. Seattle location is connected to the Virginia Mason Hospital. This requires clinics adhere to hospital standards making it a somewhat oppressive work environment.Most of the drs are behind, but typical for everyday. Front desk is great. MAs are all wonderful and hard working. Management lacks. always switching schedule's, isn't qualified for what they do, unorganized, and all over the place. Doesn't know what a MA does on a day to day bases. more worried about numbers and how they lookthen the MA's that run the clinic. Patients were kind and great full for the hard working MA'sWork days as an operational leader here were hard and long, but most importantly, rewarding.  Learning opportunities were always available, and they have a population of support for each other and the community.Management was poor. Not a organized environment.Expectations and communication poor. I found the Drs to be somewhat pressed for time.Loved working there. The atmosphere was friendly and welcoming. I learned so much about the pancreas working there. Best place for an EGD.I enjoyed getting involved in Toastmasters (covered by the hospital), was a part of the Green Team, and started the Staff Support Networking Group.  I learned a lot about scheduling meetings that involved executives with very busy schedules; learned about various technology (tele video and lite projector).  I always prepared myself for the unexpected which I enjoyed a lot.  My workers were very supportive and I developed many close friends during my time there.  I learned to pay attention to my director's calendars so I could maximize my support for them.I look forward to my day and my work. It is challenging and the MD's I work for are just as nice and I keep a smile on my face. I normally work on complex scheduling in the morning unless there are other mandatory items that need my attention. I prefer to work with people and have fun as well. I look forward to change that is coming with my current job. I also would prefer to work for one department instead of being split up into two.I learn something new everyday as I came from a banking background. The Hospital setting is very educational and I enjoy all my peers and management.I enjoy helping with events and I admire my manager.While going through financial struggles with layoffs,  the managers still get bonuses while working 8 hour days. Excellent doctors leaving the organization or being worked to death along with their nurses and assistants.Japanese business ""masters"" flown-in to observe but nothing improves,.No one cares how far the real workers need to commute, education and experience are not appreciated unless the manager has a crush on you.Our voices not heard, even if it's an issue with patient safety. Very fake  quality place that's out of compliance and never gets inspected.Most enjoyable part of job is working with patients and serving them.  Applying and removing casts.  Getting to know patients and having great conversations with patients.The best company I've ever worked for and I will highly recommend anyone to work for this company. Great benefits and awesome work culture. Excellent company when it comes to team work.During my 19 years at Virginia Mason Medical Center, I enjoyed working there very much. The work was challenging and rewarding, and I made many friends in my department and outside of my department. My job was eliminated due to a reduction in workforce,  brought about when a long-standing alliance with Group Health hospital ended.I am currently still working there, and my final date there will be in February 2016. After that, I will be actively searching for new employment.The most enjoyable park of my work in helping patients, taking care of them, making them happy and see the smile on their faces when they leave me.Individual responsibility for one's own productivity; excellent opportunity for self-direction with limited supervision. Great learning environment at a self-paced level.Hospital and Clinic are just side by side.  Doctors and Nurses have good Personal contacts with patients.  They really take care of you.Level 15 (general surgery) is a new unit that just opened in Feb 2015. This is an amazing floor to work on as the nurse manager, assistant managers, nurses, and PCTs are all extremely friendly, fun, young, outgoing, and great at their jobs! Typical day is 12.5 hours, with 1 15 min break, 1 45 min lunch, and another 15 min break. You learn as much as you want to, as the nurses love to teach you things like show you how to put catheters, IVs, etc. in the patients. As a PCT at VM, you are given much more responsibility than many other hospitals and workplaces. You get to remove catheters, IVs, and other fun and exciting things :)If it was not for the money they hand out for their doctors this company would fold. Poor management. They only listen to their employees when it benefits them.this a great place to work, if you like a challenging work environment.This place is a very fast pace work not time to stop.My work days usually go by pretty quick because we are always so busy.  I usually end up doing anywhere from three to five different jobs throughout the day because I cover other staff lunches.I am happy that I get to meet such a diverse group of people on a daily basis whether that be patients or employees from other departments.I learn a lot from the many different patients that come through the clinic, as well as the employees I work with.  If it had not been for this job I would not know how to interact with so many different cultures and personalities, and that makes everything I do have real meaning,The staff I work with are all very helpful and friendly, and we all treat each other like family.  When we get new staff, we all pitch in to make sure that they are comfortable and welcome, which is wonderful.Our management team is accommodating and is always asking if staff members have suggestions on how to make things flow smoother.  We have rapid improvement workshops where the staff will have the chance to try out any suggested changes to see just how functional they are and if they are better than the old process.The hardest part of the job for me would be loosing so many people I have come to know and care about.  I value each patient that comes into the clinic and that makes it much harder when I find out they have passed on.  I think I mourn their loss as though they were family, which makes my job very tough at times.The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the peace I have with what I do.  Each day I get to help dozens of people in some way  more... or other, and that makes my life have meaning which is what we all are looking for most.  lessVMMC is a wonderful place to work.  They recognize hard work and you get recognized for it.  There are plenty of chances for advancement and that's what I admired most about working for VMMC.A typical day at work would be transporting patients to and from appointments and various other locations through out the hospital. I learned a lot about time management. My corkers were a great team also fun to work with. The hardest part of the job would be getting incorporative patients to their appointment. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with doctors in meeting new patients.Lots of phone work, surgery scheduling. Working with wonderful physicians. Most of my co-workers were good team players. The hardest part was having to be very multi-tasked.  Most enjoyable was caring for patients needs and feeling very fulfilled.","5,001 to 10,000",Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-12-02T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/a18ca3ba-3512-45bc-bd2d-779a75a2bc50?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The leaders there seem to be afraid to learn from their mistakes and are not very open to suggestions. The job security is great and the pay and benefits are about as good as you can find now.Running production is a very fast pace environment which makes the job great. Must be a person that doesn't mind to be on the move.  While running all the different products means it's not the same day in and day out.  It is something new everyday!!  The best job I ever had!!!I left a good place of employment for Continental Mills. Or rather the promise of something better there. The grass is not always greener. It is a place that beset with the same problems as any factory in this. Morale is not so great. Emphasis on making money at the expense of employees personals lives. Benefits were slightly better. Pay was marginally better but the hoops one had to jump through to improve that were comical. No hope for forward progression to management. I had a hard time adjusting to the by the book approach they stressed and my training was thoroughly frustrating. I dont want to condemn it completely. Some people can thrive there at the expense of integrity and honesty. Alot of you will find the reputation of being a good employer a little bloated ... Its a factory just a different kind of one, with a the failings of any factory.CM is a great place to work, they have excellent benefits and the people for the most part are awesome to work with.  Overtime to get job tasks completed during busy seasons or month end is rarely available. Cubes for work space unless in supervisor or manager positions.Awesome company to work for because of its open door policy,management encouragement on committee participation,training to improve on process skills.Co-workers were always lending a helping hand.Hardest part of the job was working at nightMost enjoyable part of the job was trouble shoot issues and be able to overcome any problems to accomplish goalsA company you can grow with.  Great benefits.  Always growing. Incredible employee relations and always wants the employee to succeed in their career and gives the employee the tools to succeed.the work will tear up your body.  advancement is given to people who kiss butt to the right people.  it doesnt matter if you deserve or are good for the advancement it matters if they like you enough to give it to you.Great company with room to learn and grow. Great employees and management team.This company is the worst. They don't care about their employees at all. The HR department is an absolute joke. Nobody cares about safety or the health of the workers. There might be some departments that are okay, but I never saw them. Just a lot of unhappy workers. No thanks. I'll look for something that actually makes a difference.I'm thankful for the Job but there is not but room for advancementGreat place to work! Good pay with benefits. Some team leads need a pride analysis.The women are horrible! Racists! If the women don't like you....you are gone. They do not like white girls.there are too many women in packaging..... it makes it a horrible place to work.... if you get a job in the warehouse or in processing youll be just find if you are a maleEverybody was friendly and very helpful, enjoyed the experience working with themGreat company.
