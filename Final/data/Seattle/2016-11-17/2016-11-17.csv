Go to lunch repeat. Do site visits to inspect project progress and that it meets design specificationsBest experience in Real Estate field, opportunity to learn and advance in a career to become a licensed RE Agent to work in parallel with the FDOT and Turnpike as a consultant.HDR was a great place to work. My Boss at th time was a wonderful women and the HR department was the best. I loved the fact that the engineers treated me like I was family. The location was wonderful and I really enjoyed working with this company for almost 8 years.HDR had one of the easiest environments to work in that I have ever experienced. The people are wonderful, the management let's you figure things out on your own but is always there to answer your questions, and they make an effort to allow you to work on tasks and get involved with the company when you express certain desires to do so.Wonderful company in every aspect. Highly recommended.Lots of large complex projects with many challenges daily.  learned many things about working in large national teams.HDR is a great place to work at.  Lots of projects and oppurtunities.  Large room for growth and advancement to management.This was a type of contract job.  I learned contract jobs have you feeling a bit used and unappreciated. My direct Supervisor is nice and my coworker is great.Im needing to find a job as soon as possible. Hdr was not a great job for me due to the lack of help and communication from the supervisor there is no set job at HDRI love coming to work and do what I do everyday. Learning new things, Helping people with anything the need. There is good and bad days but always make the best out of it no matter what. There is always a solution to everything.The job was very interesting and provided excellent mentoring for a young engineer right out of college.  Commercial buildings and industrial plant experience combined.In the short time I have worked with HDR as I have been on contract with them I have come to respect their work and their management. Compensation is fair, and working expectations are reasonable. It is a large company and seems to have great opportunity to work worldwide.HDR has a strong benefits package including a well performing ESOP. Leadership is honest and hardworking and doesn't take cutting people lightly just to make a few extra bucks. HDR is a nice sizde firm to work for with all the resources of a large company but the feel of a small one.A typical day would include processing all AR/AP entries in QuickBooks.  Handling payroll for a small staff of 5 employees.  Responsible for finalizing and submitting quotations to potential customers both in the industrial and municipal markets.   Manage inventory of spare parts and arrange for shipment of equipment to locations nationwide.The management and people in general at HDR are fantastic. Become a part of an employee-owned corporation with a great future.Excellent communication between employer and employeeBenefits to die for Assignments discussed with employees for acceptanceRemuneration based on experienceHDR Houston is a great place to work. Well managed and productive office. It's just too bad it's in Houston, Texas. Friendly co-workers, family atmosphere, lots of office functions to make for a real team feel. I have done work for several states because HDR is one of the best at work sharing between offices.This can be a great company to work for in the right situation. I was an employee for the Chicago office for 6 years remotely. I worked out of an office in Springfield, approximately 4 hours south if Chicago.I was laid off due to reduction in work in the area. I firmly believe the Department Heads there did everything they could to not let me go, but ultimately were forced to by the corporate office.I was asked to rejoin the office in 2014 as a remote employee working out of my home. I was glad to do this as HDR has always been very good to me and to work for and with.Strong culture of excellence while rebuilding interstate roads and bridges. Accelerated pace of construction which inspired ingenuity and problem solving while offering much experience in a compressed amount of time.This is a very fast-paced company with major responsibilities.  The crew is among the hardest working people that I've had the pleasure of working with.HDR offers excellent benefits and I loved the culture. I worked in the Claremont branch and was laid off after 3.5 years of employment.  Since I have been unemployed from the company many employees have been laid off or have left due to poor management specifically the department manager.The employee benefits and PTO are excellent. Management could have been more in touch with employees. Communication from management was lacking. I worked with many good and hard working people.","5,001 to 10,000",Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-11-17T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/sr-marine-scientist-acoustician-job-seattle-wa-us-176282388.aspx?mescoid=1900265001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

335,4277.0,"Data Scientist, Internet Services Team",Apple,4.3,2700.0,"As a specialist, your duty is to help customers. Whether that is purchasing Apple merchandise or helping them trouble shoot. I learned more about communicating with customers. How to figure out more than one solution to one problem and to always keep the customers interests ahead of mine. Hardest part of my job was dealing with tasks that I was in no way required to do. Some customers would come in with issues that you had to resolve despite it not being an Apple app problem or software malfunction. But keeping Apple loyalty among customers is very important, so it had to be done. Enjoyable part of my job was helping people. As well as interacting with customers. I was able to learn new tasks and solutions every day. My coworkers were more than willing to lend a hand if needed and were so diverse in their education, backgrounds and fields of expertise that they had so much to offer myself as well the customers.Apple is a great company for bringing people together. We were a team of 300, and for the most part we were all into having big group events and hanging out together after work. Coming to work was a positive experience every day, and you learn a little bit about your job every day. Even at 2 years in the same job position, things change constantly and I am never bored. Pay could be better, and I wish that promotions were more frequent. Apple brings in new people constantly, and sometimes a transfer will come in.I had two internships at Apple, and the support from my manager and co-workers was outstanding. I learned something new each day and was able to have control of my own project and implement my own engineering design decisions to make a great impact. The compensation and benefits were generous, and the job occasionally required longer work hours.Overall, working for the Apple Store is an amazing opportunity. Their entry level pay is higher than most places, and you get plenty of benefits, even if you're part time. You just need to be willing to handle an extremely fast paced environment with a constant flow of customer traffic. Your skills with customer focus, product knowledge, and learning on the fly play a huge part in being a specialist for Apple.Most of the coworkers are friendly and willing to help, but unfortunately, the management uses personal favoritism in order to determine who gets to grow within the company.One of the best places I was able to be myself and strive at what I do best. With the addition of being able to help both co-workers in their training and development in growth and customers with any need.Being a Home Advisor for apple gives you the ability to work in the comfort of your own home office, while being able to work very closley with others within your team and departmentWonderful place to work.  I would have stayed longer but moved.  I became apple certified in a lot of different areas.  I love to be challenged and I'm very good worker.great place to work. However if you are considering advancing in the retail work it's a lot of politics with management.This is a great place to work! The team culture is awesome and great and the benefits are off the chart! The option to work from home and the company advancement are great!I always loved walking into work because I knew I was there to do something that mattered. Apple taught me new ways to look at the relationship between a customer and a product. The ways in which I learned to communicate with people and act as a professional are lessons I will not soon forget. The benefits for working at a company like Apple are hard to find anywhere else. From the Employee Stock purchase program to the ability to access some of the best software on the market for little to no charge, Apple takes care of their employees.Working for Apple was one of my best job experiences. The only downside was that once I was determined to be a ""rock star"" in sales, it was almost impossible for me to move into a different position within the store. I was only able to recieve my technician liscense after having surgery, and not being able to be on the sales floor, which allowed me time to study and pass the test. Even then, I was only allowed behind the genuis bar when they were shorthanded.Advancement is difficult but if you are persistent you can excel. There is a great discount for employee's and it's a super fun place to work! Very friendly staff and the management is extremely receptive to feedback as long as you are. Keep in mind though, you are getting paid to smile.good food at cafe and great co workers that led to a fun work environment.  great monthly beer activities lot of free beer, free beer. and lots of free beerI worked at Apple, Inc. for more than five years, in California, Oregon and Idaho as a Business Expert and Business Mentor. Business development, sales and employee trainings were my areas of responsibility. I built new and strengthened existing client relationships, strategized and implemented complete technology business solutions, coached and managed internal team members on all business processes, conducted client meetingsand instructed market-wide, internal business trainings.Good Job Work/Life BalanceGood Compensation/BenefitsGood Job Security/AdvancementGood ManagementGood Job CultureOverall Good experience at Apple.I have learn a lot from Apple Inc. I was assign to more job than i was suppose to. I deal with phone calls and order materials just like being a receptionist. In Apple Inc. I work with a huge team members that everyday I have to check everyone's work make sure is neat and tidy before they get send out. If there a problem I mark it down on the system to forward it to my manager.Each and every day you will meet amazing customers from all over the world who have one thing in common... The love for Apple. Not only will the customers and the busy atmosphere make your day go buy in a jiffy, but the hundreds of employees you work with day in and day outWorking for Apple is great, they open doors to endless possibilities, have great benefits and perks and are just overall a whole different environment then you are used to.They are always changing the goal you need to meet. but overall it's ok. I loooovvvveeeee my manager but the HR is not as greatApple provides paid training and it is really good training they do not just shove you though and put you out to get eaten alive. They make sure you know everything and have the tools to succeed and advance with in apple.Apple is an amazing company to work for. The experience and knowledge you gain is once in a life time. It's fast passed and ever changing. The ability to succeed within the company is unlimited.","10,000+",Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-11-17T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/88818069-2b0c-4c65-a9f6-42bf3b568757?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
