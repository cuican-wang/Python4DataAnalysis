6,3948.0,Data Scientist - Metals & Mining,McKinsey & Company,4.3,173.0,"*Smart, hard-working people everywhere you look*Management invests in helping individuals develop professionally*Collaborative, supportive environment (if occasionally stressful)*Fantastic topics that matterI have enjoyed working for this company and have gained a lot of experience in accounting, finance, HR, and office management. However, the opportunity to expand and grow in the finance field is rather limited and doesn't fully align with my ultimate career goals.They really try to build you up and make you succeed in your time there, helping with advancement.They keep the kitchen fully stocked and have regular reviews to ensure the entire team understands where the projects stand and how to improve/lessons learned.Fun environment where employees become a close knit community and become life long friends.  Employees are highly intelligent and have rock solid values.  The benefits are incredible, and work/life balance is a priority.  The only drawback is that there isn't any growth opportunity for the support staff.  As a non-hierarchical company, employees are all equal, so promotions do not exist.  Unfortunately, the job responsibilities never change, which can eventually create boredom in this position even though the position is very fast paced with a heavy workload.Many e-mails.  Travel arrangements. Meeting scheduling.Learned to be extra pro-active.Management of support staff is fair.Great peers - always ready to help each other.Hardest part of job is constant change of schedules.Enjoyable part of job is figuring out complex travel arrangements and offering solutions.Pros: fast learning curve; working with smart people; exposure to a variety of different topics/industries;good training programs and exit optionsCons: poor life balanceI need to put 150 characters here. It was a good experience and I learned a lot when working here. The culture and atmosphere simply fostered excellence.Large variety of challenging clients & situations across the globe and incredible people to work with.  Plenty of opportunity and ability to forge your own path.Exceptional workplace where you get to work with some really smart people. You get to do interesting work in a fast paced environment.  Limited advancement opportunities and professional development.A place where you can explore you area of interest. Good people. Daily you will learn new things . You can travel all around the Globe on various engagements.This company has many good qualities preferred skills and knowledge can be implemented in future job replacements to better advance your professional needs.Come in early and enter day in a very easy going environment. It was a lot of tedious work but it flew by and it was a great learning experienceSet up equipment for consultants. The processes of internal technology. Co-workers were self centered. Working around the strict budget placed on IT.There were about 100 + team in McKinsey and 1000 + employees.A regular day would be motoring the work done by my teams. Review the invoice dispatchment on various vendors has been done with the credit cycle.Checking reports (MIS)Checking my scheduler for meetings lined up for the day with differnt teams to understand their Event requirement.Meeting Vendors (Hotel Relationship manager for event details)Doing hotel visits to confirm loactionEmails/ paperwork.Most management that work under Procurement- GPG- do not have experience in procurement. They are only there because they know someone higher up. It's a great company if you work on the consulting side and starting at the bottom will not get you there. They only hire consultants from top 10% in ivy league schools. If you work as an assistant in procurement, be careful who your managers are. Some will belittle you, yell at you in from of people over the most stupid thing and require you to take a test before being hired which doesn't apply to assistant work at all. Benefits are great if you are a full time employee and they won't let you take time off in the first year. Following year, approach with caution. This place is all about politics and favoritism. If you get on the wrong side of a manager, you won't get a promotion. They are experts are making you believe you will move up and when the time comes they will give you some excuse. They will try to give you the least amount of money and work you like a dog.Only good to put on resume because of the name.The work was pretty boring and kind of a grind but the people here were so nice to work with. Great company to work for, lots good memories here.Great place to work	Production of chart and graph intensive documents and color presentation, utilizing PowerPoint, Excel, Word, Photoshop, Illustrator, Pagemaker	Assigned to coordinate and schedule 5-8 teams of consultants on their production needs daily and weekly.	Created color online presentations and coordination of  35mm slides (processing, display equipment setup and equipment test).McKinseywas a great place to work and the guidance I received there was exceptional. I had the opportunity to work with individuals throughout the country.Fun work with great project and clients.Excellent people and very hard workers.You travel a lot.Great office support.Feedback cultureMcKinsey is a global firm, comprising more than 9,000 consultants and nearly 2,000 research and information professionals. We have offices in more than 60 countries, speak more than 120 languages, and represent over 100 nationalities.People:-- Surrounded by some of the most talented, impact-driven people of any organization-- Contrary to most expectations, the people are interesting and interested, and much more interested in solving problems than career advancement or office politics.Lifestlye:-- Travel and hours can be challenging, but most of it is self-enforced. There is a tradeoff between location/lifestyle/sector for any project, and you can't always have all 3.","10,000+",Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-11-12T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/data-scientist-metals-mining-job-seattle-wa-us-175903633.aspx?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

338,4280.0,"data scientist, Business Strategy - Seattle, WA(Job Number:160007548)",Starbucks,4.1,10300.0,"The company is willingly to develop their employees as much and as far that employee wants to go.work days varied, all co-workers worked together  and had good customer service., benefits were very good, regular pay raises, insurance.and free starbucks coffee.Colleagues were amazing. Fun and eventful days at work. Making coffee, practicing the foam art, all in a days work. When we weren't getting orders through the window, cleaning and ensuring the areas were clean, were also a part of the daily duties.I enjoy this job and my team.  Position can be enjoyable, yet stressful. Toughest part of the job is the toll on me physically.i just didn't  like unstable they were with their hours, you would get sent home early so they could cut labor, i liked working in a team. the hardest part was having to be on the floor on your ownThis job is great. I love my coworkers and the management team, although the customers can be very difficult to deal with at times. Overall a great job, however consistently burning your hands on hot coffee is hard to handle.Depending on the shift, my day typically differed vastly. The store had a great workflow established for morning, mid and evening shifts. I was initially filling in positions to help the store since I was new. So I would warm pastries during the morning rush and run the to the front counter or drive through. I'd brew coffees/teas, refill milks, juices, cups, lids, straws etc. I'd open another register to help clear lines during rushes. I'd clean dishes, lobby, the bathrooms, the store. Other days I'd be focused on making drinks on ""the bar"" or I'd be assigned a register.Starbucks is an amazing company to work for. I was hired while in high school and continued to work there through graduating college. They offer amazing benefits and are very flexible with school or other work schedules. There are always opportunities for advancement!It was a very rewarding job with many perks. I experienced a new atmosphere and learned many new skills. I enjoyed the job but the management was terrible and was the reasoning for my resignation.Great place to work at . NIce vibe to it . Free drinks. Free food. Free markout every week. Great benefits. They have a college achievement plan !Customers are amazing and loyal once they know you put them first.  Working in a drive thru store requires multi-tasking at a whole other level if you are a shift or store manager.  Must ensure routines are followed at all times, otherwise good intentions from staff can cause chaos quickly.  Great company and AMAZING benefits if you work for corporate store.  Don't waste your time with license store though, because it doesn't come close in benefits.Have a positive relationship with your co-workersProductive dayBe efficientStay motivatedFollow instructions from management Contribute new ideasStarbucks is a great job and I miss it. You start your day off by prepping the coffee for sales. I learned about how communicating with customers can make the business a better place. there is nothing hard about this job, it is so easy-going & fun. the  co-workers are really fun to be around.A day working at Starbucks is so much fun it's like you never know what to expect when you walk into work, you meet new people everyday the customers are always nice and welcomeStarbucks is great at fitting to your schedule whether it is early days, short shifts, etc. But the real plus is the benefits, health, stocks, free coffee, tuition reimbursement. The pay is good for a part time job but not something that you can live off of comfortably.Lots of customer service with a smile! I learned how to balance many tasks and prioritize between them. It was a very busy job that required full engagement to do the job right. I learned a lot from this job and it helped to have the management that I did. The hardest part of this job was the continuous mind numbing customer service in the early mornings, but the best part was also the continuous customer service. I enjoyed being the smiling connection that helps others jump start their morning and get their day going.I loved working for this company. The atmosphere is always great and the people you work with are just as good. i learned a lot more about customer service working here because it is such an engaging job.Rewarding in every aspect of the job.  Excellent Mission and Values to live by both inside and outside of the job.  Excellent work life balance.Overall Starbucks is a great company. The people here are generally uplifting and the workplace is mostly cheerful.I would recommend working here for sure.Starbucks used to be a great company to work for. But as of late, the standards and expectations are on the rise while we labor is cut and we are meant to do the work of 2-3 people at once. It feels impossible. One of the more frustrating things is the fact that tenured partners' wages have been ""bumped to the new minimum"" so that people that are just hired or just been promoted are all making the same amount of money. A new supervisor that has been promoted is making the same amount as one that has been doing the exact same position for 3 years. Morale is at an all time low all around.This was my first job. I was not trained for very long at all. I was hired during the busiest season and we were short staffed so that put a lot of stress on me. My co-workers were nice and understanding though.","10,000+",Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-11-12T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/2a17d5f7-a60a-4ee6-84e1-d2d5f768d63d?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
