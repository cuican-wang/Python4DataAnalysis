92,4034.0,"Decision scientist, Retail Operations, Business Strategy - Seattle, WA",Starbucks Coffee Company,4.1,10300.0,"The company is willingly to develop their employees as much and as far that employee wants to go.work days varied, all co-workers worked together  and had good customer service., benefits were very good, regular pay raises, insurance.and free starbucks coffee.Colleagues were amazing. Fun and eventful days at work. Making coffee, practicing the foam art, all in a days work. When we weren't getting orders through the window, cleaning and ensuring the areas were clean, were also a part of the daily duties.I enjoy this job and my team.  Position can be enjoyable, yet stressful. Toughest part of the job is the toll on me physically.i just didn't  like unstable they were with their hours, you would get sent home early so they could cut labor, i liked working in a team. the hardest part was having to be on the floor on your ownThis job is great. I love my coworkers and the management team, although the customers can be very difficult to deal with at times. Overall a great job, however consistently burning your hands on hot coffee is hard to handle.Depending on the shift, my day typically differed vastly. The store had a great workflow established for morning, mid and evening shifts. I was initially filling in positions to help the store since I was new. So I would warm pastries during the morning rush and run the to the front counter or drive through. I'd brew coffees/teas, refill milks, juices, cups, lids, straws etc. I'd open another register to help clear lines during rushes. I'd clean dishes, lobby, the bathrooms, the store. Other days I'd be focused on making drinks on ""the bar"" or I'd be assigned a register.Starbucks is an amazing company to work for. I was hired while in high school and continued to work there through graduating college. They offer amazing benefits and are very flexible with school or other work schedules. There are always opportunities for advancement!It was a very rewarding job with many perks. I experienced a new atmosphere and learned many new skills. I enjoyed the job but the management was terrible and was the reasoning for my resignation.Great place to work at . NIce vibe to it . Free drinks. Free food. Free markout every week. Great benefits. They have a college achievement plan !Customers are amazing and loyal once they know you put them first.  Working in a drive thru store requires multi-tasking at a whole other level if you are a shift or store manager.  Must ensure routines are followed at all times, otherwise good intentions from staff can cause chaos quickly.  Great company and AMAZING benefits if you work for corporate store.  Don't waste your time with license store though, because it doesn't come close in benefits.Have a positive relationship with your co-workersProductive dayBe efficientStay motivatedFollow instructions from management Contribute new ideasStarbucks is a great job and I miss it. You start your day off by prepping the coffee for sales. I learned about how communicating with customers can make the business a better place. there is nothing hard about this job, it is so easy-going & fun. the  co-workers are really fun to be around.A day working at Starbucks is so much fun it's like you never know what to expect when you walk into work, you meet new people everyday the customers are always nice and welcomeStarbucks is great at fitting to your schedule whether it is early days, short shifts, etc. But the real plus is the benefits, health, stocks, free coffee, tuition reimbursement. The pay is good for a part time job but not something that you can live off of comfortably.Lots of customer service with a smile! I learned how to balance many tasks and prioritize between them. It was a very busy job that required full engagement to do the job right. I learned a lot from this job and it helped to have the management that I did. The hardest part of this job was the continuous mind numbing customer service in the early mornings, but the best part was also the continuous customer service. I enjoyed being the smiling connection that helps others jump start their morning and get their day going.I loved working for this company. The atmosphere is always great and the people you work with are just as good. i learned a lot more about customer service working here because it is such an engaging job.Rewarding in every aspect of the job.  Excellent Mission and Values to live by both inside and outside of the job.  Excellent work life balance.Overall Starbucks is a great company. The people here are generally uplifting and the workplace is mostly cheerful.I would recommend working here for sure.Starbucks used to be a great company to work for. But as of late, the standards and expectations are on the rise while we labor is cut and we are meant to do the work of 2-3 people at once. It feels impossible. One of the more frustrating things is the fact that tenured partners' wages have been ""bumped to the new minimum"" so that people that are just hired or just been promoted are all making the same amount of money. A new supervisor that has been promoted is making the same amount as one that has been doing the exact same position for 3 years. Morale is at an all time low all around.This was my first job. I was not trained for very long at all. I was hired during the busiest season and we were short staffed so that put a lot of stress on me. My co-workers were nice and understanding though.","10,000+",Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-11-19T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/decision-scientist-retail-operations-business-strategy-seattle-wa-job-seattle-wa-us-176375023.aspx?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

CEO transitioned from founder to lawyer - uh oh!Navteq provides an individual the opportunity to experience and learn in an ever increasing demand for up to date maps pertaining to GPS systems. It affords people the chance to work in a IT driven, multicultural environment. Navteq offers the chance to work within databases, learn brand new software, while maintaining a work friendly environment. The best part of the job, the experience you will learn from working with new technology and the training offered. The pros and cons like many organizations are the people you work with. Navteq has a great number of amazing individuals who make working for this company a pleasure most of the time. The negative benefits being: the lack of advancement and communication with the management teams which is the significant factor one should consider before looking for work with such a company.Healthy working environment, Good compensation compare to market, very helpful peers. Management has no idea of technical ground but helpful. I worked as consultant but received friendly treatment. No complainsThe company became more disorganized and poorly managed as it grew and got sold back and forth. The people I worked with directly were amazing. The job itself was a good job. It was fun and served an important purpose. Without working here I would not have been able to gain valuable experience to help me in my career path.Good corporate culture and work amenities. C Level Management are top notch. Great advancement within but parent company's market share erosion depleted the moraleit is very good company to workAll cutting edge technologies are used here Management is okaygood peopleHardest part of job is production supportmost enjoyable part of the job is every day Work hard and play hard type of culture.  This was the first job out of undergrad and it was a perfect fit for me.  I moved to a field office in Little Rock, Arkansas to work with one other colleague.  Lots of travel opportunities within the state, country, and international as well.Following all new construction across western Illinois and northern Missouri is a task in itself, followed by field data collection to implement quarterly database upgrades. Creating new products in the navigation industry was a challenge, as our company continued to grow and lead in many navigational aspects across the globe. Travel could be long in duration at times, but I remain readily available to complete all company goals and objectives. I value all contributions and relationships from co-workers across the US, Mexico and Europe during the creation of project specific builds.A typical day working at Navteq/Nokia requires extensive communication between internal and external departments involving database closure windows, project management, planning with project managers, field teams, vendors, and Overseas Production Centers (OPC's). Navteq affords a laid back approach from the traditional standards of 8-5 by allowing employee's to dictate their own work schedule with some exceptions. If I've learned anything through my experience within this company. It is the chance to have been given responsibility over managing multiple projects/teams and how to handle ever changing situations. I was fortunate in working with many fine men and women throughout my years at this company. If I have any negative things to say about this company, it is simply to state that those that truly strive to make this company the best in the market, often times are overshadowed, or tasked with too much responsibility and low wages for the work involved.my typical day consist of making route preparations and all travel arrangements for upcoming trips for our dept.  Travel to different parts of the world collect GPS data for traffic dept. We mostly work by ourselves from home when not traveling.  The hardest part of this job would is being away from home and family on a weekly basis.
