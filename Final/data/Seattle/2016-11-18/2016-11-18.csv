93,4035.0,Research Scientist - Outcomes Research,Evidera,3.6,5.0,"Evidera has many positive things going for it.  There are opportunities for anyone to succeed if they're willing to think big, work hard, take ownership and really commit to whatever it is they're doing.  The only limits are those people place on themselves.I have been at Evidera through many major changes over the last five years.  We are better and stronger than we've ever been before and as a free standing company, in control of our own destiny.  That's a great place to be.Productive, fun, simple, enjoyable, didactic, interesting, workplace. I recommend to other research assistants and anyone else who is prospectively looking to work hereA great place to start your career if you are a researcher; offers considerable opopportunities for growth and advancementOrganizational structure provides limited options for operations staff who have expectations of long-term employment; limited resources made available for skills development of operations staffMy experience here as a SAS programer was very positive. Everyone here knows what they are doing and works together well as a team. Demands of the job are not too high, but expect to pull a few all-nighters when projects are due.",,Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-11-18T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/research-scientist-outcomes-research-job-seattle-wa-us-176347410.aspx?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
