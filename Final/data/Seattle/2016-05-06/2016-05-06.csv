685,4627.0,Lead Research Scientist,PMSI,3.8,51.0,"A typical day at work calling Medicare to check lien assignments. Working a diary everyday. Submitting signed authorizations to the MSPRC and follow up for the Conditional Payment Letters. Work with management with Special Projects as necessary. I learned a lot about how Medicare works and what they will and will not approve. Management was strict and approachable. My co-workers were great and a lot of fun. The hardest part of the job was waiting on the phone with Medicare which could take up to 40 minutes or longer. The most enjoyable part of the job was the variety of lunch vendors who fed us.This job is a good place to work. The management is not very good but other than that it is a good job. They fired me for putting the work truck in a ditch. They would not give me my last paycheckMost days were busy, but enjoyable, because in so many ways I was helping people.  Either on the phone or checking in patients, or checking them out with their next appointment,  Sometimes there were some that  had a need to talk, and i listened with patience, because we all need someone to talk to sometime.  Every now and then some patients would get upset, and we (as well as myuself) would do whatever we could to keep them calm, and try to resolve their issues.  Really enjoyed being to make the patients happy, but it was hard when you were not able to get them in for an appointment when they wanted it, but did the best I could to satisfy them.  A lot of days were a challenge, but yet it was still enjoyable and rewarding.Good company to work for. Learned a lot about medical equipment, vendors, and the flow of the relationship as an DME account manager. A lot of organizational and technological changes during my tenure. Friendly co-workers.Great company to work for. Awesome potential to promote and relocate when merited. Highly recommended for anyone degreed or not.A typical work day would consist of inbound/outbound calls/emails. I learned how to multi-task and how to give excellant customer service. Management and co-workers were pretty decent. The hardest part of the job was not having control of your incoming calls and being able to notate each file accurately in the amount of time given. The most enjoyable part of job was to be able to assist the clients in receiving their meds in a timely matter.I worked at PMSI in several capacities starting in 1997 as a pharmacy tech, and have always been able to grow thru my own merits and efforts.When I resigned from there it was only to maximize my potential professional growth, I still believe in the company, and would be honored to return in the future.This company has very poor management. The management team is never on the same page and the work is very stressful. The pay is very low and the benefits are great at allI constantly follow up on denied claims and I also work patient collections. I post payments and I know how to read explanation of benefitsPMSI can use some improvements in several areas.  The people were not friendly for example when my Aunt & Brother died I didn't get any sympathy from anyone not even a cardHard work , hard on your body but good pay. lots of traveling. You have to be willing to work long hours,The corporate culture was that of a large ant hill.  Many people always running around trying to do what is best and getting in each other's way.  Many chiefs and no cohesiveness.  I worked with some of the best people in the pharmacy benefit management industry.  I know I will never have such an opportunity to work with people that I could not find fault in any one of them, ever again.  I left when I realized that I would not be able to get ahead professionally or financially and when my vacations were all work vacations.Excellent Company with excellent potential.  Enjoyed working with a group of excellent people with a wealth of knowledge.I loved working for this company.  The had great benefits and a great staff.This company could be something great if it didn't keep shooting itself in the foot. Lack of direction from upper management leads to missed deadlines and low morale among the ""worker bees"". Because PMSI is under the ownership of a holding company, we are always under the fear of being sold. It seems most of the effort here goes into ""fattening us up for market"".If you are desperate for a meager paycheck and just need a place to land between jobs, then this may suit you in the short term. I wouldn't recommend making a career here.Spent most days collecting and scanning medical documents from adjusters. I learned to hone my multi-tasking skills at this job. Management was very helpful. I worked with only 3 other people in my market but all were very good at their jobs. The hardest part of the job was finding time for family as you worked almost every day and into the night some nights. The most enjoyable part of my job here was working with the adjusters and forming ""friendships"" and building trust so that they would continue to bring you more work.This is where I first learned all the Do's and Don'ts of customer service. Longest and by far, most rewarding of all my jobs. Learned so much of my skills set from the training I received here.I enjoyed working at PMSI everytime  when someone had a birthday we always had our desk decorated and birthday cake. It was a very fun place to work , we had fun  but  always made  sure that the patient was always satisfied because they were our  customers  . When we satisfied the patients then we new  we did our job right.   The management was the best every .They knew when we was at work that we gave our all to satisfy the customers and they let us know how much they was proud of us. The hardest part of the job was we did get close to the patients and when one would pass away it would upset some of us. Over all it's a great place to work.The best part about the job is the employees that you work with. The patients are great as well. A lot of the same patients are seen and it is nice to see their smiling faces.days are full, there is always something new, supervision is cool. The hardest part of day is the most fun. Everyone works together well. The best part is the pay, it is great.9-11 hour days, fast paced, revenue based end of month crunch...every month.While I have had the opportunity to be mentored by incredibly successful people, I find that in any relationship actions speak louder than words, and from where I sit I'm hearing a lot of words but not seeing a lot of action. It's disappointing as an associate.The most enjoyable part of the job is I am able to bring different idea's to the table to help with efficiency within the departments. The hardest part of the job is maintaining the team spirit throughout the floor with already low morals.",,Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-05-06T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/fa2e176b-91e2-4a2b-ba62-7ba07d8785bf?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=35,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
