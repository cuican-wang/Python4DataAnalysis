803,4745.0,Senior Medical Science Liaison (Oncology),Astellas Pharma,3.7,50.0,"Territory sales within a defined area which meant to go where the business was.  Learned effective time management and sales targeting. Management was mediocre and fleeting.  Co-workers for the most part were top notch.  Hardest part of my job was trying to make my territory comparable to the south and east coast.Nice place to work, Friendly people . more work ,good environment to work. and this is the one of the company that i love to work withI like working at Astellas,  The people and management are friendly.  It a relaxed and flexible work environment,  I like how they support all ethnicity and lifestyles.Very nice work environment. A very good work/life balance. Management is done well well. Good Company culture. A very good team.We all know that painful feeling waking up in the morning to get ready for a job that we don't like.  Going to work each morning for Astellas was not that way for me.  This is a wonderful company that provides exceptional compensation and benefits for their employees.  This company truly cares about their employees lives and well being.  The flexibility and vacation time provided is nothing less of exceptional.  I greatly enjoy working for this company.  Astellas has set the bar very high.Good place to start your working life out of college. The pay isnt the best but its solid for a good resume builder. Get in and get out. The staff and people who are in management are great.I learned much about the sales and marketing aspects of product promotion, as well as the technical aspects of the product.  The sales team that I worked with was exceptional.  I enjoyed getting out in the professional community and networking with others in my profession.Solid work place environment. Good opportunity. Supportive colleagues and well intention-ed management. Since my stay with Astellas was short, I had little to complain about.OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was bought by Astellas, so I worked mostly for OSI.  My co-workers were wonderful; very supportive, eager to teach and learn from each other, always striving to improve. In my time there, we had several directors, most of whom were knowledgeable, helpful and approachable. Being in cancer research, management made a real effort to show us how our work was impacting patients by holding talks given by Medical Affairs, Clinical and Marketing. We had great educational benefits; they reimbursed for classes you took related to your career path.Excellent company with great products. Top in industry for benefits and work life balance. Great teammates in all areas of the business. Ability to run your territory as you see fit to move the business.I was hired as Transplant rep and worked here for a year, the company was great , the pay and benefits were excellent. I left the company  as my position was not a good fit for me on a day to day basis based on calling on only 4 accountsI enjoyed my job doing various tasks.  My favoriate was Manageing Translations.  The customers were interestion to work with, I learned daily.I loved the job I was doing and looked forward to going to work. Enjoyed working with management, employees and suppliers.Astellas is a Japanese company. All employees try to be honest and work hard to release new medicines in the world to save as many people who need to be cured. Astellas has been trying to have diversities and they have now.I've worked in other corporate positions but none of them were the right fit for me and balancing all of the things I'm involved in outside of the office. Not only does Astellas offer great benefits, the flex scheduling and work location is essential for work-life balance for my entire team. The professional development opportunities are abundant and make me very excited about my future at Astellas and proud about the change my work does to further our mission and our ability to improve the lives of patients around the world.Great company who had some excellent products.  Worked with others and didn't have to be micro managed.  We had a steroid free product that dermatologsits wanted.Good products and good field sales leadership. Smart people who know what they're doing in the field. In the home office, there are many excellent people who have strong technical sales. There's an over reliance on consultants who bring in fresh ideas and milk millions of dollars off the bottom line. The best technicians rise to the top, as long as they're likable people. This results in poor leadership in the home office. But, nobody really cares about home office leadership because technicians are replaceable and the field sales folks continue to bring in the dollars.Run don't walk.  Hands down the worst management and pharma company in the industry.  Nightmare to work for and no I'm not being bitter or unfair.  It is very unhealthy work situation.It is a great company to work for. I enjoyed my time there. I had a great mentor to shepherd me through the organization. Management was very supportive and co-workers were willing to help when necessary.Astellas Pharma is a fast paced growing company, that offers an  atmosphere that promotes teamwork, and empowers employees to  thrive in their career.I was the maintenance manager for a two/three shift operation.  I would arrive at work before the third shift was over in order to talk with the maintenance techs to find out what had happened during their shift and know current equipment status.  I would then review the Work Order System to assign new work orders and verify status of urgent work orders.  Daily activity was determined by priorities, downed equipment repair was number one priority, then projects and then necessary meetings for production scheduling and other needs.  Since this was a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility we work under clean room conditions.  The nature of maintenance required the maintenance techs to use extra care and caution when performing normal procedures to the equipment.  In addition to maintaining the production and support equipment our team also performed the majority of calibrations for the site, this averaged to about 650 calibrations per month, we never missed making schedule. Upper management was very open to discussion but still demanding schedules were maintained.  Projects were scheduled during site shut downs unless it was a equipment modification that required immediate attention.My management team was primarily consisted of operations managers, I was the only maintenance manager.  We worked well together covering production and project work making equipment and resource schedules that made everyone's schedule as much as possible.The hardest part of the job was keeping the right combination of maintenance tech skill sets distributed to each shift during high work rate  more... schedules without hiring additional techs or working excessive overtime.  We went from a five day two shift production schedule to a twenty-four seven day schedule for approximately six months, this was a challenging time for everyone.I enjoyed seeing the monthly schedules completed early or at least on schedule especially when we had trying situations to overcome in addition to our normal work load.  I also enjoyed seeing a project come to completion weather it was outside contractors or our maintenance techs or a combination of both.  I also enjoyed observing maintenance techs learning new skills and growing their proficiency in all areas of their work assignments.  less",,Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-11-23T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/6c68c052-f9a0-40e0-8a9c-2e07d4163d9e?mescoid=1900254001001&jobPosition=15,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
