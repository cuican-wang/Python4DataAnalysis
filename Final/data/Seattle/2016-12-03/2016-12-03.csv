323,4265.0,Principle ML & Data Scientist,Microsoft Corporation,4.2,2600.0,"Microsoft is a very good place to work.  The company direction with Satya Nadella at the helm has been very good, and many internal changes are improving the culture and environment over time.  Very competitive, and there are some managers who are better than others (as is true with any employer).  Best if you're willing to work in Redmond, WA as remote opportunities are not nearly as extensive.Microsoft is a great place to work- the pay is good, the benefits are good, too.What is difficult is the opportunity for advancement.  If you have any scarce skills and are placed on a team that knows very little, then you're to fend for yourself with little to no help from management.Old way of working of save your skin and compete with each other is going away but very in a very slow pace. lots of flexibility and some work life balance but you will have lot of pressure and sense of not doing it right even when you are doing it right...changes are constant and that's can worn you out.Dynamic but relaxed team environment.  Always challenging and fun, and populated with some of the best professionals from around the world.A lot of learning, very good work culture. Excellent environment. Enjoyed working on the SharePoint team developing and handling TFS administrator part.Greet customers as they walk in the store while asking if there was something specific or pointing out the different sections of the store.  Interacted with several customers and co workers on a daily basis as well as cleaned, organized and restocked product on the floor.You can change careers multiple times without needing to change companies.  The compensation and benefits are outstanding, and the culture rewards delivery and innovation.I have been with Microsoft for almost 4 years. The company treats their employees (myself included) very well. Schedule flexibility is great, hourly wage is manageable, and the overall energy and support that other employees give out makes the retail environment a lot more manageable.Microsoft has an amazing company culture all the way to it's retail sector. Great room for advancement, lots of talented people and awesome culture and work environment.Microsoft benefits and compensation is one of the best, but unfortunately it has a horrible culture of work politics. Hard work is not appreciated, but ability to make relationship with utmost importance. Basically ignore any emails from peers and people below and only spend time to do bare minimum for your job. Focus your time on your skip level and director/VP level. The more face time you have with them the better your review will be regardless of your work. Annual review system is basically a popularity contest with your higher up with the most say. Microsoft is a large company, I am not sure if it was just the department I was in. I would like to work there again one day but not in the same department to see how other parts of the company is like.troubleshoot calls for customers and help them be able to locate products, customer love when I do the first part of my call. I was very upset when the acct was shut-downDespite a great transformation thus far, the company does not do a good job retaining great employees and has lost quite a bit of great talent this year.Very smart and awesome people.  Teams looked after each other and did what needed to be done for the customer.  Very thankful for my time there and always rooting for them.Microsoft is a great place to develop your professional career for full-time employees. Beyond the impact employees get to make on customers is the impact they make on the community. Perhaps the most unique aspect of the workplace is the emphasis we place on social responsibility and giving back to the community.Microsoft treats their employees with great respect. The company provides excellent benefits. Fun people, great atmosphere.Microsoft is a great company to work for.  Very talented people with innovative ideas. complete work life balance. A fun place to work with Talented peopleA typical day at work is surrounded by operational tasks and customer interactions. You have the ability to lead your team through coaching and development and provide recognition in unique ways. The team has a lot of fun together and really is able to serve customers with a great experience.A special place to work when you find the right opportunity and team.  The business is a thought leader (which is not recognized externally) and always looking to advance.A nice productive environmentGood place to work and health atmosphereGood compensationGood benefitsFlexible hoursWork from homeNice colleagues and challenging workI learned a lot as a Data Engineer an learnt about data and did some personal bootcamp training myself and attended meetings. But i wanted to show my skills to start up companies.I learned how to be a leader with this company. I learned the type of leader I want to be with this company. Microsoft takes care of its associates and gives them the tools and resources to grow in their roles and get them to where they want to be. They have a growth mindset culture and promote diversity and inclusion in all aspects of their business.","10,000+",Seattle,Bellevue,WA,2016-12-03T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/d393d702-d825-4751-bcd4-9c884664a033?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=3,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

468,4410.0,Research Scientist/engineer - Assistant,University of Washington,4.2,337.0,"Overall the University of Washington is a great place to work with awesome benefits. Easy work life balance, one in which you can feel free to pursue your passions!I had the pleasure of working for one of the most respected professors in my department. He had my best interests at heart, and is truly a genuine person. The work was always challenging and interesting, and I have him to thank for a lot of my successes thereafter.The University of Washington has a problem with micromanaging. we would have the manager, front supervisor, back supervisor and lab supervisor under one roof at one time. We were a new clinic at the time so not much to do.Incredible work is done at the University of Washington, in so many different ways. In the health sciences alone, people are looking for cures for cancer and other healthcare issues, trying to solve public health problems, environmental issues, and diseases, It can be an intense place to work, but it can also be a lot of fun. It's people are the best.UW is a great place to work. Great life/work balance, great benefits. nice and beautiful Seattle area.UW has strong scientific records, great place for medicine, EE and CS. However, if you want to learn chemistry or Materials Science, you'd better think other places.Great place to work if you need a foot in the door or if you are close to retiring. I like the flexibility of my position and that I feel comfortable going to my supervisor for questions.Most enjoyable part is learning and overcome the challenges through confidence and positiveness. I liked solving problem there. Environment is very good here.Overall it's great. My only qualm is that I've been talked to about full time for almost a year now and it's never happened. Other than that it has been great.Nice and friendly environment to work in, it was a job that you could work at your own pace. Coworkers are helpful when i need help. It was a job where you mainly work independently, which is great work experience. Hardest part of the job was transporting heavy or large quantity of orders around campus with only a hand truck. Due to construction work I had to take detours on unbalanced terrain making it hard to deliver. Enjoyable part of the was seeing people so happy to receive their orders.Well organized and Team player, 10+ years of custodial experience of hotel, hospital and school maintenance, and following safety regulations and working with teams to achieve institutional efficiency goals. Fast learner, work quick, self motivated.Good communication and some computer skills. I am a dedicated worker with a strong ethic. Excellent and co worker is very friendly. I'm doing my job well and followed the rules and my obligation.Worst work experience in 30 years ... horrible, nasty, mean, hostile boss.  Mgmt unclear on the concept of how to build and keep a functioning team.I really enjoyed my time at UW. I was able to flourish during my time there and really appreciate everyone I had to chance to work with.I am a formal facilities employee who's job it was to put band aids on buildings with failing systems. Management does not have any respect for trades people because most of them do not have a clue about what we do, that should make you understand the condition of the buildings. Last month there was an article in the paper that told about a Billion Dollars worth of deferred maintenance at the UW, I wouldn't be surprised if it is more. I was hired into a job that did not have any licensing requirements yet during my probationary period I was signed up for a certification class. The UW did pay for the class but is too cheap to pay for you to use any extra certificates or to pay for you to keep them so if you are one of the lucky ones who ""gets"" to have a certification the UW wants in the end you will actually be making less than your uncertified fellow employees.University of Washington is renowned for its advancements of research, technology, and innovation. However, what it lacks in is a solid cohort of a support network, particularly in STEM-related areas.University offers an excellent Work/Life balance which is difficult to find in today's work force.  I would recommend the University to anyone looking for a job.Enjoyed working with students and faculty alongwith the curriculum that was provided. Challenging and rewarding at the same time.Poor management that have never done lower level clinic support jobs telling you how to do your lower level clinic support job. If I hear the word data one more time my head might pop. They expect more and more from us as they eliminate positions or just don't fill vacancies. Seems the toxic employees outnumber dedicated ones. I've never seen/heard so much backstabbing and lies from grown people. If you don't participate you're marked as aloof. Pass on this place if you want to go to work and contribute to good patient care unless you'll have your own office and can lock the door or you just want good benes.Great opportunity to learn about different types of things related to my field. Gives key job skills as well as an insight into different areas of industry you could pursue.I'd like to work in a place where I could grow to my fullest potential. A fun, productive workplace. University of Washington really care about me s as well as your advancement in the future. The office has a very good balance of work with great opportunities to learn and to grow.Was great working in Seattle at a premier healthcare facility.  Got to work with several homeless shelters and meet many diverse people.  Management style was easy to work with, benefits needed to be increased along with compensationWork schedules could be better organized. Class assignments were given at the last minute, and changes to class locations was confusing. Management seemed threatened by the experienced consultant staff. This prevented the establishment of a collaborative working relationship.",,Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-12-03T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/674079fa-555b-49f0-91c6-8fdeb78fd1ed?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=25,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
