336,4278.0,Principal Data Scientist I,Concur,4.3,84.0,"You work very hard, you report very often to superiors about pipeline and activity, if you exceed quota income is great.  Quarterly driven!!!  Don't miss your number.  If you exceed quota in Q2, Q3 is, ""What have you done for me lately?""Occasionally, managers take senior leadership's no nonsense style and direct approach a little too far downstream.  It can become insensitive with the inexperienced managers trying to prove they belong. Concur is a software company at heart, and what amazingly awesome software they make.  Customers LOVE the software.  Concur is without doubt the industry leader, dominating the competition.  Service delivery and particularly support and implementation can be difficult for them.  Ask Concur customers and you'll get the feedback you're looking for.Concur is a great company that recently became part of SAP. They have maintained their own corporate culture. They do have some really nice benefits like paid maternity leave, generous PTO, work from home, and free sodas at the office. A downside to working at Concur would be the lack of internal training. If you were interested in taking an external training class in Excel or something, they will cover that. However, trying to get information on their own systems (CTE and ConcurGov) can be really difficult. Frequently it seems that each department doesn't know what the other is doing. They have grown really fast, and perhaps they don't have some of the corporate infrastructure in place that one expects from a company of this size.Coworkers are friendly. Provides flexible work from home options.Salary not up to industry average. Career path not clearly defined.Concur has suffered from a mass exodus of Sr leadership combined with exponential growth. Currently there is a lot of confusion internally and externally, stemming from rapid growth.It's very difficult to be positive in a workplace where favoritism is so obvious. Once you become that person you never recover. Management micro manages to make sure their butts are covered.There was never a work life balance & Senior  management does NOT care about you. After I left I was talking with a job recruiter who told me this company has a reputation of "" burn them & churn them""The company mentality is all work!!!! 7 days a week.Yes you will be compensated  very good but you are living only to work.Kiss your family life good buy. It's all a numbers game.My manager is someone who Micro Manages our team daily/hourly.  There is constant change in job responsibilities strictly based on the managers whims.My most enjoyably part of the job is working with the clients.I was apart of the HR department, mainly assisting with the Permanent Residency Recruitment process.  The goal was to prove to the Department of Labor that we were not displacing any U.S. workers for positions held by visa dependent employees.  First, we posted the job on various websites and newspaper ads, candidates would apply, and I would review each application to determine if their qualifications met the requirements.  If so, I would conduct initial phone interviews, and if their qualifications remained strong, I would then schedule a second phone interview with the hiring manager so they could delve deeper into their experience and skills.The work in itself was slightly challenging only because this was a different type of recruitment, and after I had tracked and updated all the necessary information, our legal team had to review everything until they submitted the files to DOL (Department of Labor).  The legal team would thoroughly review the files and if anything was deemed questionable or needed to be revisited I was responsible for going back and making sure everything was 100% perfect.  Overall, I did like the people I worked with, I just felt that management was unprofessional, and were disorganized themselves, which made my ability to do my job a little more challenging.  I was grateful for the experience, but in the end the role just wasn't a good fit for me, or my future goals.The reason Concur has so many loyal customers is because our company culture puts an emphasis on employees, customers, integrity and innovation. Working here means being passionate about what you do and never blaming others.Employee benefits are generous and all levels of management are accessible. Office accommodations are very nice and well maintained. Opportunities for professional growth and promotion are readily available and it's common to find people who have moved from entry-level to much higher positions.Flexible schedules, free beverages and ride share subsidies are other perks that help make working here even more fun.When someone asks me to describe Concur the first thought that comes to mind is “Opportunity”. Opportunity to learn and grow. Opportunity to contribute and be part of a team. Opportunity to be innovative and make a difference in the world. Concur is one of those unique places where you feel as though you have made a key contribution to the bigger plan. They genuinely care about their employees both in career success and personal well-being. Concur prides itself on upholding the core values that the company was built on. Everyone who works here lives and abides by these values which are a key contributor to the unmistakable positive energy and personal success of each individual. I cannot think of a better place to be right now then here at Concur.Concur is a market leader which continues to innovate creating ongoing opportunities to keep learning and bring new solutions to the client base. The company supports work from home and although has high expectations for delivery of results, also encourages healhty work/life balance. Leaders communicates their vision, setting broad objectives and principles and has a deep management team, most with many years of tenure able to execute effectively.I had worked for a Top 500 company for many years, leading multi-year, complex projects. I was looking for something different. I wanted a job where I would look forward to going to work every day. One that offered flexible hours, shorter, less-complex projects and where I could work from home. My dream job!! I became a member of Concur's family one year ago, and I can truly say that I love my job!! They had everything that I wanted, and I was getting paid very well for something that I enjoy doing. The benefits are great and there are so many opportunities for growth and advancement. Concur has a 5-star rating in my book!!I have been with Concur for two years, and have never been happier or more excited about what I do and the people I work with. The leadership is committed to accelerating our innovation and leadership in the Cloud Computing/Social Enterprise space, and continuing to deliver significant value to companies large and small. There is tremendous growth potential for our company, and for every employee here (or soon to be here). If you are committed to realizing your full potential, and contributing to the success of the team, then I would highly recommend you join Concur.Open applications Internet explorerMicrosoft outlookARC (each different account number)Back office dataGDS (sabre, amadeus word span) ExcelAs many of the account have errors. Each error need to be work individually and check  in the GDS (Global Distribution Service) for each passenger travel needsHaving worked for Concur for over a year, I still go to work excited to be a part of something great and innovative. I have not ever worked for a company that not only says that the culture is like family, but also lives that mantra everyday. Everyone understands that they are critical to the success of the company and the leadership team regularly reinforces that with the employees. Additionally the leadership team does not sit off in an ivory tower, inaccessible to everyone. They are out in the office everyday, grabbing conversations with you. Finally, I would say that working at Concur has afforded me many diverse experiences that I can add to my tool belt that I might not have gotten with any other company.outsources, doesn't care about employees, very bad company some friendly smart employees bought out by SAP. A terrible example of a veteran with an honorable discharge is terminated while foreigners working on a visa promoted.The company is growing quickly and there is alot of room to advance. Flexible hours and the ability to work from home fosters a great work/life balance. Excellent company culture and they work hard to maintain the small company feel. Competitive pay and benefits.Concur offers a wealth of opportunity for those who seek to pursue it. With it's growing global presence, Concur provides an individual career trajectory that also facilitates travel to many parts of the globe, EMEA, APA and of course the domestic US.For the motivated and energetic individual, there is no shortage of work and possibilities.The culture at Concur is great, people willing to connect all over the globe, along with some fun monthly moral events mixed in and around the offices.Such a fun and innovative culture and the employees are all great. Has the startup feel while still a fast-growing company.I've worked for several companies, large, small, well established and start-ups. Concur is one of just a few where I feel challenged on a daily basis, my ideas are sought out and new methods are welcomed. Constantly striving to improve and come up with a better solution to new and old problems is just part of the job. No one is bounded by a ""box"" - you determine how much you take on and how you can contribute.Just within the database group, we manage SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL and Mongo. Working closely with development on a daily basis to find and resolve potential problems before they arise. There's never an ""finger pointing"", problems are identified, corrected and we move forward.Concur is overall great company to work for. Offering amazing benefits such at 22 days off PTO to start. There is career opportunities to those who speak up and let there ambitions be know","1,001 to 5,000",Seattle,Bellevue,WA,2016-11-14T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/8b39e000-c046-4ad8-afc7-12d5d6d94a37?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
