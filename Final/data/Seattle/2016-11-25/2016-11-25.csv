477,4419.0,Human Factors Research Scientist,Battelle Memorial Institute,4.0,165.0,"Provide overall office support to small group. Database maintenance.Work is exciting and meaningful. Staff members are friendly and confident. The safety culture is second to none. Management is helpful and cares about work life balance. The pay is good and the benefits are good as well.They were all amazing. Everyone there was very nice and gave me projects to work on, though sometimes it was a difficult seeking them out. I got to work long-term on a couple projects and short-term on a bunch of others, so I got to see a lot.They were also good with their culture - lots of intern events going on (from social to professional, like employee talks and lab tours), got to see a lot in a short period of time, was noted for my worth and not for my gender/ethnicity/sexuality/etc. Overall a great company to work for.Only downside was that it was a little slow to start. I had a project I was assigned to initially, but that didn't get started up until late in the summer. They were able to assign me to other projects, and my boss was very receptive to this/actively worked to get me on more projects, but it was a little frustrating.Great work environment, with excellent team members. Improved on management skills and interaction with workers. Increased awareness of Quality procedures and practice. Ensuring the workers are performing at a high standard. Working with the Army on Force Protection of the troops.Battelle promotes a healthy culture throughout their staff members. There are programs in place for you to attempt to lower your healthcare premium and a cafeteria with fresh cooked food and snacks. The benefits are much worse than other companies of this size as their primary focus is on income rather than employees.I worked at Battelle for 5 years.  I worked for a great RDML.  I enjoyed working there and doing what I did.  I was appreciated for my support and work.  I was allowed to continue with my volunteer work and also allowed to involve the organization.  I felt job security and the location was wonderful.  I was able to take subway, bus or drive my car.  The hours were flexible.  There really are family oriented and have great holiday parties.  The people are friendly and helpful.  There is also a possibility for advancement.  They will allow you to take classes and improve yourself and education while working.12 hour shifts, no paid lunch even while being required to wear PPE during your lunch. Management seems content in not answering employees questions and berating them for seeking guidance from corporate.I feel very disappointed that tons of American companies are unfriendly to international students. Battelle is one of them.A great company and great people.  Unfortunately, the position ended because Battelle was developing a product at Battelle's expense. The expectation was that another company, ID Quantique, wouldpurchase the product. Unfortunately, ID Quantique did not purchase the product.I worked as a contractor in a government facility and alot of the work enviroment was structured to that so I can not fairly rate the company as a whole.It is a very good place to work at. the only thing not good as a contractor is you do not get any Benefits. Management for the most part are friendly and very nice.job is challenging for various reasons1. lay offs 2. retireesleaving the ppl behind with lil knowledge of job dutiesHowever, it is a place where you learn a lot and grow within the company. Very competitive and passionate ppl work in this place.The overall mission of Battelle is great.  However, because of previous management/investment errors, the Business Services group of the company is in some disarray.Factory style work. Very little upward moving possibilities. Work life was alright and management was very understanding and accept short notice of absence.Great company , very employee oriented.. A non profit company that put all its earnings back into research and employee benifits.It's a very good job. The animals I worked with were the best. You just couldn't help but fall in love with each one of them.I was incredibly lucky to have such great co-workers. Staff are extremely talented, intelligent, have integrity, and are committed to providing quality work.Most enjoyable part of the job i had their was or team was like family.  I learned alot from the people i worked with and got to do alot of cool things.There have been a few organizational changes and scares, but overall this is a good place to work. People are friendly and there's a lot of perks to working here, including the onsite gym and cafeteria which houses guest vendors daily from outside of the restaurant. There seems to be a good opportunity for advancement both lateral and vertically.Flexible environment. Allowed for multiple off-site training sessions. Encouraged continued education.  Quiet environment allowed for Developed a Battelle specific schema based on DocBook using Altova XMLSpy for the vendor to validate documents against.Significant travel made this company more attractive when I was younger than now that I have a family.  Constantly need to keep selling yourself both internally and externally.","10,000+",Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-11-25T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/6bf39410-d9e2-4ea3-8402-6e6e31aacb17?mescoid=1700179001001&jobPosition=34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
