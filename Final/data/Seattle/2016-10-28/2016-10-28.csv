347,4289.0,Principal Data Scientist,Nordstrom,4.0,4200.0,"Love Working for Nordstrom, I love fashion and customer service, same office politics that hinder progress at any workplace.Great place to work! Nights and weekends are a must and holidays are hard to get time off. Sales goals are high but achievable and has a great environment for customers! I learned how to creat repeat customers, laid back sales techniques, giving five star service and teamwork excercises.Its a great place to work new company just opened new location. management could use work very new. I learned various new things there logistics has more things that i knew. The work staff was great everyone was fun and outgoing.Nordstrom was a wonderful company to work for! The management really cares about growing their associates into leaders if they see you are eager and willing to put in the work. It's a very fast paced work environment so be ready for your feet to hurt at the end of the day.Its very hard to have a set schedule for this type of job(Retail). Great company and great benefits. Hardest part of the job is not having a set schedule. My co-workers were great and overall I love this company.Nordstrom is a great company for EVERYONE. If you're a student looking a for extra money or if you're seeking a career with growth opportunities, Nordstrom has a place and position for you. I am so blessed to be apart of a company that feels like family. They are quick to take care of their employees just as quickly as they take care of their customers. I never feel like I don't have a voice. Also, because they have so many locations including their Rack division, opportunities exist all over the country and now in Canada as well. I've always felt well compensated since day one and the benefits have continued to grow in my almost 4 years with the company. I'm grateful.Everyone is like family and you can count on the staff to be right there with you. Service experience and training was awesome.I am so thankful for the experience I have develop while I have working at Nordstrom.  I have taken and have used alot of what I leaned in all the jobs I have held.  I will always be greatful.Very unorganized, definitely a place to start if you want to move to there corporate side in Seattle. Work is not rewarding and you job security depends on your ability to acquire new rewards members.Definitely a lot of favoritism, kind of like high school, if you suck up you move up not because you are amazing at what you do.  A lot of discrimination based on race.Great college job, minimum wage, competition for commission, nice coworkers, good managers, 20% employee discount, yummy food at the cafe, nice lunch room, good training.I was only a part-time employee and they still set-up a 401k for me. They had a great training program. They went out of their way to work with your schedule.The Nordstrom way is always make your customer feel at ease. Everyone works together to increase sales. Helping people find exactly what they want for that special occasion, and coming back for the nextNordstrom is a great company to work for. The typical work day was between 6am and 3pm. It was a very fast paced environment, you are always going to be on your feet and very busy. The stock support team was almost like family.clock in have fun selling and very competitive environment . fantastic management wants you to be as successful as you can be. great place to start learning retail . many opportunity for growth in company.This is partly due to the particular store I was in and the dreadful environment born due to the worst store manager I've ever experienced in my life. Favourtism, sexism, lack of support and a lack of positive acknowledgement were all prevalent on a day to day basic. Money isn't that great. They think bc they start you more than minimum wage they are better than other companies.I learned a lot in depth on how to give great customer service, they allowed me to express individual ideas when it comes to merchandise. Over all great to learn from in regards to selling and aiding people to have fashion.Large company but runs more like multiple small businesses so work-life balance and environment vary within the company.  My experience has been good. Overall good corporate culture and benefits.Nordstrom is a great corporation because they are committed to promoting talent from within and ensuring career advancement to top performers. Retail commission based sales positions are great for college students who need part time jobs that offer autonomy, flexible schedules, and a competitive and fast paced work environment, and Nordstrom is no exception!A normal day a t Nordstrom's starts with morning meeting, putting out any product from the nights  before truck. servicing the customer is the number one priority at NordstromYou always had the opportunity to grow within the company. Everyone was always very friendly and willing to work together as a team. Management was excellent.","10,000+",Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-10-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/c4dca55b-04bf-44db-83e1-7f29c9d892aa?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=9,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
