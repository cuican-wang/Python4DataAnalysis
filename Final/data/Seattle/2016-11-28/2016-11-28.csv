330,4272.0,Sr. Data Scientist,Expedia,3.9,320.0,"Great hours, very quick and easy to get through the day. They had fun games during break times and provided candy during the shift. Worked with several other college students - worth it!I used to love this job when I started as a Lodging Support Agent. After you've been there for a few months the cracks start showing. Management lacks expertise on everyday work tasks and one is forced to ask other peers for guidance and support. If you are able to reach one of the leadership positions then you'll have a bit more job security. Overall the place was fun to work with, good peers, more bad than good supervisors. Benefits are ok, but as far as receiving good travel benefits, then you're better off looking elsewhere.Over 250 employees lost their jobs to outsource overseas. I wish that would not have happened, I enjoyed coming into work and they were a great company to work for.Little that we knew at the time, they sent several employees from our call center to train call centers Philippines, El Salvadore and other countries. Not even two years later, they closed Flagship call center where Expedia all started in Tacoma, WA.This position has given me the most creative license in coaching and developing employees.  Expedia breeds a culture of working hard, but also being playful at work.  They are not afraid to try a new process, fail, learn and move on.Great place to work.  Great work and life balance and excellent benefits.Management were great and very diverse. They believed in having fun at the same time believed in taking care of business.Enjoyed working at Expedia. Very good work culture. Nice work-life balance. Pleasant working environment.Was able to learn new tools.I'd almost bet there is no better company than Expedia to work for. Their benefits , culture and work life come in second to none. Best company I've ever had the chance to work for. I will be back aboard at the first opportunity. Dream job for sure.Company has several struggles of running the office. The overall atmosphere is highly stressed, and no one talks about in fear of losing his/her job. Micromanagement is extremely high as well. There are good people there. Their benefits are wonderful.I loved working for Expedia, Inc. The workplace environment was as if I was spending the day with my family.  The benefits were great. The training was extensive and on going.Company provided wonderful training for new mortgage professionals as well as seasoned veterans. However the training doesn't provide you with the reality of the hard work you needed to put in.  You would need to provide your own book of business or cold call or network constantly in order to live because you have no salary or any kind of compensation even though you were required to be there between certain hours.I love my job. It is fun to be able to be apart of the guest experience. Management is awesome and so are the benefits. The most enjoyable part is being able to interact and meet new people from all over the world. A typical ay at work is answering the phones, guests questions, and planning their vacation.I did a 10 month contract at Expedia.  It was a great experience.  The team I worked with were fantastic. I respected the management who seemed genuinely interested in the development of their employees.  There were several programs to develop and grow their existing employees skills and career.It has as any other companies many pros and cons.Not bad office. Coffee, tea, clean water, snacks, mac book pro.Colleagues aren't that helpful (especially from different teams). Everybody are scared for their own job.Excellent place of employment. Able to use travel benefits to see the world and also learn many different levels to travellingFace-paced environment with good people to work with. Stand out individuals within the organization. Benefits and perks are great.Expedia is a wonderful company to work for. Great enviroment. Excellent benefits. The harder your work the more money you'll get paid.Pay is great and benefits are good, local HR and managers - not so much.  Other sites have free soda, free snacks, and even free beer IN THE OFFICE on a regular basis.  The Springfield site is very different, people have gotten fired for drinking in Springfield.I have been working in the customer service industry for almost 8 years and I found my experience at Expedia to be disheartening. Training was an absolute joke and the agents that are released to the floor are no where near ready to take calls. As a Tier 3 agent I feel we should have the  knowledge to perform our job duties, especially since we are dealing with  customers who have spent thousands of dollars. The lack of support from supervisors and leads is sad, they could careless if u fail or succeed until one of your actions cost the company money.  Proper training helps build any successful company's foundation and without it you'll find that your costing yourself a lot of money correcting employee mistakes.Expedia is great for work life balance. Its not fast paced like Amazon and people here tend to get into one position and never leave. You wont advance your career here much but if you want a comfortable job its a good place.great place to work as family center person. Balance work and family life. You will be sure to have time to accompany with your value family members. Also you can improve your skill set in this company.I've had a difficult time here at Expedia, which is opposite to my previous Corporate experience. Many of the people are great to work with, the overall culture is fantastic, but pay is low (comparatively) and advancement difficult for me to understand. Mgmt speaks to a ""work-life"" balance, but when I'm called as I'm entering the movie theater at night because they need something within the hour I don't much feel balanced.","5,001 to 10,000",Seattle,Bellevue,WA,2016-11-28T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/305ba0b1-700d-4acf-8488-cb5fbeb3788a?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=10,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
