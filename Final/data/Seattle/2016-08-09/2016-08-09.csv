The company makes an effort to encourage employees to meet with scientists and employees outside the group.  They encourage expose to all areas of research happening there.  There are many opportunities to listen to talks by visiting scientists.Allen institute is organized in industrial style aiming to do big scientific projects in brain science related field. Projects are initiated and monitored by scientific advisory board and committees, managed and executed internally by the management team.Learned the ins and outs of brain scienceRewarding as work will make a difference in long term brain scienceA typical day includes managing multiple projects through the Production pipeline, coordinating with resource managers to schedule core services, and interacting across departments to accomplish aggressive deadlines.  I've learned a lot over the years but the one comment made by my boss that has stood out over the years is: ""communication is all in the delivery"".  The hardest part about the job can be resolving conflicts between differing opinions in each department to accomplish a set goal, but in the end, respect and collaboration will get to the desired results.  And, the most enjoyable part of the job is definitely the people and having a great boss, without these two elements the motivation can be lacking.",,Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-08-09T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/c62660ba-ce00-4f13-bed2-70e7855b654b?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=22,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
