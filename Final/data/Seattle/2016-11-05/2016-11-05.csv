543,4485.0,Source Control and Stormwater Engineer (Environmental Engineer 5),Washington State,4.1,30.0,"The people are friendly and happy generally. Fun place to be. I work here as a freelance artist because it gives me a new look at business and companies that most do not get to see.I was to inspect the property, secure all entries and determine any damage. After this I was to place bids and repair damage to the home.Helping communities and individuals can be a very satisfying opportunity. Having the public questioning the value of government work is a constant stressor, as is the frequent uncertainty of each budget cycle.  Currently there is a focus on Lean management principles and responsible accountable practices which is a good trend.  People are very knowledgeable on a wide variety of things and there are opportunities to do project work to gain more experiences.Moving product in and out of warehouse, my co-workers were fun people to work with, some days were very fast paced, but at the end of the day I enjoyed it.The job was boring. The old saying that state workers take a 2 hour 1 hour lunch is pretty much true. It is hard to really get anything done due to all the red tape.As a trainer for Washington State I had the opportunity to set my own hours and develop my classes centered around my interests. I met a lot of people that enriched my life and helped me grow personally and professionally.Washington is a go and go state, always improving itself in some way or another.  Life is what you make it but this state helps improve it.It is a privilege to work for the WSDA. The work culture is serious about safety and keeping the department compliant with all safety standards.What a great bunch of people doing really interesting work.  I'm glad I had the opportunity to work there.  I learned a lot and am glad for the opportunity doing this kind of project.At this position I was able to utilize my talent in Sales and Marketing. I worked as a 1099 independent contractor for a major brokerage. I was responsible for developing and maintaining client relationships through marketing and referrals. I had to keep up to date on all the properties in my market and at what price point properties were selling. I used my negotiation skills to benefit my clients during each transaction. It was essential to follow each and every transaction through to final close. I kept up with my data base to grow my business. I enjoyed every aspect of this career.My day to day included making sure my client was happy and hopeful. I monitored overall health and medications and daily activities 24 hours a day at times. I worked alone most of the day and very long hours but at the end of the day it needed to be done and was worth it. The best part about doing this job is knowing my mom is being taken care of by someone i trust and know. Taking care of a cancer patient was the most difficult thing i have done to date but proud of how well i was told i did..Long days, great learning experience with many issues and interesting people. Learned a great deal about passing new and amending existing law...learned to be aware of unintended consequences of both. Built many valued and lasting relationships.I had a lot of fun working with company and the staff that I worked with it was sad to see the store close it was a big experience for meAs a property manager of twelve years in over 6 markets, I am eager to contribute my abilities and experience to a well established and progressive company.  Given my extensive experience in all phases of property management and my eye for financials, I believe I can help a company to achieve its mission and goals as a leader in the property management field.Through my career I have had the opportunity to work in a variety of markets with vastly different demographics.  I have established myself as an aggressive sales agent with a 90% closing rate, an effective manager managing large number of employees, and an expert at compliance and HUD housing projects.Opened and closed store when scheduled. Checked band deposit from previous night. Set up tills, re-counted safe, unlocked doors, turned on lights, Ready to begin day. Pulled bottles forward, faced all merchandise, filled empty spaces, greeted customers, assisted when needed. Supervised other clerks, and gave them duties to complete by the end of their shifts.I enjoy a fun and challenging job where the solution to problems are not always evident, yet the time frame for delivering the project does not change. The environment frequently requires unique approaches to project solutions.Noble mission.  The agency mission statement is ""Serving Those Who Served"", and they serve the veteran population.While working for Long Enterprises, LLC provided me with a myriadof experience from security monitoring through all the layers of running a business and record keeping.  I also wrote many reports onthe status security at many locations and countries.  We did not have a traditional work day and many times worked seven days a week.  I enjoy talking to people at work and always got along very well with co-workers and clients.The most important part of my consulting was meeting new peopleand seeing different parts of the world.I worked from my home and made my work schedule to my needs each week. I also traveled around the state everyday and met a lot of great people.There  were only 4 employes at the store  - you were required to work your shift - only 1 day off at a time with 2 days in a work week. This was my only problem with this position. I enjoyed working with the customers.Thoroughly enjoyed working for the State of WA. I was given an ample amount of autonomy with my daily duties. There is an abundance of opportunities to both educational and job advancement. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and clients. I would love the opportunity to work for the state again.",,Seattle,Bellevue,WA,2016-11-05T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/9bab7adb-9b8e-4767-93d7-a9ff62791952?mescoid=1700173001001&jobPosition=30,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
