System performance and uptime is 99.9.My experience at Boeing has formed and informed my life. Boeing is truly one of the best companies in the world - both to work for and to do business with. When I started, most schools were telling us to work for our first company for 3 to 5 years, then build a career somewhere else. Boeing is a large company that allows one to explore new products, innovate in existing products, and learn more about all aspects of the business. In my career, I have taken advantage of the opportunities to move, to grow in my capability, and to supplement my existing knowledge with academic and practical experience. Boeing is also active in the communities it serves. Boeing employees get out into the communities they live in and solve problems, quietly and effectively, on a practical level. This is what builds a strong company and great communities.I very much enjoyed working for Boeing the personnel were great to work with the management was good as well. The only bad side of my time at Boeing was that I was a contractor there and not an actual Boeing employee which left me with no job security and the knowledge that my job could be canceled at any time.Boeing had a great work/life balance as the company is older and doesn't expect you to be a wizard and live to work. Tech is older since the money is in making planes.This was probably the best job I've ever had I would love to still work here and hope to one day return. They had amazing training as well as support for families. They help with school and all sorts of other support.Great place to work, professional environment and great people.  Benefits are excellent, and many opportunities to advance and grow personally and professionally, really enjoyed my employment at Boeing.great pay for old timers and great benefits  not to good at advancing women and minorities. other than that it is a great place to work. the people are proud of what they build. and should be. they make a great plane. The job opportunity's are good . they hire people with no experience to highly qualified workers.Interesting blend of aerospace government and commercial programs.  Flexibility to move to numerous US and International locations.  Highly dedicated staff.I am constantly learning there is always something new to learn which I find challenging.  My co-workers and easy to get along with as I am the go-to person to schedule conference rooms and arranging travel as well as getting them scheduled on the Boss' calendar.  I am constantly multi tasking which I have become very good at managing my time and priorities.Boeing is a great company to work for. A great ride of course with the changing times comes a changing company.  Great at helping to get education. The boeing company is yhe fitureDaily support of network and workstation printers.  Supplied technical and customer service support by phone and in person.Install new equipment at customer sites as required Install upgrades, firmware and consumablesManage customer relationships to ensure highest satisfactionDeveloped and maintained positive customer relationships.Maintained records and logs of all service performed and with details of customer's concerns and requestsBoeing was a great company and took very good care of their employees.  With continued education always available to you. A great benefit package and great working environment.Great rewarding job. Being deployed to hostile locations and contributing to the war on terrorism is very rewarding. I learned that you never stop learning about the aircraft. The hardest part of the job is being away from family during holidays while on deployment. Managers were always there for morale and management decisions that were best for the company and me as an Field Service Representative. The most enjoyable part of the day is knowing that you contributed to the units aircraft readiness.A typically day at work included start up safety meeting for job assignments for the day. Meet the required credit hours to preform job duties in required time to meet budget. My coworkers were encouraging and helpful on team base concepts. The most enjoyable part of the job was competing with other teams for budget recognition.after the last contract extension and loss of the defined pension, it is not the same company it was 5 years ago when i started.Boeing/McDonnell Douglas has provided me numerous opportunities for growth and development over the last 30 years. Boeing's benefit package has been a blessing over the years. I appreciate every opportunity I have been provided and the benefits that I have had while raising my children, who are now successful adults with their own families.Excellent Company and Good Benefits.  The managers are very skilled and the engineers are very passionate about the job.One of the most rewarding jobs I have ever had. I was able to interact with the astronauts as well as inspect all hardware that flew into space via the Space Shuttle.Excellent place to work. All around great. Loved the cafeteria and the  other employees. Great union. Very fun workplace. Renton washington was nice place to live.Laid off after 31 years. I'm grateful for the opportunity. they moved my job to Oklahoma, which is what happened to my basketball team as well. One day I'll figure out why it is that Oklahoma has it out for me.Work is not very technical. Really laid back. Management can be something else at times. Would look elsewhere if you are looking for EE work. Benefits are pretty good too.","10,000+",Seattle,Bellevue,WA,2016-11-22T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/ba8333e1-0bee-45fc-9a78-b5a1dec60c9e?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=12,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
