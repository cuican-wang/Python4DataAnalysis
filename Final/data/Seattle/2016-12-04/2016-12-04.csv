21,3963.0,Data Scientist (Natural Language Processing),Xerox Corporation,3.4,7900.0,"Organization that values diversity but can be very slow and bureaucratic when it comes to making decisions. I worked with many good people during my career by continual downsizing has had impact on work environment.Most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with the people I support and fixing technical issues they have.Worst parts...Labor reductions at the lowest levels while upper management continues to create new management positions to alleviate their workload.  Tight spending controls.Outdated and out-of-service IT infrastructure.  Understaffed with few advancement opportunities.Underpaid by Xerox standards, grossly underpaid by State averages.Expensive/poor healthcareGood management, but a rather limited traditional work culture.  Business oriented, segmented work place.  The culture appeared fragmented.  Some areas/ divisions were singularly focused on narrow tasked based, goal oriented accomplishments, while others areas offered a more open environment. This was probably due to the old business genesis of the copier business.  However Xerox is known for their technical inventions.  They were the original creator of the window based graphical operating system made famous by apple and Micorsoft.  They invented the ""mouse"", as well as modern computer networking.  They are also know for having started more startups by former employee's than any other business.  Good people with unimaginative management.When I say 12 dollars, I mean it. That's all you will make. Unless you make friends with someone in management, then you can get some side deals where they add hours to your check. There is no advancement and no raises. It's almost impossible to get fired so everyone works (or doesn't work) as much as they want. People show up whenever they feel like it and everyone else has to suffer.If you are one of the few that believes in pulling your own weight, management will take advantage of you, and you will be pulling everyone else's weight too.You will be promised the moon and given nothing.Nepotism Trump's merit.It was the worst 10 months ever. I was mad everyday and it raised my blood pressure. I didnt enjoy working there. The management is a joke and turn around rate is outrageous. If they stop feeding the new hires pizza and donuts everyweek to cover up lies and deception that this place was a good place to work, maybe just maybe they could keep their other employees happy. Stop worrying about my starbucks cup on my desk and pay me more for the under appreciated work i am doing instead of worrying about petty things. Run a functional business and not this horrendous storm you call a business opportunity.A typical workday / call flow was moderate, I learned a lot about payroll and benefits. Management could have been a bit better about being knowledgeable and the co workers were great and helpful. The hardest part of the job was when the call flow increased and i still had other admin duties to attend. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers and co workers. There was no room for advancement; the were no raises or bonuses; management was not very knowledgeable; the attendance policy was not great; benefits could have been a lot better, and training was not good at all. Everything that you learn you had to learn on your own or through co workers.Xerox is a great place to work. They provide many benefits to enrich the work lives of employees. Company training is plentiful so that career advancement is possible. Expectations are set to allow employees to work toward specific goals and objectives. Performance issues are dealt with in a way that allow a struggling employee the change to correct the problem and management offers assistance. Pay is fair, employees are rewarded if the expectations are met or exceeded. Benefits are very good. A very professional and fair work environment.The work day is steady with filling customer orders, fixing paper jams, and stocking supplies. If you are a good worker who does above and beyond for customers, they will show more appreciation than my coworkers. I was an employee with Xerox a year and about to get a pay raise when they fired me for no reason. I learned later I got hired so a managers friend could work there. For this I can't recommend this company to anyone looking for job security or an advancement in their career.Xerox will hire anyone and they usually let the good ones walk. They do not give raises for any reason. They promise advancement in the company, yet can't make up their mind on what they are going to do. I've seen people go through training to get higher in the company and that training completely come to a halt. We get promised bonuses and commissions but never receive them. Management is usually of hiding in a bathroom or their vehicle or the break room and sometimes even in the back of the empty cubicles playing in their phones, of which aren't even allowed the floor. The stress caused by the company is far worse than that of what customers for Verizon could ever put us through.Xerox has a well rounded management staff and offers a level compensation package. While also proving to be an equal opportunity employer allowing employees to interview and relocate to other positions in the company.However the ability to receive raises in regards to knowledge and experience obtained is a short shot at best.Very poor management. Employees not accredited for their work. Harassing work environment. Overall, the job itself was enjoyable and interesting on a day to day basis, but management made the position not enjoyable at all. Management only focused on the negative portion of the job. Very little praise and/or credit was given to any employeeWorked there for 4 years for decent wage, other than that its one of the worst companies you can work for. The management is unprofessional and are incompetent. They have favorites and those can get away with anything. The rest are treated like dirt. They also seem to hire all the bottom feeders that no one else would hire, not even Walmart. Stay away if you can.Every morning we will do quality control on all bank levies. Once it hit 10 am, we will then start our deposits for all the banks. we send our checks electronically as an image cash letter to nine banks. when this is completed, we will then work on all reject checks and return it back to remitter. At the end of each day we will reconcile and balance into an excel spread sheet.I have worked for this company on two occasions and my expectation was higher the second time around. The company has a high attrition rate due to job dissatisfaction and low compensation.A typical day at work is very stressful because there are client and employee needs which requires undivided attention, so it make the work day extensive.I have learned about time management and had the best attendance rate for my team, which went unrecognized.The hardest part of the job is keeping everyone happy at the same time and the most enjoyable part of the job was training and coaching a great team to exceed expectations.Xerox values the contributions of it's employees. The listen and have good compensation; both monetary and nonmonetary.  The management team is great to work with on all levels.  The team atmosphere keeps everyone dedicated to their jobs and contributes to a very pleasant, yet stressful at times, environment.I came from a company that compensated their employees well. When I came here, I was shocked at the salary. After all, Xerox is a well known global company. I'm trying to give constructive criticism. I don't see how people or families survive on the salary. The pool time needs to be revamped. People need ample time off, come back to work & feel good about it. I hope someone from the company takes a look at pool time. I really enjoyed meeting & working with the people. My co-workers are great & helpful. Everyone is nice, including Management. If Xerox is going to make changes, they have to pay their employees and revamp their benefit package. Why should someone wait a whole year to get matched by the 401K Plan? I hope this helps!I've been working at the company from 2011 till 2016.  The upper management at Xerox seems interested in doing their best to sustain the workforce and came out with a Call Center of the Future model which included getting rid of desk phones and replacing them with Avaya software and improving the break room as well as installing large flat screen TV's on the call center floor.The best part of the job is building friendships with those you work with and being able to positively impact the lives of thousands of clients.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with an extremely high call volume during certain times of the year.  It is no fun getting back to back calls with no breaks in between calls and just being over-worked in general.If you are a high school graduate looking for your first job this is a good job for you. It has decent benefits and the pay is one dollar above Taco Bell. However, management is very unprofessional. It is extremely hard to promote. Its almost like being in high school again. The job demands are great and it can be frustrating being so worked with so little pay. No holidays off. I even had to work Christmas day without holiday pay. With over 500 employees one is easily recycled until the next individual comes along. Good for a first job, but definitely not a career.Very layed back easy work. Management has their days. Poor communication skills, and employee courtesy. Most employees are in their very early 20's and have a lack of work ethic. Hardest part of the job would probably be when the machine is not working correctly. They do not have many incentives. NO raises or any kind of employee appreciation except pizza delivered maybe once a month.It was chaotic, high turn over and most of management looked through you or at worse at you as a number not a person. High stress environment and don't expect them to remember who you are. When I left the company they screwed up on either A. sending the message along or B. Mistook me with another employee, as they had me marked down as having left 3 days after I actually quit. When I went for unemployment and the unemployment group called them, they DID mix me up with another employee and got my benefits denied as a result.The only good thing at the company was the pay was above average and the health insurance was good and not expensive.The DVP that I reported to as well as our RVP were to great leaders whom I learned a lot from because the kept feeding an employee who wanted to do more.   I managed business in 5 call centers, 4 US, 1 in Canada.  I also managed a global work force management team. I was reasonable for the budget creation and P&L of my client portfolio.  The only reason I left was at the time I had two young children at home and I was missing too much of their lives.  It was one of the toughest decisions I have had to make in my call center career.","10,000+",Seattle,Redmond,WA,2016-12-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/5a6aa69f-2d40-4c3e-9971-ea06a0e16f50?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

System performance and uptime is 99.9.Compensation:Salary is middle to slightly below market value. Health plan is acceptable as a single person and is wonderful for employees with a family (family partial inclusion in plan). Depending on location and type of work, advancement is either slow or nearly impossible. Culture:Relaxed and slow-paced with intermitting rushes. Company tries to modernize in technology and mentality. Minimal sexism, racism, elitism; however, noticeable ageism. Younger (1-10 yrs) sometimes viewed as severely inexperienced or incompetent, more so than justified. Management: Variable depending on position. However, a noticeable aspect about some of the managers is that they put an extensive amount of energy into pleasing upper level management; so much so that their leadership roles take a toll. Lifestyle:40-45 per week is typical in most non-management positions. Most have paid overtime.Best company wage wise.   Management does not know how to manage people. They have taken all incentives away from us. They tell us lies about a union and workers on the floor just don't care anymore.  It's just a job now.  Nothing special.We really need a union, for wages, benefits and our future to take care of our families.  All they care about is the numbers game.They are willing to bring in union buster people for months and pay them and put advertising on radio and tv to stop the union.  Then they throw a big party for the management for a job well done.   They could have given us a raise with the money they spent on the campaign to stop the union.Now management treats us very poorly. They have the edge to fire us if we don't do what they say.  Bad situation for everybody.Wish I never would have taken this job 5yrs ago.Keeping a globally distributed, non-standard infrastructure available with minimal down time takes many hands. Management either rotates or changes every few years which made career success a moving target. Co-workers tend to be close knit, even to the point of being like family, which makes departures very hard on morale. The allure of short term cost for outsourcing critical functions seems to blind managers to the loss of control, quality and reputation of the IT department. Rebuilding the IT department from the ground up may be the only way to keep it from collapsing in upon itself.The most enjoyable part of the job was greeting new people to the team, making them feel welcome and valued; the hardest part was watching them all leave, mostly involuntarily.My days at Boeing are filled from start to end with challenges. I have learned patience, time management, how to work with different types of individuals and how to focus on customer satisfaction. I find myself having such a heavy workload that I have little if no free time for family and personal growth. I enjoy seeing my team grow into a organized and proficient unit. I have had the luxury of meeting many helpful managers, HR, management support, and co-workers, and I have learned so much from them.The quantity of work is dismal. It used to be thriving but has significantly dwindled since the contract has changed hands. The management gives no consideration for it's employees' well being. They hide behind the shroud of a government contract, blaming its literature for the severe lack of fringe benefits. Pays it's employees the absolute bare minimum as mandated by the US Government.  No performance raises, ever.Boeing (IT specifically) is a good place to launch a career, but don't count on advancing even if you are walking on water. Too much bureaucracy in management will stifle your growth. On the flipside, if you are a minimum effort type of employee, Boeing IT is a great place to work. You will be compensated the same as the guy next to you pulling all your weight!I'm salaried, work in an office.I don't want to come in to work. I've been here for 10 years and I think I get treated worse every year. The managers are more interested in doing what their boss tells them then growing their people.If you suck up and find the right ""mentor"" (read executive cheerleader) you'll do great. If you have opinions and share them (I've seen people share them well and people share them poorly; all with the same results) then you are labeled a troublemaker.After 4 years in a role, I went from the minimum pay at 0.75 of market reference to 0.80 of market reference. My job duties are insulting. There are no growth opportunities to speak of.Just nod your head and back away slowlyGreat company with lots of opportunities.  Great benefits.  The most enjoyable part of the job is solving the most complex issues and opportunity to work with the brightest individuals and be part of the aerospace and defense industry that connect and protect the world. Boeing Management CEO and CIO are top notch.  Typical day at work includes working on the most complex issues in Information Technology with a great team!   Challenges are frequent layoffs, and hard to get a promotion at senior levels due to high number of senior team members.I am a young, intelligent, hard-working communication professional. I was at Boeing for almost a year, and I have been thoroughly traumatized by my experience. There are many, many corrupt, unethical, incompetent first-level managers it's astonishing. I was bullied by management and unfairly treated. I developed extreme anxiety and depression as a result. I did not feel safe at Boeing.The company is disgustingly regressive and bureaucratic. It's policies and practices are very outdated and make no sense. Boeing is not evolving. They will not last at this rate.What I have outlined is just the tip of the iceberg as I am not willing to spend any more time, thought or energy into The Boeing Company, other than the all of 5 minutes I spent crafting this review.Executive-level calendaring • Compose correspondence based on subject matter and awareness of executive's business priorities • Appropriately fields calls and requests to determine necessary action • Facilitate business conferences, team meetings and events • Track action items and distributes them based on commitments and deadlines and process travel expense reports.Worked on a 6 month contract as a Project Manager. The work was very interesting and important to making Boeing more competitive. The company and the people working for the company are very talented. My advice to senior leadership: There are too many levels of management in the organizational chart and a culture of ""consensus decision making"" which makes it difficult to implement necessary change.The company provides outstanding benefits, to include tuition assistance, paid training, health care, and a fair salary.  However, the culture of the business leadership is generally unwelcoming to new ideas to cut cost and increase profitability.  The multiple layers of management typically act as a filter, leaving most good ideas from employees on the desk of a mid-level manager somewhere, decaying before it can reach someone capable of funding the idea.Overall Boeing is a good company to work for.  They have recently hired a lot of younger people and let the more experienced employees go.  They have great benefits, opportunity to move around the Company doing different jobs.  They have a great educational benefit.I loved the work.  There was just too much of it.  The jobs are extremely stressful.  There is little work life balance.On a cost-plus USG contract, it was Boeings upper level management advising Project Managers to do construction projects incorrectly and utilize inexperienced and cheaper Project Managers who would process change orders and think this was a good thing, as these same Boeing upper level managers terminated all the older and much more experienced but more expensive Project Managers who would save the government customer time and money on these projects. The individual Project Manager salary, if reduced allowed Boeing to keep the delta.The Boeing company cares about its employees and provides great benefit and healthcare. Also, the salary is wonderful. Boeing culture is deeply strong and long lasting. I would work for this company again, if the opportunity is present itself again.I enjoyed my life when working with such an awesome company.  It came to a stand still when there was no room to advance in my field.  It is almost impossible to change fields unless you know the right people and get the right support from your direct manager.  They have to fight for you to do anything different than what you were hired to do.  And some are not sure what that is when it comes to Staff Analysts.  Yes you can have a manager that doesn't know how to manage you. They do great with the engineers but for administrative personnel they are lost.  So you have to make it your business to not get comfortable and try your best to move around the company so you can learn new skills and have longevity in your skill code or advance to another skill code.For the money that they pay, this is a very easy job to do.  With the training they give you, and the teammates around you, the work is clean, simple, and the workers are generally compensated well for their time.  That being said, there are management issues.  there are some excellent managers there, but they seem to outnumbered by mediocre or outright bad ones.  And the managers are rotated periodically among the teams, so an employee is not stuck with a given manager.  But you never know what manager you will get next.  might be good, might be someone trying to make their name and now they have a whole new team of people they don't know anything about.I was with the Boeing company for over 10 years.  It is a great place to work and grow, but it is hard to advance in certain areas or to even get employed with the company.  But once you are employed you do have access to a great deal of knowledge and training.  The downside about working for Boeing is job security.  Whenever there is a change in management there is almost always a layoff or a tightening of budget, that's just the nature of the beast.Labored, but productive depending on where you were working on the airplane.I learned that the union has a big influence on how things can be ran on the production floor.Management varies depending how long they have been in the position and if they are trying to make a war with the union.Co-workers are ok as long as they aren't pushed too hard by management. Retaliation is a big issue in this environment.No team work. You are left to sink or swim on your own. No help for team mates if you are verbal about the union in any way.Being able to work with my hands and getting some of my team mates to work together to meet requirements.Boeing has given my family a great lifestyle, and of course a great income with benefits. I personally have been evolved in programs starting building new tool for the 757 & 767. Worked 707, 727, & 757 which are not being made now. I work all commercial aircraft in Boeing great line of products. I've also work military project B2, space station, AWACS , one shop I work in built the Lunar dune buggy. Which is still on the moon. During two layoffs I had job such as white river bus driver, & manufactured home warranty repairman. I have other experience such as street maintinence in Tacoma. Auto service work for Tacoma police, & small engine repair.","10,000+",Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-12-04T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/f0b35830-00e3-400f-bc81-192c7e692ec4?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
