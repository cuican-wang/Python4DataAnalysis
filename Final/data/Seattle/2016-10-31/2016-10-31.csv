As the atmosphere, environment is excellent.               my team was working hard share the knowledge on project during meeting and working on code specially.Communication is lacking in certain departments. Exponential growth of employees. Great benefits for full time employees.Great medical benefits. Company provides employees with various amenities. Start up company. Needs processes and procedures to help organize the company.Best place I have ever seen to work. Best work life balance. supportive environmentFree lunch is best thing they are providing. Management team behave like normal employee, so work together with every single employee.It's a very exciting workplace! In true start-up fashion, there's always a fire put out somewhere, but the culture thrives on the set pace. The culture in general is good and is being maintained fairly well for how fast we've grown and are growing. Change does happen, albeit slowly. There's also free food, massages, beer bashes, and GREAT health benefits!I spent a lot of my day cold calling and prospecting, it was a hard job but very rewarding. My team is very supportive and I enjoy my job.Friendly teams and good life-work balance. Been a pleasure working here and getting to know the product.I learned about the product and how each of contributes to the product and also how it helps other businesses.Love working with Nutanix. Great company, great culture. Drive is a bit much, going from Raleigh to Durham every day is exhausting.","1,001 to 5,000",Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-10-31T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/dde78ed8-d926-4589-a8fb-23181a7e312b?mescoid=1500127001001&jobPosition=31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
