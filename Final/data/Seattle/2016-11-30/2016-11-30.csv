325,4267.0,Data Scientist - Entry level,Kforce,3.7,554.0,"They kept me busy with contract work and the pay was pretty good.Great employer and co-workers that create a true team atmosphere. Management not only lead, but helped broaden my experience and develop my pricing analysis skills.Management doesn't care if you fail or succeed they will allow you to continue to fail without any proper training and then blame it all on you. people get fired left and right so your job security it shaky. you won't advance unless you completely suck up, which isn't my style. your coworkers are pretty chill and laid back but its all sales and competitive so watch out for the snakes. in the sales role they tell you to be out of the office and bringing in new business 3/5 days of the week and then complain you weren't in the office at all. commission ladder is completely whack. all this place wants to do is have a million meetings verses letting you actually work.Not the company it once was. Over the last few years Kforce has undergone a lot of change to make the company more profitable but not organically. The company is not able to obtain organic growth so they tweak comp plans, set new rules around splits that benefit the house, and focus to much on taking from instead of investing in. When you start to do things like this, you have issues with keeping talent. Kforce loses a LOT of talent to competitors and larger tech companies because they simply pay better. These tactics to push stock prices up help no one in the long run. Recent restructuring was an attempt to shake things up as the company was not achieving growth and has been quite flat over the last 3 years. It was also an attempted to thin the herd and pay less salaries at middle and upper management. Pockets of the company find success but it's counter balanced by other markets. They are starting to talk about reinvesting back into their company and employees, finally, but it was a shaky promise. Time will tell if they deliver.Kforce is a great place to START your staffing career. You can get great training and some of the local management is outstanding. But this is not where you will stay long term. New upper management across the markets has a ""my way or the highway"" approach. You may have the chance to work with great people, but it will be short lived.I gave Compensation 4 out of 5 starts ONLY because I was on a plan they no longer offered. Their new comp plan would have paid about 15% less. Culture for where I worked locally was great until about the last  more... 3 months of employment with them.  lessI had zero training for the actual job that I was doing. It was your basic boiler room. I would basically build call logs and call people for jobs all day.There is a cliquish environment.  The hours and work expectations are unrealistic.  Very numbers driven.  Not a great place to work if you are looking for a real team environment.A very tough environment. Management was tough to adjust to. Attrition occurred every month. It was tough but I ended up pulling through and found myself successful.Kforce is a good place to work.  The people are very friendly and look out for you.  They are a contracting company though so you will work for another company.The company is big enough that they will give you enough time to ramp up.  The company does not provide enough training if new but they do give you enough time to be able to succeed.My account manager was very good and helped me with the job transition. it was a short contract. this was the end of a data center move and they decided to close down the data center and end the contract.kforce is a staffing agency. great one at that.where they placed me for an assignment was not. the name of the company is Related Management. the manager in that facility is horrible!!! working with hitler every day.Working with banks to collect invoices.  Nice company, friendly co-workers.  Busy work environment. Clean office cubicle work space.  Area was a bit noisy.Management was engaged and cared about how the employee was doing. Management was frequently in contact to ensure everything was up to standards and needs were being met.awesome company, but its a big grind. Get ready to work 55 hours a week.Learned a lot- from my managers, typical day 8am- 630pm... but you always have to answer emails at all hours. LOVE my coworkersThe culture at Kforce was great- our team got along very well, and often went out for drinks together after work.  That being said, some work could be done to improve the commission structure and management.  As someone who had limited experience coming in, I did not find management particularly helpful, and training was limited to online workshops that covered only the bare minimum.  Because of this, it was difficult to develop the skills necessary to climb the commission ladder.Too many managers that micro-manage.  You have 5 different bosses who all have a different objective.  Make sure to produce numbers quickly or you wont be here long/Kforce is a fantastic place to start in recruitment. The headquarters in Tampa, FL is an amazing organization. The environment forces you to work hard, but they are great at injecting breaks with activities where the whole team participates. The training and education is a continuously evolving and ongoing. Internal promotions are constantly happening in the organization which is nice to see firsthand.Kforce is a great environment when you work with the right people. There is potential to make tons of money, but you have to be ready to devote 60 hrs a week.Management is very clueless. Support and training is none existence. Enjoyed most of my co-workers. The work was easy but required better training to complete. correctly. Management on site was nonexistence, did not come in or only for part of the day.I would report to the store that was on schedule . Than I would clock in and go find the manager of the department that I was going to work in. I would let them know that I was there to Help their associate in this department.  This job was taking care of flowers and setting them up for display.  Than making sure all plants were watered. Taking plants down if they needed to be tossed or marked down.I enjoyed my position in this job. Enjoyed the people I worked with. I  enjoyed interacting with the customers.KForce was my contract company that contracted me to General Motors (GM). Typical work day: - very busy working with the Technicians on vehicle issues. Or testing Electronic Control Units (ECU) on the bench.- learn much about General motors vehicle operating systems.- the Management was Ok- most co-workers were knowledgeable and great to work with- the hardest part of the job – in the beginning learning GM’s acronyms - the most enjoyable part was testing and troubleshooting ECU's on the vehicle benches","1,001 to 5,000",Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-11-30T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/93be3cca-3ebf-4243-bc77-1382cf882229?mescoid=1500152001001&jobPosition=5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

577,4519.0,Engineer I (Stormwater Inventory Specialist),King County Sheriff's Office,4.1,7.0,"Overall the King County Sheriff's Office (KCSO) is a good place to work with many benefits and job security. However, working as a 9-1-1 operator the culture was entirely different with more time spent at work than at home. There is no room for advancement once one becomes a dispatcher. Periodically a supervisor job will come up and that is rare and not available to those that just take calls. Management is under a lot of pressure and trickles down to dispatchers and call receivers and adds to an already stressful environment. The Records department is entirely different with a laid back atmosphere in a high paced environment that allows a balance between home and work. All the co-workers in 9-1-1 are A personalities and such many clashes occur. There culture here will not be found anywhere else and is a very negative environment.Coworkers are great.  Working for the Sheriff's office makes you feel like you are part of something meaningful.It is not an easy process to get any internship including lie detector test but I had great co-workers willing to teach me and help me with any issues that I did not know how to handle.We are the first person people in crisis speak to.  Developing rapport and keeping the caller calm is essential to get all of the pertinent information that the officer needs, starting with location.  Once a call is entered it is sent to the radio dispatcher who assigns officers who are available to provide public safety.  We work as individuals yet are one.  This is a very rewarding, yet thankless job.  The public doesn't realize the amount of stress we deal with on a daily basis to ensure that we are providing them with the correct medical, fire, or police response needed.  At the end of the day, the I leave my stresses of my job at the office doors feeling a sense of rewarding accomplishment for my days service.King County is a great place to work but the Sheriff side was not for me or my family. I was switching between to many trainers for the short time that I was with them.Police work has many levels, and working for the King County Sheriff's Office has been the best experience I have ever had.I had great sgts. to work for they were all very supportive in the cases I handled.",,Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-11-30T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/1d3d4f17-b376-4b64-8211-e0eafd76b638?mescoid=1700173001001&jobPosition=30,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
