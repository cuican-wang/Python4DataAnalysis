78,4020.0,"Associate Scientist II, Biomarkers-Seattle","Gilead Sciences, Inc.",3.8,76.0,"Its a good company to work. It enhanced all my skills and also the management was very friendly. I love working in this environment. The colleagues were very encouraging.Working at Gilead is an great experience getting to know people through different departments. Sometimes  a day can be very busy to a calm day like on a Friday.  Lastly enjoying the happy hour on Friday and just catch up with your friends at work.  It something good to feel about coming to work everyday.A typical day at work is a mixed bag of  lulls and a deluge of challenging tasks.What I've learned is to expect anything.Management is autocratic; this is unfortunately consistent with the industry, and shows no signs of abating.Co-workers are on edge, most are contractors and are pre-occupied with job security.Hardest/unpleasant part of the job is that communication style from management is uni directional.Most enjoyable part of the job thus far is the cafeteria, If I'm being hones. But I'm fairly new so there is hopefully room for that to change.Great place to learn. Lot of cross-functional exposure. Good management. Great co-workers. very busy place. Can keep you working for ever. More work less fun though.The most discouraging place I ever worked, A company chock full of individuals that are not collaborating, and encourage a trickle down system of information.A telephone game of long hours, on call, and pour treatment.My supervisor once told me that a coworker could not be sleeping on the job, he was "" A good Christian Brother"" and this was just another day on the job! This place is terrible.Company runs very lean and IT management is not mature to operate under lean workload. No employee reward, management is disconnected with individual contributors.I was originally brought on as a Front-End Developer, however after working with management and assessing user needs based on UX analysis methods it was clearly evident that the current UI wasn't addressing the complex user needs. Gradually my position transitioned to redesigning the UI and conducting UX design research to gather data.Overall my experience was great! I had the opportunity to work with and learn from talented and seasoned developers. A typical day would consist of brief in depth meetings to assess daily workloads & how to implement and leverage technologies such as Angular JS, JAVA, javascript libraries, UI design sprints and timelines.The benefits and stock options here are great but the company culture and work life balance are pretty bad. Most employees are doing the work of 3 people and it is impossible to work just a normal 8 hours day. The workload is not only heavy but very demanding as alot of the work is very urgent. The political nature of this company doesn't allow for quick progress unless a manager personally likes you. Promotions aren't based off of what you know or the work you put in, but instead on if that manager wants you to be promoted or likes you enough to do it.Fast paced environment, excellent team and stable product pipeline. Access to the latest recruiting tools and technology and a sense of team support that is positive and geared towards learning.Great company with outstanding product line.  Very ethical.  Outstanding leadership team and winning corporate culture.  I no longer work there, but often wish I still did.Best place to work i loved working over there all employeeres are friendly. management was excellent. The best part of my job is My team. I am so fortunate to be part of a team that, despite everyoneâ€™s differences and eccentricities, manages to make every day at work seem like an episode of tosh.0.fast paced environment, high expectations, not enough work life balance, no WFH policy, different rules for different folks, not enough focus on employee development from managers due to pace of organization (managers themselves are swamped, and don't always know or have patience to understand employee's needs),  not always objective, emphasis  how one's image is portrayed to the team rather than collaborative approach of working together towards common goal, significant turn-over within organizationNice very expensive cars all across the campus.Really bad culture that claims "" it all about the science"" when in reality its all about the profit. Need a new CFO ASAP.Oracle EBS Functional and Technical.Good Job Culture.Participated in all Design phases of this project.Learned more anout OPM and had adapted to different project reuirements,We have a team size of 5 with developers and Functional consultants.The harderst part of the job is to meet the complex req's which are solely in OPM .The most enjoyable part of the job is despite stringent deadline we could meet all the req's and development with minor issues during Golive.The people and policies reflect a culture that is toxic to professionals. Asking questions is prohibited and career advancement is at the expense of personal dignityI learned a great deal about clinical research conduct within the US and globally.  I had the opportunity to work with a great individuals who shared their wealth of knowledge and support for my growth and progression.Depending on the division your in makes a difference in the job culture you are subjected to.  IHD is the red headed step child of the organization and is treated poorly.  Minimal support for Managed Care Contracting.Gilead was a great work experience for me, especially as my first major company. Management not only managed, but also did a good portion of the work which made myself and fellow employees feel as though it was a team effort. There were definitely opportunities for advancement and the compensation was good.Not a place to go to develop in a role. You are on your own. There is a very negative company culture that applauds over working until the point of burn out.There is essentially no work-life balance  and they can care less about your well being and your family. All they care about is making money. ""For the love of money is the root of all evil!"" Gilead demands you to work untill they tell you to go home. I'm not joking here, I slept in my car after working back to back 15-20 hour shifts. I have the many time card printouts to prove it! Gilead clams this is the best package you can find. Well these people haven't worked anywhere else in alot of years, they are inexperienced in what is offered out there now a days. What good is having benefits when you cant even take time off to go to the dentist or doctors because if your not at work your missing deadlines which hold up production which equals loss of money. This place is cancerous and I was out of there before that cancer killed my relationship with my family. You can make money anywhere, this place is not the only place in the world to make a great living in. If you care about your family and your well being look for employment elsewhere. If you just care about making money this is a place for you. But let me tell you all the money in the world cant buy happiness.A lot of one-on-one opportunities to really talk about your goals, your future, and also the future and state of the company itself.","5,001 to 10,000",Seattle,Seattle,WA,2016-11-10T12:00,http://jobview.monster.com/associate-scientist-ii-biomarkers-seattle-job-seattle-wa-us-175840409.aspx?mescoid=1900267001001&jobPosition=1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
