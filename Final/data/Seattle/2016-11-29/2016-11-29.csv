31,3973.0,Biomedical Assistant/Phlebotomist,PlasmaLab International,2.0,1.0,"Most co-workers are great - with the exception of one person that has caused several great people to quit because of their actions toward them and management ignores this problem (even when confronted with the reason these people are leaving).  Management refuses to let this person go, even though this person causes a lot of problems with co-workers.  Management does not take responsibility for problems caused by them (management) or others around them.  Seems like management does not really want to be there any more, but keeps going even though they are not actively promoting the companies products as they should.  The fate of this company is uncertain because of the managements lack of interest in promoting the company products.",,Seattle,Everett,WA,2016-11-29T05:10,http://jobview.monster.com/biomedical-assistant-phlebotomist-job-everett-wa-us-176853291.aspx?jobPosition=5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
