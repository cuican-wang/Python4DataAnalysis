871,4813.0,GIS Analyst I,City of Renton,4.4,5.0,"Managed daily customer transactions, collecting money for greens fees, driving range, and merchandise. I learned time management, communication skills, handling difficult customers, and learned what it is like to work in the customer service industry. Positive relationship with co-workers, boss, and upper management.Was a great summer job and liked my co-workers.  Learned a lot about customer service and dealing with the public.  Loved working outside everyday.A great place to work, and although it's only summer seasonal, I worked there for 8 seasons. Regular communication with customers and their needs kept me on my toes, but a reliable team helped alleviate the regular stressful burdens that came with a very busy environment. Typically would work either 4 or 8 hours days, perhaps longer, depending upon staffing needs.My mornings with the City begin with meetings and planning. Normally on Monday mornings, I review the weekly schedule with my fellow directors, and assign duties to the recreation staff; the staff will then follow the given directions. For the past seven years, my time with the City of Renton has been quite the learning experience. I have gained experience through growth and management responsibilities. All in all, this job has provided me with a skills set that I can apply in my future career.The positions I held had the caviat of ""opther duites as assigned"". I was in a non-union, management positon so if it took all night... the job still got done. It was a very hectic pace, but I found that I thrived in that environment. I was able to accommodate for anything that was tossed at me and succeeded in each task well beyond hopes or expecttionsof supervisors.",,Seattle,Renton,WA,2016-10-08T12:00,http://job-openings.monster.com/monster/193a89ce-ae44-48ad-8629-e89bfb7af8e9?mescoid=1500140001001&jobPosition=14,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
