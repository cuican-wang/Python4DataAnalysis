# INFO7374 18218 Data Analysis Using Python - Fall 2016 #
## Final Project - Exploration of Data Scientist Jobs ##
This project is mainly about Data Scientist Jobs:

1. Data is web scraped from Monster.com and Indeed.com among ten mainly IT cities(San-Francisco, Boston, Palo Alto, Chicago, New-York, Washington, Seattle, Atlanta, Houston, San-Diego)
2. How are skill-sets and degree needed among different city and different size of companies?
3. What about everyone's comments on the company?
4. Which day of a week does HR usually post jobs?
5. How is the distribution of job posting among these ten cities? what's the frequency of job posting for each city? 

## Collect Data ##
Data is web scraped and integrated from both Monster.com and Indeed.com among ten cities(San-Francisco, Boston, Palo Alto, Chicago, New-York, Washington, Seattle, Atlanta, Houston, San-Diego) including 5392 rows and 65 columns.

## Data Pre-exploration ##
Break down the whole data according to city and job post date. After pre-exploration, data is as following:

## Analysis_1 ##
Performed sentiment analysis of companies' reviews and got a review score by using indicoio api. Higher score means more positive and lower score mean more negative. This analysis is dynamic, you can input city name and number of companies with Top and Last score. Part of the results are as following:
