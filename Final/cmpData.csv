I worked under the Lost and Stolen department. This is a special department for offshore since we only handle customers with lost and stolen phone concerns.Working with T-Mobile is fun and a learning experience, I was able to share my skills and knowledge since I am one of the tenured representatives of the account. Handling newbies is very fulfilling for me since I am a frustrated educator/trainer/director. I was able to grow and learned a lot from this job. I was able to test my capabilities and patience in terms of handling different kinds of people and culture since I am dealing with different types of people in terms of my customers and colleagues and clients.This June, our UK account was sent back onshore. Our department was transferred to a different account. We were moved to Yes Optus - our Australian account.

Performance Evaluations - included responsible for IAP (Improvement Action Plan) and DAP’s (Development Action Plan) for improving the performance of team members below SLA’s.10 hr. shift, learned how to deal with customer. Management had a lack of people skills, coworkers were friendly and helped you out when was needed. Hardest part: work under pressure to sale products. Most enjoyable part: facilities, activities.24/7 Customer gives their employees a work-life balance environment. As they believe that a happy and satisfied employee is a productive employee. They will be able to give better results and meet their daily goals if they do not feel overworked and restricted.As [24]7 is my first job, I have learnt how to help the customers in resolving the queries and we do have fun time at work like games etc. My team leader and my co-workers who are much more tenured than me helps me in giving the exact solving for the work. The most memorable day is when I was re-awarded for the best AST topper across the floor.good management to work for.Time managementFriendly co workersworking on the floor is challengingsalary is always on timemethodical work progress"
220,24M Technologies,"Working for this company is like working in somebody's garage! The facility is a mess, over crowded and filled with JUNK. Every piece of equipment in the lab is purchased used and never fits the needs of the company so it's all half-assed. The office area is over crowed and made of pieces of furniture that were bought used so nothing matches! There is inadequate storage space in the lab as well as the office areas. Additionally they have very poor insurance benefits and very limited number of paid holidays. Not to mention they do not match funds in the 401k plan.Just keep looking you'll be happy you did."
334,A9,"Pay well, smartness is valued to a great level. Can make an impact on some big challenges. People around are nice and cordial. Office has a history and good location. Option to work from home.Good working environment. Smooth cooperation among colleagues. Free snacks and drinks, comfortable desk and chairs. Need a gym and more shower room."

I completed plc program changes for installation on weekends, I completed all necessary paperwork. this included Cad drawings, ECR's, Printouts of electrical drawings, backups of the plc programs. I worked with production management, engineering, and maintenance personnel.

101,"AbbVie, Inc","AbbVie is the best place I have ever worked.  They are on the forefront of addressing some of the most debilitating and devastating diseases.  Their culture is phenomenal and their benefits are great.I had a great time working at AbbVie. For an intern right out of high school I had a lot of freedom which was nice. Could have used a few more structured projects but it was good.Had an amazing experience working with the company, the employees and everyone at the company were very friendly. Very easy going workplace, everyone was available to help.AbbVie values its employees. Provides opportunities to grow and connect.Managements try their best to listen to employees and provide solutions. Projects goals that are inspiring and motivating.I had a great summer interning and combining my science skills with the business behind a pharma company. I had time to work on my own projects, conduct informational interviews, visit/tour different company sites, attend lectures, and network.Excellent company. Computer Operator Skills. Diversified employees and co-workers worked together on various projects. Meetings and luncheons given monthly.The project I was on was short term and didn't give me enough time to get a sense of the culture.  The people I met and worked with were kind and hard working.AbbVie Pharmaceuticals is simply a wonderful place to work. I was a  Change Management Consultant for the Purchasing Dept. I worked under wonderful people and was paid well. Can't say enough good things.Good company but limited growth potential. Not  as innovated as other organizations.Using older sales techniques to sell product.Good marketing department.Promotions are limited if you are in field sales.Still have low numbers of diversity in management positions.The company is great, the work is fun and there is a lot to learn so it is challenging in a good way. Benefits are awesome. But I have a lack of immediate Management.Not interested in providing a review of AbbVie. I have worked here for 3 years as a consultant but do not have enough exposure to the company to offer a thorough review.Many career opportunities. Theres something for everyone. Well managed and great benefits. I would reccomend this company to anyone wanting to expand their breadth of knowledge or wanting to fuether their career.Responsible for undertaking ad-hoc analysis on payments made to healthcare physicians and organizations using Lavastorm Extracted data from an Oracle data warehouse, cleaned and normalized the data for further analysis, performed complex joins and created data sets for further analysisMy day involves constant attention to detail and the ability to work effectively and efficiently with other people.  My tasks are frequently change and require the ability to be flexible and supportive of management directives and initiatives.  The greatest challenge keeping communication open between various groups over a large manufacturing floor.  I enjoy the daily challenges of learning new tasks and growing technically.Great culture and great benefits.  They always emphasize a all for one attitude.

I enjoyed developing  new technical skills.Manufacturing organization that requires the best of any candidate that seeks employment.The work at times requires a seven day work week, this can be a benefit to some and not to others, depending on your life style.Lessons learned  while working here is the importance of product accountability, cGMP, FIFO, JIT and good record keeping.The product IPSWITCH  gives users the ability to share files within the company  and outside the company firewalls usually for 3rd party vendors to update and retrieve documents in a secure area. No limit on file sizes - disk space was always a concern.  A typical day at work would be setting up new users and creating the environment for each dept needs and use. The hardest part of the job was managing resources without clear and defined roles of who would be responsible for outcome deliverables. The most enjoyable part of the job was providing satisfaction and quick turn around time to Customers and as an alternative to the standard MQ messaging environment which was both costly and cumbersome for small business units within the organization.prepare a calls planings with pre-call analissis , looking for opportunities ,call pharmacies , learn more about health care products cover , learn more about physician situation , hard part is complete the 8 calls days , I like this jobs"

113,Accenture Inc,"I have spent 10 and 1/2 years with Accenture and they have given me many SAP Basis skills that I did not possess when I joined them.  They are a hands on company and employ only the most qualified people.  They value work/life balance and live up to that promise.  I always worked for managers that I enjoyed working for and respected which made me only want to do a better job for them. A typical day at work could vary from day to day as I learned quickly that some tasks take priority over others and at a very quick pace. I enjoyed all of my co-workers and worked well with them as a team.  Hardest part of the job was leaving after such a long time.Day-to-day project experience varies with your delivery lead.  Senior leaders try to create an engaging, nurturing culture, but that often comes secondary to delivery leads' efforts to over-deliver.Enjoyed working with the firm. They maintain a certain work environment which caters to the needs of their employees in an appropriate manor.If the management of project is ethical then one can find opportunities for growth. If not, then it can give one a challenging experience. Pay scale is decent.When you work at Accenture, you are moving very quickly but you are also exposed to so many new opportunities. If you like a big company and have an entrepreneurial spirit, you'll really enjoy it.My review of Accenture was that in my dept we were extremely understaffed which in turn cause A LOT of frustration and stress in the environment. In my time being there management was changed 3 times which cautioned a red flag in my mind. The management staff was very rude and non helpful. I even reported them to HR upon my departure due to the fact of the unfairness and treatment I would constantly receive at my time there on several different occasions.A typical work day is would be managing a Scrum team of 7 members. Attending daily standup meetings, grooming sessions, and Review & Retrospective meetings for 2 projects. The team is very productive and work as a well oiled machine. We have a nearshore team and they work with us during our timezone which makes them professional. The most enjoyable part of the job is that there is a lot of team work involved and we knock the requirements off the park during every sprint.I enjoy working for Accenture however it is a world wide company which makes it very difficult to get a quick answer from your supervisor when they work in a completely different state.I have worked at Accenture for 4 yrs and have had a great range of roles which have definitely help improve my over all skills but the salary and bonus are not good.In general, Accenture is a great company to work for.  They offer good benefits, decent compensation and have a strong company culture.  The people that work for Accenture are highly motivated and work well in team environments.  I never have felt threatened that someone was trying to take my job or through me under the bus.At first, the company would look rather really harmless, and full of fun. But when you get into a project, that's when the nightmare starts. You have to work longer hours even when it's not really necessary; and sometimes even work on Saturdays and Sundays just because the manager told you so. One time after a long day at work, I was still only parking my car in my garage (I haven't even turned the engine off yet) when my mobile phone rang and it was my manager calling me asking me to come to work EARLY the following day! at 2AM in the morning! Another gripe I had was even when the workplace is supposed to be full of software developers, for some reason, it's was always so noisy. You have to struggle focusing on your tasks. And since it's a very competitive company, you'll be lucky to find people to help you in case you get stuck in something - especially if it needs their specialty. People are so insecure with their positions that they often see you as a threat when you ask them for help.My time being here has been pretty good for the most part. It's a great company to work for. Great place to grow within the company.Good health and dental. Flexible with vacation time in my experience. Trouble growing in some career alignments, understand where you are in the company and how the group is prioritized.provided opportunity to create and seize business opportunities in formulation and preparation of proposals and ideas for new service offerings. Forged and leveraged positive relationships with key client executives, drove value by maximizing benefits / value for clients and Accenture, and coordinated and directed complex work efforts by planning and coordinating work ensuring achievement of multiple commitments and quality expectations. Restructured work in response to changing client needs, define and / or reinforce standard methods and processes delivering high quality services, as well as, balancing relationship among budget, staffing mix, and project milestones including work-plans and schedules.Excellent People, Environment challenges you to be your best.  Many different opportunities to grow your career.  Many roles require travel Monday through Thursday.Accenture is all about the bottom line.With Accenture there are no such thing as work life balance. The Company is mainly focus on it is bottom line.Only downside I experienced is when you change roles and the next role is clearly more difficult, a promotion and a pay raise should accompany as well.  This did not happen.Working in Accenture I started to understand about to work in a different level of business, was a gret job. I worked with people of many countries, different languages.Working on latest in technology. Great place to develop network, learn and progress if you are interested in consulting. Very open work culture in terms of moving to different areas if needed.Its very good work environment. Work Life Balance and Compensatio, Benefits are very good. Co- workers are really helpfull. And leadership is very friendly. Training are very good.Regular busy day, meetings , team management. I have learnt lots of testing management activities from my day 1. Hardest part of my Job was the project where i worked as test manager where I was responsible for all the testing activities of the project. Interacting with the new people while working with different clients."
532,Acorda Therapeutics,"A very dynamic and unique environment. There are a lot of moving parts. It keeps you on your toes. Very flexible schedule to balance work and personal life.They will scam you out of your money.  Go to the official acorda website to apply for a position. Horrible work environment. Unprofessional. Waste of my time.This was a contract position, but the job culture was uplifting and exciting. The staff was very helpful and always willing to go the extra mile to assist.It was always a full day but fulfillingThe leadership and staff are very dedicated to the pursuit of a cure for spinal cord injury and MSThe most demanding part of the job was trying to meet a deadline for grant funding-plan and coordinate special corporate events -assist senior level management with projects and assignements-research and learn about various pharmaceutical productsNice Environment Overall, Some Management restructuring needs to happen ASAP before excellent talent leaves the company.Fantastic, effortless communication line.Very accommodating, compelled me to be extra productive and double efforts in response to their ‘no problem, let us help you’ nature.To illustrate this, I miscalculated my holiday allowance and booked a ski holiday for a day too long. I was prepared to return earlier, but was given another convenient option.I supported the entire companies needs from a creative standpoint, i reported only to the creative director, She believed in me and gave me a lot of creative freedom and gave me opportunities to learn and grow and present.I became known as the go to guy for being fast reliable and easy to work with.I even produced funny movies.Very busy, dedicated staff. Some disorganization. Nice co-wrokers. Training in new initiatives not provided."

This a great company that helps those with disabilities afford childcare.Smart & dynamic people, far less than pleasant managements.Pros:Nice people willing to provide help;flexible time; good database & experiencesCons:Bad life balance; inefficient management;serious favoritism; low salaries"
704,Adaptive Biotechnologies,The management team here was great. The work/life balance was also very fair. The mission of the organization leads to an incredible energy and collaboration among employees.
325,Adobe Systems Incorporated,"while there and being acquired through 2 aquisitions (allaire/macromedia), the big company feel and not being as known as in the smaller entities got tiresome.  when my office closed, it was a welcomed layoff, however, i still miss working there.I have amazing colleagues in Adobe, they are helpful and diligent. I learned first set of skills on my career path and get involved with state of art technologies. Work & life balance here is fantastic, our work is usually well scheduled that most of us find comfortable working here.Great work space and awesome co-workersWorked with Adobe ElementsManagement was great, let you do your own thingGreat Co-workers still associate with them todayNever experience anything hard about my job, if I had to say anything it was trying to get things out on timeLoved that I had my own office and never over workedGreat experience for the resume but little opportunity for career growth. The annual reorganizations confuse corporate strategy and are very disruptive to productivity.Your peers will help the best they can, but management doesn't spend any time onboarding the knowledge you need for your position. Management also doesn't spend any resources furthering your knowledge with Adobe Solutions or the industry. Their is a wiki, but it is poorly managed. Good luck finding the tools you need to actiquitedly do your job.Fun and Innovative place to work with great benefits including high quality cafeteria and gym.Everyone there is willing to take time to meet with you.Efficiency in sales, multi-tasking, and endurance is a must. The environment, management, and flexible hours for education are amazing. This job is not for the light of heart. Retention is low due to excessive stress and mental capacity required of the representative.The business was great, the customers were great, the employees were great, but the management didn't pay me as a manager, even though I got promoted as one.I worked for an amazing HR specialist and she taught me so many skills to take with me. They were very encouraging and motivated me with everything I've done.Adobe is a great company to work for. It not only offers good benefits but also has a wonderful culture. I was given a real project with real responsibility and was able to sink my teeth into the day-to-day life of this career. The pay was great, the benefits are great and everyone I worked with, from interns to senior executives, were lovely. A great place to work.Receiving calls and taking care of customers.  Multitudes of different computer programs to assist and complete customers requests.  The management is lacking in this business not very professional as to say the least.  Co-workers are the balance between management and daily duties.  They are what makes working for a company worthwhile and what making comes to work satisfying.  The hardest part of the job is to have to listen to people yelling, using profanity and being expected to take it as part of the job.  Not being able to interrupt and let the other person know you are here to help and to try and assist to the best of your ability.  The most enjoyable part is when a customer compliments you on a good job and making certain they have the best experience necessary to have them return to your company and the company acknowledging how wonderful you are doing with the company.  It's not always easy but colleagues as well as those wonderful customers makes it a joy to go to work and do the best that you can possibly do and go home at the end of the day with a smile on your face and a song in your heart for a job well done.It is a great place to work.  I enjoy the co-workers and also the job.  There is free soda on tap.  There is also a gym that you could work out.  It is a relaxing place to work and they try to make you feel comfortable.Security enior Program Manager responsible for maintaining and updating existing and new Knowledge Management systems and processes in support of more thanWorking with great people on interesting campaigns is at the heart of Adobe's culture.  Managers are usually accessible and often work side-by-side with their teams.  Co-workers keep everything interesting.The hardest part of the job is determining where to put one's energy, as there are continual streams of new technologies and methodologies to explore.The best part of the job is, again, the sense that everyone is working together for a greater good.i hate that i have to enter this same review multiple time because the system identifies this as another job.. I worked there for about 5 years i outlined the in my resume however the system doesn't recognize duplicate entriesI've worked here for over 10 years and LOVE it. I've always had great co-workers and work with very smart people.  The company has a lot of benefits for the employees and their families.Adobe is a great place, great people, and excellent work/life balance.The atmosphere is mature. It is common to see that a large number of employees have been there 10, 15, 20 years and have no intention of moving to any other company. Everyone I met had great attitudes and energy and were pleasant to be around. Working at this company was truly a unique experience.I really liked the company and the products. I did not like my manager because she was extremely liberal and feminist and forced her beliefs down my throat. Overall, I was unlucky to be on the team I was placed on, but the company was great and I would have loved to switch to a different team and remain with Adobe.Workload really depends on the team and position.Adobe has great company perks like the gym and free software products for employees.Beautiful, fun place to work, great work space, great benefits, nice people to work with, wonderful atmosphere, excellent cafeteria and gymProgressive and leading edge in Software development. Very much Employees oriented company. A great company to work for. I would love to come back to Adobe systems.A great place to work, but the workload is heavy compared to other companies I've worked at making work/life balance more difficult to achieve.The people (very professional and friendly) and work environment (very clean) and small perks such as Peets coffee and healthy snacks are the best attributes in my experience.I was able to gain some new valuable skills in a short time there and made some great new connections within the team and with other teams.Inter-team communication is very good."

150,AECOM Technology,"Work with analyzing data, writing reports, developing monitoring plans, and managing technicians in the field. Co-workers are all very friendly.My day consisted of various laboratory tasks as assigned to include work with an AA machine, wastewater BODs, and oil and grease assessment of samples. I was also tasked with maintaining inventory and ordering supplies as needed.Good company and people,nice atmosphere, flexible on start and end times. There are many online training platforms, just need more practical application and direction for the long term. Benefits are decent, just raised rates.I worked for AECOM twice. When they found out they were losing the contract they force the people who had insurance to take their insurance and it was high. The second time they came in with their gonna make things better bull and they allowed the wrong things to still happen.Regular work day was great, learned how to navigate oracle system, managers easy to work with. nothing hard to learn at AECOM, just coming to work was the enjoyable part and talking to co-workers.Fantastic atmosphere with friendly,professional, and safe teammates. Typical work day is an eight hour day with expected PM procedures, and few trouble calls. Great opportunity for advancement within the company as long the individual is willing to relocate. Training is always available.Tried to do the best I could with little training. Management was puppet to the host company and would throw us under the bus to make themselves look better.Ive been with the company for eight years and overall they are a great company but there is no advancement within the company. Management needs to improve.its good pay but the workload is crazy. They don't show employees no appreciation for the work we do. The benefits are good. Its really no room for growth.Employee morale at a all time low. No advancement or stability. Play favorites with employees. Does not acknowledge loyalty.Projects were varied; travel opportunity was excellent. Supervisors were fair and provided training when necessary. I enjoyed the experience.AECOM has some amazingly passionate employees that I felt honored to call my coworkers. Talent in abundance, humble and true professionals. The teams really go above and beyond with their dedication.Friendly atmosphere and good team experience. Good work culture and enjoyed working with management and friendly co-workers. Enjoyed extra-curricular events and celebrations.Outstanding opportunities with AECOM. a globally recognized corporation with LOTS of opportunities for personal and professional growthAll the folks who run the maintenance desk are the same people who ran it in the Navy. So, in most cases, you've got the same types of problems.The company offer a variety of benefits and paid above average compensation.  The costs were average in the industry.  There is constant change coming from Corporate leadership which resulted in a stressful work environment.  No work/life balance due to long hours.A very large company and as such, don't get the feel that the company really cares about you as an individual. I spent over 2+ years at a job site before I actually met an AECOM Chief or overall discipline manager or higher.I began my career here and all the people have been friendly and I have learned and grown a lot in my career and as a person.  I have enjoyed my time with AECOM but feel I am wanting to grow more and they do not have the position I am looking for and I have a lot of motivation and drive and I am stuck now in my career.Worked with the legacy company Washington group and URS.  Once aecom took over the feel of a big company set in.  Soon it was evident all the company cared about is their bottom line.  Absolutely no thought given about their employees unless it somehow benefits the company.Benefits are a thing of the past for this company. Health insurance benefits are doubling in price and the coverage is going down. Look to spend 20-30% of your salary for health coverage. In 2017 you will be penalized for having a working spouse on your insurance plan.typical day went by kind of fast due to busy work and trying to not be fired. come in, get situated, grab tools and go out to the flight line. launch jet, recover jet, inspect jet."
512,Aecom Technology Corporation,"Work with analyzing data, writing reports, developing monitoring plans, and managing technicians in the field. Co-workers are all very friendly.The environment is pleasant, friendly and professional. I learned a vast amount of skill sets which helped me towards my management career. My co-workers were very efficient and diligent in working as a team. The most difficult part of the job was the internal politics, lack of planning, limited knowledge in managment from a production standpoint. Unfortunatly, there wasn't clear/consice descision making inwhich affected the direction of projects. There was 2 sets of 'laws' and alot of internal turmoil between groups. The most enjoyable part of the job was being sucessful reaching deadlines enlight of the time constraints/challenges.AECOM is a great place to work and learn Construction Management.  As a Construction Superintendent, I was able to interact with different contractors on a ""work order"" basis"" and learned more about RFP procedures and contract timelines to complete projects to final closeout.Friendly atmosphere and good team experience. Good work culture and enjoyed working with management and friendly co-workers. Enjoyed extra-curricular events and celebrations.The job has a lot of room for improvement. I was told that there would be sufficient training. That wasn't the case. The procedures are all reliant on who is in the room, if the manager is in the room all t's are crossed and I's are dotted. When the supervisor was in the room, incidents were deliberately ignored on their order. If this was ever caught the supervisor would place the blame on the operators. The pay is ok for what the job involves. The benefits were very expensive. Overall this job would be much better if the management were replaced, and better benefits were includedThis is a company so filled with red tape and beauracracy that it can't get out from its own way.  The culture and day to day work environment is horrible unless you enjoy fulfilling non-engineering related tasks that are tied to meeting accounting requirements imposed from a corporate management that has no knowledge of day-to-day operations performed by the engineering staff of professionals.The company has been focusing on Employee development and satisfaction in recent months. benefits could be better. not very competitive. Management can also be improvedBenefits are a thing of the past for this company. Health insurance benefits are doubling in price and the coverage is going down. Look to spend 20-30% of your salary for health coverage. In 2017 you will be penalized for having a working spouse on your insurance plan.Would be a great place to work if there were any hope for pay increases.  The job itself is very satisfying working along side with various  government officials,  There is no room for advancement, but much training is provided to ensure that everyone is the best that  they can be at their own jobs.The company offer a variety of benefits and paid above average compensation.  The costs were average in the industry.  There is constant change coming from Corporate leadership which resulted in a stressful work environment.  No work/life balance due to long hours.Collaborative. Forward-thinking. Dynamic. Our culture mirrors our work product. With a diverse practice and projects that span the globe, AECOM is an ideal place to build your career and develop skills in entrepreneurship, project delivery, leadership, and life.Good company and people,nice atmosphere, flexible on start and end times. There are many online training platforms, just need more practical application and direction for the long term. Benefits are decent, just raised rates.great co workers, really made me feel like part of the team. Very knowledgeable and eager to help and new grad/hire like myself. Inconsistency from top down management. Furlough and layoff cycles made for very stressful situation visa v job security.Working with AECOM is a great company for advancement. Great working environment with co works. Good Team work within the company. Management gets back to you in a timely manner.Excellent employer with great benefits and management.  A team approach to construction projects is beneficial for all and is followed very well by co-workers and management alike.Tried to do the best I could with little training. Management was puppet to the host company and would throw us under the bus to make themselves look better.No raises, no weekends, no room for advancement, high turn around rate, poor corporate managers, and micromanaging. Not to mention the horrible benefits!Ive been with the company for eight years and overall they are a great company but there is no advancement within the company. Management needs to improve.Most people seem to get hired because they are friends with management or related to them in some way. There is no room for advancement. You never get recognized for the hard work you put in. Management is horrible, way too much favortism on this contract. Benefit are a joke!!! Overpriced health insurance with an over inflated deductible. Sick days and jury duty days you pay for out of your Health and Welfare Benefit. They change the way you receive your Sick days and Vacation going back and forth from accrual to front loading different times through out year. This is the contractor to avoid whilst looking for a job at Fort Bliss.I prefer not to answer this as the last 4 years has been the worst I've ever gone through. To begin with the job was fun and I learned a lot.  But 4 years ago, we became a service center with a new manager who changed the entire atmosphere of the office and our jobs. And then 2 years ago we went under a different division of the company and URS was bought by a company named AECOM and things just got worse.  People were being laid-off until it got to my position and then 10 of us lost our jobs.  In the last 4 years I went from 9% raises to 1% and 0%A typical day of work as a Logistics  Analyst at AECOM were both challenging and rewarding.  The challenging were to remain flexible and engaged in the procurement and tracking of product. I learned that the Integrated Logistics Support documents requires constant update and your co-workers/team member must be supportive of each other to include management to meet both the customer and company needs.  The most rewarding part of the job were delivering  the end product to the customer and properly trained."
755,Aegion Corporation,Solid company with sound mission. Typical stresses of public company life sometimes complicate decision making. Overall push to grow and expand
230,Aerotek,"Overall easy to work with and very professional. Contracted at Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics.  Support users on the Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS),provide end users with assistance in using the CTMS and work on improving quality of data in database.A typical day at work consisted of clocking in at 1pm and would clock out anywhere between 2am-4am, six days a week. The work was challenging enough to keep my mind active and the constant changes kept me on my toes. I had a great supervisor who was tough, but fair. She stood behind me when I had to make on-the-spot decisions and made me feel like what I was doing was important. The hardest part of this job had to be working such long hours with only one day off a week. However, working with people from all over the globe was amazing.For my personal opinion Aerotek isn't bad at all. Its one of the better staffing companies. Got me a job through a contract and I'm now permanent with the company. Aerotek actually paid a little more than the company I work with and offered us benefits AND we got a raise through them as well while on contract. Ive been with a few temp agencies and none were even close to Aerotek overall besides BG Staffing. If you need work soon and willing to take a chance on a temp to perm its honestly a decent company. It was at times unnerving with the uncertainty of the situation and the contract but it all ended up working out in the end for most of us. Once again my personal experience in Irving, TX so of course other results may vary. But definitely worth a shot if you are un employed or looking for quick workFun company culture. They really try to do their best to compensate the hard work you put in but it is a grind. Depending on the day you could be done at 5 or 5:30 but others it could be 7:30 or 8 before you feel comfortable leaving, and you may still have not hit your expectations for the day. Great place to start out and learn but tough work-life balance.I am proud that I was able to begin my Career with Aerotek. I started without very much direction. I was trying to see what I wanted to do long term, and it introduced me to a world that I never even considered in college. It was a career that found me instead of the other way around. If I wanted to go into sales long term, I definitely would've remained there, but it just wasn't where I wanted to take my career.Sign into RF scan gun and pick product from location with correct quantity for order. Management was decentCo-workers were great people and made you feel welcomeHardest part of the job was counting large quantities of parts,Most enjoyable part was being able to listen to music and the breaks.No hourly pay for over 40+ hours of work a week, bad culture, bad management, favoritism, corporate bullying, no work life balance. This office is a very dirty environment, very poor housekeeping.This company has one of the best training and development programs I have ever been a part of.  Great culture that provides guidance, support and motivation from folks around you that truly want to see you succeed. Long hours that may require some late nights at times but the deal is you get out of it what you put into it, generally.  Even though the hours are long they are very flexible for things you need to do, such as run an important errand and leave for most any personal reason as long as it isn't being abused.  It is an extremely tough job and is quite the grind.  In recruiting and sales that are so many things that happen outside of your control.  You can make a lot of money and have a long great career here but you better have a great work ethic and the ability to persevere.I started Aerotek on February 15th, 2016. I was contracted through them to work for a company based out of Morrisville, NC. It was so exciting for me. I was completely thrilled with the new opportunity before me, because I had been looking for the opportunity they presented me for a long time. It was a short lived dream. The company they contract for has management that SHOWS way too much favoritism, and if they don't like you, well it's out the door for you. I was robbed of my dream to become permanent. Not only that, but they released me for such a ridiculous reason...Performance driven environment, but centered around a great company culture. Work hard, play hard environment where management focuses on developing the skills of young professionals.Great company to work for, compensation is great and they do take care of their employees. Work culture is professional, fair and friendly.  Management has an open door policy, they truly care about their employees.  Definitely recommend them and would work for them again.Coworkers were more than just team members, we were like family. Working for the company provided bonuses based off the work effort that was put forth. Decent salary. The call center was partitioned into divisions, e.g., Team H2O or Beast Team etc. which boosted our morale to work harder to close on homeowners loans especially priorities 1-3 in conjucntion with utilizing the isms, i.e., company ethics and or / guidelines. Very energetic atmosphere.Great culture & strong leadership, but very demanding.  Great environment with great people, solid training but you will be working a lot to achieve success and advancement.Long hours, low pay, limited opportunity for advancement for women.  The recruiters and sales resources work very long hours and play very hard in the off hours.  It's a big of a ""frat house""...balls being thrown around all day long.  A bit militant.  Very hokey atmosphere.  Appearances can be deceiving.  I learned a lot about the staffing business and managing consultants.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people find meaningful work.A typical day for me was always a learning experience in different departments, was trained in various departments in order to be able to always have someone is critical operations to full fill the demands of the company. Got along with all my co-workers no matter what position they performed. I enjoyed very much interacting with different people and different departments and being able to perform different tasks thru out my day.Great place to be. Everyone is seemingly up beat and happy.The first 10-11 months I worked there were awesome despite a few bad apples. If you are negative and can't take feedback to develop into a better recruiter you probably won't be there long.It solely a performance based job but does have awesome compensation and benefits package. Set salary plus commission.The biggest downside I felt was having to conform to their view of a corporate employee. I had two buddies that were told they probably wouldn't get promoted because they wore purple button down shirts with ties instead of the typical blue or white. One was actually denied a promotion and was told it just wasn't his time yet even though he was the top recruiter in the office. As my time neared its end there a lot of changes in structure and management were going on. Meaning a lot of the culture was being lost and they brought in a lot of new recruiters and management was being shifted into new branches and even our director was demoted and kept even though he was the main cause for the stress and lack of production. Since then they have plugged a new person into the role of the Director and I imagine its going a lot better now.Aerotek is a great job to start out at after college, with the new rates entry level people out of school will now get 60K after hitting certain numbers plus commission and bonus. You can make decent money here but it is quite a grind and you need to be prepared to work 50-60 hours a week and some weekends.I worked as an intern for Aerotek and it gave me some good insight into the recruiting world. During a typical day as a recruiter, you would make aprox. 45 calls a day to try and set up interviews for candidates to come in and meet with you.The Account Managers are often promoted from recruiting fast. This show that there is plenty of career advancement, but there have been some complaints about the management being unexperienced. Great work environment, everyone is easy to talk to and get along with. The hardest part of the job is the reliance that you put into your candidates. You must first search for the candidate, call them, bring them in for a face to face interview, call their references,  have them interview for the position, accept the job offer if it is extended, and pass a drug test. During any point of this process the candidate can become ineligible for the opportunity or loose interest and you have to start the whole process over again (which happens pretty often). Like most sales job, closing the deal is the best part of the job. Can also be a pretty lucrative opportunity if you are good at it.Very nice company to work for a lot of opportunity to grow and a lot of good benefits also management treats you nice and co-workers and staff as wellIndeed is a life changing work environment! The employees and management team are very genuine and supportive! The culture is very positive and it is a fun environment. New ideas are encouraged and implemented. Indeed, is a great employer with amazing perks. Complementary breakfast, lunches, beverages and snacks to keep the teams happy.Aerotek has great job culture. For A normal work day the work is repetitive and also through out the week.  I learned about invoicing and collections. The management could be better. My co-workers are very supportive and helpful. We put work first and fun later. the most enjoyable part of this job is the culture. Everyone is like family and I think that is important."
174,Aetna,"Aetna is a good company to start out a career in. It is a small, family owned company, however room for advancement is narrow and opportunities do not arise as quickly as one would expect. The typical day to day is a fast moving environment that includes quick problem solving, on the spot customer relations, and high attention to detail. Co-workers are wonderful, and everyone is willing to jump in to lend a helping hand. Management is supportive and always available to work with and talk to when/should a problem or need for help is called upon. The hardest part of the job is time management due to the ever changing day to day responsibilities. I enjoyed the daily grind and electrical side of my duties.I did not check the ""job security"" rating due top the fact that my tenure at Aetna/Coventry was a contractual position through U.S.Tech Solutions, Inc, .a New Jersey based staffing company. Atypical work day revoled around speaking to and contacting customers regarding medicare benefits using the computer to enter information into the data base.  I learned quite a lot regarding health benefits and members need for information.  Management and coworkers were excellent.  There were no real difficult aspects of the position and the most enjoyable part regarding  the position was theteam work atmosphere. Enjoyable work place because different coworkers would bring donuts and coffee and pot luck lunchesVery effective with time management to meet various deadlines.  Must communicate effectively with internal and external customers regarding billing, accounts receivable and installation of new customers and revisions of existing customers.  Must daily reconcile payments received for book of business and allocate to various benefits and confirm that the reported information falls within our edit limits. Must be aware of various differences in state legislations and how it applies to benefits.This experience has been wonderful with regard to my co-workers. Everyone is supportive of each other and we celebrate our successes. People take accountability for their actions rather than looking for a scape goat. The hardest part of the job has been that it is predominantly a work from home position. It would be nice to have the opportunity to be in the same room with the co-workers for projects etc. That being said, the most enjoyable part of the job is working at home. It is easier to be productive when working solo as there are minimal distractions.I entered into Aetna Better Health of Ohio with great expectations. My hope was to be with this company until retirement. From the start, I felt that management was very eager to just push me around into different categories and the right hand did not know what the left hand was doing. A LOT OF TURNOVER!!! Providers are constantly told we have your claims, appeal, dispute information, then they call back after 30 days, then they are told, sorry your information is lost, resubmit it again, this is done after 3 times in a row, going on 2 years now. Very unethical company. I am glad I no longer work for them. Benefits were ok, similar to what the members have....Aetna has been a great company to work for. I've had the opportunity to express different departments allowing my knowledge to expand from behind the pharmacy doors to adjudication and transcribing request. My experience expanded beyond the pharmacy area and into medical. Patient management was a different experiences  that I grew to understand and appreciate  the medical field. Leading me to get a degree in Healthcare administration.Been here 3 years and my department management is horrible. If your not a favorite of the managers forget about raises and help all together.  Cases are piled on you and then when you fail qa it is all your fault. Complaining to HR is useless.  Mangamemt will throw ypu under the bus to save themselves.  Health benefits are a joke. High deductible and premiums. Only perk is they offer work from homeI was with the company for 23 years. I worked in  Enrollment, Coordination of Benefits and Accounts Receivable. When I was the supervisor in Accounts Receivable my focus daily was to ensure the payments were processed timely. I worked well with my peers and coworkers. I enjoyed most was the people I worked with. I didn't have any experience  in Accounts Receivable in 1996 when I was hired and they gave me an opportunity. I learned everything and I enjoyed coming to work daily.Enjoyed working at Aetna.   Insurance benefits could have been better but, good enough.  Management was good and enjoyed  working with them.  Some of the mangers were better than others, as with most big companies.  Salaries were raised to meet cost of living expenses, which was great!The recent changes to the healthcare requirements as defined by ACA caused major changes to the plan administration and plan benefits.  Aetna's focus on living healthy lifestyles played a termendous role in the successful implementation of the changes and the positive results.  There were some negatives as well, such as reducing staff by transitioning some positions to offshore vendors.  One of the most difficult things to overcome was meeting customer demands with a much leaner staff.  Everyone works extremely hard every day and puts the members first.  On days when I was able to make a difference in someone's life by expediting a claim payment or providing information on plans which were critical in the member making the best decision for his/her healthcare needs is the most enjoyable part of my job.  Healthcare is very complicated and can be confusing to many people and they need guidance, especially in situations where the decision is critical healthwise and financially.I am currently with the company but seeking a position outside Aetna.  Promises made to me when negotiating for my hire were not kept, my role keeps expanding with no adjustment in salary, and an exemplary review resulted in about the same pay increase as an average employee. I believe there is significant pay disparity between myself and a male colleague with the same skills, education, and experience.Used to be the most excellent company to work for; however, much is lacking today in terms of production expectations and deliverable quality within those expectations. The ability to provide excellent customer service is hindered due to the unreasonable standards of production.Company will work you to the bone with volume that is completely unmanageable with expectations that you will meet deadlines.  No lunch breaks.  No compensation for overtime worked.  Upper management very slow to approve positions, even though employees are burning out from work stress.Job is very challenging everyday, I truly love my job just would like to be compensated for my I bring to the company. the most important part of the job is helping providers with members, providing the correct benefits and processing claims correctly. I have learned so much with Aetna, how to display good customer service values. Always putting the providers or the members needs first.salary employee ending job 10-12 hours/day X5 days/week,  Poor life balance. Not even enough time to exercise, though they advocate this. Since new manager took over in Spring she has not talked with staff, only my direct boss has team meetings weekly. Alot of required meetings are a BIG waste of time, new programs started prior to being tried on smaller scale, protocols in place and questions answered.A typical day at work consists of processing a minimum of 12 medical claims per hour, based on CMS guidelines. Over the past 2 years on this team I have learned a lot about the coding and how to make sure the claim is ok to pay. The management I honestly very good people, the co-workers are very friendly and eager to assist  with any  help that may be needed. The best part of my day is knowing I have did my job and did it correctly.Good work culture in the Portland office but very poor compensation and benefits. I would not like to work there again. The company expectations do not match the compensation. Experienced several issues with my benefits. Employees can't afford the health insurance the same company provides.I have learned so much working at Aetna.  In essence I group up there.

A lot of different balls in the air.  This is what makes the job exciting to me.The most enjoyable part of the job is the atmosphere of the workplace the interaction with the clients and the ability to work in a non-micro-managing atmosphere.Aetna was a great place to work.  The management is very supportive . A typical day was talking to the agents about their commissions and computer work to make sure they get it on time.-I learned how much a little extra effort is really appreciated here-The management was really good. Great leaders- Mixed emotions on the coworkers-hardest part of the job was dealing with computer glitches -best part of the job talking to all the agents. They are great..Don't work for Aetna if you can't deal with a lot of stress. They used to be a good company but terrible now. Benefits are bad and no job security  in the call center. They expect way too much and put tons of stress on their employees. It's not worth itprefer not to be negative great place to work if youre lucky to be in a good organization. last management team was disconnected worried only about numbers not interested in feedback or improvement suggestions."

Great leaders- Mixed emotions on the coworkers-hardest part of the job was dealing with computer glitches -best part of the job talking to all the agents. They are great..Aetna is a good company. You would go in and know what you would need done and be able to work on your own with a supervisor/manager handy when needing assistance. Management was good to work with schedules and time off. Upper management was always changing and wanting vague information at times. Aetna has acquired many smaller companies and is always trying to convert the staff to their systems.  this is an extra burden to anyone who was bought out and leaves a lot of uncertainty in the direction the companies take.The culture at Aetna seems very member focused and company is views the job as more than just a job. Aetna is very driven in reshaping healthcare and focusing on the needs of its members. I enjoy working here because it also supports employee work/life balance. The employees feel valued and that they are contributing to the company."
790,"Affymetrix, Inc.","Affymetrix was acquired by another company so they are no longer in business,Once acquired the business was merged into the new companyCompany had a great work life balance.Given the opportunity to understand their products and how to use that knowledge when re-implementing Xactly.Able to work with management,Allowed my staff the ability to work with implementing the Xactly system for their future skill set.The hardest part of the job was doing the GL and monthly accruals- that is not my background.The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I met and worked with on a daily basis.Good products, people, and processes.  Changing management resulted in various changes, largely positive, to how the organization was run.Typical day at work included 30% bench work, 50% documentation and 20% interaction with cross functional teams, vendors, customers etc. The hardest part of the job was the efforts that went into establishing stringent requirements in creating a GLP environment and transitioning a Research Use Product only to a diagnostic product for clinical applications. The lack of quality and regulatory knowledge amongst colleagues from within and various other departments made the process longer and harder. The most enjoyable part was a great, determined and hardworking manager to work and report to. Working with a team willing to learn and adapt to changes. Interesting and consistent challenges during the course of development to launch of the product. Also plenty of opportunities to learn and grow in the company.Affymetrix is a decent place to work for, but it seems next to almost impossible to advance within. For the most part they give good incentives, health care, 401k, vacation time and few other perks. They try to keep the morale high by having a employees activities committee conduct monthly events. The hardest part of the job are the people, but that is usually at most jobs. In my area my co-workers are very close knit and we work like a family. Management can a shaky at times, but nothing to really worry about. There are many learning opportunities because Affymetrix highly promotes cross training. When I started working here you get all benefits from day one.Affymetrix is a good company to work for but it is not financially solvent. Thus I couldn't really move forward in the organization even though I did ""quality work."" Hours are flexible and eating was great until they took away breakfast. They had layoffs while I was there and I ultimately became a victim of budgetary constraints. I was replaced by a contract worker that was fired in the initial layoffs and was rehired back on a contract basis. There is some backstabbing though and certain people don't know too much. The company is not going to stay afloat due to bad management and a lot of workers I saw goofing off.Affymetrix is a great organization with a close knit culture. One of the most internally connected companies I've ever worked with.Best place to work for. Friendly environment. Great management team. I enjoyed my busy desk, always challenging on a daily basis.I learned a lot from the people I work for and has been my mentor all the time.I will surely miss the company.Overall This is a god place to work. I do wish that I was more challenge at my job on a day to day basis.7+ plus years good professional experience in the Analysis, Architecture, Design, Development, Implementation, Integration and Testing of Client / Server / Internet / Intranet Systems for Engineering, Research, Financial and Insurance Industries using Object Oriented Analysis/Design/Methodologies.Hands-on experience with the latest Java EE 5 platform. Strong exposure to lightweight containers like EJB 3.0. JPA 1 and Hibernate 3.0. Solid experience in lightweight POJO based frameworks like spring 3.0(Dependency Injection, IOC, ORM, DAO, AOP, MVC, JMS and Business Integration).Good experience in Spring AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming) and IOC (Inversion of Control).I begin work each day by checking my email. I gown up into proper lab wear then procede into lab. I take a filling order and follow each procedure. Work orders vary from quanity which determine the time frame. After completing the work order I return all materials and close the work order into the companies software. The management is pretty laid back and the co-workers are the same. There is no hard part about the job. One of the best things they have are educational classes that you get credits and certificates when complete.There was a good focus on getting things done while maintaining flexibility and freedom to work in the way that best suits youThe most enjoyable part of the job was listening to music and setting up experiments using different types of skills. The typical day was getting there at 7:30 am in morning. Starting my day with good breakfast and listening to music and working on DNA chips. Using micropipette filling chips with Hyb buffer and then putting it in Hybridization Oven.The best thing about working for a company like Affy is knowing that the end result (products/services) positively affect the quality of human life.For me, this simple fact has been the most powerful reason to work there and why I choose to remain in biotech !Very aggressive work schedule focused primarily on profits. They do have an excellent product which is of great benefit to mankind. Perhaps with the the recent restructure and change in management they will be able to work to their mission and product a product that will make great strides in diagnostic medicine.I made my weekly schedule which included all service call coordination and installs. Keep up on expense reports and service reports. make my own travel arrangements.Typical work day was ok,I learned about all kinds of bulk and liquid materials,management was fine,co-workers were ok,hardest part of job was very big orders in which took alot of time to get done,my most enjoyable parts of job was the christmas party'sa typical day at worKwhat you learnedmanagementyour co-workersthe hardest part of the jobthe most enjoyable part of the jobManagement in the corporate is very incompetence. No new products for years and no new technology. Management is full of dead woodsGreat place to work. Wonderful co-workers and teamwork.Company cares about the workers and makes a pleasant and enjoyable place to be.Worked here for 13 years. Great boss and co-workers. Had excellent amenities."
192,"Agero, Inc.","I worked here as a second time through in a call center. The managers where nice but they were focused more on quantity of calls taken rather than quality of calls. I was let go because I could not meet the low average handle time (300 seconds) but had made 100% on quality the entire time I was there.I love all my co-workers, we have really good trainers there. It is really good place to work, you can earn a lot of incentives and bonuses."

Agilent needs new leadership blood, same people cannot improve its old culture because they don't know what to change to.  Agilent needs to redefine itself form ""Old HP"" image, it needs at least to be ""New HP"".Agilent was a temporary position that allowed me to explore the world of technology. It allowed me to use my IT education to assist in helping customers.

An excellent place to seek employment.PRO'S: job security, training/furthering education, stock/benefits. Very flexible with schedules and family oriented. Most positions allow you to work from home at least part time which can be an added perk for most.CONS: not a lot of job advancement because their current upper management have been in those positions for long periods of time. (good for older generations, bad for the younger generations). I can't speak for all of the Agilent locations but at the Santa Clara location (HQ), there were very few employees under the age of 35 - culturally and socially different than many other large companies within the bay area.Great job which involves sales of chemical analysis equipment. The job entails calls and faxes to get service contracts. For the equipment that we sell and make the quota each month for total revenue.Most people are paid well and many groups are relaxed with a good work life balance.  However, there is little to no opportunity for career advancement and the recent reorganization/reinvention of the corporation appears to be killing its future.  The primary corporate focus now appears to be saving for the bottom line and not innovative product development or customer satisfaction.Acquired by Modis.

The harder I worked the more benefits I receieved.It is a great company to work with if you have already developed a career. Products are amazing but internal infrastructure needs work."
800,agilisIT,"Management truly wants to hear our input and makes continuous improvements. Some of us work on individual client projects, some are in teams.  The engineers are dedicated and professional.  Many have a work hard, play hard mentality.  You are encouraged to take on projects and responsibilities if you are up for it.  I like the culture.It's cool that they stock the office with nice breakfast bars and drinks.Work is 8am to 5pm in the office, some remote..Bringing your ""A"" game is a must.Co-workers are pretty cool."
225,Agios Pharmaceuticals,"A very hard-working group- to be successful here you need to be willing to work hard, but the company culture is amazing and makes it worth it.Every day seemed to be different. I was spread between many different departments and was able to learn a lot. I was primarily in charge of the animal facility and glass wash. I quickly learned shipping and receiving, basic facilities duties, and also started to help out the scientists. I learned many different things from growing and splitting cells to facilities tasks."
274,AgreeYa Solutions,"Manage all sales and recruiting for a large Telecommunications National Account. Responsibilities include “C” level management, developing Statement of Work contracts, and managing the VMO relationship for IT contracting positions.   A track record of opening new accounts and forming client strong relationships.Learned new technologies.coworkers help each other.enjoyed a lot working at this company and would like to work again with this company.Managers work closely with employees.Excellent team to work with, never faced any issues related to salary/ payroll & processed. met all the expectations which is promised, salary always on time and all the HR, Legal and other staff is very courteous and understand issues and try resolving ASAPA typical work day involved reviewing Helpdesk tickets and confirming their severity level.  Resolving issues with hardware such as fax machines copiers printers etc. Setting up new servers pCs for clients so they can perform their duties.What I learned from agree is that the environment was very dynamic. The clients are extremely interested in learning more about career solutions concepts.My coworkers were extremely nice they were generous with their knowledge that they would share at any given time.The hardest part of my job was trying to determine from a client's perspective what was the highest priority item to resolve. Sometimes the clients would come in very confused and in a hurry to get things done. But once I got the client to calm and discuss what was other most pressing needs, the solution became very evident.What I enjoyed the most about Korea solutions was learning new Technology before it even hit the market. We have the latest and greatest software her fingertips. Which may performing our job even easier.Good place to work. No pressure from management.Top level management is very supportive.They need to get more client and should not stick to one single client.Good to work , lot of thing to learn and grow.Management is ok.But facilities to employee can be more.Agree ya specialized in mobile application development. They are preferred vendor for device manufacturers , mobile application and user acceptance testingNo job security and they expect you to come in with a book of business. CRM sucks and they don't give you any warm leads.It was pleasure working for them.It was pleasure working for them.It was pleasure working for them.It was pleasure working for them."
459,AIG,"The company has had turnover in senior management over the last decade.  This unfortunately has created an environment of chaos with regards to having effective management in place.  Many managers typically stay in their office and it is up to the employee to approach the manager vs. the manager actually setting clear and direct communications.  This leads to the overspending of funds for system enhancements and/or projects.  A number of the Project Managers hired recently don't seem to know how to manage a project as those project managers from years ago.  It is unfortunate this company gone from being a great company (with some issues, needless to say) and many, many dedicated employees to a company of counting $$$, which it is wasting on an immense basis.Good work life balance and great benefits. Shift differential for over night shift and benefits for the weekend. International company that has many other offices for international opportunities.There was no room for advancement unless you wanted to move to the technical side of the house and then that wasn't guaranteed. Lots of lay offs with the administrative staff.Really depends on the department you work. During my time there, the company was going through a lot of restructuring which involved a lot of lay offs. So as you can imagine, that environment wasn't really the greatest to work in as many people were worried about Job security. My favorite part about working there though were my managers. Their open door policy, honesty, among many other things made working there quite pleasantI learned a lot at AIG and the management is generally easy to work with.  The hardest part of the job was the way systems were sometime implemented.  The people were the best part of the job.Productive Workplace. I have worked with AIG for eight years and I am currently looking for a Customer Service or Administrative position.They were a great company to work for. They were supportive of all the employees and their job goals. Management and co-workers were very helpful and friendly.Good place to work for a big company, but you only learn a small piece of the company. The people are fun and the environment is okay. Lots of overtime during quarter end, but overall was okayAllowed myself to have creative freedom in a relaxed atmosphere, with great management. AIG did the best to accommodate me for the high costs of living in the San Francisco Bay Area. Only downfall was being laid-off during company cutbacks from a job I truly enjoyed.Overall, I enjoyed my 10 years with AIG.  AIG chose to exit the Employer and Voluntary Group Benefits business and in doing so allowed them to align more closely with the company's organizational goals and vision.  As part of this strategic reorganization, my position as an Account Service Rep, along with hundreds of others, no longer fit in with the new direction AIG is currently undertaking.I enjoy working at AIG.  Awesome teamwork environment.  The work life balance is great.  The management style is very open and laid back.  The most enjoyable part of the job is finding great talent to join the organization.I really enjoyed my time at this company.  I was given the opportunity to learn many areas and had the chance to do all aspects of different positions from data entry, processing, scanning , mail sorting to applications.This was a good job for me to bridge my job loss from AT&T to retirement. I would recomment this company for other job applicants.Overall my experience at AIG was not good. Not clear who your reporting to. 3 changes in management in a 6 month period. Overwhelming tasks, Work/Life balance almost non existent.Head of Department resigned 3 months after I resigned. Good for a single person who is a workaholic.The management is very engaged with their staff and everyone works towards one goal...the customer.  This is a very professional environment with skilled individuals.Handled workers comp claims from beginning to end.  Was allowed to work from home 4 days a week.  Co-workers are very helpful.A typical day at work is a stressful one wondering when you are going to be laid off.  AIG is not a bad company and there is a lot to learn but Management has been concentrating more on the layoff of employees instead of making the employees happy and give them an incentive to stay with AIG.No raises are given.  Benefits are good but moral is not.  The day is like a sword hanging over your head wondering what time it will fall on your head.Could be a great company but it fails.  Different departments doing the same work in different fashions,  why not stream line and handle calls, disbursements and other transaction the say way among all department.  AIG does not value it's employees.enjoyed working as a scheduler but was working 3 jobs and could work the hours. It was too much to handle the hours. I called clients that had a retirement fund with the company and scheduled meetings with their adviser to go over their retirement goalsVery political , high turnover, employee gets burned. there's not too much advancement. stay there not long, can't comment on too much. Can this sight not force people to write review ?Great opportunity to meet people from all walks of life and different parts of the world.  Continued learning and sharing outlooks and outcomes of life experiences."
345,Air Liquide US,"They were kind of stiff not very friendly people yet I was not there that long. I learn how to do footnotes for audit. It was an overall okay place. Don't really remember much.Air Liquide is a great place to work for, my time was cut short to to reduction of force at Bayport complex. I understand the decision since Air Liquide purchased the AirgasMy work at Air Liquide was contract so I can't speak about the benefits.  There were several employees who have been there 16+ years so I'm sure they were fine with their benefits.I love working for htis company. The people and atmosphere were great. I am somewhat disappointed there was no option for permanent hire. I would deifinitley work with them again in the futureOnce a very solid company to work for that prided itself on employee relations. After the buyout, they have slowly moved their top figures in who have no minds of their own. Everyone is just trying to exist while not ruffling any feathers even if it may be valuable to the company. Cronyism has consumed this place and will ultimately suck the life out of you.Air liquide is a very safe company to work for. I got a lot of experience driving those big tankers,my manager was always polite.I learned a lot about cryogenics and loading up those tankers and filling those tanks.Great Company to work for. Going in the wrong direction with the merger into Air Gas, Benefits / Compensation all dropped off dramatically. Supervisor willing to bust your balls, but give you his shirt off his back.I do not want to include a review. Air Liquide is a good place to work I guess the benefits are good. Hydrogen is fun. I once saw a rabbit thereA nice commute. Air Liquide offered great leadership and scheduling to their employees as well as a great benefit package.A typical day at work is fairly simple, calling/emailing customers and helping them with their accounts. I learned how to use different systems on a computer and learned more on how to use a computer and using office. The management is very fair and helpful. My co-workers are delightful people to work with and keep to themselves. The hardest part about my job is to just focus on one thing rather than multiple. The most enjoyable part about my job is that I finish things before my deadline and like to take on new projects when possible.This company likes to engineer everything and is almost too concerned with safety. They are very lean with their money, dumping a lot of work on employees before considering adding head count. If you are driven, smart, an engineer, and can play office politics, you will excel in this company.Was a production tech for 8 years before I finally had enough. There is zero work/life balance. As management sees it, they own you. They run bare bones personnel. Averaged 1300 overtime hours per year the last  4 years. Pay was severally behind the rest of the industry. Benefits became fewer and fewer each year. Maintenance was non-existent. Equipment was always going down. Numerous 36 hr. straight shifts getting the plant back up and running. Thankful everyday I was able to get away from there and find a great job.Became adapt at project management in a short period of time while being given the lead on various capital projects.  Also gained engineering knowledge relevant to each project.  Grateful to be given lead project responsibility and learned a great deal about customer interaction as well as internal interaction within the the course of a project at an early stage in my careerVery poor managment...the work is not all that hard...learning process takes many years. In would not recommend working for this company to anyone.I like working for Air Liquide. They need to work on their communication with employees. The company just went through a merger with Airgas and they have not done a good job at communicating what is going on with our jobs.Nice company and easy going coworkers.  Fast paced and heavy workload. Enjoyed customers and helping everyone out. I learned different to track orders. Also learned the different natural gases supplied by Air Liquide. Hardest part was learning the different sizes of containers. The enjoyable part was learning new things.Air Liquide has provided an excellent opportunity to grow with a multinational company. It has given me a chance to learn a diverse set of technical and interpersonal skills.There was always something new and challenging.  There was always something to learn.  Using our work loading to accomplish daily work orders.  Accomplishing the hardest, most difficult task and achieving outstanding results.If you dare , Air Liquide's management has run there company in the ground the constant waist that has gone on for years has led to management turnover .The day They hire you is the day They begin to Fire you. Driver pay is UNcertain. Air Liquide purchased AirGas. Everything will change. Except Safety Choking the ever loving life out of you. Driver is the the catch all for everyone else not doing their own job. 14 hour days are common. Then your asked to work extra. Life? What Life?  Only Management is allowed a life.AL is a good company as a whole, however I had a negative experience mostly due to my direct supervisor and upper management.  I received very little training and no support from my direct supervisor.  He was oftentimes a hinderence to meeting deadlines.  Even though upper management say they have an open door policy, this is far from the truth.  His open door is open only to his small group of friends.  He didn't want to hear anything I had to say."
260,AIR Worldwide,"Good program for intern, 2 weeks of training gives you good knowledge about insurance industry. Lack of leadership skills in higher management. No innovation.AIR Worldwide is a pioneer in the risk industry. Employees enjoy a good work/life balance, an effective management team, and challenging innovative work. People are from all over the world and most have advanced degrees which makes the environment even more stimulating. Two thumbs way up!Great benefits and location.  The nature of the business and global presence makes it difficult to have a good work life balanceThere is diversity among the ranks, however women are not equally represented in management.I learned how important is QA position for the product. I used to give feedback to the project leads which help them in development of the product.I enjoy working for AIR Worldwide. The people are great, the management is all right - there are few strange policies, but overall are pretty good.I wish the management would have little more trust in people and allow to work remotely. The company looses too many knowledge in good employees due to their migration, and not willing to keep them on staff working from their new homes.Solid company, great opportunity for advancement, but has its drawbacks as well."
52,"Airbnb, Inc.","I host people for Airbnb. It is a lot of fun, and a good way to meet people very different from you. In general, the people who visit are quite nice to have around.I enjoyed the challenge of remodeling my property transforming it into and 11 guest stay.

It also allows me to have an open schedule so that I am not missing out on other things in life.Great Environment. There are thousands of ways to learn and innovate in this environment.

The job was very easy and has limitless benefits. I loved it. If you love people and enjoy entertaining this is the job for you.I love Airbnb. They have provided a way for me to bring in extra income and do what I love most which is to make my home an oasis and to serve guests with a pleasurable experience while staying with me.-Limited to no growth potential-Strong lack of work/life balance-Highly inexperienced management-Lightning fast pace-Burnout environmentGreat second source of income. Lots of freedom to manage your own way. I will continue to rent my home as long as I can. Great idea and I hope it sticks around for years to come.Great company and provides great backup for hosts. Super flexible and they are always there to help a host.  Super fast on response.There are a plethora of people who don't do anything and still have a job. I made one mistake and written up for it and then fired, which wasn't even a rightful termination. Loved the agents and the environment but the clients between 24-7 InTouch and Airbnb have no understanding of valuing their employees.Great work team. Very supportive. Great perks in travel credit I highly recommend working here.They were very flexible and I was able to work from homeI have worked at Airbnb as a Customer experience specialist for about a year.Airbnb is a great company to work for, they have amazing offices and great perks: breakfast, lunch, snacks, health insurance, happy hours, travel coupons every quarters for employees, laptop provided, etc.They take good care of their employees and they have a great on-boarding training.For this position, we usually worked in shift either from Sunday to Thursday or from Tuesday to Saturday.The only drawback while I was there was a lack of consistency between managers across teams but the issue was identified so I am confident that it is being taken care of.Overall, I am very satisfied with the company and its culture and I would recommend working for them.A typical day at work is unpredictable, considering  each case is different. I've learned the victories and difficulties in working with travel/booking. My co-workers are awesome for the most part, I get along with everyone and do not mind helping when needed. The hardest and most enjoyable part of the job would be balancing the stress depending on the level of difficulty behind the case, and the most enjoyable part is saving the day!Hosting and interacting with guests is fun and rewarding.You make new friends, build new relationships, and help people transition from one move to another.The system is easy. Guests see our profile on site and reserve a time. We confirm the reservation and take care of each guest dedicated to achieve guest satisfaction. Management includes collection of deposits for keys and house keeping, house cleaning and maintenance, and showing and guiding guest through residence.The hardest part of the job is receiving a rude guest who is high maintenance and the best way to handle the guest is to be calm and collected. If problems arise, we try to come up with the best solution and best service for that guest. The most enjoyable part of the job is making new friends that have lasted long past their stay.I was my own boss, so I only hosted when I had the time. I learned to manage my time, deal with people from different backgrounds, and learn about different cultures. Cons are: minimum security and could be more than a full time job as I was on call 24/7.It was a interesting complex due to the legalization of Airbnb in NYC. We worked in a cool office space but everyone was assigned a territory."
538,Alion Science and Technology,"Day-to-day tasks are to just do what the government client wants. There is no room for suggestions or creative ideas whether for process, product, or office moral. There is no room for even anonymous suggestions and/or a human resources person to talk to on site.The company itself is average. The office culture is mundane at best.I was a telework employee, but everything at Alion made me feel part of the team.  All support staff were easy to get in touch with and any issues, when they did arise, were addressed quickly.Alion had a great health insurance plan for their employees. Unfortunately, over the 3 yrs. I worked their, out of pocket cost got higher and the match for putting away for retire went away, due to poor management in the corporate headquarters.Employees treated like cattle.  All profits go into the pockets of the highly compensated 10%.  Questionable use of govt funding for company overhead expenses.The company is now owned by a financial firm solely focused on revenue and low bids to win contracts.  Often salaries and benefits of current employees are reduced in order to stay employed on a new contract award.Overall, I would say that this job taught me how to stay on task, even when I did not enjoy the work every day.A typical work day changed on a daily basis. It was the same type of work, but the parts that we worked on changed every couple of days. We assisted in building a radio system to place on the back of military vehicles. There were around 200 pieces that fit on each pallet so we were tasked with putting them together. The job tested my motivation but I was able to push through. My co-workers were good people that were pretty easy to work with. We did not develop any outside of work relationship. The hardest part of the job was doing the same thing about 200 times per day but I learned to persevere. The most enjoyable part of the day was that the day-to-day duties changed.A great working environment full of intelligent professionals. But company leadership has made many bad choices over years, and this has led to hard times in the current industry environment. Two bad quarters and many lost recompetes have led to several hundred employees leaving the company, many involuntarily. Key management has been stripped out so critical thought leadership needed to grow the company is non-existant. Wait a couple of years before considering a job at Alion. They need to turn their ship around first.I have been employed at this company for 11 years there is great opportunity for advancement I have been promoted 3 times in those 11 years, I started off as a temp for 1 year then hired permanently for the past 10 years nothing but growth there are some management who gave me the ability to learn new things I love everything about my position and manager. The most enjoyable thing about working at Alion is the ability to advance and free educational classes.Always a different challenge everyday. Work with amazing people. Personally rewarding due to the fact that we were able to help soldiers regarding fuel, and safety. Cutting edge of technology.Management sometimes makes it feel more like a staffing agency.  High turnover has been constant, management is more concerned with filling a billet for a low rate than anything else.Provided onsite SETA support to Air Force Acquisition.  So, there was limited direct interaction with the company.  Role involved navigating three ISR programs through the Programming, Planning, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) cycle for obtaining funding for these programs.Management does not value or reward employees with a strong work ethic. The most enjoyable part of the job was lunch break and going home for the day.  Management also stressed ""teamwork"", but would allow certain employees to get paid for doing nothing all day.It pays the Bills- Other than that, I would avoid Alion at all costs.  Zero benefits and an imaginary advancement plan.  Not sure if this is twenty words or not.Collaborative work environment with both internal teams and Government customer. Excelling place to gain leadership skills and expertise in your domain.The best part of the job was my contract work for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The work was interesting and provided for the acquisition of new techniques in my profession.It's a good place to get your foot in the door. My coworkers are kind, personable people who gp the extra mile to mentor juniors like myself. The Navy programs that I work on serve as challenging, interesting work.Everyone was focused on customer satisfaction, so there was good teamwork to do the job well.  Upper level management ran the ship aground.A typical day at work was very busy doing multiple tasks throughout the day.   I was in charge of running the facility at every level which I started doing back in 2013 and learned quite a bit on how everything is run.  Management was very supportive and the co-workers were very pleasant and easy to work with.The most enjoyable part of the job is working with highly skilled people in their respective fields.  Co-workers are top notch and create a very enjoyable work environment.Although an ""Alion employee,"" this is in name only for pay, benefits, and tax purposes only.  Am really an employee of the contract.  When the contract ends, employment with Alion ends.  No opportunity for advancement.  Have never discussed future growth opportunities in Alion with any Alion leadership.  Lost over $40,000 when Alion stock tanked and Alion was bought at $1.25 per share.  Think Enron.  Pay frozen for past 2+ years.  Cut out of government award fee bonus.  Would not recommend Alion as a place for employment unless it's the only option until find something better.The company has complex business models and is quite challenging in many aspects. The most enjoyable part of the job are the people, everyone seems very nice."
122,AlixPartners,"16-18 hour days during the busy timesmanagement somewhat disconnectedco-workers are extremely intelligent as there is a very rigorous hiring processAlixPartners is competitive, exciting, and take care of you and will respect your holiday, granted that you put in the hours, the quality and the hands on approach of the firm. This is a great firm for overachievers, and fast paced minded individuals. Work/Life balance is hard due to the nature of the work, but after a couple of months, especially if not coming from consulting, you can make it work. Office politics are important, though not the biggest factor from the analyst to the Director level. Politics become important as you become Director.An eye opening experience in a corporate setting. Everyone I worked with was cheerful and upbeat."
162,Alkermes,"I wasn't there very long so but it was a great environment to learn about GMP.  People, and culture was great and there was great teamwork.Alkermes has an exceptional work life balance and compensation but very poor leadership at the Director level. The company does not promote collaboration between groups and in fact reprimands employees who desire to learn about and meet other key stakeholders that may affect your work. The company in my experience has inadequate training programs that are job specific and expects you to perform at a high level with zero to no training or guidance regarding your Job. The business has a culture of working in silos with strict restrictions on being able to communicate with other people across the organization. Be aware that when you interview for the company the team sells the opportunity to collaborate and bring new ideas, but when you do they may come at the cost of your continued employment. The company is still developing new process and is still junior in this area.Great company in its infancy before becoming a major CNS player.  I currently promote Aristada Injection to all Institutions, CMHC's, and private practice psychiatrists in the Worcester/Western, Ma area.it is a great place to work, with great people. very fast paced and willing to help people move up into higher positions if they have the skills.A great company helping to improve peoples lives!A great culture as well!aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaPeople are generally friendly and communicate well. Room to grow and learn inside after hire. Promotions are available with time. Great benefits and retirement plans. They really care and want people to be happy and taken care of.I was a contract employee at Alkermes.  It was close to home and although it was NOTHING like what they described, it was a good job.  Both the staffing company and the internal management I interviewed with stated it was a lab type job, but it was really a manufacturing-general labor type job that had nothing to do with the degree I received.  Because I was a contract (temporary) employee, I received no vacation or sick days, no benefits, was not allowed to partake in the small raffles (VIP parking spot, vacation day, baskets, etc.), and did NOT receive a shift difference in my pay even though I worked 2nd (afternoon) shift.  I was recently let go because so-called internal moves; this had been planned for a week, yet I was not informed until Saturday, a weekend day we are not scheduled to work, and also informed that my locker would be cleaned out and sent to me.  My supervisor was not consulted in this matter and therefore could not even break the news to me.  Although this may be a great company to work for if you are fortunate enough to be a full time employee, the temporary employee status is definitely not one to recommend, and since 90% of their company is hired through the same staffing company on a temporary basis, I wish every contract employee there the best of luck and hope they do not get what I did not deserve.Excellent company. Great environment, lots of room to grow and advance your career. Would work there again given the chance.Be clear about the role and responsibility during the interview processThis company takes care of its employees and creates a good environment in which to develop your skill set and further your career.I enjoyed working at Alkermes.  I learned a lot about the Pharmaceutical Industry.  Now I understand why some medicines are so costly.Inspected medicine powders before formulating into medicine capsules, Learning procedure for medicine production steps.Staying seated almost the whole 10 hrs. Some requirements for job not so rewarding . Rewarding part of job was Making boxes and filling them with medicine to be accounted for and documented and put in the freezer for holding till ready for capsule filling.Quiet office.Nice people.I was only a temp there so I am not in the position to be writing a review of the company. I enjoyed my experience there and it seems like it would be a great place to work long term.The product is great and the accounts that work within the market are very dedicated to their patients."
696,Allen Institute for Brain Science,"This company is growing and everyone is very passionate about their job.  The company makes an effort to encourage employees to meet with scientists and employees outside the group.  They encourage expose to all areas of research happening there.  There are many opportunities to listen to talks by visiting scientists.Allen institute is organized in industrial style aiming to do big scientific projects in brain science related field. Projects are initiated and monitored by scientific advisory board and committees, managed and executed internally by the management team.Learned the ins and outs of brain scienceRewarding as work will make a difference in long term brain scienceA typical day includes managing multiple projects through the Production pipeline, coordinating with resource managers to schedule core services, and interacting across departments to accomplish aggressive deadlines.  I've learned a lot over the years but the one comment made by my boss that has stood out over the years is: ""communication is all in the delivery"".  The hardest part about the job can be resolving conflicts between differing opinions in each department to accomplish a set goal, but in the end, respect and collaboration will get to the desired results.  And, the most enjoyable part of the job is definitely the people and having a great boss, without these two elements the motivation can be lacking."
394,Allergan,"The people here are wonderful to work with. I wish the company was a little less old fashioned and would allow telecommuting.Great company and products, loved my manager and working for allergan, comp was great and company is growing. highly recommended for sales professionalsAllergan is a strong company that has always had a great culture.  The work/life balance is good.  The benefits and good, but have been slipping over the last few years.  Following the merger with Actavis, the company has been overly focused on mergers and acquisitions and less concerned about research and growing existing product lines.Allergan is a nice company to work for that offers many opportunities with great benefits.  The Orange County campus has amazing talent. Work hours are flexible for most positions.As far as warehouses are concerned, this was a laid back place to work but we also took our jobs very seriously. Management was great and co-workers worked hard.I worked there for over 5 years before the location shut down due to lack of work, combined with other reasons. I really did enjoy the responsibility that the job required.A typical day at work with Allergan varied. I held lunches most days with doctors and staff of the clinic. I learned to be patient and how to make someone's day better. The hardest part of the job was that sometimes the doctors would be extremely busy and not have time to visit with me and go over the products I was representing. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and building strong relationships.Good place to work. Positive and friendly atmosphere. Can play basketball at lunch or go to the company cafeteria. Free gym for Allergan employees and secure parking with several ports for electric cars.I worked in records retention and was a temp employee. My duties were limited and direction was given to permanent employees. Good paying job to have and many options to move around the company.After the Actavis merger and Allergan purchase, there was a rapid change in management  ( three managers in three years) that created a very challenging and strange work enviroment.It's awful to see and hear from others how poor or non existent the culture is at this place.  Management (including Jr/Sr/Executive) is so poor due to the fact the CO only wants to save a buck by putting inexperienced and bewildered people in place just to follow orders like clowns and repeat their superiors like parrots.  It's a good place to stay away from!Womens Health Division. Central/West region is an incredible place to work. Experienced management with great opportunity. Best place to be at Allergan besides Dermatology/Facial division.My experience as a Records Management Associate at Allergan has cultivated in me imperative skills and instilled specific knowledge sure to help me succeed in all my endeavors.selling devices, aesthetics and pharmaceuticals for a top notch fortune 500 leader. innovative and growth pharma on the frontier.  Selling to physicians, hospitals and group purchasing organizations and having the ability to negotiate contracts is a must.  you need to be driven and a leader. Management qualitiesAllergan has been one of the most professional companies I have worked for. The core values that management along with it's peers has made coming to work a delight.Allergan is a forward thinking company that considers its employees as an asset to its success. Great management teams and benefits. A global technology leader and is on the cutting edge of science and technology. They have great benefits and a strong team environment.I took a pay cut since I heard how great Anda was. Their bonus structure is horrible.  Barely make any money, and can't even keep up with bills.  DON'T LIE TO PEOPLE JUST TO GET THEM TO ACCEPT A POSITION.I was a former temporary associate working with the company and they only hire but kissers. I worked for them for two years and never got hired on. I was repeatively passed up by people who were there for three days ind i wad there way longer than them...I was given opportunities to learn different trades. I worked with different people. I enjoyed getting to know about different departments. My supervisor was always there if I had any questions and gave positive feedback and constructive criticism.the territories are quite large and the training was excellent. the expectations for new employees is vast given the geography of the territory. good management and coworker. the hardes part of the job is the size of the territories.Allergan is an awesome company to work for. You get surprise rewards and days off. Our Sr. Site Director has an open door policy. She listens and is really great. The company is understanding to life events and changes. We have a Monday thru Friday schedule only and get all respected holidays off with pay. You couldn't ask for more than that.we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives. We strive to set the standard for quality, safety and value in the discovery, development and manufacture of health care products.

149,"Allergan, Inc.","The people here are wonderful to work with. I wish the company was a little less old fashioned and would allow telecommuting.Allergan is the result of mergers and acquisitions and as such comes changes and job uncertainty. As with all changes come some good management and some arrogant management, with the latter a reason for good people not to stay. When you hear the peers of the bad manager even criticizes them it make you wonder why they are kept on in the first place.Allergan is a strong company that has always had a great culture.

Work life balance is not as good. Hard working people with a good compensation package. The opportunity for advancement is good since there are many divisions.I am grateful for the years at KMGL for teaching me how to be a hungry salesperson working for 100% commission.  My co-workers were fantastic and helped me to further grow in sales.  However, it is difficult to endorse a company that gives so little support and compensation to their sales staff.A tyical day at work begins with assessment of what previous shift had done and what is priority at the moment according to management business interest for the day.Team work are highly examplify in the way the process is arranged. No one person can run the process from start to finish. You need one or two people to verify part of the work you have done.The hardest part of the job is that some of the equipment in use is highly complex.Whenever target is met brings moment of celebration. This is my joyous moment.The people I work with throughout the US and even globally have been a real pleasure.  People are responsive and it's been a real team effort that's really hard to find these days.My only complaint is that the company is changing rapidly and there's really not a feeling of stability.  The buying and selling of assets is constant and at the highest level everyone else is just a number.  Once you get down to the director level and below it's the greatest of experiences, but the CEO only has corporate interests in mind.You can be relocated and happy you survived the most recent merger and then let go six months later in the next deal of a lifetime.Allergan is a terrific company with regards to the neuroscience division.  Botox is a tremendous product for their therapeutic indications, more specifically Chronic Migraine.  The direction of the company has become much more focused over the last 15 years.  Allergan is a wonderful company to work for, where I have developed great relations with many individuals.  Calling on key injectors in multiple cities.  The expectations from Allergan management is 6.5 call per day, which I exceeded.I learned how to evaluate situations which included; Sales data, understanding the color profiles of each office to effectively communicate with specific offices/individuals and forecasting sales results.My co-workers have been wonderful.  I have developed many lasting relationships with many individuals.The most difficult part of the job is at times, excessive administrative work with a short turnaround.  I enjoy selling Botox because of the benefits to patients, and listening to patients who rave about life changing results based on their therapyThe work is very easy an 3rd grader can do it, but the work environment and management is extremely poor. One the worst company's I have ever worked for. If one manager doesn't likes you the rest doesn't either, you never get off at shift end time. The worker's most of them are lazy and they don't do anything about it. They just had two lay offs and the last year and a half if you have standards do not apply for this company. The hiring manager feed you a bunch of lies to make you think it's a great company to only be hired and find out it was all lies!  Only great thing this company has to offer is health insurance.It's awful to see and hear from others how poor or non existent the culture is at this place.  Management (including Jr/Sr/Executive) is so poor due to the fact the CO only wants to save a buck by putting inexperienced and bewildered people in place just to follow orders like clowns and repeat their superiors like parrots.  It's a good place to stay away from!Great working environment.  Really good people who act very professional.  The only problem is that most of the jobs available are only contigient so the only benefits are what you get from the temp agency.Good leadership and co workers, also great benefits and time off. Also, great job to help start a career in pharmaceuticals."
607,Allied Minds,It was a really good company where i can gain lots of professional experience and the people in there are really nice. The salary is high than the average level.
366,Allstate Insurance,"See above, work load always very heavy, employees stress levels extremely high. 2 people actually walked out after I was laid off. The hardest part of our day was prioritizing as everything was equally important.During my time at allstate I was able to perform in numerous areas such as personal lines adjuster, bodily injury claims, auto theft claims, auto appraiser, auto management and property appraiser. The company trained me in all aspects including creating an outstanding customer experience. Management provided the necessary tools and skill set I needed to perform my daily job. Allstate is extremely customer focused but at the same time, very employee focused. Allstate does a good job ensuring employees are given every opportunity to succeed. Differing opinions are encouraged. New ideas are solicited and open communication is welcomed. I enjoyed my time at allstate.Allstate was the best i have experienced in terms of a company actually caring about their employees. Although they couldn't satisfy everyone, they tried! I give them an applause for their efforts in trying to focus on work and life balance for their employees. Still it is a job or career path, and they have to do some things in the eyes of corporate as a business,which can at times feel a little too scripted and repetitive. Overall if you are looking for a reliable and respectable good paying job and for a company who treats their employees well, then this may be a good fit for some of you out there. Most of all, i will miss the awesome potlucks and free prize giveaways there.Overall, a good place to work. The last couple of years have been fraught with uncertainty. There is a definite push to outsource job functions. For an entry level position good place to start. You receive  pretty training. There are opportunities for advancement if you work hard and use the talent development tools available. The hardest part of this job was having to say goodbye to people that you've worked with for many years due to restructuring and outsourcing. What I learned is that you can accomplish anything you set your mind to if you use tools available such as networking and ensuring your manager knows what you want to achieve.Overall, Allstate is a great company at which to work. They provide a great compensation package. Allstate is a large company, with over 30,000 employees. Any company of that size, of course, has areas of opportunity, but Allstate does not run from them. They are constantly pursuing improvement. I plan to be with Allstate until I retire. They are an extremely ethical company, and they work to always be customer focused. I do feel appreciated at work, and I am consistently pushed and coached to always do the right thing for the customer.Responsible for performing clerical and administrative duties in an office setting. Assisted executive assistants and secretaries by sorting mail, filing, answering phones, greeting clients, This job allowed me to build a rapport with customers. The management and my co-workers were very encouraging and supportive of my ambitions both inside and out of work. I handled correspondence, preparing reports, maintaining office files and inventory. They are also responsible for limited bookkeeping activities, taking messages and preparing outgoing emails.Working for this company expect to be burnt out and overworked. The company only cares about productive and numbers. Only promote if they like you. If you have any college background please......stay far away from this company. The individuals that are in mgmt doesn't have any college education however are responsible for your future. If you want to work for insurance please go to Progressive or AAA...where they actually pay you a decent rate. Oh yeah you will have no personal life once you work here. Your coworkers will throw you under the bus to make themselves look better for mgmt.A typical day of work for me is driving 48 miles to work arriving 2 hours before opening to get a head start on the day.  Focus on meeting company sales goals while training new sales staff as well as holding tenured staff accountable.  Over the years I have learned how to manage multiple books of business as well as interview/hirer new staff, implement onboarding processes, train on policies/procedures for sales.I'm one of 4 individuals that runs the organization.  My title is Director of sales.The hardest part of the job is realizing that I have not further opportunity to grow or attain equity in the company after investing 10 years while helping grow the overall book of business by 45 million. The most enjoyable part of the job has been gaining wisdom of managing several small businesses while increasing my overall sales/management skills.The way this company and their offices operates the workplace is great.  The positions here allow employees to keep work in the office and not take it with us when off the clock.  It is very flexible there as far as requesting days off, days switches, vacations, etc.  The position I work in, though, is very intense--it is not an easy job; however, the compensation is what makes me continue to work as hard I have been, and strive for even better.  The job and company overall is definitely customer service driven and focused.  Having to investigate liability from a car accident, and delivering the not so good news when someone is found responsible for a loss is one of the most challenging part of this job.  Also, if you are not organized and fail to properly time manage, you will have a very hard time succeeding in this position.Thought it was a great place to work my first 6mos....but they want you to work for peanuts compared to the other insurance companies. They push more and more and more work on you and if lucky you'll get a 2-4% raise (maybe). Management changed too much for my liking and all they care about are the numbers not the employees (don't be fooled). You're sold a bunch of wooden nickels at this company, a lot of pipe dreams.... To many meetings and not enough development of employees.....I could go on and on ....only gave two stars because a few of the co workers were greatIt is a very stressful job. I have learned a lot of skills and you are critiqued on every thing you do. I have learned about production type work, developed a keen eye to search out problems. The hardest part of my day is all day, every piece of work that you touch could have the potential of being placed under scrutiny and you get dinged on minute issues. The most enjoyable part of my job was PTO and office recognition times which were far and few between.A typical day is busy handling calls and new files.  I learned all aspects of the auto insurance business.  Management is traditional and conservative.  The co-workers were the best part of the job.  The most difficult part of the job were technical issues.  There were many which delayed and frustrated employees and clients alike.  The benefits are still fairly good but diminishing yearly.I come into work and log in to my computer. First thing I do is check my email and process any service work that may need to be done. After that, I make about 200 calls throughout the day to sell insurance. I manage the staff and help them close policies and process service work for their clients as well. My co workers are great. I trained my current employer and have a great working business relationship with him and the other two guys that I work with. The hardest part of my job is trying to keep the clients at renewal.Allstate is a great place to start your career because of the flexibility of working in a smaller capacity agent. Much more room for you to go at your own pace. Good products but limited lines of business. Management can be fickle depending on the office you're in. Overall it's a good employer with a strong brand.Typical day at work is you go and sit at your desk and take anywhere from 40 - 90 calls a day assisting customers and local agents with information and changes on policies. I learned a lot of information about insurance and how the whole business is ran and how insurance works. I learned what not to do as a leader. I did learn some good leadership skills. Learned about insurance laws, Learned how to provide premium customer service. Learned the psychology behind customer service and people. Most of my co workers are awesome and great people, hard workers and very intelligent. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the stress of people calling in and yelling about premium increases and when people make mistakes. Dealing with all the corporate jargon and the company refusing to change for the better.Not amazing because the management is very low quality. Unfair hourly raises, and unprofessional sources. The most enjoyable part was time spent with coworkers and days that lunch was provided for us. The hardest part of the job was the fact that there were no new leads which carried into no new income for comission.I love building business and new relationships.  Fast paced position that is rewarding in recognition and compensation.  I have learned that to manage a team effectively you have to be able to lead from the front.  Time manage is critical for success.  The toughest part of my job is work life balance.  I enjoy helping people.a typical day at work is taking over 60 calls assisting customers with policy changes and billing questions. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to provide and effortless experience to all customers and hearing them say how much we`re appreciated. the hardest part of the job is not having any work life balance.A typical day was to have all technology functioning to perform a fantastic day of sell. Taking care of customer needs and staff needs all day and troubleshooting when necessary in order to meet expectations. At the en of the day will have end of day reports ready.Management were willing to accommodate much of our needs  and keep us inform of any new innovations or tactics to move forward.  Co-workers were very friendly and willing to cooperate with any given task.I enjoyed taking care of customer and meeting staff expectation.Administered the equitable recovery on 550 and third party administrator claims, including worker’s compensation, auto, general and product liability, integrated disability, claim administration, and risk management services nationwide.Established strategic connection with SRS claim directors and account managers to certify that data integrity remained high while reducing collection time.Communicated with claimant’s counsel to quickly resolve medical liens while preserving a high net recovery.Company experiencing growing pains. More employees need to be accountable. Compensation and benefits are above the norm. I personally traveled every week spending 3-4 nights in hotels. I would have  liked to have more contact and visits with home office."
375,Allstate Insurance Company,"See above, work load always very heavy, employees stress levels extremely high. 2 people actually walked out after I was laid off. The hardest part of our day was prioritizing as everything was equally important.Answering phone calls for agents. Using multiple screens and systems  answering agents questions about polices and company procedures. Performance based on calls per minute and quality.I work at a good office. My hours are flexible. I will say the pay is not  the best but I do have a great Boss. He is very fare,open minded and assist all his employees when needed.Insurance isn't for everyone but it's for anyone.It is what you make it. a great way to meet people, help families, and build a career. Tough sales requirements.Every day you will start off where you ended yesterday, because there is so much work that it never stops coming or slows down.  You just jump in and get at it.  That part was great!I learned so much about insurance policies, how they cover you and also how much red tape there is as well.The management is the only part that I really have an issue with.  They do not have a backbone and will not stand up for their employees even though the employee has gone above and beyond all other employees to think outside the box to get work completed for the best outcome for our customers.A complete disregard for work completed and work that was also above the original job duty and description.  Loyalty is everything and it is hard to work for a company that is only loyal to themselves and not the employees on the front line helping to put things back together for our customers in difficult times.Also management would tell you all year long how good you are doing during mid-year or quarter reviews, but at the end of the year would come out of the wood works with the very smallest things so thy can use that against you for a pay increase.  So you would work all year thinking everything is fine and it isn't.  That is cheating and no one grows, because you have no idea what to do at that point.We sold property and casuality insurance with a focus on homeowners products. Life and Health business was referred to an outside agent.good place to grow, great customers, great team, you will need to be licensed in order to sell insurance, flexible schedule. fast pacedMy co-workers are a awesome crew of people to work with. As a team we excel and get the job done. we work together and thrive together.	Managed portfolio of over 100 insurance claims	Ensured compliance with Federal, State and local collection regulation laws at all times	Provided customer service regarding claims issues and account adjustments 	Coordinated daily interaction with clients, staff and other insurance companies  	Scheduled car inspections	Provided Administrative Support to incoming Claims Associates	Processed claims in timely mannerAt Allstate Insurance I worked as a Sales Associate. Throughout the duration of this position, I completed tasks, like providing clients with insurance quotes and quality follow up service. I, also, acted as a professional/personal assistant to the Owners and assisted with other tasks, like scheduling appointment, providing child care, and completing out of the office errands.great place to workawesome benefitsgood environmentfun peoplegood management holidays off time offno dramaloved this placeadvancement opportunitiesA typical day is text book 5 star corporate culture...I learned almost everything I know about Corporate Support at AllstateMy manager knew how to encourage and grow his employees..I was  a temp. so its really hard to rate fairly. I would just say, I would recommend it. The pay is decent. its a typical work schedule. monday - friday.Allstate has great benefits and wages. They provide extensive training and care for their employees.  The management here is friendly and fun. I really recommend Allstate as an employer.Selling insurance for Allstate is a great start but chances for advancement beyond an office management position are slim. The company needs to provide agencies a more clear cut way to identify problems with customer accounts so they can fix them on a local scale.Allstate was the best i have experienced in terms of a company actually caring about their employees. Although they couldn't satisfy everyone, they tried! I give them an applause for their efforts in trying to focus on work and life balance for their employees. Still it is a job or career path, and they have to do some things in the eyes of corporate as a business,which can at times feel a little too scripted and repetitive. Overall if you are looking for a reliable and respectable good paying job and for a company who treats their employees well, then this may be a good fit for some of you out there. Most of all, i will miss the awesome potlucks and free prize giveaways there.I love building business and new relationships.  Fast paced position that is rewarding in recognition and compensation.  I have learned that to manage a team effectively you have to be able to lead from the front.  Time manage is critical for success.  The toughest part of my job is work life balance.  I enjoy helping people.Typical day was taking order for customers. I learned excellent customer service skills and patients when i comes to dealing with difficult customers. Management was amazing I loved working with the owner I felt he was understanding and instructive. Everybody there was easy to work with and great at what they did.Not the best job, Main campus closed down so wouldn't know if Hudson will soon as well, Pretty much management was down your back at all times about stats.Family oriented, helpful, diversity. We have many employees with long term experience and tenure. I look forward to coming to work and assisting the customers as well as my fellow employeesI came in as a temp so my job position of transferring was easy. The worst thing about the job is that it isn't loyal to employees. At any given moment you could lose your job."
252,Alpha Analytical,"I was an extraction technician.I learned a lot about GPC repair and operation.Co workers were pleasant.The hardest part of the job, was gutting fish samples and mixing them with methyline chloride for extraction.Careful taking a job here - the problem with this company begins at management. They work everyone like dogs, pay low while management takes big salaries and bonuses. The workforce is pitted against each other and turnover is high.Don't waste your time here - look elsewhere.Great co-workers. under paid and over worked employees. bad company morale. However, they give bonuses and chances to win gift cards every so often. sometimes have mandatory overtime.A lot of turn over in the lab.  no room for advanecment.  long hours and very depending on time restraints.  Owners are very family oriented where management is not.Privately-owned company, 250+ employees, based in Westboro, Mass servicing many states.  Analytical lab providing air, water and soil analysis.When I was first hired I loved my job and the people I worked with.  Bonuses galore and great opportunities. I moved up very quickly and worked well with everyone. As I moved up, roles and responsibilities were increasingly unclear which often could cause problems when resolving issues. Management was different in each area. Some management was phenomenal and would work with you while other managers were unbearable and unmoving. Culture was different in one facility to the next.BAD MANAGEMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!BAD PAY unless you ARE MANAGEMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Owner should be ashamed for letting this company run as it does. Problem is he trusts MANAGEMENT.Problem of this laboratory is MANAGEMENT. Find another job. You'll be wondering why you took this job in a few months. It will be just a waste of your time.This was my first job out of college and was unaware how bad the conditions and treatment of employees. Subsequently I stayed, worked for four years, foolishly thinking that if you work had you will get reworded for it. Don’t be fooled, don’t work here unless you have to. They under pay and overwork employees. Also guilt or hold your job over your head to increase your work output. Please for anyone that reads this do yourself a favor and work anywhere else. Laboratory conditions are bad for your health management does not care how hard or effectively you work. Good luck to you if you work here and good luck trying to leave once your there. A nickname we used as inmates / employees was Alphatraz.The work and the culture of the company are quite rewarding personally and professionally. The lack of compensation in salary is what makes this company not a great one.  They seem not to mind a high turnover rate from employees.  The are a stepping stone for recent college graduates who eventually move on to better paying companies.most people are great, but be prepared to long hours.  Typical small company problems, but also the benefitssame as previously stated/reviewed. Intelligent and extremely dedicated co-workers who I thoroughly enjoyed working with and being around on a day to day basis.Despite being a company that deals with a 24 hour turn around time the atmosphere is upbeat."
598,Altamira,"Good company, great people.  future is brightWork as a team and each individual contribution is receivedLearned the inner workings of HADOOP, MAPREDUCE, HDFS, SCALA &SCALDINGHardest part of the job....coming up with solutions to the clients problemsjust for working with adults with disabilities you get paid kinda like babysitting. they actually make sure the people that are working are people that can be trusted.Altamira is the merger of Invertix and NearInfinity. One was a services/butts-in-seats company and the other was a straight technology company. Over the last year, there has been a lot of shifting around. They spend a little on R&D but mostly it's onsite services contracts.Altamira, FKA Invertix, has been a great group to work for.  I really don't have any negative information to provide, they always did what they said they would and provided me with ample opportunity.I worked outside the facility. My job was direct support to the individual I was working with, in the community environment.The small company mentality of relying only on those in the 'in  crowd' poisons the atmosphere.  No attempt is made to create a team oriented environment anyone would want to work in.  There is a no awareness of a lack of tech leadership."
549,Altamira Technologies Corporation,"Purposeful and meaningful works and please to work wit competent like minded individuals.Great people!  Great drive!  Great benefits!  To include, didn't have to pay for the insurance the company did all you had to do was pay for the co pay.

124,Alten Calsoft Labs,Very busy for the most of the day.Has good infrastructure.Management is really experienced.Co-workers are very co-operative.Hardest part of job is high expectations.
164,Amazon,"Amazon is a fast-paced, exciting place to work. I highly recommend anyone to apply. Management was strong and colleagues were great.A typical day is a 10 hour shift where management is expected to arrive 1 hour early and leave 1 hour late - in order to prepare for the day and then report on the days results to upper managementI have learned a lot working for Amazon, i have developed my leadership skills tremendously. I have gained experience in developing a team, in performance managing hundreds of direct reports. I have gained knowledge in lean methodologies and performed a multitude of process improvement initiatives.You have to be a certain type of person to succeed in this role. It is most definitely not a 9-5 type of job. The hours are long and the expectations are high. The payoff is good when you have the right team and are in a department where you can flourish.Amazon allows its associates to advance and develop their career opportunities through different programs but the amount of work and mandatory overtime required makes it a very hard and exhausting place to work. The balance between personal and work life becomes difficult to manage due to the amount of hours required to work and the compensation and benefits are not worth it.Even though Amazon can be a fun place to work with many incentives, fun activities, holiday celebrations and more, the tasks become repetitive and boring after a few months making it difficult for the associates to stay motivated.I worked at Amazon for a few months, as well as Integrity Staffing. For one, they are very unorganized. They provide very poor training but expect high rates with little errors. I only got trained for 5 hours on my first day and the other half of the shift I worked in the MOD. I got fired for productivity, which was due to poor training. I learned how to  perform my job better while I was on my final write up and getting retrained, however it was too late. I asked managers several times to move me so I wouldn't lose my job but nobody seemed to care. I worked there for 2 months and got fired. Managers were very rude to me as well. One manager told me if I didn't speed it up I was going to get terminated. I really didn't enjoy my time at Amazon, I feel like they didn't give me a chance.Though Amazon is a growing company, upward mobility only exists for those straight out of college or former military. The pay is well below industry standard at all levels. Management is typically inexperienced and unguided. Though there are many different schedules to work, Amazon is quite rigid with transfers of shifts and departments. Mandatory overtime is commonplace and there are more than six weeks of black out annually, in which vacation time is not allowed to be used. The education program is a joke as you are only allowed to pursue a handful of career paths, all of which amazon only assists to an associates degree which is useless in almost every field. The hours are long, tedious and physically demanding. Injuries are commonplace but the onsite medical staff is extremely rude and uncaring so most people hide injuries and seek out their own medical care.10 hours spent on your feet all day and constantly moving across an incredibly large three level warehouse describes a normal day.  Half of my coworkers did not want to be there and their lack of motivation or sense of doing things correctly ultimately made the job far more difficult to accomplish.  Management seems only to care about the numbers, nothing else.  Since speed of work is everything you better hope you don't run into a problem (there were always problems) since resolving it means you need to walk to a specific station and you also need to hope you aren't 5th in line.good benefits but not a job to make a career out of, they treat their workers poorly. The management team needs some improvement and the pay is not worth the hours they are asking for.The co workers don't work together as a team and everybody is for their self.To me its a great job to start out from but not a job to stay for years.The only thing that's good about this job is the benefits one of the main reason why i still currently work their but the money doesn't support my family needs.The hardest part about this job is all the changes they make unannounced.,the relationship with the management teamand the empolyees.I do not enjoy this job so i'm currently searching for further employment.I worked there for 2 years and took the buyout. They have little events and play games sometimes that are fun but...Never have I been anywhere so micro-managed in my life. If you were breathing wrong, they dinged you for it. They set high rate goals and play favorites heavily. I was a favorite of my manager and got a lot of perks. I tried to work hard, but once they terminated that manager, I was sent back to packing from being a Lead. If you can suck up and don't mind a brown nose, you can make it there no problem. If you want a paycheck and that is it, you can do it. If you want to make a career, keep looking unless you have a MBA.Being a quality auditor for Amazon.com was a great job. Although it was sometimes repetitive warehouse work, I was always rewarded with great wages, challenging situations, and most importantly an unlimited opportunity for advancement. I was also inspired by a CEO that has a devotion for community, family, and the less fortunate. A humble man who wants to see the world improve. That simple idea provided me with motivation. This is a perfect example of a self-made man who started with a small garage operation and turned it into a huge success. The company also excels at the most important part of business, phenomenal customer service.I enjoyed  working  there, was fired  due  to not meeting  rate, which I wasn't  informed  of a rate system  being that I never worked  in wherehouse before, they should  inform new hires of the productivity  requirement,  which they don't, so they will know what to expect, they make everything sound  good at orientation, meanwhile  never telling  new hires what is expected  of them in order to keep your jobs, there  more harder on pickers than packers, that company  is not fair to all there employees, a lot of favoritism. They are a very unfair  company  to work for, I couldn't  even appeal my termination, they made a mistake  and I wasn't  employed for 90 full days, so I can't appeal there  decision, totally  unfair, so I could never work for  them again. Wow  what an incentive for being  fired  you guys suck to the fullest.The particular site I worked at was not adequately staffed since day one. This caused a lot of strain on staff with daily tasks, reports and case load. First site I worked for was great, however the last site was severely lacking in all areas. It depends which site you go to as to the individuals success. This company is very metric driven and does not put the needs or care of the customer or associates working for them ahead of the metrics. Their processes need significant improvement internally. Otherwise it was a great experience at my first site, which is how most of the sites should be run.Awesome managers who listen and work hard to resolve any issues you have. Positive work environment and feedback from co-workers all the way down to human resource.Hardest part of my job was adjusting to walking on the cement floors for 10 hours and finding smaller items quickly.Most enjoyable part of the job was the prizes we won for our efforts and meeting my co-workers.I learned how to work hard and feel proud to finish a job to completion and that hard work pays off! I also learned great time management skills and how to be attentive to detail.One of the worst places I ever worked. I hate how they treat their employees like a number, HR is the worst ever!! There is really no structure, rules changes everyday, to many kids. Coworkers are awesome, the managers, ops managers don't have degrees in their positions. Managers have to many favorites. You really have to kiss butt to move anywhere or try to learn new positions. This place is nothing but about NUMBERS....Could be so much better, if only they cared about their employees.I recently quit working with Amazon and had many reasons for leaving. I had a difficult commute which was the primary factor in my departure. During my time there, my leadership team was always vigilant in making things better for our associates and our customers. I have had the opportunity to work with some really great people and the culture and internal advancement opportunity was great. The majority of my managers were really wonderful people that worked hard to support me and help me develop in my career.Amazon is a continuous improvement environment. They stand behind their principles, one of which is dealing with ambiguity. With stock prices soaring, the prospect of receiving compensation in the form of stock, as well as competitive wages in management roles the job seems alluring. All management roles go thru a rotation of departments, times, and days. This is an effort to round out each candidate to help them rise thru the ranks. This can be tough for anyone with smaller children. The fast paced environment can also lead to meteoric rises for some and wastelands of underdevelopment from others. Conference calls are attended by yes men and eager pleasers who aren't willing to push back on the view from the top.Amazon is a difficult place to work. My job was not stable you never new if you were going to have a job then next day. The management was very poor. They would always run out of equipment and you would have to figure out how to do your job with out your tool. Co-workers were very plesant, we would all try to keep a positive attitude and be up beat.Working at Amazon I learned a lot. I have learned how work threw difficult time in a work environment and how to suck it up and work with whom ever you may have to work with. Long hours and hard work is a lot easier with a positive attitude.Everything about this place reminds of prison, from the orange vest they make you wear, to the safety line you have to walk in, to the constantly working on your feet. Your not being paid to think just work. Supervisors always on your back, similar to a Corrections Officer. Your hard work gets unnoticed so don't try and give 110%, try 65% instead. Work is extremely easy but boring. It's hard to get fired, you pretty much fire yourself by constantly being late or not showing up for workAmazon.com fulfillment Center is an okay place to work. They work you like a dog with working long hours for minimal pay. The benefits of physically working there do not outweigh the costs associated with this type of manual labor. Amazon benefits are good for healthcare, time off, and having an annual picnic. The management always is new and don't necessarily know what they are doing, thats why there is a high turnover rate with management and other employees.There is nothing but drama, drama, drama, backstabbing at this place i mean you have a CEO who is the 3rd richest man in the united states and we work for pennies! Ive been employed almost 5 years and just this week got a 75 cent raise so i make 13.75, but new employees starting are making 11.50 to 12.00 and they just started, does anyone see a problem with that? We have a very big turn over especially MANAGEMENT most of the are kids and dont have a clue! AMAZON cares about its customers, but as far as its employees they dont care how much time we are away from our familes, terrible attendance policy, try to limit our time to go on a BATHROOM BREAK! They claim they do so much for us, we work for everything we are entitled to like our stocks we are given but we have to pay the taxes on them, so basically we are paying for them twice we have to work for them then pay the taxes on them. Our HR department is a joke they are not nice and hateful! You ask a ? And you will get 20 different answers, or i dont know i will have to get back to you ( weeks later)You cannot get full time work.  Management seems disorganized. No explanation of what a PA's job actually is so they appear to be doing nothing but staring at computer screens.  Same with management. Staring at computer screens.   High turnover rate.   No promotions, no raises.   Option to become ambassador and take on more responsibility without more pay. Training was a joke.   Weird clapping and chanting at beginning of shift. All about increasing productivity without any rewards.Amazon is an amazing place to work, it's diverse culture, meeting people from all walks of life is just a blessing. Management's open door policy, where everyone is there to support you and make your work easy, fair and achievable goals are set. your opinion no matter how small is heard, makes me feel belonged and important.Priority to safety, amazing healthcare benefits, career choice plan, outstanding maternity/paternity leave, paid personal time off etc.. i could go on and on."
663,Amazon Corporate LLC,"Amazon is a fast-paced, exciting place to work. I highly recommend anyone to apply. Management was strong and colleagues were great.A typical day at work here is always crazy because they set new rules everyday. I have learned to just suck it up and go with what ever come my way for that day. Management has no clue of whats going on. they are some good and some bad coworkers as every job is going to have. But I'm a people person anyway so I'm not really bothered by anyone. The hardest part of my job is having no good direction and no routine at all, everything is so disorganized. The most enjoyable part is only when i get the opportunity to learn new things,One of the worst places I ever worked. I hate how they treat their employees like a number, HR is the worst ever!! There is really no structure, rules changes everyday, to many kids. Coworkers are awesome, the managers, ops managers don't have degrees in their positions. Managers have to many favorites.

This place is nothing but about NUMBERS....Could be so much better, if only they cared about their employees.Amazon is a great company to work for.  If you enjoy working in a fast paced environment without supervision; this is the company for you.  It is a good company. They give great incentives, especially; during the holiday.  They practice good safety standards for a warehouse. The best thus far. State of the Art facility and equipment. The company is growing and expanding more and more. An excellent opportunity to learn more about the fulfillment industry.Amazon is a job with great positives that rope you in. They have awesome pay, with minimal requirements. As well as immediate benefits and plenty of overtime. Which is perfect for seasonal workers. But when you are looking to advance you realize the dirty game Amazon plays. Incentives and bonuses are not give, after working so hard to be earned. The stress, from the condition of the environment you work in, combats the mental/physical stress of doing the work at benchmark. There is absolutely no kind of job security. The job just take more from you then you'll ever recieve.Everything about this place reminds of prison, from the orange vest they make you wear, to the safety line you have to walk in, to the constantly working on your feet. Your not being paid to think just work. Supervisors always on your back, similar to a Corrections Officer. Your hard work gets unnoticed so don't try and give 110%, try 65% instead. Work is extremely easy but boring. It's hard to get fired, you pretty much fire yourself by constantly being late or not showing up for workI enjoy my position.  Fun working atmosphere with great Supervisors.  Great benefits.  Hands on supervision.  My typical day at work begins with a stand up procedure to receive all updated announcements.  Work starts out with clocking in to your computer and getting the products ready to Prep...e.g., bagging, taping, bubble wrap, etc.Hardest part of the job is standing on your feet for 10 or 11 hours a shift.Most enjoyable is sitting down at break and lunch.  Resting your feet as much as possible.  Sharing important information with each co-worker to be sure the job process is successful.I wanted to make permanent but has worked there during peak season. It seems like management should know a good worker to refer. i enjoyed working on the dock and even got told by the supervisors that they like my work ethics at work .hardest part was lifting things too heavy or finding out who pulled the e brake to rest the whole conveyor belt for the dockI enjoyed working with my co workers who were willing to work with you and the bosses loved that i would always be willing to help and to learn new work task.A typical day at work would consist of safety checks, start meetings about company numbers and progress. I've learned how to work in a fasted pace production environment, I learned data entry skills,shipping and receiving skills and also I learned how to be proactive in going above and beyond (safely) the call of duty. I like the management because of their experience to teach and provide incite. The hardest part of a job for me was being in an environment where I'm not able to grow. The most enjoyable part of a job would be the people that I worked with which made the time go by fast.Amazon is a very cultural  work place its fun to meet different employees from all over the world. Management and everything about the place is very organized very well.In order to work at amazon you have to be able to work hard and work long shifts daily. The hardest part of the job is the parking lot having patience with the long traffic that comes with working at a very large building. I've learned how to stay focus for a long period of time, how to talk to be people who knows little English, how to act under pressure, and how to be a hard working employee.Loved, loved loved my job at Amazon and was more than thrilled to go in. However the men working there are all a bunch of horndogs without a clue. They dont mind to do as they please and grope you at any given point. Management never done a thing to help. Other than the pig like men, its extremely enjoyable, fast paced and a very friendly/diverse environment. Plus SO many benefits and great time off plan!I believe that if they took control of bad situations that they would be able to have a lower turn over rate. In a typical day they would make you go over the same thing over and over and it was incredibly tedious. I felt that if they put people in certain jobs and considered their abilities and put them in functions that would work better for them, they would have a better work atmosphere.There is absolutely no supervision. They can't keep employees because their rate is too low, the main reason being that employees are too busy socializing and flirting with each other to care. Employees are having ""relations"" in their cars, married and single alike. Safety is also not a concern. There is a lot of horseplay going on. Employees locking wheels on a co-workers cart, taping up the wheels, sticking their feet under a passing coworkers cart's wheels, etc. The employees don't go to work to perform their duties, they go for other reasons. Some employees don't care about the work as much as the at work social life they have, and as a result, merchindise gets damaged.•	Working on Software Development in Digital Software and Video Games Platform.•	Created Auditing System which is a real time expert system implementing business rules. It was required for predictive maintenance and process validation.•	Created a Rules Engine to fire and execute rules and perform required fixations as predictive maintenance.•	Designed the application on Service Oriented Architecture, created services and used Guice Dependency Injection for the faster instantiation and execution of services.Amazon can be a great place to work, they are understanding if you have a family to care for. They do many events for the employees to make things fun,but if you are a seasonal employee your chances of being hired on permanently can be very slim. with the good , and the bad it's still a good place to work.U can work really hard for this company and if u mess up just a lil they we let u go really fast, they say they care about u but they really don't.  all they care about is numbers not the people who works hard. ask anybody there about break time, u only get really is a 9-10 min. break for a 10-11 hr days they r crazy. it takes u 2-3 walk to the break room and 2-3 walk back  u do the math.  to many managers telling u what to do. These workers need to get paid more at Amazon.!!!  Walmart's warehouse get's better pay, lot's of people here left Amazon to Walmart  to better them self. U go to work each day thinking em i getting fired today, not funThere's very little work life balance for most people who want to move up, and the managers are constantly changed around between buildings and departments. In order to move up there's a huge barrier to entry level advancement as Amazon needs base labor, so the majority of folks who start at T1 end at T1. That said, there's a lot of opportunity to grow within your area, and if you're seen as a leader you can become an Ambassador.It was a decent place to work for. Working there is good way to lose weight. The amount of work they expect you to do vs the amount of pay they give you isn't totally worth it. They give you a monthly bonus based on the whole builds productivity instead of your own personal productivity which is not right in my opinion. If you place 2 pieces of product into a wrong bin out of 5,000 plus you do a day they will give you a big lecture on how you are doing a bad job and need to do better or you will get a write up.Don't treat British people nice , rude,nasty attitude have no respect when it comes to their employees where I suffered from anxiety and it isn't a nice place to work where they were pressuring people to keep to speed with targets and productivity which is a form of bullying and punishing the sick people too money too badWarn people who to apply for this could happen to yourselvesGreat benefits after 1 year mark , manangent needs a little work.very fast pace and they don't have any problem getting rid of you , your always walking on egg shells , you only have a certain amount of time you can take off, you get personal like 40hrs (4 days) ,80 (8 days) and vacation accruing 1.35 days every 2 weeks for a year(32 hrs)-3 days and 2hours mandatory OT could be called 12hrs before a shift suddenly usually 4 day shifts on 5 with overtime .I learned how to operate the reach truck, PR, PC, clamp and tugger after over a year of employment although I requested it constantly.  They constantly move you around to other departments that you are not very good in instead of cross training other employees so that there is a rotation instead of the same people always being sent elsewhere.  Favoritism was a major problem there."

It is most definitely not a 9-5 type of job. The hours are long and the expectations are high. The payoff is good when you have the right team and are in a department where you can flourish.Amazon allows its associates to advance and develop their career opportunities through different programs but the amount of work and mandatory overtime required makes it a very hard and exhausting place to work. The balance between personal and work life becomes difficult to manage due to the amount of hours required to work and the compensation and benefits are not worth it.Even though Amazon can be a fun place to work with many incentives, fun activities, holiday celebrations and more, the tasks become repetitive and boring after a few months making it difficult for the associates to stay motivated.I worked at Amazon for a few months, as well as Integrity Staffing. For one, they are very unorganized. They provide very poor training but expect high rates with little errors. I only got trained for 5 hours on my first day and the other half of the shift I worked in the MOD. I got fired for productivity, which was due to poor training. I learned how to  perform my job better while I was on my final write up and getting retrained, however it was too late. I asked managers several times to move me so I wouldn't lose my job but nobody seemed to care. I worked there for 2 months and got fired. Managers were very rude to me as well. One manager told me if I didn't speed it up I was going to get terminated. I really didn't enjoy my time at Amazon, I feel like they didn't give me a chance.Though Amazon is a growing company, upward mobility only exists for those straight out of college or former military. The pay is well below industry standard at all levels. Management is typically inexperienced and unguided. Though there are many different schedules to work, Amazon is quite rigid with transfers of shifts and departments. Mandatory overtime is commonplace and there are more than six weeks of black out annually, in which vacation time is not allowed to be used. The education program is a joke as you are only allowed to pursue a handful of career paths, all of which amazon only assists to an associates degree which is useless in almost every field. The hours are long, tedious and physically demanding. Injuries are commonplace but the onsite medical staff is extremely rude and uncaring so most people hide injuries and seek out their own medical care.10 hours spent on your feet all day and constantly moving across an incredibly large three level warehouse describes a normal day.  Half of my coworkers did not want to be there and their lack of motivation or sense of doing things correctly ultimately made the job far more difficult to accomplish.  Management seems only to care about the numbers, nothing else.  Since speed of work is everything you better hope you don't run into a problem (there were always problems) since resolving it means you need to walk to a specific station and you also need to hope you aren't 5th in line.good benefits but not a job to make a career out of, they treat their workers poorly. The management team needs some improvement and the pay is not worth the hours they are asking for.The co workers don't work together as a team and everybody is for their self.To me its a great job to start out from but not a job to stay for years.The only thing that's good about this job is the benefits one of the main reason why i still currently work their but the money doesn't support my family needs.The hardest part about this job is all the changes they make unannounced.,the relationship with the management teamand the empolyees.I do not enjoy this job so i'm currently searching for further employment.I worked there for 2 years and took the buyout. They have little events and play games sometimes that are fun but...Never have I been anywhere so micro-managed in my life. If you were breathing wrong, they dinged you for it. They set high rate goals and play favorites heavily. I was a favorite of my manager and got a lot of perks. I tried to work hard, but once they terminated that manager, I was sent back to packing from being a Lead. If you can suck up and don't mind a brown nose, you can make it there no problem. If you want a paycheck and that is it, you can do it. If you want to make a career, keep looking unless you have a MBA.Being a quality auditor for Amazon.com was a great job. Although it was sometimes repetitive warehouse work, I was always rewarded with great wages, challenging situations, and most importantly an unlimited opportunity for advancement. I was also inspired by a CEO that has a devotion for community, family, and the less fortunate. A humble man who wants to see the world improve. That simple idea provided me with motivation. This is a perfect example of a self-made man who started with a small garage operation and turned it into a huge success. The company also excels at the most important part of business, phenomenal customer service.I enjoyed  working  there, was fired  due  to not meeting  rate, which I wasn't  informed  of a rate system  being that I never worked  in wherehouse before, they should  inform new hires of the productivity  requirement,  which they don't, so they will know what to expect, they make everything sound  good at orientation, meanwhile  never telling  new hires what is expected  of them in order to keep your jobs, there  more harder on pickers than packers, that company  is not fair to all there employees, a lot of favoritism. They are a very unfair  company  to work for, I couldn't  even appeal my termination, they made a mistake  and I wasn't  employed for 90 full days, so I can't appeal there  decision, totally  unfair, so I could never work for  them again. Wow  what an incentive for being  fired  you guys suck to the fullest.The particular site I worked at was not adequately staffed since day one. This caused a lot of strain on staff with daily tasks, reports and case load. First site I worked for was great, however the last site was severely lacking in all areas. It depends which site you go to as to the individuals success. This company is very metric driven and does not put the needs or care of the customer or associates working for them ahead of the metrics. Their processes need significant improvement internally. Otherwise it was a great experience at my first site, which is how most of the sites should be run.Awesome managers who listen and work hard to resolve any issues you have. Positive work environment and feedback from co-workers all the way down to human resource.Hardest part of my job was adjusting to walking on the cement floors for 10 hours and finding smaller items quickly.Most enjoyable part of the job was the prizes we won for our efforts and meeting my co-workers.I learned how to work hard and feel proud to finish a job to completion and that hard work pays off! I also learned great time management skills and how to be attentive to detail.One of the worst places I ever worked. I hate how they treat their employees like a number, HR is the worst ever!! There is really no structure, rules changes everyday, to many kids. Coworkers are awesome, the managers, ops managers don't have degrees in their positions. Managers have to many favorites. You really have to kiss butt to move anywhere or try to learn new positions. This place is nothing but about NUMBERS....Could be so much better, if only they cared about their employees.I recently quit working with Amazon and had many reasons for leaving. I had a difficult commute which was the primary factor in my departure. During my time there, my leadership team was always vigilant in making things better for our associates and our customers. I have had the opportunity to work with some really great people and the culture and internal advancement opportunity was great. The majority of my managers were really wonderful people that worked hard to support me and help me develop in my career.Amazon is a continuous improvement environment. They stand behind their principles, one of which is dealing with ambiguity. With stock prices soaring, the prospect of receiving compensation in the form of stock, as well as competitive wages in management roles the job seems alluring. All management roles go thru a rotation of departments, times, and days. This is an effort to round out each candidate to help them rise thru the ranks. This can be tough for anyone with smaller children. The fast paced environment can also lead to meteoric rises for some and wastelands of underdevelopment from others. Conference calls are attended by yes men and eager pleasers who aren't willing to push back on the view from the top.Amazon is a difficult place to work. My job was not stable you never new if you were going to have a job then next day. The management was very poor. They would always run out of equipment and you would have to figure out how to do your job with out your tool. Co-workers were very plesant, we would all try to keep a positive attitude and be up beat.Working at Amazon I learned a lot. I have learned how work threw difficult time in a work environment and how to suck it up and work with whom ever you may have to work with. Long hours and hard work is a lot easier with a positive attitude.Everything about this place reminds of prison, from the orange vest they make you wear, to the safety line you have to walk in, to the constantly working on your feet. Your not being paid to think just work. Supervisors always on your back, similar to a Corrections Officer. Your hard work gets unnoticed so don't try and give 110%, try 65% instead. Work is extremely easy but boring. It's hard to get fired, you pretty much fire yourself by constantly being late or not showing up for workAmazon.com fulfillment Center is an okay place to work. They work you like a dog with working long hours for minimal pay. The benefits of physically working there do not outweigh the costs associated with this type of manual labor. Amazon benefits are good for healthcare, time off, and having an annual picnic. The management always is new and don't necessarily know what they are doing, thats why there is a high turnover rate with management and other employees.There is nothing but drama, drama, drama, backstabbing at this place i mean you have a CEO who is the 3rd richest man in the united states and we work for pennies! Ive been employed almost 5 years and just this week got a 75 cent raise so i make 13.75, but new employees starting are making 11.50 to 12.00 and they just started, does anyone see a problem with that? We have a very big turn over especially MANAGEMENT most of the are kids and dont have a clue! AMAZON cares about its customers, but as far as its employees they dont care how much time we are away from our familes, terrible attendance policy, try to limit our time to go on a BATHROOM BREAK! They claim they do so much for us, we work for everything we are entitled to like our stocks we are given but we have to pay the taxes on them, so basically we are paying for them twice we have to work for them then pay the taxes on them. Our HR department is a joke they are not nice and hateful! You ask a ? And you will get 20 different answers, or i dont know i will have to get back to you ( weeks later)You cannot get full time work.  Management seems disorganized. No explanation of what a PA's job actually is so they appear to be doing nothing but staring at computer screens.  Same with management. Staring at computer screens.   High turnover rate.   No promotions, no raises.   Option to become ambassador and take on more responsibility without more pay. Training was a joke.   Weird clapping and chanting at beginning of shift. All about increasing productivity without any rewards.Amazon is an amazing place to work, it's diverse culture, meeting people from all walks of life is just a blessing. Management's open door policy, where everyone is there to support you and make your work easy, fair and achievable goals are set. your opinion no matter how small is heard, makes me feel belonged and important.Priority to safety, amazing healthcare benefits, career choice plan, outstanding maternity/paternity leave, paid personal time off etc.. i could go on and on."
251,Amec Foster Wheeler,"This company allows the best work life balance by far, and great people to work with.  This is a large company so it does take some getting used to if you are coming from a smaller company (i.e. company policies/procedures etc can make it challenging.).Amec Foster Wheeler is a great company to work for.  They are competitive with salary and benefits, and they work hard to keep their employees.  The work environment is very comfortable, and the stress and pressure level is very low.every day our general forman preaches to us about ways to "" get our money"" inciting to get us fired. Our supervision wants us to do it their way and not the right way. Its honestly a poorly ran job site.Worked here for a year as front desk, awesome co workers. I was a temp therefore that is why I am no longer working there. Understanding boss and great atmosphere. Great company!I gained a great deal of experience.  Worked with many levels of management.  Relaxed but professional atmosphere.  Truly a work family at the local officeTypical work environment, you have good and just get along workers. Working doing equipment and piping is enjoyable. Making layouts work in existing plants is both interesting and challenging. Management helps to get the required items you need to do your job.great company.safety department always making sure we were all following safety rules and regulations. to keep us safe.I will go back any time if the opportunity was given.Joined a successful stormwater and water resources group.  Very good staff and solid leadership.  Large corporate structure that is impersonal.  Minimal appreciation for long hours and hard work.I enjoy working for this company, not only do they show there employees the up most respect but they follow up with there employees to see if the job expectation is able to be preformed to the best of the employees ability.Love the people.  Very team atmosphere.  Great place to growLots of opportunities  Always looking to improve and challengeVery much a work family atmosphere.Read and interpreted blueprints, plans, and drawings to ensure specifications were met.  Measured and cut iron and other materials to size specifications.  Collaborated with workers and managers to plan job requirements, timeline, and scope.  Performed flagging and signaling duties directing workers engaged in moving loads to ensure the safety of workers and materials.  Constructed, assembled, and connected structures, columns, and beams using bolts, hand and power tools.  Grinded metals to smooth and quality finishes.  Maintained work areas, tools, and equipment in a safe, orderly, and clean manner.  Followed all standards, rules, regulations, procedures, practices, policies, guidelines, directions, and codes to ensure safety, efficiency, compliance, productivity, quality service and workmanship.The company expects a lot of work,  labor, and places more expectations everyday. The worst part is you are threatened daily for not meeting goals or asking for a fair wage.After Foster Wheeler was being bought out by AMEC, changes to the employment roster was coming.  Good place to work with good insurance.Projected a position that was opened and laid someone off six months after they started.  Company is being affected by the oil/gas industry and not sustaining work for employees.This merger if Amec and Foster Wheeler was a very tough one.  Half of the company in Houston has been laid off. No one could foresee the oil and gas market having the troubles it now hasOn a typical day I provide numerous reports to various departments that include headcount, salaries, KPI, and government requirements.  It is sometimes very challenging because of the fact that my company is a Global company and has various systems that manage the HRIS and Finance for each Business Unit. My job is rewarding because I have spent many years working on all the different systems and truly understand how to manipulate the information to create the reports required of me.Some days we'd be overworked and aggrivated with management. On other occasions it would be completely different and fun. Plenty of water provided constantly through the day.All the people I worked with were very nice and friendly. I enjoyed all my tasks at this position and learned a lot about Instrumentation and engineering codes and standards.I learned a lot with working with different projects with different lead engineers! Building and designing panels and wiring diagrams. Worked in a very professional workplace setting! Hardest part of the job is when work is getting slow and lose out on bids for big projects and they have to shorten their staff!  Most enjoyable is when work is overflowing and getting overtime!! Learning and working with great people!  AMEC FOSTER AND WHEELER is a great company!Every day was a learning experience for me. What I enjoyed doing the most was working on the transformer units. Everything about them interests me. Looking forward to learning about turbines and would definitely take action if given the opportunity to attend Turbo School.Amec Foster Wheeler is a nice place to work. The atmosphere is pleasant and welcoming. Employees to mind helping employees. If the industry were better for Amec Foster Wheeler, this would be a great place to start and end your career."
450,American Express,"Amex was a growth opportunity in my career change from insurance to travel industry.  I enjoy working with the cardmembers the most.  I disagree about the management use of survey systems but I realize that is a part of the customer service world.The company changes and reacts often.  Jobs have recently been outsourced to Philippines and India. Amex does what makes Amex money. They do not care if you see your family. They monitor bathroom breaks.  There is no freedomAmerican Express is a great place to get your foot in the door if you're interested in banking. It's fast paced which means things are always changing and you end up learning something new almost everyday.AmEx is a great place to work at. You get tons and tons of project management experience and the company loves to think outside the box.lots of consultants hired and cycled through - most of the foreign.Very large environment. Lots of bureaucracy could have been a much simpler environment.Must be very technical to survive. very long commute from where I live.Best company I've worked for to date. Great group of people, awesome environment, state of the art technology and plenty of activities to break up the daily race stress.Great place to work, unfortunately the contractor with them that I worked for lost the contract.  People that I worked with were very professional and of good character.American Express is a great place to work.  The finance division is now Ameriprise.  I can only hope that it is still the same great company.-On site food market, great lunches!-Learned the importance of professionalism -Managers are there to work by your sideGreat company to work for both as an employee and contractor.   Always new opportunities to expand knowledge of technical and business skills.   I enjoyed the people that I worked with on a daily basis.I held a variety of jobs working for this company which was great. I was able to learn and grow everyday. The clients were nice and I enjoyed the office team. I was very proud of my office team. We made our deadlines and help advisors all over the market group. I initially set up how we would do our technology and marketing areas. We did well and other market groups were interested in how it was done. Then, our home office wanted to streamline the marketing and took back the distribution and allocation process. This made it very difficult for us to obtain the numbers we were getting. My hands were tied by home office and I could not find a work around to please the Group Vice President. However, in dealing with this process, I was able to get back $11,000+ back to the market groups budget.I worked here for several years and there just didn't seem to be much room for advancement. Many times they hired from outside of the company instead of promoting internal employees.I loved working in American Express. They always take care of the employee needs.I worked in American Express for 27 yrs and I got nothing to critized.American Express pretty much left me in the dark most of the time. Very little communication about the job or who exactly cares. Most communication was via a team member whom I did not really answer to. They seemed quite disorganized cared little about my skillset or utilization of them. I often had no idea if my job was going to be dissolved due to transitions even though I was praised and had high marks as a top performer. Often 'other' teams handled issues with very little explanation as to why. Such teams may or may not respond to any communication attempts possibly passing the buck when contacted. Processes for handling specific 'areas' were typically inept at best and appeared frequently mishandled. They seemed very 'low-tech' which was the opposite of what my impression was before working for them.Amex has an environment that allows for employees to cultivate themselves and the company. The work life balance has been key.Great organization. They really have the work at home segment nailed down. Training could use a bit more consistency and more mentoring time would be beneficial. Especially in the live-call listening. Overall the experience and culture is inclusive. One does not feel like a number in this vastly huge company.Great place to work following a structured environment.  The company believed in their mission and vision and give their employees hope for advancement and security.Loved working at American Express. One of the best companies I worked for. Great environment, team and reachable managers. Intellectually stimulating work.Amex encourages employees to try new positions, challenge themselves, and broaden their horizons. It is a great and fun place to work and the people are awesome.They pay well, have fair benefits, good work life balance and attempt to create a positive culture. However, they are behind the times in product growth and frequently make bad decisions that effect the entire company. Every year, if not twice a year people wait with baited breathe to see if they will be one of the people getting axed in the current ""reorganizing"" round. The last round consisted of 10% of the entire company. Very shaky and unstable. You constantly feel insecure.as in any large company, there is a lot of politics and power play involved.  Working for a strong brand with very smart people is always a thrill.  great work life balance and love that they bring in speakers from different industries."
467,American International Group,"The company has had turnover in senior management over the last decade.  This unfortunately has created an environment of chaos with regards to having effective management in place.  Many managers typically stay in their office and it is up to the employee to approach the manager vs. the manager actually setting clear and direct communications.  This leads to the overspending of funds for system enhancements and/or projects.  A number of the Project Managers hired recently don't seem to know how to manage a project as those project managers from years ago.  It is unfortunate this company gone from being a great company (with some issues, needless to say) and many, many dedicated employees to a company of counting $$$, which it is wasting on an immense basis.Good work life balance and great benefits. Shift differential for over night shift and benefits for the weekend. International company that has many other offices for international opportunities.There was no room for advancement unless you wanted to move to the technical side of the house and then that wasn't guaranteed. Lots of lay offs with the administrative staff.Really depends on the department you work. During my time there, the company was going through a lot of restructuring which involved a lot of lay offs. So as you can imagine, that environment wasn't really the greatest to work in as many people were worried about Job security. My favorite part about working there though were my managers. Their open door policy, honesty, among many other things made working there quite pleasantI learned a lot at AIG and the management is generally easy to work with.  The hardest part of the job was the way systems were sometime implemented.  The people were the best part of the job.Productive Workplace. I have worked with AIG for eight years and I am currently looking for a Customer Service or Administrative position.They were a great company to work for. They were supportive of all the employees and their job goals. Management and co-workers were very helpful and friendly.Good place to work for a big company, but you only learn a small piece of the company. The people are fun and the environment is okay. Lots of overtime during quarter end, but overall was okayAllowed myself to have creative freedom in a relaxed atmosphere, with great management. AIG did the best to accommodate me for the high costs of living in the San Francisco Bay Area. Only downfall was being laid-off during company cutbacks from a job I truly enjoyed.Overall, I enjoyed my 10 years with AIG.  AIG chose to exit the Employer and Voluntary Group Benefits business and in doing so allowed them to align more closely with the company's organizational goals and vision.  As part of this strategic reorganization, my position as an Account Service Rep, along with hundreds of others, no longer fit in with the new direction AIG is currently undertaking.I enjoy working at AIG.  Awesome teamwork environment.  The work life balance is great.  The management style is very open and laid back.  The most enjoyable part of the job is finding great talent to join the organization.I really enjoyed my time at this company.  I was given the opportunity to learn many areas and had the chance to do all aspects of different positions from data entry, processing, scanning , mail sorting to applications.This was a good job for me to bridge my job loss from AT&T to retirement. I would recomment this company for other job applicants.Overall my experience at AIG was not good. Not clear who your reporting to. 3 changes in management in a 6 month period. Overwhelming tasks, Work/Life balance almost non existent.Head of Department resigned 3 months after I resigned. Good for a single person who is a workaholic.The management is very engaged with their staff and everyone works towards one goal...the customer.  This is a very professional environment with skilled individuals.Handled workers comp claims from beginning to end.  Was allowed to work from home 4 days a week.  Co-workers are very helpful.A typical day at work is a stressful one wondering when you are going to be laid off.  AIG is not a bad company and there is a lot to learn but Management has been concentrating more on the layoff of employees instead of making the employees happy and give them an incentive to stay with AIG.No raises are given.  Benefits are good but moral is not.  The day is like a sword hanging over your head wondering what time it will fall on your head.Could be a great company but it fails.  Different departments doing the same work in different fashions,  why not stream line and handle calls, disbursements and other transaction the say way among all department.  AIG does not value it's employees.enjoyed working as a scheduler but was working 3 jobs and could work the hours. It was too much to handle the hours. I called clients that had a retirement fund with the company and scheduled meetings with their adviser to go over their retirement goalsVery political , high turnover, employee gets burned. there's not too much advancement. stay there not long, can't comment on too much. Can this sight not force people to write review ?Great opportunity to meet people from all walks of life and different parts of the world.  Continued learning and sharing outlooks and outcomes of life experiences."
175,American Student Assistance,"The work was challenging - which i love; and the rewards were amazing. Seeing how your work assisted with the growth of the company was rewarding. The company also values their employees (employee appreciation events, amazing benefit, great management).I expect this company to go out of business within the next five years. Leadership is lacking and everyone is more interested in holding on to what little they have rather than trying to make things better.The job was to gather missing information for the processing of student loan applications. No real interactions between co workers. You are always on the telephonesI don't forward to going to work like I use to.  Their use to be a lot more opportunities.  Management shows favoritism, speaking up will get you fired.Very busy, fast-paced environment that advocated a high importance of culture and teamwork.  Positive mission that supported a balance between loan payment and a personal understanding of student, post-graduate responsibility.If you like to sit around and do nothing this is the job for you. A bunch of zombies walking around.Friendly working environment. Benefits are great and many different training's offered to help us enhance our skills. The hardest part of the job,particularly in my department is it's repetitive nature. the repetitive aspect can become tiresome and directly affect how well you perform on a daily basis. I do however, enjoy my co-workers and most of my management team.As an intern, I was glad to be accepted as a valued member of a fast paced production team. They treated me as an equal and entrusted me with crucial tasks on a biweekly basis. The tasks required of me ranged from quite simple, such as making slight visual tweaks to the site, to creating the entire front end of one of their web apps from scratch. I learned quite a bit about web development and its best practices during my time at ASA and made some great connections. My co-workers were generally very helpful and fun to work with. My favorite aspect of the job was that I was able to influence the direction of the final product to some extent. As the website is targeted at college kids close to my age, I was asked to give my own thoughts on how to more effectively advertise ASA's services as well as make the site more intuitive and enjoyable to use. They took notice of every one of my suggestions and were very grateful for my input.On a everyday day basis the job involves a high level of calls incoming and outgoing where those incoming were priority over outgoing ones. Each of my co-workers work as a unit to minimize the high level of calls waiting to be serviced and with the support staff we were able to control that level. The hardest part of the job was not having enough data to serviced our customers more efficiently, while the most enjoyable part of the same job was getting the job done when customers are satisfied with their counseling.There was never a typical day. The diversity in my responsibilities, the energy of my team and the culture made being a work fun.I especially appreciated the autonomy I had in my role. My manager was available when needed, but trusted my judgment.  ASA's commitment to community allows employees to participate in events and programs outside of ASA. The people are amazing!Awesome place, mission and people.. it just need to find a way to make money and wish them the best in that.Very friendly atmosphere, as well as professional environment.Great place to work. Love my coworkers and management is great.Good company with great people.  Looking to  drive revenue through sponsorship.  Company is very profitable and is looking to create an additional revenue source.- 8 hr work per day- Front end development, includes html CSS, javaScript, JQuery and some framework like dust, foundation.- Co-works are nice- The Company has a casual atmosphere but the employees are business professionals.- Management is well informed with an open door policy.- The staff are friendly and knowledgable.- It was always enjoyable to come to work each day. Great location with a lot of public transportation options.Worked among very intelligent product management team that drove technical enhancements on a number of platforms. Enhancements created enormous growth of partner clients and overall loan volume.Nice place to work, but department don't work well together.I thought ASA was a great place to work. However, advancement was pretty much non-existent. When they decided to develop an extensive web development team, there was hiring from outside... not letting, for the most part, internal engineers gain experience. That was the biggest issue that I had. The tech experience I had when I started was what I had when I left."
445,Amex,"Amex was a growth opportunity in my career change from insurance to travel industry.  I enjoy working with the cardmembers the most.  I disagree about the management use of survey systems but I realize that is a part of the customer service world.The American Express Service Center (AESC) in Phoenix, AZ is a truly remarkable facility.  Having worked in private, public, and non-profit sectors, AESC has proven to have the strongest work culture I've seen in my career.  The company has fantastic work/life balance opportunities:  work from home, flexible schedules, onsite dental, onsite flu shots, onsite nurse/medical, onsite cafeteria, onsite massage, a break room with video games, TVs, and couches.  And yes - there are expectations to produce very high quality work - but this is accompanied by fantastic training and coaching.Jobs are being lost because the company rather save a dollar more and out source them to cheaper labor in India and Philippines. Customers are not happy and the company doesn't care about it, they rather save extra money, rather than listen to their customers. Which ultimately they will end up losing in the long run because of this decision making. They release employees who have put their hearts and souls into this company for many years, and they are just laying them off.I have worked at American Express on a full time basis for a few years. I would say overall it is a good company to work for.  Work-life balance is great depending on which group you are in.  Most groups allow you to work from home most Fridays.Compensation at American Express is not the best.  It's certainly not the worst.  But, I think American Express struggles to be competitive from a compensation point of view.Job security is not great here at the moment.  Layoffs are happening across the board and at all levels.  So, I would say proceed with caution.Overall, I have enjoyed my time here.I have been with American Express for 3 years now. I have learned a lot about the banking industry and how to help people in a calm manner.Unfortunately, I don't see room for advancement for me here. I was not fortunate enough to go to school for a degree and most positions, regardless of qualifications, require a degree.I enjoy working with people on a team, but I also enjoy being left to do my job, the way they I can do it.I enjoy being able to help clients when they are in a bad situation, it gives me a sense of satisfaction when they really appreciate the help I can provide.On the other side of that, there are some people you just can't please no matter the situation, so that is tough.They pay well, have fair benefits, good work life balance and attempt to create a positive culture. However, they are behind the times in product growth and frequently make bad decisions that effect the entire company. Every year, if not twice a year people wait with baited breathe to see if they will be one of the people getting axed in the current ""reorganizing"" round. The last round consisted of 10% of the entire company. Very shaky and unstable. You constantly feel insecure.Good on the job training opportunities, very light on any training that has cost associated to it. Performance based compensation, bonus and recognition programs for high performers. Standard benefits of medical, dental, 401K with 5% matching and vesting. Heavy contract staff augmentation on shore and off shore.Global Company that causes interference with work life balance.American Express pretty much left me in the dark most of the time. Very little communication about the job or who exactly cares. Most communication was via a team member whom I did not really answer to. They seemed quite disorganized cared little about my skillset or utilization of them. I often had no idea if my job was going to be dissolved due to transitions even though I was praised and had high marks as a top performer.

They seemed very 'low-tech' which was the opposite of what my impression was before working for them.This strong US financial company is outsourcing jobs to India for customer servicing despite card member complaints. With the recent co-brand partner dissolutions with Jet Blue and Costco, American Express recently displaced nearly 220 customer service professionals from their Salt Lake City facility, with an offer to retain approximately 80 - 100 home based servicing positions only. It's a shame, as the jobs are needed to support our American workers, not to mention the US economy. In 2011 AMEX displaced nearly 300 New Account specialists from the SLC facility.  In 2015 nearly 100 of their Fraud specialists were also displaced.I worked in a center 9 years before transfering to Home Based Servicing. Working from.home sounds great... but its very lonely. Once you are at home their is very little opportunity for advancement and you are just stuck taking calls day after day with no end. It wears you down fast. I did enjoy that ability to drop and pick up hours easily with colleges. This made it simple to adjust my schedule with out using PD time. American Express is a great company but home based servicing was just not for me.Amex is a great company overall with nice people, but has become too slow and is unable to move quickly enough to be competitive.  Advancing in the company is difficult as greater value is place on planning events then actually deliver results.I actually love working for AMEX. The culture, leadership and opportunities for advancement are phenomenal. I worked my way up the corporate ladder and have not been disappointed. I have been given the opportunity to lead a team and work hand in hand with American Express' head of marketing/developmental teams out of Phoenix Arizona. Absolutely love this company.Amex is not only customer centric but also employee centric and the management will do it's best to develop you and your skills.They believe in maintaining a good work-life balance and will support your development. There is a lot to learn from this organization which will help you explore your capabilities.Great place to work following a structured environment.  The company believed in their mission and vision and give their employees hope for advancement and security.Good salariesGood benefitsTraining and developmentCareer pathswaps and cross trainingWinning Cultureteam buildingAmerican Express is a great place to get your foot in the door if you're interested in banking. It's fast paced which means things are always changing and you end up learning something new almost everyday.Great environment if you just want to plug in and get a job done.  If you want to make a difference, this is NOT the place for you.  Unless you are a VP (they are very top heavy in VPs by the way), you don't really have a say in what happens on a day to day basis.  The company is very vocal about peer reviews and surveys to make the working environment more appealing to all stages (entry-level up to senior management) of your career.American Express was a great place to work.  They care for their employees and have a good work life balance.  I really like the people I worked with.  American express tried to build a culture of team work.Work Life Balance. Great Work Schedule. Great Culture. Customer Oriented. Job Security. Future Forward Management StyleI worked here for several years and there just didn't seem to be much room for advancement. Many times they hired from outside of the company instead of promoting internal employees.as in any large company, there is a lot of politics and power play involved.  Working for a strong brand with very smart people is always a thrill.  great work life balance and love that they bring in speakers from different industries."

Fortunate enough to do well with the products however, the way leadership treated my counterparts who were not so fortunate with Corlanor after the messy launch is shameful.  Not a place I would encourage for the faint of heart.  Dog eat dog culture.  The launch of Repatha was even worse and they should have this specialty pharmacy game down to a science since they are not new to the biologics game.  Work life balance is non existent if you do not want to be on a list for not making your weekly numbers.  I am fortunate enough to have a great manager, however, nationally, my counterparts are miserable and get harassed every day regarding their numbers.  Our team is frightened of what will happen when our manager gets promoted and we get the tried and true Amgen manager that runs their teams on fear and intimidation.The people, work, and benefits are really great at Amgen.

My immediate manager was truly someone unique and special to work for.  She absolutely made sure that her reports had a strong work/life balance (even if she didn't adhere to that for herself).

I was told they had an open ear and welcome new ideas. Not even close. The safety dbag watched over everything you did just to tell you to do it different. Hardcore FDA regulated. Employees are told to fill out reports and ""dime-drop"" on others if they see you do something wrong. You'll be better off joining the army. It's run just like that.

221,"Analog Devices, Inc.","Analog is a great semiconductor company with some really good managers who act as mentors as much as directing tasks.  My only complaint (as of 2004) was the pay.  They figured bonus and stock options as part of the package, but both were very unreliable over the 6 years I worked thereGood pay and benefits, shut down between Christmas and New Years.  Communication could be better.  Transitioning from Hittite Microwave to Analog Devices has been tough.I learned SCHEMATIC and PWORK to prepare detailed electrical and mechanical drawings for new product development.Create CAM files for a copper clipboard.Assemble boards for testing and stock and order parts for staff of 25.Analog opens room to his employees to grow within his organisation.Analog creates a channel where all employees can bring innovative ideas or thoughts.Human rights at Analog are treated fairly and equitably, and that created a very friendly work environment.1) I checked voice mail and worked on spread sheets. 2) Pretty neat tricks with their custom  spread sheets3) Very helpful.4) Didn’t have any5) Knowing it was going to end.6) Learning a job I had no experience at.  Wish I could have leaned more.Worked with a confidant IS team that assisted one another with daily activities that consisted of SOP, troubleshooting user issues and time-lined projects. Management works well with team members and co-workers meet daily for trouble case updates.It was my pleasure to have been a part of this company, but unfortunately, the company closed that is why I had to look for another job to sustain my and my family's daily needs.A typical day at work when I first started with the company was great, especially when we were Hittite, when it became Analog things changed and it wasn't as great as it was when I first started.  I got to learn new software packages and use an old one which was alright.   As far as coworkers at this company we had good ones and then coworkers that were just out for themselves and not wanting to help the people that needed help.I'd say the hardest part of the job was when people didn't communicate and a person would have to find out on their own when things were changed around and no one would say anything.  communication in any company needs to be better.I enjoyed the work at my company especially when I first started, but then when the bigger company came in and there were a lot of changes it wasn't a happy go lucky place anymore.Company provides innovative projects to work on everyday. A lot of technical knowledge is contained in senior engineers.A great company with excellent benefits. I worked in an environment where my job skills and intellect was fully utilized for the betterment of my career goals.My day started at 3 pm.  and I was always busy pushing product outand it ended at 11 pm.I leaned a lot of different thing work for Analog devices the differentproduct's that we processes through the different machines.Management was great he always would give long lunches when we mad our production was meet.My co-workers were great people.  Sometimes we would get together on our day off our when we got of work.The most hardest part of my job was always being in the clean room with full gear on.the most enjoy able part of my job was learning the different machines.Small teams working on leading-edge tech products.  Strong R&D and leaders in the areas they play in, but little commitment to fight for market share in new areas.  They are good at creating new product categories.Pro: Great company and culture for working. Management is encouraging of new ideas but slow to adopt any.Con: Projects move slow.I had a good boss and I liked the working hours. I liked working with sap. It is a very good software package. I had to figure out if the invoices needed to be taxed or not.Several significant reorganizations company-wide have taken place over the last 5 years. The latest reorg in  Oct 2014 moved directors and senior management into new roles across the company. Technology and segment groups were joined under general managers (new structure). Same reorg also resulted in significant layoffs (at least 10% of staff) and many teams have been understaffed in key areas. This paralyzed the company for at least 6 months.  According to rumors internally, requisitions are awaiting signature and hiring will start up again this fall (particularly in the product lines).First full time job where i starting in the manufacturing side putting circuit boards together.  Worked my way up not to being the shipper receiver and have been doing that for the last 2 years.It used to be a wonderful place to work. It is too bad that things have changed. Analog is now just another company with short sighted management interested only in the stock price. Employees are now just another commodity. The company has performed layoffs in spite of the fact that it had plenty of cash and was not losing money. People are routinely apprehensive about the annual layoffs in the November/December timeframe. Because of this, a vicious competitive environment has been fostered where backstabbing is the norm done by people who mistakenly feel that it will make them more secure. It does, however, still offer one of the best 401K plans available.Great wealth of technical expertise with the company.  Good work-life balance.  Upward progression limited, re-organizations occur almost yearly.I was with Analog Devices for 2 years, contracting the first contract was for 6 months, they extended the contract but never became full time. My manager was very happy with my performance, but due to financial status they had to laid off all contractors.I love working at Analog Devices,  Great and fun environment.An outstanding work atmosphere with helpful co-workers.Good company with good benefits. Every day I learn something new, which is my favorite thing at this company. Management is also good. We all get along, and work together to complete jobs on time with quality. The hardest part of the jobs is to complete work on time since there is not enough employees."
186,Analysis Group,"Great company, with great culture and great people.  A great place to learn broadly about capital markets and to learn from smart, dedicated, and motivated people. I had a great experience.Analysis Group's work relies heavily on rigorous quantitative analysis, resulting in a steep learning curve for new analysts.  However, once basic analytical skills are mastered, there is an opportunity to assume significant responsibility on case teams and gain wide industry exposure.  Managers also tend to invest in the career development of analysts.  Due to the opportunity for rapid skill development and the supportive culture, Analysis Group is a great place to begin one's career.This is a good role for undergraduates with a degree in economics, math, or statistics.lots to learn from very smart people. will develop strong analytical skills. work is often stressful and requires late nights, though."
57,Ancestry,"I felt I wasn't given the help needed for me to grow in this job. The management didn't want to be bothered with helping or answering questions to a problem.Ancestry used to be a great place to work for software engineers.  But is has continually gone downhill.  They used to give stock.  Now they don't.  The management said that stock was only for ""people like them.""  Management doesn't care about the people.  They are all just waiting to cash out.Why do you think there are so many job openings at Ancestry?A good company to work for--if you can meet the call time limitations. Good pay and benefits. Management does care--but there are metrics that must be met. It's great to be able to help people out, but sometimes there are customers who should not be around any technical equipment (computers, tablets, smartphones) and many struggle with the on-line services Ancestry provides.I came in and check the tickets that came over night. I maid repairs a go the servers back on line. I then moved to my three backup environment, and ran the Exchange Backup reports, The CDPE reports and Ancestry.com backup reports. Any restores that need to be restored that morning,  At Ancestry I learded Microsoft Office, and all Microsoft Operating Systems, (10years), CommVault Storage Backups (5years),Vmware and Hyper-V virtual environments (6 years),I worked here for five years. When first employed, Ancestry was a great company to work for. Management valued Member Services and created a great atmosphere for their employees. Over the years, they have turned member services into a typical 'call center' atmosphere with very scripted responses to their customers. It has since had a steady decline with over all satisfaction. There is no job security and no way of moving up within the company (other than staying just within member services).just don't like it answering to many phone calls in a short time frame and try solving a problem that the customer was having with ancestry productI couldn't speak more highly of this company. I am in a contract position and to be completely honest I'm sad this job will be coming to an end. You get great pay, they have incentives for doing well, you can also get benefits through the company. Overall I love the site I work at including the people and the job itself!Ancestry is the best place I have ever worked. Unfortunately, it is very hard to be recognized for your work and move up in the company.I really liked the company, they took care of the employees. They offered free breakfast for everyone each morning along with free fresh fruit and for those with a sweet tooth they had free soda fountains and frozen yogurt each day as well. The work was fairly simple and repetitive but still fun to do. Supervisors were always super helpful and very approachable.Great place to work if the focus is only Work life balance. If you are looking for a competitive place, this is not the one for you.A typical day at work can last at least 4 hours a day depending on the position you have in the company. I learned to pay close attention to detail and how to search for ancestors.Management was very friendly and they did their best to help me when I had a question.Co-workers I had there were very friendly and very welcoming.Hardest part about the job was the hours honestly. Like I said you can work at the very least 4 hours a day depending on your position in the company.Most enjoyable part of the job was the cafe they have for employees. During your break, if you get hungry, there is a cafe you can go to, to grab something quick to eat.Really great place to start internship and highly intelligent developers who will assist you any way they can.  Great benefits and wonderful learning process.  Will definitely help you to grow as a developer.You will be answering a wide variety of calls. You need to be very patient. There is a lot of emphasis placed on stats and handle time. You need to be abel to learn quickly and act on the spot. The web site changes rapidly and you usually find out when a member calls in. You need to be able to handle the call and quickly assist with the change and take feedback. It was enjoyable finding family records for the members. The billing is automatically renewed and the online cancel doesn't always work. Because of this you will be dealing with some angry customers.The job was a good envirerment and made it as good as possible for employees working customer service over the phone daily. The benefits were very good and important to me. I realized that I wasn't cut out for the type of work and knew it was time for me to do the most appropriate thing and resign from the company.The work environment is incredibly high paced. I've learned how history and technology work together for the greater good. My one major complaint is company culture and lack of communication between Ancestry's head quarters in Utah and it's satellite sites all over the country. There is a large disconnect which in turn causes negative company culture and confusion.Its 40 hours a week and the calls do not stop. 90% of the calls are cancel calls and we do not give refunds for monthly subs so customers yell most of the time. Ancestry does not verify email so if a customer enters .coom instead of .com its impossible to look up there account so the calls take forever. why they don't verify emails i do not know. the sales calls are alright and the support calls i like but like i said its mostly cancel calls.Ancestry.com is an excellent company to work for. I have never worked for another company that so greatly values its employees. This organization truly encourages an ""open door"" policy and feedback is delivered consistently. Members of the leadership team are always available to discuss performance and to coach employees about how to improve. Ancestry encourages promotion from within so there is a lot of opportunity for upward mobility.A typical day would include taking various types of content and scanning them into in house programs in order to enhance them for the company website. I think my favorite part of working here was my co-workers. It was a very fun and relaxing environment.Passionate and engaged employees and management that sincerely care about the work they do and the product they support.I loved my position as a work at home agent. Now that position has been eliminated. All agents are now called in. When I first began working with the company it was a breath of fresh air for a large corporation. None of the back stabbing, very high energy and positivity.Since growing, through the work of its agents, it's now cold, lacking in care of its employees and customers who literally make their business.A Typical day at work is very stressful and some customers are rude and abusive towards employees. They will make the issues personal towards you and then claim that you hung up on them. In all my years of call center experience they are the worst bunch of customers I have ever dealt with. I have learned a lot of important information on my ancestors. A plus is my family loves that I'm working for them, but on the other hand, not so much. I am not happy there.Management could use a serious overhaul!! They're not on the same page. I don't like feeling as if I'm being micromanaged by senior management. Employees get told that they have never fired anyone for their call time, but they write you up for it and put you on a final and tell you to improve or you're gone. Doesn't make any sense at all. They lie & cheat their employees out of their dignity and expect too much from them in a 3 week training and then slam them with everything you need to work on your own. They tell you they have only fired employees for attendance problems, another lie! Great coworkers. But the turnover is ridiculously high!!! They pack up your desk into a box while your super is firing you and escort you out the door like a criminal leaving a prison. The hardest part of the job, lack of support from the so called supervisors and they hold you accountable for the long hold time to reach support!!! The hold time goes against your call time, as if it's your fault in the first place for needing help. I have personally waited more than 10 minutes for any supervisor or support department to answer  more... my call. I see they all of them are goofing off in chat which is supposed to be some of our support instead of assisting you. It's a vicious cycle!! Their attendance policy is unthinkably stupid!!! VTO is non existent, but they tell you it's available if the call volume goes down!! Phones are poorly covered, hold time is a long wait for our customers. And employee don't get anytime to breathe!! They call themselves and Equal Opportunity Employer, but promote the newbies to positions without posting them for long time employees to fill. How is that equal? Exactly!! The most enjoyable part of the job is I'll find another one.  less"
147,Andiamo,"A typical day at work you would  clock in and get moving, majority of business is at 12 or 5 o clock, the time passes by fast before you know it your clocking out.Andiamo was a faced paced environment with a good atmosphere in which I was able focus on teamwork and customer relationsHalf of the people in the back didn't know english. This was frustrating. I learned how to wash dishes. hardest part was doing that all day.A typical day at Andiamo includes setting up section or bar (depending on position that day). Servers work on all opening duties such as: butters, waters, parmesan, salad dressing, snacks(during shows) and polishing their sections. Bartenders opening duties are making sure you have all the glassware you'll need, stocking your bar with beer, wine, and any liquor you may need and cutting fruit.I've learned a lot during my time at Andiamo, I've learned how to talk to people, bus trays, food services, even food preparation. Management is a little scattered sometimes, but overall they're a good team. My coworkers all stick together, like a family, and always have each others backs when we need it but like all families once in a while there is a bit of drama. The hardest part about the job is going long hours without a break or any chance of eating. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the coworkers and when working weddings making that event the best day of those peoples lives with no issues.great busy all day every day little time to spend with family re did work almost every day due to customers not making up there minds one client all the time no expansion in the companyIts a great place to work minus the benefits. You end time is questionable. The management is great and easy to get along with as long as you do your job.Its fun co workers are fun and cool to work with, very little managing going on.Super cool fine dining and theater. Fast paced so you are never bored!As an employer there, they respected you and it teamwork was alway apart of the job at Andiamo."
769,Apache,"If everyday is the same then we are doing our jobs right.  Very knowledgeable co-workers along with a safety orientated work environment....................A Decent Company with manageable work. Poor planing/workflow causing major overtime as materials get lost/misordered. Problems stem from under staffing for periods of over a year but the company pushing overgrowth despite lack of personel. The company prides itself on its employee owners and for the most part everyone is treated well and with respect.My beginning at this job was not at all unpleasant.  I learned a lot about logistics and the overall process of shipping and receiving.  The only downside to working here was the hiring of a few hard drug users that would conduct drug deals in the parking lot during company time.  Concerns about this were repeatedly ignored.I like the half day work on Fridays. Friendly colleagues. I get to work closely with application/ DB team folks and learn a lot.Immediate management and staff are demanding and supportive of IT staff - learned much about the inner workings of ONG corporations and had a tremendous IT staff that are extremely knowledgeable and  work well as a team. I've enjoyed the camaraderie and pacing despite being a small team.An excellent company to work for. Great benefits package and pay structure. This company is heavily tied to the oil and gas market. As such its activity level is based on oil prices. Some of the best people I have ever worked with.Excellent place to work, good compensation, Typical day included troubleshooting day to day issues while working on long term projects. Management is fair and coworker is fun to work with.I have had the opportunity to work with some of the most interesting people in the work force.  Room for advancment was limited and the selection process is unfair.All the people that I worked with was very professional and a pleasure to work with. There was never a time that if I had any questions about anything or needed help that I was not able to just call. All the management in the Midland office are very enjoyable to work for. I look forward to being able to work with them and Apache again.a little one dimensional as far as duties go. some people are nice, but a lot tend to come off as snobby. I have not learned anything new in the 10 months I have been here. the best part of job is the building itself, very nice, and the schedule is good because you leave early on Fridays.A typical day is busy, work is steady even in the downturn. Training could be improved on. There is no official training program and documentation is space, outdated or incomplete. Coworkers are great, cafe and benefits are great.I loved working for Apache, I hated that they closed the Tulsa office. Employees were friendly, the work environment was comfortable. Apache offered flex time, They supported volunteering for Meals on Wheels once a week.I enjoyed working for Apache. They gave me maximum exposure to both field and office experience. Typical day in the office involves constant production analyses of my fields. Identification of low performing wells and writing AFEs to stimulate them.It started off a very good environment but it got out of hand with no real leadership. I dislike not having organization in a work place.Well I was contracted by Apache through Genesys Works and when I began I was shy since it was my first day at work. But I made friends quickly and when i needed help with any problems on pipelines I would ask my coworker for some help. The employees at Apache are really nice I enjoyed my time there and it was a fun experience.The jail was getting too crowded and we did not have the available work force to keep everyone safe. Management did not care and neglected to do anything about it, and due to my disagreement with the way things were being run, I resigned from Detention CorporalApache was a good company while it lasted. Great benefits and a lot of good people there. Just like everyone else got caught up in the reduction.Apache is a great organization to work for and a great group of people to learn from.  The leadership is excellent and are willing to assist you when needed.A good typical day at work is wen it is not raining.the new thing that i learn wuzz how to bristle blast.The management wuzz very good.All of the co-workers were good people the work with they teach you different things.the most enjoyable part of the job is wen we get to go home to our families.- Typical day at work involves resolving trouble tickets, taking phone calls, building and configuring computers and IT equipment, troubleshooting, working with peers and other departments to resolve issues- I gained a large breadth of knowledge working with Dell, Apple, and HP products, from small mobile devices all the way to high end geophysicist workstations. I also got to work with video teleconference design and implementation department for enterprise solutions- The IT dept. is small in the regional office, so less management overhead as a corporation makes it exceptional to get things done- A small team of multi-talented co-workers makes it a great place to work and learn from each other's areas of expertise in IT- Hardest part of the job is keeping up with technology in a growing corporation in the oil field, and traveling to support multiple field offices.- Most enjoyable part of the job is working with a great team, getting hands on everything IT based, and helping our clients with any IT issuesPlanned wells, confirm targets, reviewed drilling hazards, integrated geology, geophysics, drilling, production teams to plan and improve production.  This was the hardest part of the job as well as the most rewarding."
777,Apache Corp,"I am very thankful to have had the opportunity to be a part of this corporation. I was a paid intern and I was very well treated by both co-workers and supervisors. Since I was an intern, I did have to do some of the heavy lifting, but I was more than happy to help as much as I could.I loved everything about my job with Apache! I would not have gotten this job if it were't for my dad knowing the main boss. Learned a lot about how the oilfield works.I gained very valuable and necessary knowledge as a new land professional. I was eager to come to work and apply myself in anyway that I could; eager to help or work for any division. The management was incredible and wanted to see each employee excel in their professional careers.Easy work daysHeavy Data EntryEasy TrainingGreat Upper ManagementGreat LocationGreat Job OpportunitiesCreated oil spreadsheets to help back up data systemGreat day bonus not enough training time, but they keep their family members employed and will let go of outsiders. Great pay, but not worth the amount of time you spend away from homeWork 40 hours a week assisting both remote sites and corporate headquarters with managing their records.Learned how to manage databases, manage records and design computing systems.Commuting to work.Being allowed to contribute in the determination of a technical solution to complex data issues.It was good while it lasted. Apache had great benefits and good people. Just like everyone else right now, reductions are going on.I loved working for Apache Corporation, they offered competitive salary with even better benefits! They offer flexible work schedule working 9 hour days Monday - Thursday and 4 hours on Friday, no weekends with very little overtime and traveling. I hate that Apache closed their Tulsa office.They made you feel like it was a family, everyone was important to the end game.  No matter if you were bottom or top the company gave the impression of carringApache Oil and Gas is an excellent company that appreciates a contrarian spirit and hardworking employees.  The employees are a wide range of ages with excellent communication and teamwork skills.Hold Meeting with the crews to inform them of activities the night crew was doing.  Learned how to lead crews with a positive attitude.Management backed me with the decisions I made.  Learning to lead a crew without having to yell and scream.  Teaching people the right way to perform a job task.Allowed me to grow my career in the oil and gas industry, put a lot of trust in my skills and sent me to training as needed. Very good place to workIn my first 18 months I had 6 different managers to which I had to report. They constantly pushed for more work while handing out minimal compensation.Was only there short time but all in all very good place and environment to work. I was transferred before I got started. Others I know love it.Tulsa office was closed after being an active and viable part of the community for 60 years.  I worked for Apache Corporation for 32 plus years and loved my tenure there.  The workplace was like an extended family, including employees, and vendors we dealt with.  The office closure was like a death.They are very friendly to their employees and the contractors who support them. The management team is laid back. Nothing else to add about them, please ask if you want more information.90% of the co-workers are easy to get along with and communicate to.  The hardest part of the job was to get the operators to send you monthly or even daily platform reports.  over all a good company to work for.Great people and good atmosphere to be around. Each job presents its own challenge. Get to work along beside some great folks who have great knowledge in what they do. I get to share what I know with them while training them on how to troubleshoot problems with controls for water systems and teach them what to look for when problems arise.overall a great place to work,compensation and benefits are awesome. work environment varies by office but overall is pretty positiveI was a contractor while at Mariner.  Apache hired me as a full time employee and provided me many opportunities for advancement.My day usually started with a safety meeting. Afterwards i would walk around the refinery and make sure all JSA's were filled out and signed by every employee. The hardest part of my day was firing people for working unsafe and dealing with unexpected injuries."
7,Apex Systems,"Boston Medical Center was a great company to work for. Apex systems failed to properly contact me when my contract ended.I was very pleased with this service.   They landed me a job that I enjoyed and the pay was great.  The associate was really great.  He called often to check on me and make sure things were going wellMy contract with Apex was very productive. The company gave good instruction on how to complete your daily job tasks. My co-workers and I got along with each other very well, we supported each other. The job was not hard at all, matter of fact it was a very easy job. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing so many cities and States.After fourteen years of military service all I can say is that it was worth it.  They really take care of their soldiers and their families.  It is really a family oriented military now.  better than it was beforeCo-workers were amazing people to work with.  The company itself doesn't value it's employees unless the employee is making money for them.  They only want metrics.They made the contracting process easy.  Once I started working for the contracted company I didn't have much interaction with Apex.  Didn't have to worry about much, Apex handled everything.Working for Apex is an awesome experience. Having representation onsite at the clients location is an added value. They have exceptional training courses and provide a pleasurable work experience.Computer day varies depending on the level or issue that has to be taken care of with the customer. Some days where slow but mostly busy all the time.The workplace is nice. A good mix of stressful and calmness. The other contractors are also very enjoyable which shows a good hiring process.They don't have the abitly to get you in a job full time and are not ganentee a place with the employer they put you with.They are contract company so when your contact is up you are done.I enjoyed working for Apex. Again this is a recruiting outfit and the interaction day to day is limited.  They paid adequately and the recruiters were friendly.This company pays a great compensation for both hours and mileage. They are a contract service, so the down fall is when your contract is over, you have no more work, unless there is another company needing you in your area. I was sadden when my contract was over, the hardest part was I was doing computer work for State Farm, and had to drive all over Louisiana.I got injured on the job!!!!! and got the run around lied to !!!!! They do not care about you if you get hurt they just fire you and ignore phone calls and emais .  Very unprofessional would not recommended working for themA decent company to work for.  Traveling is about 75% of the time.  There were many times when no work was available.  Scheduling can be difficult as it is through the military.this place please stay away from them they lie and blackball everyone and their pay sucks you work in a unhealthy work environmentWork in aggressive environment to thoroughly test the application. Able to learn new software and procedures.

Can be very cliquish but still a fun place to work.""They"" say you will be reimbursed for your expenses within 2 weeks. Not my experience, More like 3 weeks and you better make sure before you order that the restaurant has a point of sale machine that prints itemized receipts, has a good ribbon in the machine and you can get a good scan of the receipt. Really? No handwritten receipts are acceptable. So, local money to restaurants without these things is not reimbursable.This is on a $3+ BILLION HP contract with the Navy. Oh and BTW. They only pay 8 hours of travel each way so if they send you across the country and it takes 12 hours, you will be paid for 8.Depending on your HP supervisor, you will get 8 hours if you get their numbers for the day or you will get the hours you worked. Efficiency is not rewarded on a random supervisor basis.Worked at Dell as contract employee.  Poor hours, weekends and benefits were nearly non existent.Dell was hard to work with because of the Dell culture and metrics involved.  Call center work."

In shipping and receiving there is a lot of moving and you meet new people everyday.  We were a very small family orientated company.  There was a lot of teamwork and togetherness.  The hardest part of the job was the weather working in a warehouse.Applause is nice QA company with many inteligent people. Every employee can work in the projects, what they want. The best of features are flexible schedule and good practice.Working at Applause (formerly Utest) was a good chance to stay up to date with the Quality Assurance world.  While all testers (over 100,000) are all remote from around the world, we can all come together to work on various projects for desktop apps to mobile applications and everything in between.As everyone works remotely and you have no direct contact with the customer, you must rely upon your prior experience as a tester and the information that is presented to you in the overview of the project.The hours devoted to testing are based upon whatever the tester has designated within their profile.For a seasoned tester, not being able to have direct contact with the customer means that the tester needs to be diligent about asking questions for clarification."
687,Apple,"As a specialist, your duty is to help customers. Whether that is purchasing Apple merchandise or helping them trouble shoot. I learned more about communicating with customers. How to figure out more than one solution to one problem and to always keep the customers interests ahead of mine. Hardest part of my job was dealing with tasks that I was in no way required to do. Some customers would come in with issues that you had to resolve despite it not being an Apple app problem or software malfunction. But keeping Apple loyalty among customers is very important, so it had to be done. Enjoyable part of my job was helping people. As well as interacting with customers. I was able to learn new tasks and solutions every day. My coworkers were more than willing to lend a hand if needed and were so diverse in their education, backgrounds and fields of expertise that they had so much to offer myself as well the customers.Apple is a great company for bringing people together. We were a team of 300, and for the most part we were all into having big group events and hanging out together after work. Coming to work was a positive experience every day, and you learn a little bit about your job every day. Even at 2 years in the same job position, things change constantly and I am never bored. Pay could be better, and I wish that promotions were more frequent. Apple brings in new people constantly, and sometimes a transfer will come in.I had two internships at Apple, and the support from my manager and co-workers was outstanding. I learned something new each day and was able to have control of my own project and implement my own engineering design decisions to make a great impact. The compensation and benefits were generous, and the job occasionally required longer work hours.Overall, working for the Apple Store is an amazing opportunity. Their entry level pay is higher than most places, and you get plenty of benefits, even if you're part time. You just need to be willing to handle an extremely fast paced environment with a constant flow of customer traffic. Your skills with customer focus, product knowledge, and learning on the fly play a huge part in being a specialist for Apple.Most of the coworkers are friendly and willing to help, but unfortunately, the management uses personal favoritism in order to determine who gets to grow within the company.One of the best places I was able to be myself and strive at what I do best. With the addition of being able to help both co-workers in their training and development in growth and customers with any need.Being a Home Advisor for apple gives you the ability to work in the comfort of your own home office, while being able to work very closley with others within your team and departmentWonderful place to work.  I would have stayed longer but moved.  I became apple certified in a lot of different areas.  I love to be challenged and I'm very good worker.great place to work. However if you are considering advancing in the retail work it's a lot of politics with management.This is a great place to work! The team culture is awesome and great and the benefits are off the chart! The option to work from home and the company advancement are great!I always loved walking into work because I knew I was there to do something that mattered. Apple taught me new ways to look at the relationship between a customer and a product. The ways in which I learned to communicate with people and act as a professional are lessons I will not soon forget. The benefits for working at a company like Apple are hard to find anywhere else. From the Employee Stock purchase program to the ability to access some of the best software on the market for little to no charge, Apple takes care of their employees.Working for Apple was one of my best job experiences. The only downside was that once I was determined to be a ""rock star"" in sales, it was almost impossible for me to move into a different position within the store. I was only able to recieve my technician liscense after having surgery, and not being able to be on the sales floor, which allowed me time to study and pass the test. Even then, I was only allowed behind the genuis bar when they were shorthanded.Advancement is difficult but if you are persistent you can excel. There is a great discount for employee's and it's a super fun place to work! Very friendly staff and the management is extremely receptive to feedback as long as you are. Keep in mind though, you are getting paid to smile.good food at cafe and great co workers that led to a fun work environment.  great monthly beer activities lot of free beer, free beer. and lots of free beerI worked at Apple, Inc. for more than five years, in California, Oregon and Idaho as a Business Expert and Business Mentor. Business development, sales and employee trainings were my areas of responsibility. I built new and strengthened existing client relationships, strategized and implemented complete technology business solutions, coached and managed internal team members on all business processes, conducted client meetingsand instructed market-wide, internal business trainings.Good Job Work/Life BalanceGood Compensation/BenefitsGood Job Security/AdvancementGood ManagementGood Job CultureOverall Good experience at Apple.I have learn a lot from Apple Inc. I was assign to more job than i was suppose to. I deal with phone calls and order materials just like being a receptionist. In Apple Inc. I work with a huge team members that everyday I have to check everyone's work make sure is neat and tidy before they get send out. If there a problem I mark it down on the system to forward it to my manager.Each and every day you will meet amazing customers from all over the world who have one thing in common... The love for Apple. Not only will the customers and the busy atmosphere make your day go buy in a jiffy, but the hundreds of employees you work with day in and day outWorking for Apple is great, they open doors to endless possibilities, have great benefits and perks and are just overall a whole different environment then you are used to.They are always changing the goal you need to meet. but overall it's ok. I loooovvvveeeee my manager but the HR is not as greatApple provides paid training and it is really good training they do not just shove you though and put you out to get eaten alive. They make sure you know everything and have the tools to succeed and advance with in apple.Apple is an amazing company to work for. The experience and knowledge you gain is once in a life time. It's fast passed and ever changing. The ability to succeed within the company is unlimited."

Management wants to cheerlead you through the long hours, poor raises and sudden shifts in job requirements with copious swag and beer parties you can't even attend if you're on shift anyway (or you'll be on the phone buzzed, which isn't allowed). If you're willing to still through those for the health and retirement benefits then this is the place for you. Otherwise, look elsewhere. It's so competitive here, people trying to get ahead will not hesitate to throw you under the bus and climb over.Typical day of my work is to schedule multiple interview while also monitoring day to day schedules (up to 4 - 5 a day). I also send out offer letters and on-board new candidates. I learned how to juggle all these things at once and how to handle work/life balance. Working at Apple as taught me how to use Mac software as well. Management is great! They always made sure to communicate and never point a finger. Just get the problem fixed if it ever raised. My workers are really dependable. Everyone wanted to help and so did I. Hardest part of my could be the last min updates to interview schedules but that was usually day to day so it did not become a problem. The most enjoyable part if when I get to on-board new candidates that I scheduled. It can be so rewarding to know that all your hard work was a life changing to someone.The company treats you like family and not just a number or an employee. You are welcomed with open arms into the Apple Culture and you find yourself speaking and acting the Apple way even though you may not even be present at work. Level of expectations are extremely high and you find yourself doing the same in your personal life. You learn that ""good enough"" doesn't fly but rather that perfection is expected of you & you find everyone else striving on a daily basis to meet that level of expectation. There is job security! Its hard to advance internally but to advance externally is easier.Apple as a company is a great company to work for. They train and give competitive wages. The benefits are a real positive that the company offers. A typical day at work can be very stressful and physically demanding.I learned teamwork, technical skills and staff development. Co-workers were my favorite part of the job, however management left a little to be desired. The hardest part of the Job is the customers that demanded more than what we can give. The most enjoyable would be the repairing computers.The best part of working at Apple was helping customers who appreciated your knowledge and expertise. However, management and getting promoted could be very political. Employees were given opportunities to mentor continuing and incoming hires, as well as start programs that contribute to internal culture. While at Apple, I started Old Orchard Magazine, a publication designed to get all the store's news to the entire team, while including light-hearted, health-related content about flu shots and yoga poses.I've had a great time at Apple, I started as a lowly phone agent in 2007, but in 9 years have increased my salary by 4 times and am doing jobs I never thought in 2007 I'd be doing now. Management is great, (keep in mind there are 10k people in this campus, and I've mainly worked in the operations side of things without a degree) albeit times the culture seems to be shifting from the bottom up worship of the past to a top-down middle manager methodology.(Contract position)A typical day of work consists of 75% of the day spent at your cubical on a laptop with a large monitor, 12.5% of mandatory break time (two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch break), and 12.5% of group discussions and team meetings. Management at times seems to lack interpersonal skills and asking questions is always a tricky situation to navigate. The team is encouraged to ask questions to maintain consistency on projects, but ask the wrong question and you risk being ridiculed by management. Team members are often compared to one another to create a competitive work environment. Favoritism by management is a large problem the team faces, and payment is not always on time or accurate.Best call center helpdesk to work in hands down - training is extensive, couching and follow-up is constant, only hurdle is politics with management that will affect promotions and new positions.Overall, working for the Apple Store is an amazing opportunity. Their entry level pay is higher than most places, and you get plenty of benefits, even if you're part time. You just need to be willing to handle an extremely fast paced environment with a constant flow of customer traffic. Your skills with customer focus, product knowledge, and learning on the fly play a huge part in being a specialist for Apple.Most of the coworkers are friendly and willing to help, but unfortunately, the management uses personal favoritism in order to determine who gets to grow within the company.This is blessing and a curse, as it gives the person with little previous experience the chance to gain top notch management experience. With so many unqualified managers running around though, it turns into a culture that fosters favoritism, and promotes based on networking, rather than actual job experience and talent.I loved this job at first, but my vision was clouded by the glam of working for the company. Once the koolaid wears off, you find yourself surrounded by a bunch of zealots who would throw you under a bus in a moment's notice to get that next promotion. Be careful who you trust at this company, be very careful.Also, I had 10 different managers in 9 months. I only switched teams twice. They are constantly moving managers around, building cold and lifeless manager/employee relationships that are vaguely based on personality, and largely based on metrics.By all means, get your job experience, but get out before it sucks the soul out of you. The mangers ruin this job.Working for Apple was one of my best job experiences. The only downside was that once I was determined to be a ""rock star"" in sales, it was almost impossible for me to move into a different position within the store.

Very progressive and inclusive culture. Top notch benefits. Have met some great people. Processes are always changing. Would like to see more stability on schedule.This is a great place to work! The team culture is awesome and great and the benefits are off the chart! The option to work from home and the company advancement are great!Apple was great to work for, don't get me wrong but they were stingy when it came to raises and there was not a lot of chances for a home based agent to move up.  Probably because well, you are home based and many of the job openings are not.  The benefits are excellent; if I remember it correctly you had health benefits on day one (no waiting period.) which of course if very rare.  Another very silly and vain perk was just the fact that you are working for Apple!  When people would ask who you worked for and I would say Apple you could see the admiration on their faces (and working from home for them just added to their jealousy!)  All in all it was an awesome experience and one that I really wouldn't hesitate to recommend to someone else.From your first to your last day with Apple, expect to be pushed to your limits in your knowledge and ability in several ways. Your team and your fellow coworkers are great at supporting you and keeping the environment cheerful and positive. Plenty of opportunities to grow as an AppleCare representative and in administrative positions. That in mind, you will need to be more than proactive in reaching out to additional hiring managers if you want to be anything but AppleCare.This company has changed drastically over the last few years. As it has grown quickly, the work environment has become much more corporate. There is a large influx of former Dell management that have joined the team and the work environment is more like Dell (all of the bad stories you have heard over the years). Employees are now seen as disposable.Worked in a highly engaged, valued customer service position. Enjoyed learning about Apple Technology and programs and worked with like-minded individuals.Management was varied but driven and provided good support on job roles and information. The co-worker environment was minimal since the position was work from home, and allowed personal relationships to build when wanted.The hardest part of the job was having to let it go. If the option was or is available to me I would absolutely work for them again.The most enjoyable part was the problem solving. Being able to resolve and determine technical issues.Have to love this company. It is a test of your intelligence, Technical aptitude and definitely people skills. If your looking for a feel good job that tests your limits this is the place. The people that you work with are great! They will become your second family. Benefits are second to none. And corporate knows exactly what they are doing and always have something in place to transition into whatever it is they are doing.My overall experience at apple has been excellent, however most my my negative experiences such as bad management, over micromanagement, and poor benefits apply to the contracting company Apex Systems."
310,Applied Materials,"It was a very laid back environment until it was time to get things accomplished.

Management is always here to better you and get you to the places you want to be.Great company culture which allows for personal creativity and problem solving. Generally a laid back atmosphere.Opportunities to work in many different locations.The work always offers a challenge and more to do and learn, but learning is hindered by a lack of institutional learning.  Each department reinvents the wheel for so much of what they do.  This is exacerbated by management requiring such a high volume of work (typical day is 12 hours or more).Great company to work for.  The culture was highly bright and it was a joy to speak with all levels of management.  The work/life balance could use some improvementsThe corporate culture is 'Silicon Valley' - a flat management style where results matter.  There are no 'silos':  the workers are expected to go anywhere and interact with anyone, without restriction, to accomplish their objectives.  Managers are there to clear roadblocks.In return for an unfettered work environment, the workers are evaluated on their performance - and if the performance is excellent, they are richly rewarded.  If their performance is not excellent, they should be looking around for another job.  The industry is cyclical, and layoffs occur roughly every 18 months or so.  Regardless if you are a worker or a manager, if you do not demonstrate consistent, superior performance, you should be looking around for work elsewhere.Because Applied is the #1 global manufacturer of capital equipment, the expectations are sky-high.  Competition is fierce, and Applied competes on a global basis.  Applied sells their products worldwide because they are the best in the world, with the fastest time to market.  The typical product horizon is released in 90 days or less - the longest is 6 months, and that is rare.  This is generally not the environment for a work/life balance - the emphasis is on being #1 with rapid deliveries.  On the plus side, working at Applied is the opportunity to demonstrate superior performance in a world-class organization.I have learned that in there are many people with disabilities that are not life disabling / threatening.

Easy to talk to guys with a laid back and appreciative attitude. Co-workers are average. You will have the ones you like and do not like, but at the end of the day, you are a family.

Their Paid Leave policies are beyond wonderful and are flexible.A bunch of guys that blew stuff up in the desert - Now they are trying to expand their business foot print and have the know how to get it done, but have trouble executing this.Worked with 12 personnel daily ensuring they got assistance from me in equipment checks & accountability, training, and deployment of personnel and equipment.  My co-workers were all active duty Air Force members that were subject to deploy to any location in the world with only short notice.  The hardest part of the job was making sure members were ready to meet military requirements to support our country.  The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing job satisfaction that they were ready and that I made that happen.Our work is mostly research oriented. We conduct experiments sing our equipments depending on the project we are handling and the runs usually go on for 7 hours. Most of our work involves research to find out how to get better results by going through a lot of papers and articles. We are guided by my adviser and Post-Doc who mention our goals and assist us in understanding our experiments better. The hardest part is getting the machine to work properly as it gives trouble from time to time while the fun part is the freedom we are offered. We can conduct experiments with our own ideas provided they are feasible. This has helped us gain a lot by means f trial and error.Outstanding to work for. Great support form all levels of management and branches of the company. As a contractor, I am at a remote site, and have never actually met my supervisors face-to-face, but have any support if needed. They leave you alone to perform your job, and the review/ratings for promotion/pay increase is very fair! As a recently seperated veteran, this company was an easy transition to make. But- with all DoD contracting firms, job security is only as good as the politicians and the needs of the military. No fault of the company- but I got my sequester notice. They are assisting us every step of the way to the last day- and helping to us to find other jobs. Typical day of work at ARA includes little to no communication with/through staff.  Great experiences and work with customers. Coworkers, with the exception of a few, have little to no communication and/or personal skills.  There is little to no appreciation for employees and even customers.  Nepotism and management ""favorites"" ruin the work environment.Great work environment.Learned excellent team collaboration techniques.Management genuinely concerned for the work force.Hardest part of the job was the commute.Most enjoyable part of the job was traveling.Working at ARA allows lots of people interaction with interesting projects being developed by Scientist, Engineers, and Software Developers. The culture is very strict, and based in military/government schools of thought.ARA is a Department of Defense contract firm so I had direct client interfacing while planning military exercises for United States Strategic Command. A typical day included collaboration with other working groups, developing training and exercise objectives and identifying requirements to meet those objectives.  Coordination with trusted agents and other planners to build story lines and integrate those vignettes with the master scenario.Co-workers were other DoD contractors, government civilians and military members with varying skill sets.The hardest part of the job was working with the exercise scripters to integrate smaller story lines.The most enjoyable part of the job was during exercise execution when we got to see the flow of the exercise and how the training audience reacted and worked together to develop solutions to the problem set created.All employees own stock in the company. They have a good benefits and retirement package and are flexible with work schedules.good benefits but an ""eat what you kill"" company;  hard to get good balance of work and outside life.  divisions have had lot of turnover of late with sequestration.  juggle many projects.ARA provides a good solid work environment that promotes learning and growth. All members of the staff that I interacted with were always friendly and professional.Diverse technology, has a strong team with excellent skills and technology for innovative products and projectsGreat environment and benefits. Typical 9-5 job. Pay is good. The managment is understanding of the balace of work and family life. Good stock options and retirement plans.  Interesting subject matter with the military.Testing new machines to upgrade security in the  fight against terrorism.9-5 job. Great work environment and great people to work with. wrong application of QA, hard employer for women in general, difficult to succeed as QA.Each day at Applied Research Associates was different. Being a consulting/contracting firm (dealing mostly with government and military) presented various challenges and projects. A typical day would usually consist of reviewing lab write ups/white papers, preforming a variety of tests, generating lab reports, and finally submitting lab reports.I learned a variety of tasks including (but not limited to) preforming various tests, generating test protocols, generating lab write ups, designing and manufacturing test jigs/fixtures.The management at Applied Research Associates was relatively strict, but still very knowledgeable. They were very strict on meeting deadlines and being under budget, which is completely understandable when dealing with contracts. But it can however make for a very stressful work environment.My co-workers were very knowledgeable and came from a variety of backgrounds and schools/degrees. It was not unheard of for an engineer to work with a physics major. It made for very interesting group dynamics, but also made it easier to generating new concepts by having people from different backgrounds.The hardest part of the job was generating the white papers and lab reports while still meeting the, usually, tight deadlines.The most enjoyable part of the job was the challenge. Every day you worked on something different, it was great for keeping you stimulated and interested in the work you were doing. Each day was a great learning opportunity."
241,Aramco Services Company,"You worked a 12 hour day offshore & went to oil platforms by boat. There were days when the seas were rough so you stayed on the platform that had living quarters.

The company is now so diverse in its capability from originally oil and gas production, all the way to NGL, chemical and plastics.I have to say that; it was an experience not to be missed and I did largely benefit from it in more ways than one. A multi ethnic and diverse workforce when working with either employer or contractor.A company that I would recommend anyone who gets the opportunity to work for.Quite energy draining job co'z you have to drive kilometers and kilometers of off-road condition for the require daily inspection of pipeline construction activities.Aramco is the best company i have ever had the pleasure to work for. very professional people and positive environment.I stated the work 10 years before in Kingdom Of Saudi Arabia in Oil & Gas fields. Very good company and I gained very good experience in piping , welding Mechanical equipment, Hydro testing etcWorking for Aramco is a different environment in terms of culture - you must be patient to learn and understand the culture.Overall, a very good company to work for.It is a great organization with tremendous opportunities to grow in the organization, varied technology.A typical day at work is extremely busy with handling three contractors. I have learned to handle my work load day by day. My Co-Workers are the best and enjoy working with them on  daily basis.Hardest part of my job is not knowing how to speak Arabic.Not good company to work for, There is lack of senior management and professionalism. There is no feel of ownership for the projects.EPC projects are done without real controlI had a lot of works there due to the company was new in that time. my team and I worked several months to finish the company headquarter offices.great place while i was able to work there, fun workplace. great people. i helped on a audit my second year there for the company and got to meet a lot of great people.Saudi Aramco is well-known company which developed high standards values and regulations in Saudi society. As an SMP with Project Management Team, I used to relocate my job location as per job requirements. Most projects were in remote areas.

151,Arcadis,"I love the people I work with. Aggressive billable hours goals can be tough to get used to if you haven't worked as a consultant before.Was an acquired firm but was a great place to work! Great people and culture with room for advancement. Wished the company was able to maintain the workforce.Strong global company with the desire to do great things. First part of the climb was, to pay off all senior staff to leave the company and hire Collage students. Effects, the company lost clients and senior knowledge. Next up was to hold back and stop yearly merit increases... when moral was already low from previous actions, it just dipped lower. Each deparment has their own personnel challenges. No company is going to give their money away, but this one will try to give up as little as possible on it's staff, even if you do more than expected (above and bound).Flexible work schedule, Great people, but stability and advancement opportunities are poor. For similar role with a competitor, the salary is low as well.Ok, very large company with many offices and international locations. Felt too large and impersonal. Okay place to start careerPoor company to work with.  I was with the firm for many, many years and it has gone down hill since the merger with Malcolm Pirnie.  The merger was poorly managed, the leadership team let the smaller purchased company come in and change how a well managed company was run and it FAILED.  Morale in most offices is very bad, there is no loyalty, management talks of a ""transformation plan"" that has falsified KPI's.  Bonuses have gone down, down, down every year since the merger with Malcolm Pirnie.  The hires they make into leadership and business development roles are very poorly vetted, business revenue is not improving year after year.  I think this company needs to start from scratch and get back to basics and should start by getting rid of all of the Malcolm Pirnie employees still left in the firm.The pay and benefits have been great, but the hours are terrible.  I have no time for life outside of work.  Management seems to want to help you succeed, and will pay for any continued educationAfter 23 years of my service, Arcadis fired me while I was out on disability recovering from my liver transplant. They then started to force out any senior members who had 20+ years of experience. This was a cost saving measure to purge all the high end salaries. Many of the furloughed employees were from the original G & M firm who helped Arcadis grow from 10,000 to over 55,000 people. We in the Southeast provided most of the revenues to finance their expansion. We were rewarded with pink slips. My advice is to join the company for experience and leave for a better job as soon as you can. Loyalty is not a word in the Arcadis vocabulary.My overall experience has been good. I like what I do, and where I do it, I love the fact that I serve a purpose to the American public. Management has been very helpful in helping to adjust to the different areas and scope of work. The hardest part about this job is the travel. I loved it at first. Now I just need to be at home more with my family. My co-workers have all on the most part been one of the best parts to my job. Most of them are in the same boat as I. This make relationships easy to relate to.great opportunity to learn and for professional development,  My co-workers are team spirited and work well together.The position was not advertised as the actual position required. My expertise was in Project Accounting, not Governmental Contract Accounting.Huge turnover. Management is horrible with money, so they are constantly looking for younger people who will do the same work for a fraction of a good wage. Laid off after thirty years of loyalty and hard work because their poor work can't maintain clients. It used to be a good company but they fired all of the people who made the company work. Good luck in this shrinking industry.(This is my experience from someone who has had multiple years of field work with ARCADIS)Typical engineering company. Nothing very special about the way it treats its employees. Promotes a culture of self promotion and not actual hard work to move up the chain. Good way to start a career but I would not recommend staying with this company once you have experience. Some people get lucky and find a nice niche but they can get eliminated after a few years depending on how bad the company is doing.Horrible communication between office staff and field staff. Never got to a job site where the ARCADIS office staff came up with an efficient and common sense plan. There is no emphasis on field-office staff communication. Probably would save millions of dollars for ARCADIS-US if they did. That is no exaggeration I personally have seen hundreds of thousands of dollars of waste because of this lack of communication. The communication problem is also exacerbated by the current policy of ARCADIS to hire the youngest and cheapest  employees to do the field work.There is some positives though. Can work with some experienced people that have stayed with the company and actually learn a few things. Currently ARCADIS is on a rampage to get rid of experienced people though. There is no guarantee of having a job from year to year and it will try and use you for every dollar that it gives you. I would view ARCADIS as a good place to get training and that's it.Like I said earlier get experience and then get out.- Work for this company for 8 yrs since I was 19.- Company is willing to teach and groom new trainees- Friendly co-workers- Not doing redundant work every week- Hardest part about the job was learning new, tedious, and critical work that needed to be completed as soon as possible. - The most enjoyable part about the job was learning new and intense work on a daily basis.Communication is very poor. As a new employee the burden is shifted to me to figure out what projects I'm on or I am notified less than a day before that I'm on a job. We're supposed to have project meetings which I'm never involved in, but am expected to know what was discussed. Finally, the way expense reporting and billable hours work is horrible. Lets just say that if I work over 40 hours, but 8 of those hours were to overhead and not a project well I just wont get paid for those 8 hours. At least they are flexible with career paths and letting you decide what type of work you'd like to learn.Good breadth of projects. The company has a global perspective. Lot of opportunity for collaboration on firm wide level. Focused on few sectors.Where to begin? From the beginning a lot of promises were said but never followed up on. Me and fellow colleagues helped build up a new process for a project we were collaborating on globally and were literally used and abused. Once the project was completed management dropped our hours from 50% for example and expect people to stay busy of be threatened with layoff. A lot of blackmailing goes on if you are not of the big boys club or one of their favorites. A lot of favoritism occurs and management likes to speak to people like dirt. Also they expect you to work 10 hours without an outside social life. They also treat women like its 1950. If you are married and have children they make you feel guilty about having to leave work after 8 hours. It is like working on a slave ship for very low pay, I would avoid this company by all means.A typical work day is continually putting out fires.  I rarely knew in the morning what I would be working on in the afternoon, but I always knew I would be busy.Ever since the company became publicly traded on the stock market job security and morale plummeted.I didn't get the chance to work at Arcadis long, but I enjoyed the time  I did spend there! Great management and staff! This is a company that really cares about their employees.I enjoyed working with the Project Managers from all over the US and Canada as well as Brazil, Chile, & Peru.  I enjoyed the challenges of the larger projects.I learned the practices and procedures of accountingYou'll feel like a little fish in a big boy club world. Employees work extra hard, just to obtain a 1.5-2.5% raise.........."

This is a company that tries so hard to impress their competitors and stakeholders that they neglect the well-being of their employees. Arcaadis is seeing a lot of decline - don't believe the heresay of acquisitions/partnering and how strongly they are positioned. They aren't. Staff is dwindling and most major competitors know they are a joke in the industry. What you should focus on is the mass exodus of employees, bipolar management, micro-managers, no office morale, extremely low pay, no sick days, no bonuses, and NO WORK. Layoffs are constant here because Arcadis just cant win.Billability is truly the only thing that matters at this company.  You can be the most brilliant, talented, well-liked person imaginable, but if you suddenly, through no fault of your own, find yourself less billable than someone who just processes storage boxes all day, then you go, and they stay.  Your timesheet is either your ticket upward or the nail in your coffin.As much as they try, the divisional walls at the company will never be taken down.  If a certain division is in need of a skill, and you have that skill, you may never find each other.  People are laid off all the time who could probably have been kept quite busy elsewhere, but management is unaware of how to make that happen.The most difficult part of the job is the heavy focus on billabilty and finding work for one's self. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to interact with new clients and other contractors on a daily basis.Company is very driven around business development. Projects are very impressive to work on. The PMCM division is  still working on developing standard procedures. Advancement seems to be promotion to project manager as well as take on business development role concurrently.I enjoyed working with the Project Managers from all over the US and Canada as well as Brazil, Chile, & Peru.  I enjoyed the challenges of the larger projects.I learned the practices and procedures of accounting"
453,Arch,"ARCH is a non-profit organization. I work at the homeless shelter known as the TRUST House. It's a dual recovery environment that deals with mental illness and substance abuse. I work closely with veterans. There is a daily message of hope that every resident receives.The reason why i did this job is because it was flexible to my school schedule, theres not need for clocking in or out. The only time i would come and work would be when there had a patient for me. I would always come after class and maybe have one or two clients.ARCH was a great learning experience. It allowed me to help those who were in need. A typical day at work varied because each day was different. Most days were booked meeting with clients to assist them in their needs. Other days I would have to travel to different locations to do walk throughs for housing. Management was great gave me the freedom to do what I loved the most and that was help people. We were a family at ARCH. The hardest part of the job was not being able to help everyone who walked through the doors. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing families get a second chance to be independent.Greeted and conducted students and staff members arrived at Arch Center.*Answered multiple phone lines, data entry, sorted incoming/ outgoing mail, faxes and mailing materials.*Assisted with special projects, job fairs, talent shows, activities.*Also photocopied students’ documentation, Birth Certificates, SSC, and ID.*Transferred incoming phone calls to the appropriate staff members.Offer mentoring services 30 to 40 freshman, sophomore, and junior summer school studentsCoordinate teacher aide services for summer school classesCoordinate healthy activities such as basketball, football, volleyball, tennisChaperone trips to the local YMCA, bowling alley, art museum, and other activitiesThis place is a home to its staff and participants. It was a great opportunity and I am grateful to have been apart of such a wonderful company.Current job duties include but not limited to; Electronically receive/review and process files of mortgage loan confidential documents, printing, scanning, faxing, etc                                                                       Work with Departments on the secure transmitting of documents.A basic learning environment, starts off fast paced and stays that way throughout the day. ARCH made certain that you learned what was taught with hands on projects, constructing both simple and complex projects. The supervisors were both helpful and patient with the teaching process.Great arrangement for the time in which I was employed there, however my needs since I started have dramatically changed.The shift lasted for 24 hours, the management was good but they seem to ignore any issues with the residentsThe most enjoyable part about the job was when we played bingo and exercising, and to know I was making them feel goodabout there self."
403,Argonne National Laboratory,"Engaging, diverse and multicultural University like environment.The APS Beamline hosts users from all around the world and is the brightest X-ray source in the world. Every day continues to be an education.Argonne hires a lot of foreign  employees, so the best part about this job would be learning about all the different cutlers that are present here.I did my summer intern at Argonne. Its a great place to work. Huge number of cool projects are happening on daily basis. Lots of learn. Higher management is very helpful.Weekly meeting to discuss progress on various projects.  Learned what other professional were working on and the progress and problems they en-counted.  .Group participation in addressing problems en-counted by the other groups.  Worked mostly alone with little supervision.  however, assistance was always available.  The hardest part of the job was leaving at the end of a day.  The most enjoyable was returning to the job the next dayFortunate to learn a lot at a young age during an internship. Made you feel very welcome and always allowed you to seek new opportunities. Also a great location for those who like the city of Chicago.At ANL, I enjoy my co-workers and most of the researchers I help support as an HP tech. There are good benefits, job secuirty at least for me is great (Unionized), and my direct supervisor is wonderful. My largest issues stem from my group management. There is an overall feeling from many of the techs that our opinions are not heard and our feelings dismissed. While this might not be entirely the case this seems to be a common feeling among both the good workers and the bad workers. This could stem from lack of communication from our upper management about how our issues are actually addressed instead of just being told no. There is also a lack of training and continuing education at the tech level. While many don't care about having this there are a few of us that do and would like to be given that opportunity. Others issues stem from the way techs are treated by researchers we support on a day to day basis. Many of us end up being buffers between the researcher and our supervisors. This is emotionally exhausting. Many attempt to do things behind their area HP's back and are upset when a tech goes to their boss to ensure that whatever the researcher is wanting to do is safe, covered by appropriate work control docs and RWPs. Many have no care or no understanding of contamination control and argue with techs if they are told they are doing something unsafely. While we don't have Ph.Ds we are experts in our right in our field. Over the last 2 years many researchers have gotten better, but I still find there is a general lack of respect for safety personnel in general. As an hourly  more... worker, work life balance is hard especially since alternative schedules were taken away from us by upper management. Argonne as a whole (not just looking at my little world) seems to be an excellent place to work. Every group has their issues. I have no opinion of upper upper laboratory management.  lessWorking at the lab is unique. The culture is so relaxed, because the focus here is about the science and results. It's not a strict environment at all. So, self-motivation and initiative will get you far here.The coworkers are down to earth and friendly. They are proud of the work they do. That's what it's like working here: doing great work and taking pride in it.Argonne is located in Lemont, which is a far southwest suburb of Chicago. This is probably my largest gripe with this employment: the commute is difficult.This place has great people. Good salary, nice location, great compensation, in Chicago area, lots of food and entertainment not far awayWhile attending Purdue University I worked as an intern and assigned to the Decision and Information Science Division. I designed power supplies for special instruments used in collecting data for energy conservation. This was very exciting because projects were experimental and on the leading edge.A typical day at work is very busy. There is no room to grow nor any employment opportunities after the internship. You mostly work alone with very little supervision. You do learn about what scientific breakthroughs Argonne has discovered and are currently working on. You also meet different people on a daily basics.The potential for personal and professional growth is highly dependent on who you work for. Most PIs are only interested in advanced their personal career and are likely to treat you as a technician, not a young scientific mind. However, there are a few gems that are wonderful people and scientists. I would highly recommend looking at what happened with the careers of the previous postdocs before working for someone at ANL.As a radiation safety trainer and an HP technician, I interacted with hundreds of people from around the country and around the world.  Management is caring and focused on Argonne's objectives while also aware that those employed here have lives outside of work.I've found Argonne to be extremely helpful in furthering my professional development.  The pay and benefits are much better than academic postdoc positions and you're surrounded by world-class researchers and equipment.  The downside is that getting hired to a permanent position here is extremely difficult.The editors offered useful advice concerning effective writing. My writing skill improved substantially from their advice. The project teams worked closely together to deliver results.I only worked there as an intern so I don't have much to say. I enjoyed the culture I worked in, and the people I worked with. The engineers I was working with were highly motivated and exceptionally intelligent, making the internship very productive for my development.I worked with a team to support the lab with rigging and transporting of scientific equipment.• Installed specialized lab equipment requiring advanced skills for hoisting/ transport within facilities and onsite• Worked on lift plans for critical lifts with an emphasis on safety• Proficient in safe working loads and standards for all rigging including chains, chokers, slings, spreader beams, and other associated hardwareI would get tickets for troubles from the Service desk and work with a crew of Desktop support admins. All of the crew were extremely talented and all would help you at any given moment. The company was a National Laboratory so every year there was a possibility that the government would be shut down. Management was good as to not micromanage and allowed you to work unabated, as long as within Service Agreement parameters.Excellent place to work. Excellent environment. Excellent People. Many good thing to learn. Excellent Challenges.I highly recommend this place to work.ANL is a great place to work to advance your career with hands on training.  It is also good to take advantage of the opportunity to further your education.I love working at Argonne National Laboratories.  The people are nice and they really care about making sure that you understand what you are doing.  If you are on staff you have great benefits, but as a contractor you have no benefits except what you get from your staffing agency (almost nothing).It was not an exciting place to work. It was monotonous work.  Had good compensation.  There was not much supervision.  A lot of shift changes that made it hard to balance work/home."
237,"ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc","Work/Life balance can be in favor of work depending on the position held. You learn an incredible amount in IT, but it is not without the downside of having to apply that knowledge in time compressed schedules. Most of your coworkers are in the same boat, so there is little offloading of tasks. The most enjoyable part of the position is knowing a project has completed leading to a sense of accomplishment.great culture, great company, doing excellent science. It is sad that recently so much happened to it. Enjoyed everyday working here."
217,Array BioPharma,"It was a great learning environment at first, was under great lead. Until that person left and then instead of fixing issues, things were 'band-aided'. After working there 8 months I still had no permissions or local admin rights to perform any task other than helplessly assign tickets to the appropriate departments for checking. After months and months of begging and constant nagging for the required access to do my required duties, I was let go due to lack of work, when we had been wrecklessly and desperately looking for new temps for many weeks prior. Not a company for advancement at all for they are only in it for the profit and layovers and not the actual work being done. I met some VERY amazing people in there and I wouldn't change meeting those folks for the world. I learned a lot about relationships and how having certain relationships with other parts and cultures of the company helps you grow stronger as a whole professionally and personally. And that's the kind of behavior we need to grow a career and maintain doing something we are passionate about.company overall has good prospects but senior leadership doesn't communicate, support staff, or make good decisionsProgram teams are open with the expectation of all contributing. Training and team support were always there. Access to senior managers. Program and project teams always current in all functional areas and invited to help address challenges.Array provides all the tools needed to advance projects and programs, excellent access to the literature through journal subscriptions, enthusiastic library resources, sophisticated chemical search engines with many of the staff current on the latest findings in both discovery and early clinical information.Stimulating working environment with the opportunity to work with brilliant world class chemists and biologists in drug discovery. I learned a great deal about the process required to move a compound from discovery to formulation to testing thru GMP/FDA certification. Typically I processed orders from sourcing and requisition to completion including order placement, tracking and expediting to delivery. Managed suppliers and negotiated contracts.The most challenging part of my job was dealing with the work habits of one of my co-workers.The most rewarding aspect of working with the Array team was knowing that the drugs we created were produced in order to alleviate illness and improve health and well being.Strong medicinal chemistry capability and solid drug discovery capability with an established record of success."
798,Artech Information Systems,"Overall a good experience, some things could have been handled better.  There was no job security and very little interaction directly with Artedh.   There were no other projects that I could be assigned to when my current assignment ended.  As a consultant on site with their client (i.e. revenue generator) the company benefits outside of salary were not there.Artech can get a bad rap from its contractors but for fulltime employees it's a good place with a great culture and good benefits. CEO really cares about employees and if you work hard you'll be rewarded. I'm a corporate employee so my thoughts may differ from those in regional offices.A typical day was started at 8 AM with a meeting about the workload and priorities of the day. We head home around 430 PM each day. While I was employed I learned a great deal about remote administration in the Windows environment, as well as configuring User accounts and network resources within Active Directory. Artech is a contracting firm. The only communication I had with management was when they changed the terms of my contract and wanted to pay me less. I did not have any fellow Artech employees working with me. The hardest part of the job was being discouraged from finding solutions to base wide computer problems. One time I was actually told that a certain platform would not be of concern several months down the road so do not worry about employing a fix for the end User. Easily, the most enjoyable part of the job is hearing the customer say their computer has never run so well after you've worked your magic.This is not a great company to work for, they are unethical and treat the employees and contractors bad. They promise you a salary when you first speak with them but when the job offer comes it is lower. i would never recommend this company.Good contracting agency. The company does a really good job the first time you gain a contract through them. They took good care of me when i needed anything or had any concerns. The only (sole) disappointment is that after my contract was complete, I was no longer able to get responses from the local recruiters to find additional contracts for work.I was able to gain many new skills during my 15 months in this role and every day was different. I supported three members of the communications department team and learned how to be a team player while completing a personal workload of local events and different communication tasks at the same time. Writing was a huge part of this role, both in short form event invitations and long form editorial articles. I was responsible for updating our company website and site televisions with new editorial content each week, which meant that I had to maintain a working knowledge of the technical systems used for posting new material. I coordinated with outside vendors for internal company events and partnered with other departments like HR and IT for news stories and program launches. Being in communications meant that you worked with every employee in some capacity. It was very much like being the glue of the company culture.This role truly gave me perspective on what it means to develop a business plan, provide the resources to execute that plan, follow through with those resources, and summarize your results. The most important part of that process is analyzing the steps and finding what can be improved for the next time around.I only worked with this agent a short time.  I found it difficult to understand the recruiters when speaking with them due to heavy foreign accents, however the written communications gave clearer understanding of project and requirements.Artech placed me in IBM originally and was wonderful to work for.  Time sheets were easy to fill out and submit electronically, and while I was there, a 401K offering was created.   Very positive.An interesting and enjoyable place to work.  I talked to people in far away places.  I worked with people in upper managementand learned much from them.If you work at Artech, you have to believe in yourself because management can make you question your abilities. People are underpaid for the amount of work that is expected of them.I think they need to appreciate their employees more. I have seen too many good people leave and management doesn't seem to care.I wish management would listen to its employees. For example, there are managers who aren't totally present when you meet with them. They are either too busy answering emails, doing work in front of you, which makes you feel completely disrespected.Co-workers are great. The job itself is enjoyable, but they need to provide more resources so people don't have to do other people's jobs, which affects the job that they were hired for in the first place.I was a contract employee for 2 years.  I was disappointed that I never heard a word near the end of my contract about other contract possibilities. After 2 years I thought that maybe they would like to pick me up on another contact for another company in the area since they were familiar with my work.  I had discussed it with the main office 4 or 5 months earlier but I never heard another word about it.  I really enjoyed working with Artech, I would work for them again.I really enjoyed working at Harley-Davidson for the CEO with Artech.  I learned new computer skills and utilized the skills I had in preparing PowerPoint presentations and handling other special projects on a daily basis.  My supervisor was awesome and the hardest part of the job was leaving due to budget cuts.  I would consider another contract with Artech again!Didn't last as long as expected.  Contract position.  Pay and benefits were decent.  HR was easy to work with.  Opportunity to learn about the health care industry.I ensured end of day (EOD) processes completed properly.Investigated and corrected promotions that were abending or lost.Corrected and deployed price fixes for the system and/or individual stores.  I enjoyed working with the people; wish the contract was longer and that new development was done.Work days are typically 10 to 12 hours per day.  Learned healthcare version of project management.  Co-workers are helpful.  Hardest part of the job is the drive (distance).  Most enjoyable part of the job is knowing what I produce for the healthcare provider is towards the service for the patients.Working at this company, nobody is looking over your shoulder, just as long as you know what you're doing and finished your work on time. You just need to be productive.I really give HIGH Praise for Artech and the staff member there placing me with a IT Job will IBM.  I really love my job and I'm working in the area which I'm proud to be part of.  I say Thank You to ArtechThey are very professional and helpful in their field. They are very informative and knowledgeable in order to reach their goals on time.Artech is a great employer. They always support their employees and help employees grow and learn.They could do better when it comes to their quickness to respond, but it's understandable since they have such a high number of employees.  A typical day consists of supporting the client and ensuring you're available for any concerns or needs that may need to be addressed immediately.Perform to Support Medical-Perfusion System production floor, Engineer projects, conducts preventive maintenance on all equipment to help people to find the jobs.Professional, Enjoyable staff, supportive. This is a recruiting and staffing agency with a strong relationship with the client."
144,Ascend Clinical,"It gets very busy during first week but it's workable. Good company to work for. Great co-workers. My only complain/concern about Ascend is that the don't appreciate their on-call/per diem employees more than they should since they are the ones finishing the work during busy week. It was very disappointing when they announced via email that the they would be giving out bonuses during the Holidays only to discover that we (on-calls/per diem) were not included. It seems like every time they have an employee appreciation, we (the on-calls/per diem) are forgotten. We work just as hard if not harder than the regular employees. Hopefully it changes.I learned a lot and I enjoyed working in there.Nice people to work withExcellent teamwork Offers chemistry, hematology, microbiology and immunology analysis for dialysis patient demographic.I work for Ascend Clinical formerly known as Satellite Laboratories Services for almost 7 years. A typical day at work was to check all the emails to find out what what going on for the day. I learned a numerous amount about laboratory testing, and dialysis.I had great managers who were also great at at helping me advance in my career. We were a strong department and all the co-workers work together to get the priorities completed. The hardest part of my job is when we received over 800 tubes during busy week, and the labels were not labeled corrected.The most enjoyable part of the job was when we has Dialysis Week once a year. It was very festive, when had games, won many prizes, such as ipod's, computers, dishwhere, dvd, luggage. We were treated with much respect."
726,Assurant,"Sourced and purchased replacement products for people who purchased contracts on computers, monitors, printers, and other electronic equipment.I enjoyed working with my co-workers.A typical day is split between managing the day to day flow of the teams and problem solving new issues. We are in the process of implementing new formal processes in all areas. These require continual refinement. Each day presents learning opportunities in multiple ways. I strive to improve the effectiveness of my management technique with this new knowledge. My co-workers are hard working, dedicated professionals! The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the accomplishments achieved by the associates around me.I currently work in customer care for property loss and it's a nightmare. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work there. There is little room for moving up in the company. It's often hard to get help when you need it as well with a phone call. I know people that have been there 3-4 years and have never received a pay raise. I'm trying to catch the first thing smoking out of there. I don't know anyone on the customer care side that likes it. This company is also not for someone that has a family or small children. I'm currently on my 3rd schedule since I started there last April.A typical day was we would wait till the phone would ring and then would get them thru the process of filing a claim over the phone and to see if they qualify for a replacement device.   I learned on how the t-mobile exchange process works and u dont always get approved.  My co-workers were great people but they wanted to figure things out for your self.Hardest part of the bad was listing to the sad stories and not being able to helpAssurant Health was an inspiring, and fun place to work that gave GREAT benefits. I learned patience working for Assurant. The management and co-worker staff were a great group of people, always helpful and reliable. The hardest part of the job was knowing that it was closing. the most enjoyable part of the job were the Employee Events.When I started there the facility was owned by The Signal and it was an enjoyable place to work.  After The Signal was sold to Assurant the place changed.  Assurant has a good reputation for its various insurances businesses but does not seem to understand how a warehouse/manufacturing facility should operate.  Instead of advancing from within, the company started looking solely to outsiders to fill management ranks.Taking calls from insurance agents and customers in reference to homeowners policies, updating info., issuing payments on premiums. This position has made me very knowledgeable at the insurance industry and how lenders and insurance companies work together and the importance of insurance. I love a challenge ., the hardest part of my job was learning the insurance ""world""., the most enjoyable was definitely the people I worked with and assisting our customers and getting a bad situation turned around for the positive.So many negative changes have made the claims department  a toxic and disheartening place to work.  A few years back, it was a great place to work.  There was a sense of community and hard work was appreciated.  Since the arrival of new claims leadership, the department has suffered significantly, with a high turnover of good, experienced employees, replacing them with inexperienced,  entry-level ""yes men"".I've learned a lot in the past year and a half about Insurance, escrow, and mortgages. The hardest part about my job is not being active. I love helping others, so when I get a call from a homeowner and I'm able to help them it makes my day. The management team seems to work well together and try their best to help every when available. I've learned how to listen fully overall.The work atmosphere is very regimented. You take your breaks and lunch (30min) with everyone else at a set time. You have to remain quiet throughout the day, being social is not encouraged. However the latest pop hits are continually beamed from the loudspeakers, and although its not very loud, it is distracting to hear the same songs over and over again about once every hour. The training process consists of someone sitting over your shoulder watching you work ALL DAY, every day pointing out errors, which makes it harder to concentrate. This goes on for months. It's not at all a friendly environment, very strict with little to no interaction with coworkers. Most just stare at their screens with a scowl on their face most times anyway.Not a great place to work .Too much into performance driving and not about the customer. They also pay temps more verses direct hires. The 3 years I worked there I was assigned to three different clients. Very unstable work environment with high turnover ratio. The pay was also a factor. Who wants to work for a 1% pay raise?I help assist homeowners with their homeowners insurance, ensuring that they have sufficient coverage. I also aid in any questions they may have, also help with property loss when the customer has a loss with the home.I worked here 3 1/2 years, I was doing exceptional well, but it was so hard to get promoted or move around within the company. They are so difficult working with when it comes to requesting off. They are constantly increasing the work load every other month but wont increase your pay. The company is a joke to work for.On any given day you are constantly engaged with employees and customers. The company has done a good job of encouraging continued learning to diversify your skills while broadening your scope of work. Due to regulatory changes the Specialty Property division has undergone some shifts lately resulting in reductions in force. Senior leaders have really encouraged employees to understand a successful change model. There are some great individuals throughout the company.The hardest part of the job is to encourage peers, management, and direct reports during a visible shift and reduction in force. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping employees develop their skill set to better position them for future change.Great place to work in with a fast paced environment. Management is great. Co-workers are very friendly and the office has great ammenities. Hardest part of the job is the attrition causes work overload on the existing adjusters in order to get the job done. The most enjoyable part of this  job is being able to satisfy an insured that has suffered a loss by idemdifying them back to the condition they were prior to their loss. We are the insureds 911.This job was very easy for me to learn how to do and allowed me to eventually train others to do what I had learned. Although the work and job duties can sometimes become monotonous and repetitious, the ability to converse with nearby work colleagues makes it easier to more fun to get through the day.When I first started at this company I enjoyed it much more than when I left. I enjoyed having a stack of paperwork that needed done by the end of the day. When it was decided that another department would be merged with the one I worked in, there were too many people away from their desks not working than actually getting the work done.Assurant is a great company to work at. Focused on their employees and their development.Has an onsite day care and elementary school for employees kids only.Great Campus. Onsite Cafeteria is amazing.Normally people work there until retirement.I really enjoyed working at Assurant. My typical day was cosmetically and functionally testing new devices that were sent in.  I was really impressed with the open door policy that we had with our supervisor. The genuinely took our suggestions seriously and if it helped with the process they acknowledged the employee that helped implement the new procedure. The hardest part of the job was sitting for 10 hours. I really enjoyed the fact that we worked four ten hour days.- pour training - rushed at learning - pour slow systems - pour management Pour communication especially with new employees Expecting them to know everything in three weeks I was hired on through a company agency, received no feedback on my progress I was doing my best to learn System navigation was a mess but took my time to learn My agency called me late evening informing me that the company has to let me go, the company didn't have the guts to say that to my face I could not go back the next day to retrieve my personal belongings, company assured me it takes time to learn everything not to rush myself take my time ask questions which I did but I never got the opportunity to prove myself to the company with their lies of training time would be 4 to 6Weeks.Enjoyable workplace which provided a through knowledge of the individual health insurance industry. The company was huge on cross training, and the more you learned the more valuable you became to the company. This allowed the company to move you to other departments based on the business needs, which overall helped with your job security."

I learned patience working for Assurant. The management and co-worker staff were a great group of people, always helpful and reliable. The hardest part of the job was knowing that it was closing. the most enjoyable part of the job were the Employee Events.Loved the department activities, they allowed you to expand your network and learn about the company. Health insurance was expensive and not worth it since you have to meet all your deductibles first before it covered your claim.Loved working there, unfortunately company is closing for business.

I have learned a lot about mortgage insurance and why its needed.Ability to grow and challenge yourself.  Very family oriented and willing to work with you as needed.  Career advancement opportunity are numerous.  Co-workers are willing to assist when able.A typical day at work would be quite strenuous because of work overload, however, it is very easy to manage so as long as one is organized. I have learned numerous positions within this company of how to refurbish a electronic device, and this information is only attainable at a job experience such as this. Management, in my opinion, is poorly structured and should be more organized with each and every department of the facility. I do not believe in making acquaintances nor friends with my co-workers because I prefer a strict business setting, however, if confronted about a situation that pertains to the job itself I will address it properly. The hardest part of the job is most likely being underappreciated by knowledge. I feel, as an individual, that not only does this company respect my eagerness to become more of a beneficial employee, but also does not respect my well being. The most enjoyable part of the job though would be that I get to see new products on the market and refurbish them for many loyal and returning customers.A good place to work.  Unfortunately due to healthcare reform, we had to shut down.The remaining small group, has become a loyal close team.12 hour weekend joyed being busy, you could start at on position and by the end of your day be doing something else, management is excellent they tolerate no negativity nice place to work at.Assurant is a productive but a fun workplace filled with many employee engagement & activities.

711,Astellas Pharma,"Territory sales within a defined area which meant to go where the business was.  Learned effective time management and sales targeting. Management was mediocre and fleeting.

Good Company culture. A very good team.We all know that painful feeling waking up in the morning to get ready for a job that we don't like.  Going to work each morning for Astellas was not that way for me.  This is a wonderful company that provides exceptional compensation and benefits for their employees.  This company truly cares about their employees lives and well being.  The flexibility and vacation time provided is nothing less of exceptional.  I greatly enjoy working for this company.  Astellas has set the bar very high.Good place to start your working life out of college. The pay isnt the best but its solid for a good resume builder. Get in and get out. The staff and people who are in management are great.I learned much about the sales and marketing aspects of product promotion, as well as the technical aspects of the product.  The sales team that I worked with was exceptional.  I enjoyed getting out in the professional community and networking with others in my profession.Solid work place environment. Good opportunity. Supportive colleagues and well intention-ed management. Since my stay with Astellas was short, I had little to complain about.OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was bought by Astellas, so I worked mostly for OSI.  My co-workers were wonderful; very supportive, eager to teach and learn from each other, always striving to improve. In my time there, we had several directors, most of whom were knowledgeable, helpful and approachable. Being in cancer research, management made a real effort to show us how our work was impacting patients by holding talks given by Medical Affairs, Clinical and Marketing. We had great educational benefits; they reimbursed for classes you took related to your career path.Excellent company with great products. Top in industry for benefits and work life balance. Great teammates in all areas of the business. Ability to run your territory as you see fit to move the business.I was hired as Transplant rep and worked here for a year, the company was great , the pay and benefits were excellent. I left the company  as my position was not a good fit for me on a day to day basis based on calling on only 4 accountsI enjoyed my job doing various tasks.  My favoriate was Manageing Translations.  The customers were interestion to work with, I learned daily.I loved the job I was doing and looked forward to going to work. Enjoyed working with management, employees and suppliers.Astellas is a Japanese company. All employees try to be honest and work hard to release new medicines in the world to save as many people who need to be cured. Astellas has been trying to have diversities and they have now.I've worked in other corporate positions but none of them were the right fit for me and balancing all of the things I'm involved in outside of the office. Not only does Astellas offer great benefits, the flex scheduling and work location is essential for work-life balance for my entire team. The professional development opportunities are abundant and make me very excited about my future at Astellas and proud about the change my work does to further our mission and our ability to improve the lives of patients around the world.Great company who had some excellent products.  Worked with others and didn't have to be micro managed.  We had a steroid free product that dermatologsits wanted.Good products and good field sales leadership. Smart people who know what they're doing in the field. In the home office, there are many excellent people who have strong technical sales. There's an over reliance on consultants who bring in fresh ideas and milk millions of dollars off the bottom line. The best technicians rise to the top, as long as they're likable people. This results in poor leadership in the home office. But, nobody really cares about home office leadership because technicians are replaceable and the field sales folks continue to bring in the dollars.Run don't walk.  Hands down the worst management and pharma company in the industry.  Nightmare to work for and no I'm not being bitter or unfair.  It is very unhealthy work situation.It is a great company to work for. I enjoyed my time there. I had a great mentor to shepherd me through the organization. Management was very supportive and co-workers were willing to help when necessary.Astellas Pharma is a fast paced growing company, that offers an  atmosphere that promotes teamwork, and empowers employees to  thrive in their career.I was the maintenance manager for a two/three shift operation.  I would arrive at work before the third shift was over in order to talk with the maintenance techs to find out what had happened during their shift and know current equipment status.  I would then review the Work Order System to assign new work orders and verify status of urgent work orders.  Daily activity was determined by priorities, downed equipment repair was number one priority, then projects and then necessary meetings for production scheduling and other needs.  Since this was a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility we work under clean room conditions.  The nature of maintenance required the maintenance techs to use extra care and caution when performing normal procedures to the equipment.  In addition to maintaining the production and support equipment our team also performed the majority of calibrations for the site, this averaged to about 650 calibrations per month, we never missed making schedule. Upper management was very open to discussion but still demanding schedules were maintained.  Projects were scheduled during site shut downs unless it was a equipment modification that required immediate attention.My management team was primarily consisted of operations managers, I was the only maintenance manager.  We worked well together covering production and project work making equipment and resource schedules that made everyone's schedule as much as possible.The hardest part of the job was keeping the right combination of maintenance tech skill sets distributed to each shift during high work rate  more... schedules without hiring additional techs or working excessive overtime.  We went from a five day two shift production schedule to a twenty-four seven day schedule for approximately six months, this was a challenging time for everyone.I enjoyed seeing the monthly schedules completed early or at least on schedule especially when we had trying situations to overcome in addition to our normal work load.  I also enjoyed seeing a project come to completion weather it was outside contractors or our maintenance techs or a combination of both.  I also enjoyed observing maintenance techs learning new skills and growing their proficiency in all areas of their work assignments.  less"

Worked with others and didn't have to be micro managed.  We had a steroid free product that dermatologsits wanted.Good products and good field sales leadership. Smart people who know what they're doing in the field. In the home office, there are many excellent people who have strong technical sales. There's an over reliance on consultants who bring in fresh ideas and milk millions of dollars off the bottom line. The best technicians rise to the top, as long as they're likable people. This results in poor leadership in the home office. But, nobody really cares about home office leadership because technicians are replaceable and the field sales folks continue to bring in the dollars.Run don't walk.

788,"Astellas Pharma US, Inc.","Territory sales within a defined area which meant to go where the business was.  Learned effective time management and sales targeting. Management was mediocre and fleeting.  Co-workers for the most part were top notch.  Hardest part of my job was trying to make my territory comparable to the south and east coast.Nice place to work, Friendly people . more work ,good environment to work. and this is the one of the company that i love to work withI like working at Astellas,  The people and management are friendly.

367,Astrix Technology Group,"This company will not help you when you have an issue with management. My supervisor was horrible and lacked leadership skills. She was very friendly with HR which why I believed they did not help me when my supervisor was rude, mean and unprofessional!They don't like to give raises or help advance their employees. They do paint a very pretty picture when you apply and interview.Compensation is very poor with little to know increase pay.Management is not fair and can be disrespectful to their employee.Very routine job and preferential / unfair treatment is common in the workplace.I worked on a contract as an Astrix employee. The client was difficult to communicate with and it took time to even find out if I had the job - even though it turns out I was the only one interviewed.... Throughout the wait I was kept informed by the account manager and was in touch with her at least once a week during the 6 months I worked for them. She was terrific to work for and I hope to have an opportunity to work with her again."
88,Asurion,"This company offers lots of great supports to its remote agents. I enjoyed my team members and leaders. Supervisors and coaches were always available and willing to helpDaily routine varies based on the most current situation which could include system down time, weather or missing personnel. I learned several coaching techniques that provided excellent results.Management was reactive never proactive and is isolated from each other and staff.Co-workers are nervous, high attrition in the 12-14% monthly is expected. Employees making the 1 year mark or remaining after that point are becoming progressively rare. Training and recruitment are the most challenging, with the high attrition the requirement in a small town are taxing.Working with the associates and exceeding goals was extremely challenging and fulfilling.While working as an onboarding technician for Asurion, our typical work day was pre-planned with appointments for meeting new hires or existing agents. We would help install their work software or ensure their computers were meeting our current technical standards. I learned a lot of IT troubleshooting experience while there, and had a couple of amazing supervisors and teammates. The hardest part of the job was probably ensuring that our quality standards were met in a particular field where they were always changing. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to solve computer hardware/software related issues because a good puzzle is hard to beat.Asurion was a great work environment. My co workers and I worked as a team. Management is well rounded because they try to do everything they can to accommodate your needs. At Asurion, I was always on a set schedule from 2-11. I had Tuesdays and Wednesdays off. I was working full time. The benefits were great. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with rude customers over the phone. They would talk over you, curse you out, and really say harsh things to you. I just learn to tune them out and help them the best way I can. Working there was pretty stressful. I was in my own little cubicle, and  I didn't really have anybody to talk to. There really wasn't a way for me to socialize unless I met up with my coworkers on my off days. I love the fact that i had my own space, my own desk, my own computer, and everything. Unfortunately, I got to the point where I couldn't really take it anymore.  It wasn't enjoyable anymore.While Asurion states that it promotes from within, there's very little evidence of it.  Internal jobs may be posted, but they've already have someone in mind.  It's all about who you know and if you're in the 'click'.  You may be qualify, but you won't get the job unless you know someone.  Management just want to chain you to the telephone and expect more for less compensation.  It's merely a place to get a pay check while you diligently look for a better job.   Asurion will proudly claim to hire a lot of people in the area, but what they don't tell you is that they cannot keep good people, because they get burnt out, used and abused.Asurion is a great place to work and they are military friendly as well as diverse.  I picked up alot of management skills as well as my ASPECT training.    The hardest part about the job is adjusting to the ever changing world of technology and the way it impacts customers.  They have great benefits and will work with you to try and give that job/ life balance that you need to be successful at both.  Management is good, advancement in management becomes limited due to good leaders staying true to their position and wanting to improve upon their leadership/ management skills.When this place was NEW there was a great work culture  that was dedicated to taking care of the people that worked for the company. Since it has changed to Asurion it has been less about people and more about the bottom line. Has had so many policy changes its hard to maintain what needs to be followed and the tenure has been a revolving door.Atypical day at work is like talking to a million people, dealing with different attitudes and problems, and the environment around you is something you would have to get used to each day. I have learned at this job that certain things can make a person angry but its up to you to calm them down. Then once you calm them down the call flow will be easy. Management is really management type. They are really good people. They care for you as if it were them. Co-workers at this job can be some good associates and then you will find that person/people who will make you not wanna work there anymore. The hardest part of the job is dealing with people thru the phone and you can't help them enough over the phone and it makes you wish you were there to go ahead and fix the issue. The most enjoyable part of the day would be your lunch time and breaks. Also when you get that customer with so much respect and love that you could feel it thru the phone.Great place to work if all you want is salary and benefits. Terrible work life balance and no endorsement of advanced education. Overall I am glad for my time there as I earned my first Director title there. I still keep in touch with the people I worked with there although 99% of them have moved on as well.While historically known for its phone insurance and device protection, Asurion has turned into a tech-first company, with a focus on better customer experience and breaking grounds in the support and product fields. It was great knowing you are part of something that helps people every day, and having the freedom of a collaborative environment let me be creative and solve problems with fun, outside the box ideas. The folks are great, and you get to work with people from all disciplines and backgrounds and feel like your work has an impact on both the company, its clients, and the customers.Compensation is decent. Work life balance is terrible. There is no such thing as sick days and all bonuses are tied to the carriers ridiculous metrics. Instead of them grading us we get graded down if a customer would not recommend the carrier to a friend. Hmm, so because they have billing issues then thats our fault. The culture is ok, they try to make you believe its greater than what it is. Soon after getting out training those that have been there a while set you straight.   The turnover is so high, its basically a revolving door of employees. Your shifts change every few months. Basically if you don't rank high in the center you get what shifts no one else wanted. Management is unlike anything I have seen all based on favoritism and who chats up the higher ups the most. Tech leads have no idea how to provide support and the systems work when they want. I wanted to like it but at this point I am actively searching for another environment. It says something when only 25% of a training class sticks around and then of that within a month that gets cut in half. Honestly if you care about your work life balance and stress keep looking.You will find:-Many opportunities to earn incentives.-So-so management-Poor system infrastructure and support (things are always    freezing/crashing/or not allowing you to access them at all) be prepared to connect with the service desk, regularly.-Opportunities to raise your pay grade, quickly.-Inflexible scheduling-Fantastic benefits!The people I work with are incredible, and they make my work environment welcoming and responsive. The job has taught me valuable multitasking skills, as well as excellence and efficiency in customer service situations. My management team is effective and available for consultation on a consistent basis. The hardest part of my job are the short time frames in which to complete training exercises and simulations, but this has made me a more adaptable individual both in and outside of work. By far, the community at Asurion is my favorite part of the job.some managers are amazing some don't deserve the position. but you'll find that anywhere. if your a temp make every decision very carefully. if your full time you'll be fine unless you complain to HR about management then you'll be harassed until you quit.A great place to work that stands behind its philosophy of promoting from within. This was my first call center job and within six months of starting I was promoted to Supervisor. The opportunities are there for those who choose to take them. There are several in house benefits such as a fully loaded game room, snack bar, VIP lounges and weekly dress up days. The compensation is adequate and there are bonuses for performers.always job security, and great health benefits. Food for all the staff on weekends. Fun events like crazy hair da,y and jersey Thursday. Great incentives to get up to 600 extra on your paycheck just for doing your job correctly.This call center is like any other.  I have worked here for years and the culture has gone downhill.  You will encounter very unprofessional employees and the company is not transparent with what they say.   You get to work and count the minutes until you leave.  The monetary compensation and benefits are a joke.I enjoyed success at Asurion because I was willing to work hard and the company is great at acknowledging hard work and dedication.Asurion has been a great place to work overall. The pay and benefits are good. I work in Case Management. I started on front line Technical Support and advanced up to Case Management after 4 months of being on the job. I quickly moved up to Team Lead and was given a temporary supervisor position while another supervisor was out on medical leave. Some of my co-workers were great. I really liked the One Team effort of the majority. There is really no hard part to the position. I consistently made the top 10 of 180 Case Managers. The most enjoyable part is helping the customers resolve their issues. Management is decent. The worst part about the job is the Work at Home program for Directv is being cancelled by ATT.Like working for the company there always there when you need the help and they are always there when you need the help with the bad calls but overall good company to work for and the benefits are amazing.this company makes it pretty much impossible for you to have any type of work life balance. compensation is minimal for the area. i would never work there again."
629,ATCC,"Stability, low pay, not so great management and co-workers were not very cooperative either.  It was a good experience as a first time job.Be very careful before you sign up here. Lots of politics (particularly from HR and upper management) lead to high turnover. Lots of people unhappy with the place; with a smaller group of people who have been at ATCC since the beginning of time. These folks will never leave, but they're not interested in doing much work. The new people have high turnover because they're not as tied to the vacation benefits that increase over time.Pay scale is low and a 'bell curve' to give year end bonuses and raises makes for a ""zero sum gain"" culture- if you get a good review, it means it's not likely I could get a good review too, because the manager only has a few of them to give. This makes people unhappy; they feel like they have to wait until next year to get the higher bonus or good review. Or they look for another job. HR says ""like it or leave"" and many people have left. If you are interviewing ask about the turnover of the newer people- HR talks about how the ""average"" person stays X years. But they're averaging in those lifers who have been there 25 + years.They keep hiring more senior directors and senior VPs; they need people who get the work done. It's kind of a mess. This is a temporary stop for me, and for many others.I have worked 4 years at ATCC and since that time I've seen 3 company heads and 3 department heads. If you think that is bad, the turnover rate for lower level employees is worse. Management from senior to supervisor level are either incompetent or in a state of fear. Since I started, 2 lab supervisors out of the 4 in our department have been removed due to abusive behavior toward their charges. The lab equipment is horrible and older then my teenage son. There are no promotions, no advancement. The pay is on the extreme low end for Northern Va (the CEO's is an exception of course).  I've been in the Biotech business for over 20 years and this place is the worst place I've ever worked.ATCC is a good place to start your career, but it's very hard to advance.  They're willing to hire new grads and career changers, and you will get a solid foundation in laboratory work.  Upper management is almost continually churning and they prefer to hire middle management from outside the company. Morale seems to be low with many employees.ATCC provided all student employees with everything needed to complete their job. Including an outline on how to work while being a student. The most enjoyable part of work was hearing the praises given by all the teachers who were more than happy to strike up conversations even if you weren't their direct student.Before working at ATCC I was a Food Service Manager for fifteen years,  I suddenly became divorced and needed more of a work/life balance because of my two small boys so I left food service and started working for ATCC in a entry level position as an invoicing clerk.  This was my first real office job so I have learned a lot and also brought a lot of skills with me from the food service industry. My co-workers are great people very helpful.  The hardest part of the job is Tuesdays and days after a holiday because that is when the check volume is the highest.Bullied by long time e'ees. Micro-management. Mandatory OT at straight time pay.  My way or the highway co-workersManagement does not support its employees. Decent hours and low pay.my department IRR was not the best department to work for at ATCC  high turnover and inconsistant manangement"
715,Atkins North America,"All about the work. If you work yourself out of work you will not be paid for the extra time. The salary does not compare to other local companies.Lower levels, ok. UK management not interested or involved. Salary and benefits below industry standards. Shame it all went so wrongThis was my first job out of college. I enjoyed my coworkers a lot because we were all in the same age range. Unfortunately, there is almost no room for advancement in the company. Management is all over the place and don't know what they're doing. This job was just ok and the main plus for me were the great friends I made and the work/life balance.Treats employees like they are a contract shop but doesn't compensate appropriately.  It only takes a few weeks of a downturn for them to lay people off.  They are horrible at finding work. Everything needs to be approved by the management in the UK. If you are not from the UK, you cannot advance in this company. I will say the culture is great, and the people are nice, it's the structure and the upper level management that needs some work.Atkins is amazing company to work for. The environment there is a professional one and yet also is fun and fulfilling.My co-workers were always extremely helpful - providing training at any point that I may have needed it. This company is one to work for!!From the CEO to the seller-doers, Atkins prides itself on its global, diverse culture.  Flexible schedules are available to most and benefits are comparable with other firms in the industry.No job security, don't know if you will be laid off from day to day. No clear vision of new management. Decisions being made in a vacuum. Coworkers being laid off that are crucial to current projects. Severing business relationships that have been in place for 20 plus years.Do not come work hereTruly an awful place to be. Legacy PBS&J company was a wonderful employer until an incompetent CEO took over in 2005. Then a series of events rocked the company to its core: an embezzlement by the CFO and his direct reports, the indictment of two former company officers (minor, but still a PR problem), an FCPA investigation, the ousting of the company's chairman/CEO by employee shareholders, the sale of the company to a foreign owner. While the sale to Atkins was probably a good move, the subsequent replacement of a stablizing CEO with a cold, former military leader with a hierarchial organizational style was not. It's a culture of fear that now permeates down through the ranks of management. In a tough economy, employees are now hunkered down, hoping to hang on till retirement or waiting for other employement opportunities to come along. Insecurity prevails. Loyalty and hard work have nothing to do with whether you keep your job, rather it's who you're friends with. Innovation, once a hallmark of PBS&J, is a thing of the past. Good people have been leaving the company in droves -- either by their own choice or the choice of managers unclear about their direction. Sorry I waited so long to leave.I cannot speak to the current operations of Atkins North America after their acquisition of PBS&J. I was ""thanked"" for my 20+ years of service after the acquisition, and let go.I can say that as PBS&J, the Corporate leadership of this employee owned firm was very approachable, inclusive, and genuinely desired to perform the highest level of service for their clients. Retention of employees was high, and the pay scale was competitive.Great place to work with supportive management. The networking events on Wednesday and Thursdays are always great. That is all!!!!In a typical day at work I need to review every contract before an attorney. For the past three months I have been very involved in the implementation of a new electronic filing system for the company.The most enjoyable part of the job is my schedule. I work nine hours from M-T and 4 hours on Friday.An internationally owned company that came in and acquired a thriving business and proceeded to downsize and close multiple offices and service lines.I learned alot of skills while working and Atkins due to the awesome culture and tools available. Management was accessible and maintained an open-door policy. I loved working with so many talented people that offered kindness freely and respected each other.good employees good benefits managements was supportativeexcellent workplace, great management, hours, advancement opportunitiesA productive work place where professionals are always welcomed, have many opportunities to share their knowledge and experience and has an adequate amount of social exchanges.ATKINS is one of the world's leading design, engineering and project management consultancies.A typical work day consists of a variety of duties from writing agendas and inputting them into MUNI, putting together contracts and making sure all necessary legal documents have been executed, pay applications being entered into MIS, dealing with citizens and County staff as well as other contractors and sub-consultants. There are many critical dealines to be met, and to get items in to the Board of Directors in a timely manner and you have to stay focused and on task to get this done.It was a great learning experience in the 11 years that I worked since I was exposed to so many different clients with so many different needs and I was able to learn so much from the team that I worked with over the years. The most enjoyable was the variation and continuous challenges brought in by each project.Atkins allows employees to work flexible schedules and is pretty flexible with your time as long as you work your required hours.I had the unfortunate experience of working in the Atkins run traffic operations center in Raleigh NC. First and foremost, this job is always available for a reason. In their attempts to operate on a 24/7 basis - management often punishes one person to work third shift (10pm-6am) then come in at 2pm the same day and work second shift until 10pm that night. There is never any expectation for even a third of the center to work this ridiculous schedule, only one person gets punished this way from month to month. If you are asked to participate in their dispatch training, expect to be there 11 hours a day every Monday and Tuesday, wich consists of sitting in an insect infested room with one DOT rep, and the training coordinator who have you dispatch calls according to video replays, then talk trash to and about you throughout your employment about how you attempt to dispatch said calls. The coordinator who operates the training has less than two years of any sort of dispatch experience, and at best fakes it until he makes it, more time is spent talking trash often heard in high school locker rooms than doing anything job related. After less than two months expect to take an exam that determines your employment, again administered by the obviously drug dependant training coordinator. The largest part of the exam is to create a 45 mile detour listed on a map, and recreate 12 digital message signs about the extensive detour - something that may occur once every six months. While I was taking the exam, the training coordinator failed to give the first group the detour part of the test,  more... then to cover his failure, told coworkers that the people taking the test did not do that part of the exam - the fact that he never handed out that part of the test was never addressed. Also notice how the pay for this position went from $13/hr back to $14/hr financially Atkins traffic operations in NC is failing, so much so they had to cut hours in Greensboro to make payroll. Again this job is always open for a reason - wait tables before making the mistake of wasting your time for Atkins.  less"
81,Auction.com,"The staff level employees are great and I met a lot of wonderful people during the time I worked there. Middle-management needs a lot of work. People tend to get promoted based on who they know or how long they've been there and not based on if they can handle the job. There is a big disconnect between staff level employees and upper management due to middle-management not reporting actual problems that are going on to cover themselves. There is a lot of favoritism and nepotism. Room for advancement is virtually impossible some departments do not let you leave to work in another department. I think executive level management really needs to sit down and talk to staff level employees to find out what is really going on because they would be shocked. During the time I was there I didn't encounter many people that were actually happy working there most people felt stuck and were very unhappyGreat culture overall. Casual. Fun. Collaborative. Open communication. Intelligent. Forward Thinking. Innovative. Pushing the limits of engineering the in the online housing marketDo not work this company.  They do not provide benefits, sick days, vacation even working  40 hours a week.  They reduce hours without pay benefits .  It is very politic and race cards.  Hopefully they hire new management team.  Not do what they say in their business.  Lot of customer complaints.a typical day is spent at your desk calling a min of  50 a day. it is very very repetitive. very redundant! the management is a bit unorganized. the bonus guidelines at not clear. the work environment is relaxed. and the people are great.good, strong company model. People I work with are great. I like going to work and knowing I am helping the public get a little bit of happiness.Large scale company and it all depends on what your looking for.  Great part time/flexible schedule for Auction manager, coordinator and concierge type roles.  Difficult to advance/move up if you want to take it further.  Most of the best full time jobs are in California, texas and new york.Nice place, constant work, great coworkers, company was sold and is no longer an option for employment. Typical day was typically busy, very few surprisesLove this, great experience, great people. I like being able to learn new things. each time is a new learning experience.There is something new always happening within the company in a good way. New clients, new system updates, new processes.Good salary. Work life balance is average. Overall the company is a good company to work for within the Real Estate community.Contract writing lots of phone calls Customer servicegreat working environmenteveryone is friendlyvery good support team great trainingroom for advancementAuction.com is a great place to work.  Management is changing for the better and we are definitely on a trajectory.  Non-performers are weeded out quickly and the culture is great.  A well established company with a start-up vibe, and many perks.  Perks include free lunch, game room, and many learning opportunities.I loved working for Auction.com.  They were great to their employees and provided a great work/life balance.Highly recommendBeing hired with Auction is a short term employment not long term.  Upper management did not care about their employees nor the long hours they stayed to complete the daily reports and work load.I love working with people and helping them. I got to speak with people from all over the world.What I learned is that it cost me nothing to me kind and pleasant to people. A lot of times our clients do not do their home work so to speak. Which meant al lot of questions I would have to go over with them. But the best feeling is when they understood and were happy I took time with them.This Company does a poor job at growing talent from within. Lacks motivation for employees to excel up in the OrganizationThere is no room for advancement within the company. You would have to kiss a lot of butt cheek to move up. Management is horrible, company is a joke, all the executive want more money in there pocket and treated the little guy as dirt.Not recommended for referral. No additional information can be provided. Located in Irvine, CA. Experience may vary by department. Company remains in transition since recent merger.Advancement is difficult at best. Almost never any openings. Bonuses are not based on your individual efforts for the most part. However, the atmosphere is great, co-workers always help one another. The work is always fast-paced, but almost never unbearable.Great Pay.Management is very poor. Company does not care for anyone. Hours very Flexible.I work as a Contract Writer at the monthly Auctions in Georgia. I've been with the company for about a year, but have only done a handful of auctions. The people are amazing, very friendly and helpful. Everyone really works as a team and carries their own weight! You also start to grow attached to the county that you work in because you begin to learn and become friendly with the people who attend the auctions (most of the properties are bought by companies that attend every month).The work is simple, but you do need to have an eye for detail. You are dealing with property transactions! Plenty of money that you will be handling. They hold training classes EVERY month the Saturday before the auction because it is crucial that no mistakes are made.They have started using an iPad app to do the contracts. While I love them when it works there are still quite a few things that can make using them a pain (if it goes to sleep in the middle of the contract it can delete all the info you've entered). As for the customers, like I said, they come every month. Some of them can be short with you and seem cold, but most of them are very friendly. I have a sneaking suspicion that some of them just come for social hour, lol! But they know what they are doing and don't play games about it, so make sure you listen well in training.However, as a bad note when I first started I did one auction. Then was placed on standby for almost 6 months. I guess they over-hired when I was hired, but then after people started leaving I was able to work more. Now I'm an essential part of my county's  more... team and doubt I will be placed on standby again. So be prepared for that possibility.Another bad note, when I started the pay was $25/hour. Then it was moved to $20/hour with no notice except when my paycheck felt lighter. Pretty unprofessional.  less"

I loved my time there.  They treat there employees so well.  I was rookie of the year my first year in sales and was the only one of my team that was over quota.  Love Autodesk.Working remotely for Autodesk allowed me to work from my own home and study, which was a newer experience, but one I end up thoroughly enjoying. The day would start off with a general meeting over Skype or Google Hangout, to discuss what we had accomplished the previous day, and what to work on in the upcoming hours. After about halfway through the day, we would have another meeting about our progress so far, and if there were any issues along the way.I got to experience working with a small-knit group of 5, and being the only artist in the team, I was helping to direct the creative direction, and alert the team to any artistic aversions to the software. We worked with a soon-to-be released version of Autodesk Stingray, to prepare it for public use. I was also working heavily with virtual reality (VR) for the first time in a while, and it helped me get a better understanding of the development technology. The best part of this job was the ease of access I had at any given time. I did not have to leave anything at the office because my study became my office for Autodesk, which let me have everything at arm's length if I needed it.There were some technical issues with data transferring software as well as the newer implementation of VR with the pre-existing technology, but these were eventually remedied.Fun place to work great team and lots to learn. There is constant change to keep it exciting. Great Product that is needed in the market.Worked there for several years.  Back in the mid-1980's there were some fun, fun times.... but with the increase in need for more corporate structure, those days are sadly a memory... though fond memories :)Autodesk has a great product and employees can be proud to work for a company with such a good reputation.  The people are terrific and the space in SF is pretty awesome.  However, management is very uneven and not everyone is on the same page.  There are a lot of mixed messages.  Beware of younger managers and those who have been with the company less than 2 years. They are eager, ambitious, and have little-to-no training on how to manage people.  Loyalty and tenure are not valued at Autodesk, and the company does a major reduction in force about every 3-4 years, focusing on releasing employees who have been with the company more than 10 years."

A person beginning their career could really learn a lot here.  But executive management is erratic, with no centralized product management or strategy.  Too many products, some of which overlap each other.  Lots of territorial conflicts due to lack of leadership.After 18 years, it is sad to be part of the 10% reduction in force at Autodesk.  It has been the most challenging, exciting, and rewarding place I have ever worked.  The corporate culture is good, and the people are fantastic.  It's an innovative company with lots of creativity.  I've learned so much and I am ready to take my experience and knowledge to another great company.Pros: Benefits, Salary, Location, Facilities, Resources, decent/fairly interesting products, free lunch 2 days per week, work from home on Friday.Cons: New employees will struggle to be effective at times due to the large amount of ""backstory"" knowledge resident in the heads of existing employees. This is a very political place, Management is ineffective at driving initiatives to success. The company appears to be struggling with reconciling its culture from when it was smaller with the changes required to be efficient as a larger company. Its not uncommon to have conference calls at night during the week to collaborate with other ADSK offices in other timezones.Great company, solid business model, but has too many changes with management & uncertainty in the upcoming times.Big potential if you survive through the changes."
60,AVA,"I'm a hard worker and very flexible. I would like to use my current skills to work in an organization where i can enjoy my job and to move up is possibleGreat company  I'm still employed ,great bonus .Very easy going laid back office, Very concerned with their clients,its more than just the money .good company to work for.My typical work day was to cash out all customers and maintain a clean store.  When it got closer to closing hours I would check my gas levels and document them, clean the store, stock the cooler and do all paper work for my shift then lock up and go home.  The most enjoyable time was the interactions with my customers and I would have to say the hardest part would be cleaning up the entire store before I closed.  My boss and co-workers were easy to get along with and easy to make arrangements with for work schedules if needed.The work was strenuous, being that it is a start up entrepreneurship.Often worked 12-16hrs days, but it was well worth it. The entire company made you feel like you were an integral part of the whole teamTypical work days are from 4am t0 3pm or 2pm to 11 pm. Management doesn't know how to communicate well.Good place to work but Bad Management, Company went Bankrupt. Co-Workers were great"

483,"Avon Products, Inc.","I would keep this up as a side job, however I'm looking to gain more work experience. Avon is a great company to work for, they offer plenty of support on, ways to generate customers, while showing you how to mantain your customer base. They have several events around the US, that allows networking and good fun.The sucess of your business with Avon relies on you, your sales will be slow at times,but if you stick with it great things will happen for you.Working at Avon has been a great experience. It mostly involves sales by catalog so I was able to start out at a young age helping my  mom with her sales. Now I'm able to sale as a independent representative and the products basically sell themselves. All it takes is showing the catalogs to people and promoting the right products based on their likes and personalities.It is a very good job if you have motivation and determination to be your own boss. It takes a lot of time and effort. The advancement benefits are good and they constantly have new incentives for their employees.They move you around a lot. They change there mind one minute from the next as to what or how you were doing something. They expect some people to give 200 percent while they give people help that don't even try. Poor pay and every year benefits decreased.I enjoyed working for this big incorporation. i had my own time's to work. I enjoyed selling and but most of all show my previous customer's the new things they had new to buy.Great company and amazing benefits!  I can work on my time around my schedule and the relationships formed while meeting new people are ones that last a lifetime!ex time, family oriented, match 401k, must take vacation, remote work/work from home, equipment and hardware upgraded frequently, free lectures and education, access to gym, awesome health care, easy quick expense reimbursement, birthday offA typical day is unknown.  It could be 6 hours or it could be 12, depending on orders and staffing.  I learned and grew a lot in my position and gained useful experience.  Some management seem to have their own agenda and once you fall from their graces you are pretty much out the door. It's a different culture and if you have problems adjusting to the culture you won't do well.   Loved my co-workers and I enjoyed the company benefits.a typical day at work for me would be to go in have our morning meeting and get put in what ever area that needs help for the day im usually on the shipping dock but can preform well in every part of the building i have learned alot about avon from where the order begins to where it ends and everything in between management at avon is awesome their all understanding and treat you like family not a worker my co workers for the most part are good to work with but every company has the lazy ones but most of them work hard and the new ones always approach me for ideas on things because most of the guys are set in there ways and bull headed but we all get along great the most enjoyable part of the day is when we get a yellow light for a line thats backed up cuz every one goes nuts over it and acts crazy and yells about it but when you go in the trailer most times it takes 15 minutes to clear so they get all worked up for nothingI loved working for Avon, but honestly not too many people are interested in Avon as they use to be. Products are Amazing and good quality. I would only recommend working for Avon if you're looking to make a little extra money not a huge amount of money.The job was fine but you had to have  alot of coustomers to make a profit or  you didn't really get a salaryI was a sales representative for Avon. I sold it for 7 years. I learned how to manage my own business. I managed my advertising, customers, and the inventory that they bought. I didn't have to deal with co-workers, I just had to make sure I submitted my orders each week. The hardest part of selling Avon was when I quit selling it I didn't get to see my customers anymore. The most enjoyable part was being able to see my customers and help them get the products that they ordered.Worked at Avon over 18 years.  It was a great family environment, fast-paced.  Great management team.  Co-workers were always helpful and willing to do what it takes to get the job done.  Most difficult part of the job was trying to figure out why so many layoffs, then re-hiring of people for the same positions a few months later.Avon Products has a great job culture and work life balance, however, the compensation and benefits are really low and job security is questionable.Being an Avon sales representative was great position to have. It allowed me to become my own boss for my first time. Support from my family has made my life a lot easier to cope with when order taking became too tough to handle.Great people to work with, gave tips on how to approach people making sales door to door and easy to follow tips on hosting successful book shows.Receiving calls, booking shows, making sales through social media or phone calls. Patience, understanding, and compromise. Management was supportive and connected with co-workers frequently to track progress. Mainly self involvement on making sales.Hardest part was going door to door passing out catalogs and booking shows. Be your own boss, set your own hours.-High exposure to top management;-Good environment to work;-ownership and accountability of your responsibilities;-Challenges;My day would begin at 7:00 am with meetings and travel to the district. Then I would begin meeting with representatives. Training on sales, recruiting, leadership, new rep meetings, sales meetings. Selling the benefit of  becoming a representative and helping them build a profitable business for themselves. The hardest part of the job is getting the representatives to be involved and working with you so that you can help them be successful. They are independent so they earn their own paycheck not paid by the company. Keeping new representatives engaged so they can see the benefit of owning their own business. The most enjoyable part was watching those that succeeded and knowing that I was able to teach them something to help with that success.A typical day at work would be collecting inventory and organizing spaces for products. Some days I was able to help with transactions and sale a few products to people.    I was able to learn how to collect inventory and properly keep organization.   The management was very nice. She was easy and a joy to work with.    I had no co-workers for the job.    The hardest part of this job was to make sales, because there was not much of clientele.     the most enjoyable part of my job was keeping things organized. I am a very organized person already and it is sometimes very relaxing.it was a really good place to work  the benefits were outstanding  and the job pay was really outstanding  you would go in every morning and you would know what you had to do that day  in contracts you printed out the contracts that avon representatives had filled out  and scanned and deal with any problems in a timely manner.  All the ontracts received overnight had been completed by noon that day.  The management was very good, they were supportive  and gave you supervision if you needed it.  All of the co-workers were very professional.  To me there was no hard part of the job  except when the system would go down  and you would have to wait for the system to come up.  I enjoyed working with the representatives."
495,Bachrach,"Great Clothing at great prices, Custom Suit program from 2008 to 2009 was amazing. Great shoe selection.Employ of mixture of some experienced Sales team to brand new kids.Too much pressure to follow corporate sales pitches which vs Very experienced qualified Sales techniques.Unlike most corporate recruiting agencies, The Bachrach Group is about growing and succeeding as a family.  Everyone comes in with a great opportunity to make money for themselves without being micro-managed in regards to call numbers and metrics.  The upper management will go to bat for any and all employees and they are truly a great company to work for in this field. If you do well you will be rewarded and promoted as the company continues to expand on their nationwide reach. I would recommend TBG 10 out of 10 times to anyone interested in a staffing and recruiting career.This is more of a calm cool and collected work environment. Meeting monthly goals or even weekly goals can be a struggle but when you work with a team who loves to help one another grow and sell, not only does it make work easier but a lot more enjoyable.I worked at BachRach over the summer and it is by far one of my favorite jobs I've ever had. The management was friendly and easy to get along with, and they were extremely flexible when it came to the hours. They train you fluently and prepare you to work with customers, they patiently work with you in any areas you may need help in, and although the job is designed to be competitive, they do not, in any way treat the job like a competition. The hardest part of the job is developing your own technique of making sales, because making sales is an important part of the job. The most enjoyable part is establishing your own list of regular customers.Bachrach was a steeping stone to having good customer service skills. I learned how to treat customers with the right balance of attention and direction. Management was a great plus. I worked with employees who had been there since I was born. Their experience and wit taught me a lot. Co-workers were easy to get along with because we helped each other out. The hardest part of the job was also the most enjoyable part of the job. That was maintaining a client database. Working at improving my skills and following up with clients gave me the experience to run my own business (music producing).Everyone was so nice and lovable. Very helpful and reliable . When i needed help they was there .A typical day included sales, client tracking, visuals, and to oversee tailor shop.met people from all over the world, tour guide was a fun job .. The experience took me afar..A typical day at work in Bachrach included organizing the store to make sure merchandise was neatly displayed, helping customers find what they were looking for, offer customer suggestions, process customer transactions and returns and providing excellent customer service.  The manager kept the store environment very relaxed and let the staff know the importance of making the customer feel welcomed and respected.  This was my first job in retail and I definitely learned how to speak to customers in a personable, effective way and how to sell merchandise.  The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the satisfied face of a customer after dealing with them and knowing that I did my job well.Good work place but poor management and job security. Company not sure of proper direction and attempts at success.My experience was that the store was very slow and on commission its hard to make a good living. The draw was almost never met. The products sold were of good quality and the co workers made it fun at times. The management was not very good at keeping control of the store and driving business. The fun part was customer interaction and being in the mall. The cons are low pay and benefits, long hours at times, not much flexibility with having to work holidays.There was really a lack of leadership. The store manager that hired me quit a week later. There was no structure. People in cluding managers would leave the store for an extended period of time. There was no sense of job security. Even if 2 people would come in the store for an entire 8 hour shift you were still responsible for selling. I felt like the volume that was done in the store I was in did not merit such a high quota. There was not a fair structure to evenly distribure sales. It was every man for himself, which led to infighting. I loved servicing the customers. That was my favorite part. For me however, Bachrach was not a good fit.Nice place to work when retail quotas are met. Reason that I stopped working there is because of store closing prospect.Upscale mens clothinjg store with quality clothing. Small staff, located in a good mall."
270,BAE Systems,"BAE continues to be out of touch. Instead of being cutting-edge the motto seems to be just ""cut"". Management constantly changes incorporating their own vision without regard to the impact of employees. The job market is difficult, but this company's mentality has declined dramatically over the years. Do not expect a long-term career unless you are upper management. The most enjoyable part of the job are the co-workers. Great team-spirit and a willingness to work hard and do their part. However, this is sometimes strained because of constant layoffs and fear of job security.The company has a great legacy and terrific potential, but management needs acknowledge several of the elephants in the room and work with all the employees to address them.Long dirty hours in harsh enviroment. There was nothing enjoyable about this job. Would not recemmend for long term employment.It is an excellent company to work for. They have great benefits and the company is very large and they can place you on another contract, if the one yo are on expires in most cases.Experienced a hostile work environment with my co-worker, who felt I had ""oversold"" my skills and experience and was therefore not worth the air I was breathing in our small office. Management felt otherwise. Funny, that co-worker no longer works for BAE... karma strikes again.Great job for people who love working in an industrial environment. 8-12 hour workdays.   Multiple shifts can work basically from a typical work day to weekends only.  Beautiful new building, nice healthy lunch room.   Company has an employee fitness center.  offers overtime and its not mandatorywell it was soso when there was work i was great but when there wasnt it was pretty hard the days were average i was able to learn a little co-workers were oddIts allowed me to get rehired a couple times so I really don't have bad things to say. it was a good environment. about the only issue I had and did not agree with was on the 11/08/16 we had a meeting between HR and my head of dept. and we agreed that I was going to be allowed to return to on 11/09/16 wich I deed and at 12:30 I was called to the office and got terminated for missing days after I was told to take time for the passing of my mom who had dementia so I was somewhat disappointed for going back on what was said on the meeting other than that its a great place to workBAE is extremely fast paced with requirements changing daily.  Employees are willing to adapt and think quickly in order to reach the end objectives through the difficult periods.A typical day is great something different everyday. Work is not to hard but very satisfying knowing that you are detrimental to the whole weapon system process of ship building.I worked at the Land & Armaments group in Santa Clara, CA for 6 years.  Unfortunately, the location was closed and the capability moved to Michigan.  But while I was there it was a great place to work.  Healthy work environment - no good-ol-boy network, nepotism or discrimination - a truly enlightened management who treated people fairly and with genuine respect.  Good work/life balance, ethical business practices and friendly and supportive peers.I enjoyed working here. I performed automotive assembly work which was great. We often worked ten to twelve hour days so we made a lot of money from overtime.BAE systems was a good work environment. It was pretty organized already, so all you had to do was keep everything in order.I admit that it could be a bit tiring, but once you have the routine down, it got easier.aboeing is fun you just work a ton of hours if your a contractorthey say that there is no prejudice towards contractors or Direct hires but that is false....they will treat you like dirtA great company that values their employees. I would typically work on different projects mainly assisting other employees who need certain files from the repository. I enjoyed being able to complete the tasks assigned to me and helping other employees by keeping the entire repository database organized and accessible by anyone with access.all of us works helping each outher with no one getting hurt to get the jobs done faster and right the fist time if you get the job done right the fist time it well get to the job on timelove working for BAE, the people are great and the management is always available to help. The only downfall is that its contract work. never know when your last day .Software coding on a long term project for the Court system Good Management Had Great Benefits Learned a lot of Computer Technology from UNIX to Windows and Networking protocolsBAE Systems is big. I wish they had more ground maintenance programs like the one they had in Hawaii.  Repairing and servicing government vehicles meant work was almost guaranteed. co workers who looked forward to work (for the most part) made it a fun place to be.I had worked at BAE for many years and the experience was great. They are a Government Contractor and as the contracts end there are Lay Offs as I was caught up in.BAE Systems is an outstanding company that annually requires Ethics training.  There is a tremendous amount of online training available and multiple contract opportunities."
400,Balchem Corporation,"Typical day is responding to emails, entering orders, interacting with warehouses, logistics and accounting. Phone calls, on occasion. Laid back atmosphere, everyone is helpful, including management! People have your back here. Days fly by because there is a lot of work to complete, but you are valued as more than just a number, so it's worth it :)Staff is willing to let young engineers grow and make some mistakes while learning on the job. Very good maintenance and production staff with experience to help offset early bumps in the road.Excellent company to work for however with 16 locations across the US, we tend to run ""management-light.""  There are times when we as Plant Managers and Engineers get pulled away from in-house issues to aid sister facilities.Management is horrible. There is no progression for anyone going into maintenance. Management refuses to give you any raises no many how times you ask, until you decide to leave. Then they pay you nearly only half of what they pay operations. Different pay scales throughout the plant. Favoritism is definitely showed.Great place to work, great people. and overall is a healthy environment. Balchem is a place where they offer many advancement opportunities as well as great benefits.Balchem is a great place to work.  Friendly people, and competent leadership.  The company is definitely going places.  The work is challenging and interesting.material handler, blender, forklift operator,inventory, shipping and receivingMy daily work experience was always very busy and productive. The day always began with a review of the previous shift in QC. This involved a review of the testing of all production of all batches produced and retesting of all out of spec material. This was done internally in my department. This was typically followed by a meeting with production to discuss their production schedule and what will be needed from the qc department. After this meeting, I checked Al of the in use reagents to insure an adequate supply for the up coming production schedule. This was followed by re-calibration of our instruments to insure proper working order. The day began and during the day, I was directly involved with the testing of all incoming raw materials and any optional work that needed to be done for QC management. Management was always very supportive and the individuals I interfaced with from production, other QC technicians and the R &D staff was exceptional, a true team effort. The hardest part of the position was the analysis of out of specification material. You needed to confirm the results and then quarantine the material. The best part of life in our QC department, was the atmosphere, interaction with fellow employees and management."
729,Bank of America Corporation,"A good place to work if you like to work in financial. a typical banking workforce. they provide good benefits that works for youBank of America Relationship Managers are always on the go. It is a fast paced job that demands a lot from you. If you are looking for a career at a Banking Center that is rewarding and thrilling, than the RM role is for you.This bank was a great place to work at. Met a lot of great people here and definitely learned a lot. Also a lot of pressure to open accounts and achieve goals, your job depends on it. But other than that lots of room to grow  and you advance quickly. Great pay and great benefits.My typical day at Bank of America was always eventful. I would always deepen relationships with clients by providing them with accurate information regarding their financial situations.Bank of America is an excellent corporation to work for.  They value their employees ""Employee recognition day"" every year.  The managers incorporate the banks core values in their everyday routines.  Management is very good at communication and the managers and employees support each other.  Each day we worked hard and had fun at the same time.  I enjoyed working with my associates by supporting them and driving them to excellence.   In  my personal opinion every job has its challenges but once you excel through them it gives you such a great job satisfaction.work was great, fast pace, time went by so fast.i learn to process checks for the Bank.Management help as much as they could.Co-workers was fun to work with, some wasn't. But I was there to do a job.The Hardest about the job..There was a limit to how many checks to do in one night. I wasn't that fast.The most enjoyable part about the job was, I was working.I loved working as a teller for this company. Very positive. Definitely recommend anyone who love working with people to apply. My management team was amazingTeam spirit, drive sales and revenue. requires multi tasking and focusing on clients. Relationship management requires direct contact with clients and sales partners to assure that we are meeting the needs of the customer.As a BofA RM you are basically a glorified cust serv rep.  All the bank  cares about is opening checking accounts for as many cust as possible and sell as many CC as possible. Now Ive heard that every branch is different (which should not be the case) but the branch I worked at had very poor management that seemed to just be learning everything as the days go by and the bank as a whole seemed to embrace this philosophy. Inefficient systems that made it impossible to do anything in a timely manner were an everyday nuisance and everyday that I came into work it seemed that there was some new policy or new way of doing things. A typical day of work includes seeing anywhere from 10-12 customers of which the majority have some issues or complaint, resolving that issue and then find some type of product to sell to them. I did not get along with my coworkers in this branch for the most part (I had 10 different in 5 months)  About the only positive thing I can say about working here where the hours. Bank generally closes as 4pmThis company will work you and under pay you. And the more you give the more they demand. On the other hand it really teaches you many thingsI learned many things while working there. I learned how to multitask in a busy, fast paced environment while handling a lot of cash. Learned how to converse with customers and listen when needed too. Learned how to handle customer complaints and direct them to the manger if I couldn't answer it. Overall working at Bank of America taught me many things and my manger made it more enjoyable. She can be a reference if needed as well.I have made some great connections within the firm because I'm a part of an employee network and I enjoy the connectivityA typical day at work starts with a daily staff meeting where we are all caught up on company news, daily accounts, and our daily SLA's that have to be met for the day. A wake meeting so to speak.During the day i process and personalize on average around 7,500 accounts. I am constantly multitasking and trouble shooting utilizing Data Card and Syntera software and hardware systems, until my company and personal goals are met for the day.I learned that I can do anything that i set my mind to. I am a quick learner. i learned to rely on my teamates and to help the team because we all have common goals and valuesthe hardest part of the job is the production aspect.the most enjoyable part of is the relationships that i have built and cultivate on a day to day basis.You were to come in, do your assigned tasks and go home. The management didn't go out of their way to be extra helpful however my coworkers were great!This is a fast pace environment and always have to adapt to changes and updates in processes and procedures as well as management as there are several updates every month.I would not recommend anyone working here. It's very cut throat and there is very little support from management. Everyone is out for themselves.Nothing but stress, high pressure sales, harassing customers to get them to buy more debt that they don't need. You are instructed to be relentless, push and use high pressure sales tactics to bully customers into loans, credit cards or any other det=bt we can get them into. My blood pressure went to the roof, you have to call customers, peruse their spending habits on their bank accounts so you know what products to cram down their throats. If you enjoy doing all that, this is the job for you. If you have a conscious you will never be able to sleep at night doing the things the demand you do to reach extremely unrealistic sales goals.This company has great job security and multiple opportunities for advancement. The job culture makes you feel like more than an employee but an advocate for change.While working for bank of America Edd I was always being rushed by my supervisor and I did not appreciate it very much the were gonna fire me because I was not quick enough on the typingFast pace work place but worked with very nice people. Day went by so fast when working with great group of people. Worked on different projects with different colleges at very high level.A typical day at work was when me and my team were given a task that is normally done in two weeks to be executed in three days due to clients request.This made me learned a lot like being more proactive,work under pressure as a team,stay focused so as not lost concentration and also communication skills. I make sure at every stage of the job,i keep management aware about the progress.Actually, i have a very wonderful team of co-workers whom we always work as a team and make sure we uplift the name of the company.working alone is not a problem but its more enjoyable working as a team because we put our individual talents  together.To me,the hardest part of the job or task was to meet up with the due-date in order to ensure at all times customer satisfaction.The most enjoyable part of the job was when we submitted the job respecting the three days."
446,Barclays Bank,"Great place for career minded people, room for mobility and advancement.  Great team atmosphere and partnership across functions and businessesGood Place To Work.... good balance of work life..good mobility. management is ok but the culture is not great. Co-workers are ok, but the culture itself is very cut-throaty and backstabbish. I would not recoommend to any friends or family.When I interviewed for the job I was guaranteed advancement opportunities.  After being on the job 2 weeks,  I was told that no growth in jobs are coming to Henderson.  Leads and Heads talks down to employees.  A lot of contradiction and favoritism.A typical day involved dealing with requests and technical questions from clients and other internal departments. The fast paced nature of the job was thoroughly enjoyable, and I found that staff members always aided each other if additional assistance was required. Management were keen to train staff up on as many skills as possible, and provided intensive training every few months. This enabled us to grow in our knowledge, which in turn allowed for promotions.Solid learning environment in a fast-paced, dynamic culture. Opportunity for growth if supported by management. Benefits are top of the industry.my day starts around 7:30 and the first part is reconciling our overnight exceptions.  The fed opens at 8:30 and our day to day activity start immediately.  Volume is high, so we are busy throughout the day.As a manager I learn how to deal with many different personalities and how to motivate my team members. the hardest part of the job is ensuring Client assets are protected at all times. I enjoy resolving challenging issues. Management was good, but their plans were not always thought out for the long term correctly.  When long term goals were set, they seem to start the process without a detail planExcellent teams. Mornings were usually meetings with London and Singapore teams. Afternoon and early evenings were development time. Working on the trading floor afforded me many interactions with different traders, risk managers, financial controls. Learned Java, perfected C++ and a lot of credit derivative knowledge. The hardest part of the job was managing global teams, many late night calls. The most enjoyable part of the job were that the traders gave me the time to interact and communicate. I saved the firm $1.6 million over a couple of coffee machine stops.I WAS AWARDED AS BEST PROJECT MANAGER FOR THE    YEAR UNDER REVIEW ;Leading the collections team to achieve 90 to 97% collections rate (a first time achievement of BACLAYS BANK (Ghana) Plc.I introduced the cheque form of collections at the branch which gives the company 70% collections.Bringing on board and championing the mobile money wallet for cash collections which has aided collections from the beginning of the year to date.I also initiated the bulk cheques collections on behalf of the bank (company management)Very bad experience while working at Barclays Too many politics. Management is really terrible only promoted their friends hire their relatives. I'm sorry to say this but Barclays was considered a good company to work forgreat place to work Aside from the job scope itself, one factor that significantly influences how employees feel about work is the environment. By work environment, I mean everything that forms part of employees’ involvement with the work itself, such as the relationship with co-workers and supervisors, organizational culture, room for personal development, etc.A positive work environment makes employees feel good about coming to work, and this provides the motivation to sustain them throughout the day.You are required to get to work 10 minutes early to sign on before your (paid) start time which equates to about 50 unpaid hours per year.  How they continue to abuse this is beyond me.  If you are late you get written up and so forth until you are boxed up and herded out the front door. It is a one-way relationship, not your way.  Pay is based on great-recession job surveys so they pay as little as possible and a full classification below the sister site in Delaware.  It is an obstacle course to get a raise or a promotion, with rules and requirements changed at will.  The monthly meetings where the promotions are announced are just a sad display of how the game is rigged.  Managers hold all the power and play favorites, have snitches mingle into break time and off-the-record conversations to report back on what and who.  Quality Call scores are one of the determining factors as to if you earn a bonus (yes-they have bonuses) this score is rigged by what calls they grade. The fact is that calls are 'selected' so as to produce the desired result.  they do have benefits which you pay for but it beats Obamacare.  Everyone is treated the same, however poorly I may think that to be.  in spite of the poor morale, most of us enjoy working with each other, so misery does love company.  For those 20 -23 this is a first job you will not soon forget, especially after you have worked for a real people's company later in your career.Good company overall. Decent compensation, but could be better. Good place for early career individuals. Would not recommend staying too long unless there are opportunities for growth.When I left Credit Suisse to join Barclays in 2007, it was a unique opportunity to be integral to the buildout of Barclays' West Coast leveraged finance business.  My former boss at Credit Suisse and I recruited a talented team of junior bankers to join in building out an entrepreneurial platform within the context of a major global financial institution.Barclays was my first professional job at his school, as far as development is concerned. To be frank they are going to be a tough act to follow. My peers and managers treated us all the same and every problem that we came a crossed we solved as a group. As far as the work environment, it wasn't fantastic. There were numerous recreational areas and there was also a full cafeteria so people could eat without having to leave the office. I was very sad to leave at office, and to hear of them shutting the site down. Very much looking forward to new opportunities, especially considering that I am much more experienced now and I feel like I can contribute tons more at my new team.typical day at work is often communication heavy, high paced with a lot of people.I often learn from veterans of the work place management is kind, understanding and gives work initiativesmost my co- workers are nice with your occasional grumpy people hardest part of the job would have to be managing your breaks, and warding off people who do not belong in certain placesmost enjoyable part of the job is seeing people smile and enjoying their time spent.Highly productive environment with hard working and dedicated employees. There is opportunity for growth and movement within the organization. Net working and shadowing with colleagues enables you to apply for internal position with mobility tool.Wonderful place to workGreat work environmentEncourages professional learning Cutting edge in their job spaceColleagues and management are enjoyable to work withMy area is Build /release/deployment engineering, and configuration management. I have a broad understanding of software development methodologies; with a focus on industry standards based process design, and automation. I have extensive experience interfacing with development, test, and operations teams with the common goal of producing high quality software in a timely fashion.Good for work life balance. No career growth. False promises  by management. Too many organizational changes in short period of time.Good place to grow in the financial world and learn different skills that can be leveraged in other companies.Job culture is very strong and supported by sr. management.U.S. Delta One Sales - Managing Director (Former Employee), New York, NY – September 8, 2016Citi was very large, well funded firm.

793,BASF,"Dealt with a high volume of inbound calls from clients across the country.  Managed orders, advertising, and collateral for six regional sales managers.Working for BASF there were long work days, old out dated equipment, too many work hazards to name. Most of my co workers were a joy to work with despite the working conditions. Restrooms in my work area were always inoperable. Management expect other work tasks to be performed without training or compensation. There is a two tier employee pay grade....older workers earn $20+ an hour while new hires earn $12+ an hour.Instrumentation and Electrical Tech.  Maintaining all instruments,  wiring,  etc.  Troubleshoot, more troubleshoot,  and fixing of same.  The job is constantly mind challenging in a good way.  Always something new going on.  We are well respected and appreciated. The entire plant treats each other well. Mgmt well responsive to care of family.  BASF offers EXCELLENT benefits at an OUTSTANDING cost.  Mgmt is responsive to our needs in doing our work. BUT,  you MUST be willing to work when you come to work and when a company treats you right and you care about YOUR plant,  that means our crew might be there for 3 extra hours sweaty,  dirty,  hungry until that critical piece of equipment is fixed.Typical day, meet stats. Management has favorites, no place for movement, education maters not experience. Co-workers friendly. Hardest part of job individual Department POLITICS.  Job Life Balance: enjoyed job, co workers, working from home. No job security!!!!  company has started out-sourcing departments.BASF offers great compensation.  The environment can sometime be stressful due to occasional periods of being short staffed.  If you work hard and utilize the company resources, there is a lot to be learned from the dedicated and knowledgeable workforce.Excellent benefits. High level of respect in work environment - can't ask for a better work environment. MIddle management at times lacks direction, but supervisors are very friendly and everyone is very collaborative.Great benefits. Management can set unrealistic expectations. Bad work environment/Cut-throat mentality. Work in all outside conditions was pretty horrible.BASF offers a number of locations and types of businesses; Strong upper level leadership with a very forward looking vision; Many opportunities; promotes from within; good comp and benefits as well as training opportunitiesI am currently working two positions at BASF and I work 12 hour shifts three days on three days off rotating days and nights every three days.  A typical work day entails me first fulfilling my duties as a chemical operator followed by performing safety observation, various data entry, safety research, and removal of safety barriers for my position as Steering Team Facilitator.  Bi-monthly, myself along with members of the Steering Team review data collected over the course of the month and determine team progress and potential safety hazards that require attention.  The hardest part of the role of facilitator is finding time in my busy work day to fulfill the duties of the position in addition to motivating other observers.  The hardest part of the chemical operator position is manufacturing high quality products with aging machinery.  The most enjoyable part of my employment at BASF is seeing the observation process lead to the removal of safety barriers.Management doesn't care much about technicians that do all the work. Salary is low and stays low unless you advance many times. Negotiate your salary high BEFORE you get hired, you won't get another chance. Technicians get the lowest bonus' at $1000/yr.I'm a contractor therefore I do not have the benefits that the company's permanent employees. Laid back and flexible environment. Everyone is willing to train with no problem. Main problem is that the opportunities to become permanent are limited or almost no existent.I had a very busy, high stress, very diversified job. I worked very hard, but I enjoyed it.  I liked my co-workers and had good relationships with everyone.  Of course, I met a great deal of people in my 33-year career, and there was occasionally  a difficult, temperamental person.  I learned how to keep my cool and just do my job.  I learned a great deal over the years in different departments, Accounting, Finance, Purchasing, Sales and Tax.  The most enjoyable part of my job, I think, was my relationship with my co-workers, the different activities provided by the company and my work in the different department I worked in. I also enjoyed meeting and dealing with many different types of people inside and outside of the company.  The hardest part of the job was the amount of work and the many deadlines that I had to meet.  But I learned to work under pressure, and I learned to deal with the stress by prioritizing my duties, and I always met my deadlines.long hours job is dirty. benefits are good pay is good. hardest part of job is standing for long hours. working with others is in my department has been good.Company moved to Mexico. Was the best company I have ever worked for. Great benefits and great work relationships. Very close to my home. Continue to keep in touch with people who still live in New Jersey.Every one seems very nice, but it is not perfect just like any company. Job security is fairly good since the company employs so many people even if your job is being done away with they can find you a different position.they hire mostly contract workers, if your not from the area you don't feel welcome. 12 hr shift rotating days. no benefits to any contract workers.Great Company to work for. Excellent pay and great benefits.  Company offers a ton of perks/discounts and seem to care about the employeesManagement now expects you to live at the site, corporate work life balance policies aren't enforced.  Quality manager is a micromanager know it all. Morale is very low due to constant hire from outside versus promoting from within.Busy environment, Great pay and benefits, Good management typical chemical plant shift work nights and days, very safety oriented very safe plantThis job is just not for everyone. Great pay and benefits but you are required to wear a full face respirator to block harmful chemical materials. Some material is worse than others. If you can make it past the first couple of months this job should be a breeze.Safety is a last concern and everyone fights like its high school. the pay is low and the benefits are very costly and poor. the instrument department is very sad to be around."
699,Battelle Memorial Institute,"Provide overall office support to small group. Database maintenance.Work is exciting and meaningful. Staff members are friendly and confident. The safety culture is second to none. Management is helpful and cares about work life balance. The pay is good and the benefits are good as well.They were all amazing. Everyone there was very nice and gave me projects to work on, though sometimes it was a difficult seeking them out. I got to work long-term on a couple projects and short-term on a bunch of others, so I got to see a lot.They were also good with their culture - lots of intern events going on (from social to professional, like employee talks and lab tours), got to see a lot in a short period of time, was noted for my worth and not for my gender/ethnicity/sexuality/etc. Overall a great company to work for.Only downside was that it was a little slow to start. I had a project I was assigned to initially, but that didn't get started up until late in the summer. They were able to assign me to other projects, and my boss was very receptive to this/actively worked to get me on more projects, but it was a little frustrating.Great work environment, with excellent team members. Improved on management skills and interaction with workers. Increased awareness of Quality procedures and practice. Ensuring the workers are performing at a high standard. Working with the Army on Force Protection of the troops.Battelle promotes a healthy culture throughout their staff members. There are programs in place for you to attempt to lower your healthcare premium and a cafeteria with fresh cooked food and snacks. The benefits are much worse than other companies of this size as their primary focus is on income rather than employees.I worked at Battelle for 5 years.  I worked for a great RDML.  I enjoyed working there and doing what I did.  I was appreciated for my support and work.  I was allowed to continue with my volunteer work and also allowed to involve the organization.  I felt job security and the location was wonderful.  I was able to take subway, bus or drive my car.  The hours were flexible.  There really are family oriented and have great holiday parties.  The people are friendly and helpful.  There is also a possibility for advancement.  They will allow you to take classes and improve yourself and education while working.12 hour shifts, no paid lunch even while being required to wear PPE during your lunch. Management seems content in not answering employees questions and berating them for seeking guidance from corporate.I feel very disappointed that tons of American companies are unfriendly to international students. Battelle is one of them.A great company and great people.  Unfortunately, the position ended because Battelle was developing a product at Battelle's expense. The expectation was that another company, ID Quantique, wouldpurchase the product. Unfortunately, ID Quantique did not purchase the product.I worked as a contractor in a government facility and alot of the work enviroment was structured to that so I can not fairly rate the company as a whole.It is a very good place to work at. the only thing not good as a contractor is you do not get any Benefits. Management for the most part are friendly and very nice.job is challenging for various reasons1. lay offs 2. retireesleaving the ppl behind with lil knowledge of job dutiesHowever, it is a place where you learn a lot and grow within the company. Very competitive and passionate ppl work in this place.The overall mission of Battelle is great.  However, because of previous management/investment errors, the Business Services group of the company is in some disarray.Factory style work. Very little upward moving possibilities. Work life was alright and management was very understanding and accept short notice of absence.Great company , very employee oriented.. A non profit company that put all its earnings back into research and employee benifits.It's a very good job. The animals I worked with were the best. You just couldn't help but fall in love with each one of them.I was incredibly lucky to have such great co-workers. Staff are extremely talented, intelligent, have integrity, and are committed to providing quality work.Most enjoyable part of the job i had their was or team was like family.  I learned alot from the people i worked with and got to do alot of cool things.There have been a few organizational changes and scares, but overall this is a good place to work. People are friendly and there's a lot of perks to working here, including the onsite gym and cafeteria which houses guest vendors daily from outside of the restaurant. There seems to be a good opportunity for advancement both lateral and vertically.Flexible environment. Allowed for multiple off-site training sessions. Encouraged continued education.  Quiet environment allowed for Developed a Battelle specific schema based on DocBook using Altova XMLSpy for the vendor to validate documents against.Significant travel made this company more attractive when I was younger than now that I have a family.  Constantly need to keep selling yourself both internally and externally."
234,Baxalta,"Baxalta/Shire is a professional and positive environment with great culture and diversity.  With Baxalta/Shire being a start up company it provides challenging learning experiences.  Management is willing and eager to teach and learn along with the rest of the team.  Team members have different levels of experience, therefore we learn from each other and work very well together.Being a Manufacturing Tech I has gave me the skills, tools, and leadership roles. I was so involved in volunteering within the company. I loved it! I knew that i was able to make a difference but then again i was saving lives by packaging plasma products for any destination all over the world nationwide. My job was sufficient with many tasks so it gave me that skill to be multitasking many things at the same time in our Packaging department.Good compensation and benefits, flexible working arrangements, beautiful office spaces.  Very progressive thinking company, nod to the future allowing workers to work remotely when possible.This place needs to be gutted and restarted... The management is HORRIBLE!!!! They are like one large clique that will throw their employees and each other under the bus at a drop of a dime! The upper echelon only cares about their image to corporate and trying to advance up the corporate ladder.  Don't be an intelligent minded person that challenges the norm because you will become a target and your days will be numbered.  I honestly hope that Shire clears out and restructures the entire upper management structure, from Senior Managers on up, for the better.  Maybe then we can actually build a culture that is for the employees and not for the leadership team.Benefits are great. Advancement potential is based on who likes you and not on your merit. You get very little help from your Masters, Supervisors or Management.  You get written up based on whims. The manager at the Harrisonburg facility as well as the QA manager are misogynists. The Manager has stated that LPN's are glorified a** wipers. There is very little positive encouragement from most managers. Breaks are very limited. The Regional manager, HR manager and their respective superiors are aware of the issues that face this facility and they have done nothing to resolve those issues. You cannot trust supervisors and management.Baxalta has a great culture. Everyone is friendly and always willing to help. We work as a team. The benefits are decent, but not a lot of additional perks.The company has gone through a lot of changes these last few years such as branching off, then independent, then bought off. Along with these changes came layoffs, no pay increase, probabilities for growth have always been hard. Management and pay is not the best. Its ok. Because of layoffs, work load has increased. Co-workers are nice. Lots of schedule changes.My typical day at work involves performing a hands on physical for donors to determine their eligibility to donate plasma. I provide donors with information regarding reactive test results. Assist donors with reactions and any health related questions about donating plasma.The work is overwhelming and the management does not seem to notice. However the people make it worthwhile to work here.My typical as project manager was review construction status, scope, schedule, budget and ensure the quality assurance was exceeding expectations.  This was my first time working in bio-pharmaceutical industry I learned the manufacturing process engineering and clean-build. My colleagues brought a diverse wealth of knowledge and worked together to achieve building a multi-billion dollar manufacturing facility. The most challenging part of the job was to  manage cost since this scope creep was constantly changing due to design. My colleagues were supportive and great people that bonded and spent time outside of the work place.People are really friendly and encourages you to keep climbing. They will teach you what you need to learn and work as a team. Management is good and the work life balance is good.Biggest turn over rate I have ever known of. The hours are very very inconsistent Some days they will work you 10 hours on your feet all day and complain about giving you a water break...bc you will then have to ""go to the restroom"" ...Management goes out and parties with their favorite co workers and definitely shows favouritism. Employees steadily talking gossip about other employees and donors. Really depressing place to work. They just let whoever be phlebotomist and even when the very nee phlebotomist steadily cause hematomas in the donors arms they just keep letting them stick. They don't car at all about the donors. Very stingy company. Thankful I'm I'm not there anymore. I'm finally getting back to myself and not so depressed.UPDATE 6-16Company was recently purchased by SHIRE.  Nothing safe here!!  Over 700 staff where laid of in APRIL and culture is terrible!  Cruel and disorganized.  Steer clear of this place!!  Used to be a place for ex Amgen staff and good people to grow!Good Company to work for, learned many new skills with oracle's JD Edwards. Always good to know that what you do helps people live a more normal life.A typical day at work is as a Clinician; as a educator to teach preventive health care; as a consultant & coordinator, as a Occupational Health Nurse Case Manager.Management and coworkers have been supportive and has allowed me to be autonomous and innovative.  The hardest part of my job is being outsourced.The most enjoyable part of my job was working with all of the employees.No work and life balance.  Poor management that only cares about numbers and metrics. You can only advance if you are one of the favorites no matter how good of a worker you are. The company pays for lots of training and traveling. Could be a great company when ran by the right people.Career ladder opportunities!

Headquartered in Northern Illinois, Baxalta employs 16,000 employees worldwide.Baxter is a great place to work. I've never been in a place where the employees help one another on a regular. The hardest part of my job is being away from the job. The best apart of my job is the employee family that I have there. Everyone is like a happy family so its a very good place to work.Biotechnology across Latin America markets specialized on Hematology, Immunology and Oncology segments with greater focus on R&D and patient outcomes.Baxalta is an excellent pharmaceutical company with a clear and defined technology road map for progressive IT globally that has talented professionals.A typical day at Baxalta is working in a team setting to meet deadlines and advance in the process. I've learned that management is helpful and available when ideas or concerns come up. I'm part of a department that wants its team members to be successful. They have helped me multiple times to advance my ideas and get recognition for my work. My co-workers are a second family, they are always helpful and help me progress and learn to strengthen my skills."
601,Bay State Computers,The company was a really good place to work I learned a lot in my 4.5 years of being there
759,Baylor College of Medicine,"I was taught hands on about reading slides through the eyes of 3 pathologists.Learning the various stains to be used to record a diagnosis.  Publishing manuscripts online with strict deadlines. Obtaining various signatures for publication.  Updating CV and licenses.  One of the hardest aspects of this job was there 3 different pathologists who constantly needed slides ordered from the lab. Stats were almost normal.Travel arrangements needed to be done in timely fashion to receive standard rates authorized through the college.Enjoyed making 3 highly recognized doctors happy daily.Very fast paced work environment. Numbers/Productivity driven over quality Care. Baylor providers are very professional. Atypical work day would include management of Acute exacerbation of a chronic condition average 16 to 20 patients daily for the mid levels and a higher number for physicians. Health maintenance provided.Fields in the Life Sciences expand at an accelerated pace and can be quite challenging, stimulating and rewarding.  The essence of discovery science is very enjoyable. Flexible schedules allow for work-life balance.  Political battles in academia are the most difficult challenges faced.This is a good company to work for. They have to better with selecting Management. It was a bit messy when I was there and people did a lot of things to get others fired. Management and Human Resource was so insecure and unorganized.BCM could be the ultimate place to work and offers many good things, including medical/insurance benefits, but they don't reward hard work and accomplishments. Rather, they reward mediocre work by people who have no personality rather than outstanding work by outspoken people. No one ever seems to be promoted, and even though I did a really good job, accomplishing things that others couldn't seem to get done, I was not rewarded by either promotion or wages. It seems to be more important to be boring and not make waves than to actually accomplish anything on a daily or weekly basis. I've worked for BCM on three separate occasions, and this last time was the closest I ever came to my 'dream job' in research, but in the end, it became more about personality than progress. Other minor problems are parking problems (true for almost all institutions in the Texas Medical Center) and inflexibility among some management.Great research environment, positive and encouraging management, pleasant coworkers and workspace. Very good benefits, good vacation and holiday plans.Great benefits - work with a great group of critical care physiciansOverall management issues with the critical care team (physicians) and the APP manager (does not allow site specific director to do their job without micro-managing)Have learned so many things - great learning opportunitiesYour experience will depend on what part of the department you fall into.  IT selects the best sales person for the CIO position and has little control on what this person does once they get in.  Last CIO was horrible and cost the College tons of Money on sales pitches that never happened. The College overall is excellent with some of the best doctors from around the nation.The Ancillary support for these group is poorly managed and is costing the college a lot of money since they more tune to the sales pitch than the actual work.  They are over inflated in staff and are getting false data from their director.Management is poor very unorganized don't care about employee concerned with customers they can verbal abuse employee cos they are always right no team work and unacceptable pay rate no raisesAssisting patient's to exam room, obtain vital signs, collect lab specimen if needed. Assist physician with exam or procedures if needed. I learned that all patient's are special and they are #1. My clinical manager was a great. She taught us to work hard to achieve our goals in clinic and in life. My co-workers we were a team that worked hard to get the job done. I did not like that we could not give more time to help some of the patient's as they needed. I loved seeing my patients and my patients loved seeing me.I enjoy my working experience in Baylor College of medicine. In the past years, I got the chance to improve my career skills and learned new technologiesWork life balance wasn't all that great once budget season came around due to working very late hours. Compensation is much below than TCH and other hospitals in the area for the same positions. The health benefits are great and the 401k is too. Most of the employees have been there for a long time and plan to retire there. There's room for advancement and movement to other departments. Management does not micromanage and are always willing to listen to what you have to say and they will back if you something arises. The job culture is to do your job and go home!no organization, lazy people, high turnover rate of employees. there is no manager in charge, management has favoritesJob is not paying adequately for the responsibility that I had.  Management was not well executed and fair either.  There were unequal distribution of work duties as well.Great place to work if you're willing to work hard.  It can be overwhelming at first since it is situated in the Texas Medical Centerlearned so much there and had fun working there. management was good .only thing lacking was the duration of job ...it was a short period of time but had great experience .This is a great place to work if you want a career in a stable industry with great benefits.  It is an academic environment, therefore you will need to be patient with academic driven initiatives rather than familiar corporate management driven initiatives.  Many long term employees resistant to change.Typical day is your working alone.Registationpulling Demographicsweekly meetingsmanagement is very interested in keeping you up to date on how to process clean claimsEncourages you to sit with other employees to grasp more conceptsI was unable to join the labs that I wanted to because of funding difficulties, and was placed in one that I didn't have much experience in. There is a strong feeling that everyone wants you to succeed and plenty of people to look to for help. Only real disadvantage is that they expect a serious chunk of your life and it's easy to begin to expect too much of yourself.Baylor College of Medicine is one of the leading Cardiovascular Clinics in Houston.  It is well known not only the state or country but all over the world. I have had the pleasure of working with some of the finest cardiologist. It was a great experience working with the support staff and nurses as well.Loved working at Baylor my co-workers were the best. My boss was really nice and my two supervisor were great. I was in the Oncology , Breast Clinic, General Surgery, Chemotherapy and Mammogram department department's. It was a very busy Suite we saw about 220 patient's a day."
338,BD,"There are many divisions of this company. I am an home based field service engineer for the diagnostics division based in the Baltimore area. So, I can't really comment to much on the corporate workings, but it does appear everyone is happy.Managed, administered and maintained cost and requirements database.  Trained Users on the system.  Worked with military, government and contractor personnel.Advancement is a little tough with senior positions exclusively filled externally. Work life balance doesn't exist for field personnel. Job description says 50-75% travel but 100% is the norm while people are travelling to cities where others live. No clear promotion path with ""manager's discretion"" being the goal to achieve and that's ever changing.The whole company stays true to helping make healthy lives and improve the health of the world as much as possible. I would suggest anyone to work here if you are looking to impact the world even in the smallest way.Fast paced work environment.  People are willing to go the extra mile to get the job done.  Hard working individuals.  Management encourages the use of Kaizens to tackle problems that arise or those that are long standing.If i could have the opportunity, I would love to make BD a permanent work place. Overall, its an excellent place to work. I were given the opportunity to get experience as an press operator and I always wanted the opportunity to work at BD.BD is a fast paced and progressive company that will provide any employee with endless opportunities for experience and advancement.some of the things I learned was received constant web based classes on compliance SOX, HIPA, international work relations as well as IT related processes. my co-workers were a wonderful enjoyable group of people.The hardest part of the job was working with vendors to resolve issues with archiving was very frustrating and consumed much of my time.Good work environment with very limited opportunities for advancement.  Quality is implemented throughout the process.One of the few companies that keeps people around for a long time.The work environment was great. Everyone got what they needed done. We made sure that our products was made like how it was suppose to. At the end of the day it was great to see that we accomplish our goals.Great place to work.  Many things and options for employment.  Seeing things built in a manufacturing plant reminds one that we do still make things in the U.S.I was responsible for converting 2D product concepts into color 3D representations, as well as any 2D graphics, Video Editing or web design that is required to be completed. My boss is great to work with and has reasonable dead lines.I enjoyed my co-workers and boss It was the same thing everydayHardest part was my commuteI did not appreciate how being that this was a temp agency, managers had their favorites and if you are not known like that, you are likely to one of the last picked to go on an assignment. Maybe if an employee is absent or they don't have enough crew then you will get picked. I believe everyone deserves a fair chance.Fun, small company. Not sure how to culture has changed after SAIC buyout.""We help all people live healthy lives"" is what they claim to be their motto, but they left out the part UNLESS you are a BD employee. If you have car trouble and over an hour late it counts the same as night coming at all: so might as well just take an entire day.Work was not that hard but not flexible if you need time off for emergencies.Coworkers back stab so be careful who you trust.Pros it's Monday - Friday for MOST departments.The company got bought by SAIC and I made a good bit of money. Other than that, I'd prefer to not discuess my old employer."
141,"BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company)","I absolutely loved working for Becton Dickinson's Tru-Fit division, and would still be there today if they hadn't moved the operations to Franklin Lakes New Jersey.BD once separated itself from other Medical Device companies however it has changed so much, their identity and reputation have minimalized.  Work Life balance is any oxymoron, a normal work week is 60+ hours.  Perhaps i have rose colored glasses thinking it will be any different with another manufacturer, but BD is taking advantage of too many good people and breaking them is disheartening.    It is unfortunate BD has changed so quickly, it was once a great place to work, it has the feel of a small private company with employee satisfaction at the forefront. Unfortunately the acquisition of debt has the company scrambling to pay back quickly no matter the cost or associate turnover.    My advice to management is to pay more attention to the associates and the company cash generation, the manufacturing plant.  Yes BD, you are a manufacturing company!It's not relevant to write a review on a company you may have worked for over ten years ago, things change, people change and management changes, please delete.Great Culture and people. Communication was not as great. Was there as a contractor and it seemed that the employees were really happy with BDTypical workday is very routine. Co-workers are great and the most enjoyable part of my job would be seeing the products we make benefit others health.Eight hour work days go smooth with balanced work load, and efficient leadership. Co-workers are helpful and professional. There is no hard part of the day.The Company having long history of commitment to the highest standard of excellence and high quality and integrity in everything that is provided to improve healthy lives.   Best place to work.  Higher  standard of employee benefits.Team leads and managers do not take ownership of anything in Global Support. There is no guidance to help someone through the BD culture. No training was provided, no clear direction to expectations, and no acceptance of any failures. When help was sought, leads always deflected to others in departments that were not part of global support. Leads were quick to throw others under the bus and got extremely upset if anyone complained.Great company to work for However, they rather hire contracted workers. The permanent  employees are extremely spoiled. you work from the time you walk in the door to the time you leave. Very fast paced company.Great place to work where employees are well respected and encouraged to help improve patients' lives. Strong social investing position. Good team work.One of the best and highest paying jobs I've ever had. I love that I don't have a manager breathing down my neck all day ""micromanaging"" me. However, many have been affected by recent lay-offs since BD acquired CareFusion...I am one of them!!!Friendly co workers. Free coffee. Very cold. Good Pay. Lots of traffic. Laid back environment. Not too strict. Meetings are plenty.The harder you work the more likely someone will take credit or set you up. It's those people who get promoted. External hires for all promotable positions instead of internal candidates is the way they like it. Unskilled external folks who need to be trained by tenured employees who are organizationally under them.Great place to work. A lot of opportunities within this organization here in the U.S or abroad. Fantastic culture that gives you a great work life balance for you and your family.very rewarding Job, as it focuses on people and building relationship.typically, I connect with a variety of people specific with the  healthcare professional, key professionals in charge to decide about improving healthcare practices. Our company is more on clinical solutions versus being a vendor alone.I Manufactured surgical drapes and post surgical opthalmic lens covers. Qaulity was very important here all products were made in accordance to very specific procedures. The management team was very good here and I was sorry to lose the job when they relocated to another state.Fun Place,worked as Sap BW,BO consultant and enjoyed the work with coworkers and learned other technologies and enjoyed to work here.explore more in this cmpany.This is a wonderful company. Great people to work with.Changing the world for better. BD helps people live healthy lives.Beautiful campus.Very good culture.Growing to fast thru acquisitions... Good benefits and PTO .Good Incentives for future planning.Sad they had to close facility and consolidate in San Jose.Management is fair and level headed. Lots of opportunity for advancement. Full time employees have excellent benefits, 99% of co-workers seem happy and easy going; they are very easy to work with. I am eager to get hired full time and spend my last ten years of employment (or more) here before I retire.Management at BD usually has someone in mind before they post a job.  Management is very closed minded.  BD's doesn't promote from within much.  Negative morale."
593,Bechtel,"working for Bechtel was the best i was for over 15 years moving up to different departments . really busy work place and the co-works were great and also the management team. I hardest part was leavingDespite being away from home for months at a time, and waking up rolling into the office at 6am on Monday in North Phoenix not knowing where in God's hot South Western Mojave dessert my crew and I will be working that week, The comroderie and overall respect that was nutured in that envronment was amazing, We were all a team, and it was felt as soon as you steped in the door. I would still be climbing for Bechel if thay were in Grand Junction and were going to stay in Western Colorado.Projects in Bechtel pose a great opportunity to develop technical skills within a team environment. Types of project vary depending on the business unit of your employment.Working for Bechtel was a great experience. I learnt more things over there and it was my pleasure working for them. I do recommend that company and would to have chance to work for them again.A great place to work and learn. I was able to learn a lot of new skills while employed with this company as well as hone the skills I already had. Besides learning I enjoyed working with my co-workers where I gained more knowledge. This company believe in training and offered training in various aspect of your job.Great overall company, family oriented, good amount of PTO and family/work life balance.  Hardest part of the job is that everything is project based.  Bechtel tries very hard to keep employees, but sometimes relocation is the only way to stay on board.Great work place, the foremans they hire need more experience. I learned a lot more about my craft. They promised lay off  compensation but they did not come through.Lots of favortism going on at this site. Poor site supervisor that was rarely onsite. Work was very difficult and we were working nights with limited lighting which is dangerous when your going up and down scaffolds all night with heavy equipment. Very poor coordination for the nightly workloadI love working for Bechtel , lots of challenges but rewarding . I am waiting for a position now from them . I love their insurance and their benefitsThe people at this company are great. Peers are always willing to help out. I have learned a lot about engineering since college working here. The most enjoyable part of this job is the opportunity to move around and work on many different projects.people are great to work with. The only problem they have is upper management. they need to learn that the working man is what makes him what he is. They seem to think that if your not a supervisor out there then your nothing to them.A typical day at work would be completing daily task from creating and finishing up calculations packages, spot checking, reviewing vendor drawings, back checking isometric drawings, turing in calculations packages to document control after checking thoroughly, and other tasks that arises daily.On a typical day my crew and I will work as a team to make sure our day duties are done on time. I as a journey man made sure my duties where done on time as well as my co- workers. I will do it all over again in a heart beat.Good days working on 48""pipe.Most days look busy sweeping .good employees to work with .jobs not being done because of managementGreat company to work for! I really like it there. I would recommend that anyone work here. There are a lot of great benefits at Bechtel.enjoyable environment and would like to work with this company again. we were always busy which helped the day go by and we all enjoyed pay dayExcellent company except for small time politics will work for this company again I learned a lot.I can only say good things about BECHTEL you took my career to levels I never believed possible for that I say THANK YOU.Management was ok except for the politics.Co-workers were ok very good team spirit in all departments.Trying to keep the project schedule.At the end of the day accomplishing what I set out to do on that day or what my assignment called for on that day. Satisfying the requirements of the sub and seeing the project progress from stage to stage.A typical day at work every day was different and never a dull moment. I accomplished most times what was assigned. If the opportunity be given I will be happy to work for BECHTEL again. I will also be willing to relocate.My experienced at Bechtel was surreal in the sense that I could not believe the level of negativity towards hispanics and color individuals. 1. I was treated very unfair for been a latino as well as my Mexican co-workers. 2. I felt opressed and misguided from the very first day by management.  3. Our employee reviews were vague and meaningless. 4. Management did not take the time to get to know they're employees and the qualities they posses that could help the company be a better working environment.Worked here for 5 yrs plenty of work Alot at home time if and when you need they are very flexible. They have classes to futher your career. Enjoyed working with with companyAs a seasoned contract engineer, Bechtel, in particular the team at Bluegrass Chemical Agent Destruction Pilot Project, are some of best I have ever worked with.this company is run by spreadsheets. get laid off one month and hired back the next. you are treated like a number in all things. the management is unorganized and either doesn't know or lies. a lot of the people you work with are very knowledgeable and nice but stifled by poor corporate organization. the pay is well above average and the benefits are nice."
427,Bed Bath and Beyond,"Its not a difficult job. Retail in general is not really difficult. Customer service values are top priority. This is a great job for friendly motivated sociable people.My general impression of most of my coworkers is either young and lazy or old and stuck.My oppinion of managers is that most of my managers are alright.The hardest part of the job is dealing with the occasional rude customers. Honestly it's no big deal in general but no one likes to be disrespected.The most enjoyable part... I can't say i particularly enjoy any part of the job in all honesty. I do enjoy a handful of my coworkers though.Job was good. However limited opportunities for increase.  Hard worker and results are obvious but not able to see results through pay.  Thanks in advance for your consideration.Working at Bed Bath & Beyond was a positive experience. Besides them not being able to work with my school schedule, it contained a positive group of people along with a good system of management.A typical day at Bed Bath & Beyond was busy. the Management was great a very skilled. My coworkers were definitely team players. The hardest part was stocking. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people.Great managers that will fight for you and help you out when you need it. Always a fun day at work. They are your managers yet treat you like you are a person and not a number.This job was very accommodating with your schedule and management was very positive. Bed Bath and Beyond puts the customer first and managers insisted we help customers over doing freight and stocking the shelves. Typically I would answer phone calls, help customers find products, and in most cases we would help customers compare product descriptions and prices to help them make a purchase. When we weren't busy helping customers we worked on stocking shelves, and organizing inventory. A big part of this job was to make online sales, also known as ""Beyonds"". In order to do this, approaching customers was key, and from there you had to identify their needs and if it wasn't available in the store you could influence them to order it in store. This helped the stores numbers and it also put you in a sales scenario, in which you could develop your sales strategy. The job didn't offer commission, but it did help you when you received your performance review. This job has a great environment and I also liked that it had holidays off and the company would often buy food from local restaurants for the employees.nice place to work positive environment good learning experience systems are old but they make it work management is nice co workers are great peopleIts a good company to be with. People will love the company when they join. People are good and cooperative. You wont be disappointed after joining.The typical day involved a lot of stocking and facing mingled with helping customers learn to read the back of product boxes.Everyone was relaxed and seems to enjoy the daily toil.The day that I be working it's usually fast paced dayCustomers always rightThey willing to help you outThe co-worker are awesomeBe there on time all the timeThe customersThis is a very friendly place to work. I have enjoyed helping customers find what they are looking for. The hours are flexible and as long as you show effort, the managers will work with you for any requests you have of them.Tight knit group of employees focused on service, great place to work, always something to do, great place for newlyweds to shop, reasonable expectations.Morning Shifts - Clock in, Head to the front grab the reports for the department, head to the stock room check to see if we have the product if so grab it and add it to your cart to put onto the floor before the store opens, Finish reports and then fill up the store with what you found inside the stock room, Store Opens finish putting away your reports and help and greet customers when you see them. Continue this until your shift is over, Clock Out.Night Shifts - Clock in, Look on the schedule to see which department you are in for the night, head to the department clean up the department and help customers when you see them, Store Closes, Head to the back room and grab the freight to put out for the night in your department until your shift is over, Clock OutI loved working in the office and having the option to also interact with customers and help them as well.  The company fosters a great culture, unfortunately the management at each location doesn't always follow through with that.Can be a great place to work. It is very hard to advance within the company. Yearly raises on excellent reviews are 20 to 30 cents. I have worked at three different stores with very different ways of doing things. It can be very high drama or very relaxed depending all on management. The customers for the most part are great, but also very needy because that is how we've trained them to be. It's nice to able to take care of customers and we bend over backwards for them. That said, the corporation does not go out of its way to help employees. The company is very frugal and raises are ridiculous; people will often get hired that make more than I do, and I'm a keyholder. There is a lot to do and its hard to get bored if you have a good work ethic.I liked this job but the pay is at a stand still to long. You was able to wear several titles and no pay raise for what  person was worth. The job was very interested and there was a lot to be learned. The feeling to be able to tell a customer about an item and the customer is very satisfied and happy while making their purchase was a joy.became an opener every single weekend since i started and enjoyed it. lunch parties sometimes. great people to work with. not too hard, but not to light either.Personally I could not wait to switch jobs out of this particular line of work. I could not enjoy myself or put myself fully into this job because it was a terrible working environment. After the managerial change within the store it all went down hill.This store has great training that is ongoing as the newer product comes in. Having product knowledge makes it fun to interact with customers.I spent most of my time training cashiers. These reviews are getting ridiculous. All I want to do is place my resume on here. I really don't understand the importance of this.Typical work day at BBB is attending to customers and providing them with great customer service skills, management is great and easy going, hardest part is informing the customer we do not have a product in stock when it shows in stock in store, and my most enjoyable part of the day is the rush throughout the day."
384,Belly,"I worked at Belly for a brief period of time,  I was hired to drive business to my market through new customer acquisition.  My direct Manager was awesome and sharing ideas as to how I could be successful.  The training was brief and fairly intensive.  My peers were readily available to bounce ideas off and pick their brain for similar challenges that I was facing."
604,Berico Technologies,"The company has good management and they work at a fast pace to interview and hire personnel, the company has a good health care plan for a good price but it is a high deductible plan, to make up for this the company offers its employees a master card with 6k every year to cover expenses. A bad thing about the the comapny is that it has sunpeded it's 401k program, but other than that this company is great.Berico is a company which is very good at marketing to their employees, but is marginally competitive.Leadership is engaged but holding an empty hand.This company has great potential, but will only be truly succesful if they align employee interests with ownership interests. Otherwise, steer clear.Additionally, company will likely be sold if they win a few big contracts.If this company were employee owned, I would give them five stars and actively encourage bright people to work there.Enjoyed my time with the company. Medical benefits are the best i have had. training was non existant.Berico is a defense contracting company which is always growing. They take of their people with a great benefits package and very good management. On my project I work with a group of people who really gel together well and our boss is very involved (not in a micro-management manner, but in a servant-leadership manner). Although the company is spread out among many projects, the corporate office attempts to keep us all together as one company. I enjoy working for Berico, and I know it will continue to do well.Company was fast-growing and innovative to provide solutions to the warfighter."
185,Biogen Idec,"Biogen is undergoing some changes.  Senior management is being replaced up to and including the CEO, a new company is being spun out of existing products, one manufacturing site is being built while another one is being closed.   My job is a manager in the manufacturing facility that is being closed and to be honest, I am surprised at the amount of transparency in the closure process and the amount of services that are being provided.  They have excelled in that regard.I enjoyed my time at Biogen.  The work/life balance was great.  The people were fantastic, and, you worked with MS patients which made the job worthwhile.  You were helping people.- A typical work day was productive- Always learning new things to improve my job - Management very understanding- Coworkers willing to give advice and help when neededBiogen prides itself on working fearlessly and changing lives. The bonds between employees and the culture here is like no other. I have learned a great deal about teamwork and the industry as a whole working here.Biogen is a results driven, innovative place to work.

Right now they are running a skeleton crew. Need to work on being so top heavyGreat place to work excellent supervisor  family friendly allowed to learn new skills and flexible schedule.  The hardest part of the job was knowing it will end temp.Excellent company to work for. Very considerate about work life balance. This company also offers excellent benefits. This job also offers great opportunity to help people.Great environment, pay and benefits.  It was close to home at the time.  Until most of company moved to Weston which is reason I left, I was used to not having a commute and walking a mile to work.If the company did not move I probably would have stayed there.Attending various meetings. working on BRD, FRD. Attending various requirements gathering sessions with SMEs.Working on Visio diagrams and swim linesFantastic culture of caring and dedication. superior infrastructure with excellent systems and training. Many perks and great benefitsThe manufacturing environment was stressful due to the ""shift wars"".  Management did not care about the workload left over from one shift to the next. The schedules were also uneven and recognition was only given to a select few. Performance was evaluated by the amount of projects or meetings an employee participated in and not the actual work performed. Promotions were given to their "" favorites"". Management was unprofessional bad mouthing other supervisors and managers in front of employees. Bad environment to work in if you are serious about your work. Lack of accountability and various  issues that were constantly overlooked. If you weren't part of the ""click"" you were pushed aside and trampled upon. Experienced employees were not taken seriously while the"" favorites"" were compensated. Completely opposite of the supposed company values.Company truly does care about the patriots and puts them first. Company is going through some changes now and it will be an interesting year.During my time Biogen Hemophilia was a mostly separate entity that was collaborative with the R & D group in Cambridge. That system had its drawbacks but it did allow for rapid decision making and clear communication within the group. We did have a management change during my tenure and while it did lead to some staff turnover, the development of the drug candidates continued rapidly and the quality of the science continued to be excellent. In the last two years at Biogen I personally spent much of my time overseeing assay development and sample testing for both pre-clinical and clinical studies. I learned about cell line development and characterization, clotting assays, SOP writing and review as well as how to implement and execute testing in a GLP setting.The hardest part of the job was meeting deadlines and keeping up with regulatory reporting guidelines that governed our types of assays.The most enjoyable part was seeing our candidate molecules go from early pre-clinical studies into human trials and have real, positive impact on patients' conditions. My colleagues were very talented, driven scientist that worked well together and were dedicated to delivering the highest quality science to back the development of life-changing therapies.A wonderful environment filled with dedicated and caring peopleTruly dedicated to helping people. Wonderful pipeline.Awesome schedules and work from home policy along with flexible telecommute schedule.

212,Biogen Idec Inc,"Biogen is undergoing some changes.  Senior management is being replaced up to and including the CEO, a new company is being spun out of existing products, one manufacturing site is being built while another one is being closed.   My job is a manager in the manufacturing facility that is being closed and to be honest, I am surprised at the amount of transparency in the closure process and the amount of services that are being provided.  They have excelled in that regard.I enjoyed my time at Biogen.  The work/life balance was great.  The people were fantastic, and, you worked with MS patients which made the job worthwhile.  You were helping people.- A typical work day was productive- Always learning new things to improve my job - Management very understanding- Coworkers willing to give advice and help when neededBiogen prides itself on working fearlessly and changing lives. The bonds between employees and the culture here is like no other. I have learned a great deal about teamwork and the industry as a whole working here.Biogen is a results driven, innovative place to work. They are very big on work/life balance and provide great compensation and benefits.

Right now they are running a skeleton crew. Need to work on being so top heavyGreat place to work excellent supervisor  family friendly allowed to learn new skills and flexible schedule.  The hardest part of the job was knowing it will end temp.Excellent company to work for. Very considerate about work life balance. This company also offers excellent benefits. This job also offers great opportunity to help people.Great environment, pay and benefits.  It was close to home at the time.  Until most of company moved to Weston which is reason I left, I was used to not having a commute and walking a mile to work.If the company did not move I probably would have stayed there.Attending various meetings. working on BRD, FRD. Attending various requirements gathering sessions with SMEs.Working on Visio diagrams and swim linesFantastic culture of caring and dedication. superior infrastructure with excellent systems and training. Many perks and great benefitsThe manufacturing environment was stressful due to the ""shift wars"".  Management did not care about the workload left over from one shift to the next. The schedules were also uneven and recognition was only given to a select few. Performance was evaluated by the amount of projects or meetings an employee participated in and not the actual work performed. Promotions were given to their "" favorites"". Management was unprofessional bad mouthing other supervisors and managers in front of employees. Bad environment to work in if you are serious about your work. Lack of accountability and various  issues that were constantly overlooked. If you weren't part of the ""click"" you were pushed aside and trampled upon. Experienced employees were not taken seriously while the"" favorites"" were compensated. Completely opposite of the supposed company values.Company truly does care about the patriots and puts them first. Company is going through some changes now and it will be an interesting year.During my time Biogen Hemophilia was a mostly separate entity that was collaborative with the R & D group in Cambridge. That system had its drawbacks but it did allow for rapid decision making and clear communication within the group. We did have a management change during my tenure and while it did lead to some staff turnover, the development of the drug candidates continued rapidly and the quality of the science continued to be excellent. In the last two years at Biogen I personally spent much of my time overseeing assay development and sample testing for both pre-clinical and clinical studies. I learned about cell line development and characterization, clotting assays, SOP writing and review as well as how to implement and execute testing in a GLP setting.The hardest part of the job was meeting deadlines and keeping up with regulatory reporting guidelines that governed our types of assays.The most enjoyable part was seeing our candidate molecules go from early pre-clinical studies into human trials and have real, positive impact on patients' conditions. My colleagues were very talented, driven scientist that worked well together and were dedicated to delivering the highest quality science to back the development of life-changing therapies.A wonderful environment filled with dedicated and caring peopleTruly dedicated to helping people. Wonderful pipeline.Awesome schedules and work from home policy along with flexible telecommute schedule. Scientists and employees work hard for lives that matter.Very work-life balance and good benefits. People show respect to each other a lot. Managers care about the team as well. A lot of team building activities going on.I enjoyed the time I had there.

139,Biomarin,"Unfortunately I can't write an in-depth review as I was there as a contractor for only a month, but during my time there everyone I worked with was very welcoming, nice, and very willing to show a new guy around.I would say the most enjoyable parts of the job would be my co-workers there as well as the laid back work environment.Due to budget changes my position was terminated, which was beyond my boss' control. It was an amicable departure.Excellent company with innovative technologies and open to creative thinking.  Wonderfully talented individuals/co-workers and a world-class management team.  Travel was definitely a tough part of the job, but interacting with so many diverse companies was hugely rewarding.  A typical day at work could range from booking travel, to conducting audits, issuing reports, closing reports, maintaining metrics, and attending meetings to report out findings.Wonderful forward thinking company. Treats patients and employees amazing.-Lots of travel 90%-Extensive learning in genetics and rare disease-Management is very forward thinking and looks at business from all angles-Co-workers are highly skilled and very accountable-Hardest part of the job is the extensive travel-The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new clientsI loved working at Biomarin. It is one of the the best companies I have had the pleasure to work at. The management is among the best I have ever seen.This was a temporary position.  Did not like this position. No communication with supervisor.  I data entry all day here had questions supervisor was not around to answer questions regarding the project I am working onExciting place to work providing very dynamic environment with great people.Lots of state of the art IT projects to get involved with providing an excellent place to work.Good Projects, Poor management, Not Rewarding Invention / Hard Work / ""Out Side the Box"" Thinking, Denying Credit when it is Due"
216,BioPoint,"I have never worked with a team as focused and professional as the team at BioPoint Inc.  They are the best.  BioPoint places contract resources in the pharma/biotech/medical devices industry so most of your contact is directly with each client, however BioPoint management is readily available if you have an issue and need assistance.  I have worked as a Consultant/PM for them for a few years now and have only positive things to say about them.  Pay is always on time, they check on the client but also on you throughout your contract.  Most consulting companies I've worked with in the past don't bother with that.Client work is demanding, fast paced, and contractors must be in compliance with all regulations.  If this is your area of expertise, BioPoint is the best."
489,Birchbox,"A typical day while interning at Birchbox included working with the content team to help brainstorm ideas for future online magazine articles as well as future video concepts. I also attended various team meetings and created props for upcoming monthly video shoots. On shoot days, I would attend and assist on set with any tasks. I absolutely adored every single co-worker and they were all a pleasure to work with. Everyone is friendly and outgoing. The hardest part of the job was mastering the Birchbox voice through my writing. The most enjoyable part of the job was the office in itself, which is an upbeat environment filled with treats and surprises everyday. I really enjoyed being there everyday.When I first got hired, they made Birchbox SoHo (before it even opened) out to be an AMAZING environment with a great teamwork ethic and a place for advancement....HAHA!Management was very bad, and the only good ones they had they fired due to them not having the ""looks"" Birchbox wanted (aka discriminated against their body types, etc). Management also chose favorites and conducted things as if it was a middle school cafeteria lunch table... only certain people got praise and perks, whereas others who worked even harder got treated horrible.This place needs to get their act together. Stop making employees who are NOT PAID COMMISSION get in trouble for not having met ridiculous and unreasonable sales goals. There is no need to make them compete against each other if it is not commission-basedA lot of different events and things for employees to look forward toI learned a lot of different ways to do things Co workers are hard working and very knowledgable"
245,Blackbaud,"Blackbaud is a company that is dedicated to helping non-profits achieve their mission by providing solutions that will keep track of how funds are raised and the relationship the non-profits have with their constituents.The company is based out of Charleston, SC, and has grown from a small company, to a large one which has become the leading provider of CRM Software for the non-profit sector.People are wonderful to work with.  Charleston is a great place to work.  It is always nice to be involved with helping companies help people.  Clients are world wideThough it is a public company, it has done a good job of maintaining its (or restablishing in some cases) its culture of fun, customer-focus, and employee appreciation.The culture and the people that work there are all very passionate, caring and fun people to be around.  The people around you are invested in helping you become better at your role.The hours required to support multiple data-centers worldwide was a challenge that met but not rewarded. The opportunity for career growth and promotion was not possible.Everyday was different. Something fun happened everyday, as well. Great team oriented atmosphere. Corporate feel but also one big family.As a Luminate Online project manager, I was dismayed that we sold customers services we could not actually provide.  Management seemed to be ok with collecting for 140 hours a month, then only delivering 120.  On the flipside, when demanding customers forced project teams to bring 160 for only 140 reserved, project managers who pushed back on customer, got zero support from upper level managementBlackbaud is an example of everything that is wrong in the tech industry, where ""services"" try to become a profit center and project managers are sacrificed by upper management, unwilling to stand behind them OR make decisions to change policies.Blackbaud is such a great company for which to work.  I've never felt so fulfilled by the work I was/am doing or so motivated to go to work.  I look forward to connecting with both my co-workers and clients each day.I generally like working at Blackbaud.  The people in other departments seem to like it a lot more than I do though.  I'm in Operations, and we're definitely expected to never stop working.  Things like work-life balance, and quality of life improvements are mentioned, but don't seem to be priorities.  The only thing we seem to accomplish is to stamp out a fire long enough to get it down to coals; then its off to the next, larger fire.That said, I really like the people I work with.  It will be a shame when I leave to not work with them anymore.Great place to work, but management / project management is all over the place. If you find the right job path, you can move up in the company.Fun place to work with a great culture team always focusing on the employees. Great location in the middle on the domain, lots of fun things to do just a few steps out the door.Blackbaud is a good company and I would recommend to others.  Fasted paced and good energy. Focus is on growth and outside sales is the place to be.Enjoyed working there.  My contract ended. Great place to work.  Managers and Employees are great to work with.  Tough environment but worth working there.  I was using my skill.A fun place with a great work and life balance, management was positive, sales goals were attainable.  Very fun job, good culture!  I really enjoyed this position and learned a lotFixed internally and externally filed bugs in software.  Great experience getting familiar with Microsoft development tools.For six year in a row, the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce, SC Biz News, and Best Companies Group have named Blackbaud as one of the top 24 Best Places to Work in South Carolina in the large employer category!My team assists internal analysts with client issues. We build and maintain virtual testing machines that analysts will use to troubleshoot critical issues with company software. We will server as a tier 2 point of contact for case resolution. We primarily work everyday with Windows administrators to make sure our database software is working properly. We troubleshoot SQL related issues that clients may have on a daily basis.Fun place too work and lots of great people but the products are old, unstable, and use very old technology. Company has spent a lot of money to acquire other companies but does very little to integrate them. Compensation is based on the job market in Charleston, which is typically lower than most other tech cities.Typical dayMonitor 40 saas database servers everydayThese systems need to be ""online"" 7/24. Downtime = no moneyPerformance tuning. I tuned average 10 queries / week. Saved hundred hours processingIntensively prototyping Hadoop to create BI from OLTPIntensive migration HP-Linux plaform with Oracle GoldenGate with terabytes of dataAny others DBA duties requiredAs a consultant, you spend a lot of time on the road and serving customers, but there is a group of consultants that are there for you to bounce ideas off of, ask for suggestions for restaurants/things to do in different cities, or even meet you out if you're in or close to their town.  With many people working remote, it's not too uncommon to find someone living in a city you are in for work. The clients are non profits, but this doesn't mean they're all amazing.  Some clients are incredibly awesome.  Some clients are incredibly difficult.  It's just the nature of consulting.  The pay isn't the highest, but you aren't expected to make the job your life, either.  Time outside of working hours is highly respected.  Weekends (with the exception of travel time) aren't two extra work days.  Personal achievements outside of work are celebrated at work.  The culture feels like a family, even if most of your coworkers are remote.They really care about the employee. They have a kitchen with free snacks and coffee all day. They are flexible when it comes to working from home depending on your job title. They are really trying to have all departments become more familiar with each other to better collaborate."
127,Blackberry Limited,"BlackBerry was a great place to work at its height. Many changes since new management team implemented Android focused hardware and BlackBerry software.I consider Blackberry Limited an excellent high tech company, with with opportunities for quick exposure, responsibility, and advancement, which have only increased since they started go worldwide, they are positioned to grow exponentially over the next several years. Most of the cultural elements that made Blackberry great are still defining of Strategy to focus on technology and consumer response to their new products.The company is happy with you as long as you do your job and give your best. It is very flexible when it comes to the working hours. BlackBerry has a lot of intelligent engineers who are very good mentors, they will help you out with anything and everything. Working there I got so much in return because I learnt a huge deal and understand the work life better. The teammates are always helping and are always ready to explain you things when you don't understand something. At times it would get stressful, however I believe that it is the stress level and the difficulty of the job that keeps us going and striving for excellence, by making it an adventure to work for the company. All the teams always help each other out, inter-teams and intra-teams, when in confusion and there is always discussions going on within the team which is makes it a better place to work for.Great place to get the exposure on the cutting edge technologies, flexible, caring and friendly working environment."
478,Bloomberg,"I am very happy to run my own business of flower designs which is a very enjoyable and creative job. And I also enjoy making new friends through the working period.Bloomberg is a solid firm but lacks vertical movements for employees already employed there. Still overall a good place to workI learnt a lot in this company, good place for work ethics.Good Work cultureInnovativeGood place for team workShare information across companyTreat people fairlyProfessional growth is given prioritylinking between people groups and organizations is goodGood compensation and benefits. Great leadership by Mike Bloomberg. Very positive experience to be a part of this company. Many chances to relocate including overseas.Bloomberg is an excellent employer that provides great benefits and a healthy work environment. The office can become quite silent at times, but the atmosphere livens up often.Great place to work at. Everyone loves the free meals and snacks of course too. Great vacation to start at 4 weeks and superb health benefits. Very friendly teams open to new ideas and ways to improve on existing methods of going about daily operations. Would like to see them hire more contracted employees full time as there are several I interact with on a daily basis who have a great understanding of the business and go above and beyond every single day as well as have great knowledge of the terminal already.Project assignment with little to know guidance as to what the overall goal is. Temp work was misguided and length of project was cut short. We were notified at the last minute we were no longer needed.Benefits are the best of the best and internal mobility is available if you show your worth. In some departments a typical day is 8-5 or 9-6 but it depends where you work, some departments don't offer much work life balance. Co-workers are considerate and the ticketing systems are very useful once you wrap your head around it all. The most enjoyable part if how much programming is available to engage employees in productive thought provoking topics.Bloomberg manages a large and complex set of software for obtaining, analyzing, and disseminating financial information.They have a high degree of structure and process that software developers must adhere to. This is necessary, but it can also be overwhelming for some people.They have a ""people-oriented"" corporate culture.I enjoyed my entire time there. The people pay careful attention to ensuring that folks have appropriate training. The workforce environment is also positive and open, allowing folks to excel in their positions and work harder than they ever realized.Great health insuranceGood 401KGlobal OfficesGood co-workersGood Entry Level Free food including breakfastGood work life balance for the most partManagement is lacking big time at this firm. They have a severe disconnect for what it is like to work as a rep in Technical Operations and thus do not offer any type of support or career development to move on further with your career. The pay scale here is horrible and offers ZERO transparency on why external hire that are new to the company receive a higher salary than a individual who works in the same role and has been there for years.Very nice people here. The place was one of my favorite places to work. People there always go above and beyond to help each other and always being polite. I just wish I could of be there longer. Project over and you move on in life.Great place to get started in any position. Not for long term as stress levels will increase in time. Department managers are chosen internally and typically understand 15% of the departments functions..this forces any good long term employees to move on, thus losing a valuable resources for the company.Great first job. Learned a lot and had a great training program. Management can be secretive at times. Not much room for growth or upward mobility. Great co-workers and fun place to work.A typical day would be to monitor the queue for incoming break fix tickets. These tickets range from service impacting high severity to low priority infrastructure work and operational updates. I've learned a wide variety of skills as diagnosing hardware issues, troubleshooting connection/link down events and also uploading and analyzing core/log files. Management can come down on you for small things, but that is because of Bloomberg is a multi-billion dollar company with potentially millions of dollars at risk. The hardest part of the job is multi tasking and handling multiple issues at once.  Bloomberg has certainly helped with pressure.  The most enjoyable part of the job is learning.  You can learn a little bit of everything here. You can learn networking, storage, the various operating systems, troubleshooting, and much more if you are willing to put in the time.Bloomberg is a large global company. There is a lot of upward mobility and ability to move throughout the various departments. Also, it has a great training program.Very good company, cant think of anything negative to say about my experiences with them. Good pay, good location, good people.The work environment was challenging and intellectually interesting. I was a software developer for the FX (foreign exchange) group. The hours were rather long, but the learning experience was rewarding.Bloomberg is an excellent place to gain knowledge of the financial market. With their terminals, I was able to learn more about different industries and how they performed on a daily basis. While there, I worked on S&P 500 markets and various European markets. Data that I analyzed and corrected, would be updated in real-time to help provide an overall better trend analysis for clients.This is a privately held financial software, data, and media company that is headquartered in Midtown Manhattan, New York City"
311,Blue Coat,Blue Coat is one of the dot com company in Sillicon Valley.It's an excellent company for job advancement and great benefits. I have bonus every quarter and stock options every year.
693,Blue Ocean Ventures,"Owner did not follow own policies and did not treat the resellers with respect. Products were never available. Co-workers were not trusting of each other. Advise for owner, listen to your employees and give fair chances. Have some promotional material made that are more informative and quit making promises to resellers that you can't keep."
286,BNY MELLON,"great company with great benefits. Definitely recommended. It typical day of work depends on the department you work for.Overall one of if not the best job I have ever worked for the pay rate just doesn't meet my family responsibilities. The hours are great the benefits are good as far as life insurance and vacation days and 401K but the medical and dental deductible is outrageous it doesn't meet the single family requirement. You have to work another job just to pay off deductible and copayment for medical and dental visits.The job itself is fine. It can have days where it's challenging but mostly repetitive. Most difficult aspect is working with other internal teams, especially those outsourced to India who do not understand questions being asked or speak English very well. Advancing your career can be very difficult. Most do not receive promotions for hard work. Instead, you have to move departments or try and get an offer outside the company and hope to be offered a promotion to stay. Raises are terrible and I've been on what they call the 'exceeds expections' category most years (highest review for merit increases). Expect no more than 1-2.5% raise/year. The company is so focused on cutting expenses they have outsourced so many jobs and make cuts a few times/year. They also do not replace positions when someone leaves, unless it's an absolute necessity, so many teams are left very short staffed and therefore overworked.Working at this place for 10 years and have to say it has changed in so many negative ways.1.) Management has poor communication with the people under them or at the same level. 2.) The raises decreased immensely and health benefit cost are now higher.3.) They continue on letting go of hard workers while keeping poor workers to remain in the company.4.) New trainees come on the floor and are here no more than 6 -12 months because the pay and management is so bad and upper management doesn't recognize that so many workers on floor are unhappy and stressed due to lack of help and lack of management communication.This job is ok for High School graduates or college graduates to get their foot in the door in the career world, but definitely not a good long term career place.The Asset Management Operations team of executives does not value or attempt to retain existing workers.  Payroll kept low by hiring new workers directly from college.  Once they are trained and working well, they face limited chances of advancement or salary increases.  Morale remains low, as workers realize their productivity will not be matched by recognition or compensation.  The teams do support each other, for they wish to retain their job until they can move on.  Established professionals hired from outside are given take it or leave it offers.Fast-paced enhancing my agility and bringing to the surface skills I was unaware I possessed.  I did not enter the organization playing the Acoustic Guitar, Keyboard and Producing Music.  My gifts and latent talents were brought out and developed during my employment.  I've done Administrative Assistant work for over 20 years in various industries and I believe it's time to use my natural gifts and talents and work in an industry where I can be of service to Humanity.This firm afforded me the opportunity to fully utilize my financial degree which made me the well-rounded professional I am today.  I gained analytical experience, managerial experience, client management experience, and both internal and external compliance/regulatory experience.Chicago site management and supervision is the worst very unprofessional and care nothing about the employees. Everything is based on company need regardless of the employees situation they may be having with other life responsibilities other then the job. The rules are very unfair also. Chicago site also is very diverse but the management isn't specially with the African Americans.A steady busy day to day work load.  Resolving issues. Mentoring and is a subject expert matter to co-workers.Over the years I've learned the investment's ins and outs, financial tools and vendors systems, writing SQL statements to pull data from the database, Eagle STAR and PACE system. Hardest part of the job was the lack of job security due to lay-offs over the recent years.Most enjoyable part of every day is knowing I can help resolve issues for our clients,  Guiding and answering questions my teammates have.  Fortunate to have friendly coworkers and report to a flexible manager.Mediocre company with poor benefits, advancement, salary and leadership.There seems to be a lack of vision and forward thinking. Most initiatives are either knee-jerk or reactionary. Much too much time spent on putting out fires and addressing regulatory issues.The asset management operations team of executives does not retain existing workers. Instead, hires new workers directly from college. Once they are trained and working well, they face limited chances of advancement or salary increases. The best part of the job is getting to know our internal and external customers.Not much room for advancement. Pay is not competitive.Raises are next to nothing, if you're lucky to get anything. You have to be thankful they give you anything.I was fortunate to work on a team that allowed to work from home sometimes, so I didn't have to go to that hole (Brooklyn) that often; a lot of people aren't so lucky.BNY Mellon is a great company to work for.  Everyone is usually friendly and easy to work with.  The management can award you for your efforts however can be easily overmissed. Low compensation compared to other companies in the industry in the area.This company is very political.  If the managers like you then you have a shot.  I worked there for almost fifteen years and as let go because I made a mistake.  They are in a lay off status and will get rid of you any way they can.  They do not look out for the employees but only for the company.  The pay is low for the work being done.  The benefits suck.Nice company but when it comes to advancement at times it is not all what it seems. Work force has become more of do with less associates, but have more work. Expectations take over a normal working day.Typically we have the daily schedule and work routines, everyone are assigned to certain clients/funds unless someone else is out for work. We are managing/processing the funds for our client and providing any services upon for requests. overall the company and the team are good but just the manager managing skills need to improve.BNY Mellon can provide you with a steady, challenging lifetime career in a modern, clean, friendly work environment.  The company strives to provide their employees with competitive salary and benefits.BNY Mellon is a very large company with plenty of different opportunities. For that reason, I believe it is a great place to start with directly out of college. There is a high degree of lateral moblity, however, this is not the case as far as upwards mobility is concerned,I worked here many years and my experience throughout the bank has been nothing short of  great.  I've met a lot of people in my time at the bank and have remained friends.Low compensation, no job security and hard to advance.  You can work hard but little recognition only good thing is coworkersEmployees are not paid enough. They go above and beyond and their work is usually met with just praise and not enough monetary rewards. This provides a lack if incentive."
279,Boehringer Ingelheim,"Productive and challenging; flexible work environment due to new workplace of the future and reducing the carbon footprint. Unstable work environment at the moment due to restructuring within the company.Boehringer Ingelheim, Value through innovation. A German Pharmaceutical Company, that in my experience, takes care of their employees.With the advancement system, there is a change to meet personal goals, with regular talks called Mitarbeitergespräch (talks with the employee). The hardest part of the job, is time management and prioritize the budget spendings. But overall, is a very satisfying job, with an amazing working environment as well as co-workes.Although I do not currently work there now I did love the culture, management and the scientists. Had I became a permanent employee ( I was a student temp) the benefits package would have been wonderful along with the pay. But i was fool and moved back to my home town after school. Everything that keeps an employee happy is what is offered at this company. Excellent leadership in management, harmonious staff of employees which only led to a great work environment of diverse group of people of differing ethnicities and backgrounds.My role with BI is diverse and broad. It is a clinical sell with scientific support, it addresses the changing landscape of healthcare. Educating not only in early recognition and its importance but in the benefits of earlier treatment and prevention of admissions and readmissions into hospitals. Providing pharmaceutical treatment options through guideline emphasis and education. It speaks to the increasing number of ACO's and PCMH's and the challenges that they have in meeting specific quality metrics and measures to optimize the triple aim goal.BI has done a great job at launching a large number of products over the last few years.  Unfortunately most of those launches have not produced in terms of sales.  As such, the company is going through a major re-organization, where the long-term-plan is not well communicated and people are being quietly laid off.  There is a strong German family culture at BI, where things are done the ""BI-way"".  If you want to read, eat, sleep, and live SOPs, then this is the place for you.  If you have creative, new ways to do things, that will not be embraced and you're better off elsewhere.  There are too many people who have been there too long to do anything new.  There is little room for growth, and the office politics are the worst I have ever seen in 20+ years.Finally, the company does not do a good job of understanding the US market.Own your business! A strong work ethic, along with good organizational and analytical skills, will boost chances for success. Phenomenal co-workers in the field and insightful and supportive management allow for enjoyable, self-direcred work days. Customers are appreciative but increasingly harder to see.A good place to work.  Going trough some changes.Future in question.Fair compensationMinimal chance for promotion.good productsBoehringer Ingelheim was an excellent company to work for.  Beautiful grounds, excellent pay scale and was always welcome to learn new tasks.  I learned event planning throughout the life cycle, portal website entries, and much more.  The company is very structured, but appreciates their employees.Job security is and has been a great thing with this company.  I have learned a great deal with this campany.  But as I further my education with the goal of bettering myself and my families life, I feel I am ready for something more challenging.Sales, Field Training, KOL development, POA development, co marketing, mentoring reps, great work environment, good benefits, hard working teamsroom for growth through development planning and implementationGreat culture where very smart people working together.  Many good challenges. Opportunity for growth limited given significant business challenges over next few years.  Not very strong pipeline...some around Biosimilars; doesn't compare to other pharma companies.Constantly restructuring, cutting, laying off.  If you're good at what you do, less chance of that but still possible.I worked for them as a temp for about 8 or 9 months then was hired in as a fulltime employ. I really enjoyed working for them and would very much like to work there again.Very good company to work for.  Privately held and based out of Germany.  Has won many innovation awards.  Company offer very good benefits.German owned company by German family.  They do value the employee and provide great work/life balance.  Unfortunately this does not drive success in business.  Management is held hostage to Germany demands which would be fine except business in America differs from Germany and one size does not fit all.  This disconnect is driving poor performance.This is a wonderful place to work. BI offers great pay and benefits. It's a growing company that is all over the world and offers employees growth potential.Typically would see 8-10 primary/specialty physicians daily. Review their provider data. Learned how to not only sell to providers, but pharmacists as well.  Became a field trainer to aid in the education of new/establish representatives.  Hardest part of this job is it is difficult to break past the glass ceiling.  The people that are currently apart of the company are lovely.The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and working with people from all different management levels as well as globally.The typical day at work was very fast paced with constant changes in priorities from immediate management. Some of this dictated by manufacturing requirements and some dictated by marketing demands.B.I. is a wonderful place to work with very supportive management. They offer many opportunities for advancement and are actively seeking new employees to add to the team.Great company to work to. Top of the line pharmaceutical products. Travel requires at least 3 times a year. Great benefits.I most appreciate the opportunity to create and innovate concepts and tools that meet business needs (vs being given something from a center of excellence to implement). Undergoing transformation- need even more people with business acumen, agility and ability to influence and get things done despite obstacles - together we will continue to evolve the human pharmaceuticals business model.BI takes care of its great employees. I have worked with many managers and all have advanced my career and helped me improve my value. Great experience."

System performance and uptime is 99.9.My experience at Boeing has formed and informed my life. Boeing is truly one of the best companies in the world - both to work for and to do business with. When I started, most schools were telling us to work for our first company for 3 to 5 years, then build a career somewhere else. Boeing is a large company that allows one to explore new products, innovate in existing products, and learn more about all aspects of the business. In my career, I have taken advantage of the opportunities to move, to grow in my capability, and to supplement my existing knowledge with academic and practical experience. Boeing is also active in the communities it serves. Boeing employees get out into the communities they live in and solve problems, quietly and effectively, on a practical level. This is what builds a strong company and great communities.I very much enjoyed working for Boeing the personnel were great to work with the management was good as well. The only bad side of my time at Boeing was that I was a contractor there and not an actual Boeing employee which left me with no job security and the knowledge that my job could be canceled at any time.Boeing had a great work/life balance as the company is older and doesn't expect you to be a wizard and live to work.

456,Bonobos,"Fun place to work with great customers. I truly enjoyed having fun interactions with the BONOBOS customer. I was part of management and was often told I was fun and easy to work with by my guides. The hardest part of the job was sometimes getting the customer comfortable with the process. It was a little different concept than other retailers. There were times that I faced very difficult obstacles which would make the overall work experience not so great. I found the other managers excluded and withheld information making it very challenging to do my job.Build an achievable sales plan for the day.Take on projects single handedly.Built an amazing team with precise coaching and involvement.Had a great team of associates I could rely on.I was brought into Bonobos over a year ago to start the Bonobos Guides program. I've brought in over $1 million in revenue for the showroom and set up trunk shows and events with Fortune 500 companies, top business schools and charities. As with typical start up culture, I wear many hats and at this stage, I am interested in focusing on sales and account management."
278,Bosch,"Review prints find parts to build the machine. if needed I will make the parts. quote jobs talk with customers about there project and if satisfied over build. sometimes customers wants more than what was quoted at the start of the job.My position required leadership skills to direct the work force towards company goals. This included on time deliveries, customer interaction, and diplomacy. Other responsibilities included training of workers, both salary and hourly, and safety. It was a pleasure to work with, on the most part, professional people in their fields of expertise. This created a high expectation that the team would achieve daily and long range goals. I earned the respect from all levels of management.Bosch is a non-profit organization, which means it's not publically traded and there are no share holders. It's a very diverse company, as well as the largest automotive supplier in the world.Bosch treats its employees well and there are many opportunities, especially for those with 4yr degrees.Well structured company to work for. Great benefits. Great pay and fun people to work with. Management was awesome. Was respective very well. Made a lot of friends.It was a OK job just was some lo down employees there. Managers was OK just some of the employees constantly having meetings about who they knew was doin everything wrong.Good benefits and opportunities for advancement. Moving to a centralized theme wherever possible to provide consistency to employees.I loved working at Bosch . If you asked anyone about me you will have very good feedback. Bosch is a fast pace job and it's very easy. Everyone is very polite and positive.I needed more to do. They were trying to force me into another department in which I was uncomfortable with, because it required a lot of computer work. I am not computer savvy; I know bare minimum.I didn't quite like the environment. We have a certain time to get a lunch break or a mini break by the time we eat lunch you're almost late to complete your shift. The warehouse is extremely huge and you have to almost run to get to the front of the warehouse. But then there is that one thing that you cannot do and that is run.Worked for the company for nearly 20 years.  They use to walk the talk of the culture and importance of community.  They used to treat their employees like valuable team members.  Now, it has turned into a burn them and churn them, no matter how much a person has contributed to the success of the organization.Management changes every few years and the culture changes to reflect the beliefs and management practices of the current establishment.Typical day is mostly desk environment but it greatly depends on the product line one works in.   Being a large company many responsibilities are compartmentalized, however a position where interaction with multiple disciplines was most rewarding because it allows you to become a generalist.  At the same time, you could also become an expert in a specific component, so it's easy to find that this company provides opportunities across the board to fit the breadth of knowledge you're hoping to gain in a product/system.So far it is a great environment to work. You get well trained before being left on your own. There is opportunity to grow and advance if hired on permanently. The fact that you have to start as a temp instead of direct hire is kind of a negative due to the pay as a temp. You cannot live on $11/hr.  But if hired perm, the pay is well above average.I learned a lot about different parts. I liked my managers. I got along well with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was when our contract ended. I enjoyed going to work everyday to learn more, and meet new people.Don't recommend, they don't care about the employees only the profits and quantity of parts put out, long hours 7 day work week,lots of employee turnoverDidnt do too much but stacked tools onto a pallet. There was nothing much more to learn. The supervisors were good people and they always checked on you to make sure you was ok.I have learned a lot from this position regarding strategic planning of the product line, communication with different management levels inside and outside of organization and also i have learned that i am not a 100% office person. I like to travel outside the office, meat people and get challenged by their needs.good memories.German culture is great.willing to work in any where in Bosch ltd.Good food and increment is also good.Want to work in Germany and other parts of the world and  i want learn more quality about Bosch products.I did not enjoy working here. The salary was no where near enough to do everything they expect you to do. I was doing work a manager should've been doing.Very productive. I learned  the difference parts of the fuel injectors. Also there are different types of injection. Working for Bosch has been and experience for me because I have learned so many things about the fuel injections.Treated badly an terrible job security. They followed me to the bathroom an talked down to workers. i will never work there ever again an do not recommend it to anyone.great place to work would recommend to other people managment was great took time and cared about employees worked thirds"
198,Bose,"I had been with Bose in various positions for the past ten years.  There were a few years due to the economy that caused some anxiety, but for the most part it was a great company to work for.  Due to changes in the electronics industry, the company had to restructure and my job was affected by the changes.I used to cover resellers over three states, and really learned how to stay organized and to best make use of my time.  Relationship building and gaining advocacy in short visits was critical and with my sales background was able to get very measurable results in short time periods.It was a very sad day when I had to leave Bose, but also exciting to know that I can take the training and relationship building skills with me to another career, and start the next chapter in my life.Bose is a great place to work, but going through changes due to challenging market,  Work life balance was good, benefits are good, and most management is very good.I very much enjoyed my time with Bose. The only reason I am no longer employed with the company is my location was outbid on rent from another company so we were forced to close. I enjoyed my job, interacting with my coworkers, and the company itself. Bose truly cares about it's employees and that shows through competitive salary, great bonuses and awesome benefits. 10/10 would work for the company again!Fun place to work, true ""open door"" policy at all levels of management. Company has an employee first attutude.Great products for home theater and audio.Having the ability to meet new people as they get to experience the sound of Bose, is exhilarating. I work at a company where I get to be surrounded by music and co workers that are just as passionate about music and a stress free life with the amount of systems we have to bring out the best needs of any customer that walks into our store.Working at Bose is a very positive and well built infrastructure. All the tools and resources are provided to make it the best place you have ever worked. I was with the company for 7 years. A lot of changes took place in 2015.I have worked here for many years and I would have to find an amazing opportunity to make me want to leave.  People typically live out there career at Bose.I thoroughly enjoyed working at Bose. The benefits and work environment is absolutely amazing! The company takes care of their employees and management to the highest level!Its a great company to come and work and help customers with any concers. I get to learn a lot from each customer that comes in to the storeA typical day at work seems to be more stressful than most. The company puts a lot of pressure on you to sell products, even to people who do not wish to buy.Upper management at Bose is a mixed bag. The research and development side is brilliant, while the marketing and branding departments are stuck in the 1980's. It is for this reason that the company has been losing ground to newcomers, even when Bose products are equally priced and of superior build quality.As for the working environment I can't complain one bit. It treats its employees fairly and the benefits are substantial. However, due to immobility at the top, job security becomes an issue as the company see's its ROI drop year after year.It was a great experience, just wish there was a place for me to grow in there as a young professional.The employees make this a very nice place to work.  An excellent place to network if you are a musician.  I was given the opportunity to perform in several great musical encarnations.Working for a luxury brand is a fantastic experience. Everyone is familiar with Bose, so I don't have to spend 10 minutes explaining who we are, and what we sell.Most enjoyable has to be helping a variety of different people with finding the correct product to fit there needs. Working with my co-workers is a joy and the ability to learn from them when I first started was awesome. My Manager and Regional Managers are great team to work for just great attitudes and great energy.They respect and value employees. They have solid corporate values and bring out the best in you. Since working at Bose, I have had a deep understanding of process improvement.I enjoyed working with people in great environment. I learned a lot over the years, but I miss Dr. Bose. I hope new management will make this even better place. Only time will tell.Sales is sales no matter where you go. At least you do not have to fold clothes, right? Good management willing to help. Wish they treated there seniors staff as good as new staff.New leadership has changed company direction, lack of communication has affected my opinion of company and morale.Great place to learn new skills. Learned SAP and learned a vast amount of knowledge with excel and communicating with other DC's to rectify inventory discrepancies.I worked there for 4 years in tech support. The people you work with each day are great. It was what made the job. During that time the company's goals seem to have shifted. Moving up is very difficult unless you personally know the person making the decision.My experience here was overall good. There was, however, very little supervision and management throughout the warehouse. everyone was just kind of on their own, so if you wanted to work, you worked and stayed busy, and if you didn't, you didn't, and eventually got called out. I found it impossible to move up and worked in every single department without any sort of acknowledgment. This place would be better if their sales were better, and if they paid more attention to their employees."
207,Boston Medical Center,"I love working with patients and trying to make them get the best medical care they can get.  I have learned a lot about billing, coding and scheduling.  I have spent the past 20 years working in the medical field and love working with people.  My co-workers are very kind and professional and caring people.  I think the hardest part of my job is seeing the sickness and illness around me and knowing that there is not a lot I can do to help the patients get well.  The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing patients return and get well.Like everything, workplace has benefits and disadvantages.  The benefits are the benefits, but not an environment that i found management wanted anyone to be able to grow.I loved the patients and the position i played but the co workers were very unprofessional. however, I got hurt on the job and was in properly informed of the procedures and was unlawfully terminated so I had to leave that position with unemployment and there was and action suit and there were so many complaints besides mines.During a typical day I manage a que of 15-20 members that I reach out to too follow up on care management needs, questions or concerns. Management and my coworkers are great and very easy to get along with. I work in a very collaborative work environment. The hardest part of my day is making sure I reach out to all of my members. The most enjoyable part of my day is the satisfaction that I get when I'm able to provide quality care management.A very high paced work environment. you have to be able to multi task. The hardest part of the job i would say is keeping up with the non compliant patients. the doctors are awesome to work with as well as the nurses.BMC HealthNet Plan has a great mission to serve the underserved population of both Mass and New Hampshire, while maintaining strong institutional ethics.Worked in the operating room under the direction of my superior. Maintained and managed supplies with accuracy, to ensure sufficient supplies were readily available for patients going into surgery. Also had the responsibility of ordering supplies to restock the operating room post surgery.Working at Boston Medical, there was always a busy work load, but I also enjoyed it because it was something I've grown to love to do overtime. While working at Boston Medical, I've learned, how to work more with a team and how to be a medical record clerk. The management at Boston Medical was always there to assist you if needed. My co-workers were like my second family. We were always there for each other, eve outside of work. We've made some pretty good memories together. The hardest part of working at Boston Medical was trying to read the doctors' handwriting. Sometimes I couldn't understand it at all, and I would need help from my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of working at Boston Medical was being able to do something that I loved. A Medical Record Clerk may not seem of much importance to many people, but I think that it's a step closer to change lives y helping people.Great work environment. Wonderful management team that shows concerns about welfare and work – life balance of staff members. There was good comradery among pharmacy staff membersThe benefits as far as health insurance, 401k are great. But there is little room for growth and management needs trainingBusy place where you can learned from a variety cultures, great team work.  Great Medical Insurance (FREE), only pay for Dental, also my medications only cost me $5.00 at BMC pharmacy.A typical day at work is very fast pasted. Ive learned so much being in the float pool. Being in the float pool I was exposed to all aspect of patient care. From labor and delivery to cardiac patients. The staff was great very helpful. Hardest part of the job would would be low staffing. Most enjoyable everyone works as a team.I worked at a call-center for BMCHNP. a typical day at work would consist of answer calls for patients and helping them with insurance information and changes. the most enjoyable part about my job is being able to help people. my co-workers were friendly.Boston Medical Center is a teaching facility which enables employees to become familiar with different career paths while employed.I have made life long friends.  We learned and explored about different cultures.  It was a wonderful experience.  Great preparation for work.I assisted all types of members with all types of issues but I enjoyed every minute of the experience. I loved my co-workers who assisted me whenever possible.I have been with the company since December 2015. I am content with where I am at this point in my tenure with BMC. I look forward to continuing the learning of various products and services offered.I had an excellent experience working at Boston Medical Center. Gained a lot of knowledge working with top rated Oral Surgeons in the US.One of the most rewarding things I experienced was working with the patient population and I consistently had compassion for the patients.Boston Medical Center is a city hospital which gives back to its community, We are a heavily traveled hospital with never a dull moment. Unfortunately we tend to a lot of overdoses and gunshot victims. My position is in charge of calling codes whenever a patient is in distress ex: code blue, respiratory response, emergency surgical airway. We are also in charge of answering all calls that come through the main switchboard and transferring them to their destination.The first 12 years was night shift customer service, computer repair calls. Worked holidays and weekends in the emergency room lot chaos and mayhem at times The most enjoyable part of the job was the kids that came in to the emergency roomgood company to work for. they treat u good and with respect, pay is good and alot of good people to work with. I recommend this job."
203,Boston University,"Boston University is a great place to work with excellent benefits and time off. A lot of diversity. You will learn how a large university operates.Supervise, train and otherwise maintain the day to day operational effectiveness of the Housing and Rental Department. Train new personnel, update techniques for continuing employees, monitor and assign workloads, measure effectiveness and design and implement goals for each employee.Handle delicate cases, analyze confidential and personal information to effect resolution. Interaction with students, staff and superiors providing information, answering questions, receiving complaints, take orders and requests in behalf of the University.Great mentorship in a supportive environment. Some drudgery when executing repetitive experiments. Friendly coworkers. Management sometimes doesn't provide enough structure. Freedom to solve problems creatively.Although it is had to say between departments. Wanting to work there for years and finally getting in the experience was not what I expected it to be. Manager was very demanding and not understanding about personal issues or well-being.Loved working there, great staff, excellent organizagtion. Worked there for almost 5 years, reasonble pay for management but and had to resign due to very stressful commute .BU will give you as much responsibility as you can handle. No politics. Decency and interesting people to work with. Wish they were here in warm Sarasota!My overall review isn't the best due to management and how staff are treated, to the point that even directors of different departments state the same.Boston University has something for everyone. They are always striving to improve the education that is provided to their students.I learned a ton from working with the student workforce. They brought a certain energy that is unique to a University setting. I found that most of the staff shared a common goal to do their fare share while keeping it a enjoyable place to work. I was blessed to have great leadership to learn from and grow as a young professional.The most challenging part of my particular job was dealing with last minute requests, or unforeseen technical issues.It was truly a blessing to work with such great young adults and future leaders, making all the hard work enjoyable.A quiet and non disturbing environment that gives you enough time to finish your tasks and research in a timely manner. The co-workers are all highly educated and professional which provides a nice educational environment.I worked and studied at BU for a very long time. Few of my instructors were tenured, and part time faculty get paid very little. I got no monetary recognition or reward for my degrees though relevant to my job. I know that BU's Personnel office only pays salaries based on a position's demand and how easily it can be filled. Management rarely shows any appreciation for loyalty or anything else. Given the cost of higher ed right now, if you can avail of the tuition benefit, use it and leave ASAP. Otherwise, avoid BU if at all possible. They abuse workers and students while obsessing over bottom lines and perpetual inferiority to Boston's other colleges.Great place to work, everyone here is very respectful. At times it can get stressful because of the work load. You're never not working because you have to be on call but that comes with working in the IT dept.It is a great experience to practice public speaking and communication with others. Also, the work load is reasonable, professors are friendly and other TAs are nice.This job required the delivery of foods and beverages to soup kitchens and churches in the surrounding Boston area. I was able to meet a lot of generous people from many backgrounds who all wanted to give back. Working with co-workers was rewarding because we were all their for the same thing.I have been an intern at BU in the IT department for the past two years. It is a great place to work, the work atmosphere is busy, co-workers are very helpful.BUASC is a great environment if you don't want to grow. The department needs structural shift to meet the needs of the younger generation.Boston University provides an excellent benefits package and encouragement to grow within one's own department and across the institution.It is a challenging internship in many ways.  Often I lead and work with people who are much older than I am, while I am in the leadership role.  I must be able to work with a large variety of people.  Because of the necessity for the Chapel to be a safe place, there is a certain level of decorum that must be maintained.  It has been a really wonderful learning experience.Very energetic team of employees, get to learn a lot on the job. Supervisors are very experienced, and are ever ready to help with any problems that might crop up.The hardest part of this job: It is always hard to get a article to support our opinion about our researchI learned how to combine real world business with theory in books. I enjoyed to work with my Professor. He is a creative person.Working in the Medical campus' research lab was everything you would expect. No thrill and no frill. Great for those who want to have an easy full time job and go for their tuition remission benefit and get a graduate degree out of it part-time. Be prepared to work hard for juggling school and work though, it's do-able but not fun.This is a very interest place to work. Some co-workers were wonderful . Management wasn't big on communication. The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting persons from different places and dealing with all personalities."
557,Bowhead,"Good company to build up work ethics for morale, interacting with different  character, looking forward to get a chance to work for them again in the future.Nice people to work for. Very open and positive management team. Co-workers were good to work with. Management team came to visit often.Friendly environment place to work and enhance your knowledge . I gathered a lot of experience from Bowhead and learned the value of interactions between different societies.Bowhead may be a great place to work if you work at one of the contract locations.  Working at headquarters in Alexandria, VA, is a different story.  The CEO, formerly the office manager in Lexington Park, who is for some reason adored by the shareholders in Barrow, micromanages everything, is quick to cast blame when something goes wrong, plays favorites, and is generally vindictive.I love learning something new every day.. great environment to work in. No worries about work there's plenty. Everyone has a good attitude.typical work day is steady work i learned soldering management is nice coworkers r great nothing hard about my job just time consuming and i enjoy my workgood company to work for. works with you on problems you may have. will work to keep you having a job.  co workers are great  team of peopleGreat work force team, give them a thumbs up.Learned that I didn't like being Part-time-on-calland thought hourly rate should had been higher.typical work day is steady work i learned soldering management is nice coworkers r great nothing hard about my job just time consuming and i enjoy my workI began working for this company shortly after I retired from the military.  Throughout my time with this company I was able to learn so much valuable information.  The company was very good to their employees.  I enjoyed the experience and training they offered.  This job gave me the opportunity to travel.This is one of my first jobs, and I feel that it is one of the best IT companies to work for. The people are so helpful and we all work as a team to accomplish tasks. I couldn't have asked for better opportunity to display my skill level.Overall working for this company is ok. They are close to as good as it gets in this line of business. The people make it tolerable.none I don't have nothing to say about the company ..Just is a good company to work for thanks BowhaedA typical day at work includes, researching part number, taking type 8 confirmations, controlling major end item and secondary programs.The senior management is great, however not everyone gets along well. There are still some little kingdoms that exist. Also Bowhead is setup like no other company I have ever worked for in the past when it comes to IT & trusting employees. There is a family atmosphere that is promoted by senior management but gets lost at the director level. At times it seems even presidents are powerless to get something done. All in all my only complaints would be the healthcare benefits and IT.Was simply contracted through them, so very little direct contact through the company. No complaints.my typical day consist of arriving 10 minutes early,then receiving part in from delivery that day and storeing them away,also consoladate and filling pick orders for the next day.Benefits are not so great, but the pay is decent.  Job culture is awful, but that has to do with where this company is located, not so much the company itself.managements are very supportive and friendly through out the whole process of employment.Great people to work with and for.  Good learning experience, benefits are good, and the travel is great.  The hardest part of the job is being on the road (family members) but it works out.  Retired Army and I love working with soldiers of all branchs, makes the job a lot more enjoyable.I enjoyed working for the company. Looking for something to challenge my knowledge and ability to better myself in my career."

142,Bristol Myers Squibb,"Great compensation and benefits; many terrific employeesOne of the reasons that I loved my job with BMS is that you did not always have the typical hum drum work day. There were times when something would happen that required all hands on deck. It was awesome to work in an environment that was truly Team inspired. Also it was an employee driven atmosphere. Our managers made sure that you were exposed to any and everything that would promote you to the next level!!!!Great company and staff. It taught me how to handle customers needs with special needs. I truly had a very strong connection with the managers and supervisors... I truly loved the company.I highly recommend this company to anyone lucky enough to work there. The management is very strong. I have learned a tremendous amount in this company. It does a very large amount of things right.The company is continuously evolving. I enjoy my job but feel as though my department may be losing head count and do not feel as secure as I have for the past 10 years.Excellent company culture and fostering of professional development.  Very pleased with the friendly, collegiate work environment.Follow SOP's, personnel at all level was well trained. Great, professional atmosphere. Job activities were well coordinated between the supervisor and the operators.I have enjoyed working at BMS, I find that the teamwork and collaboration is great.  We are all part of a team and help each other.  People don't hesitate to lend a hand when asked or to share their experience.  Overall it's been a great experience; it's just that professional development can be lacking.  In my current department, it is hard to find a way to grow and develop.BMS is a company with long-standing reputation on knowledge of brand science.  Excellent training department.  Pipeline is well diversify and has the team on place to have effective product launches.Long work days due to territory size.Great management team; encouraged to think outside the boxGreat counterparts on my team.Limited product lifeThe department tried to make all persons mix together and become friends because we work in the same area, but I think is much more better not to impose the mandatory friendship.In a typical day we should start at 8, work with the CRFs and so until 13 hrs going all together to have lunch and then back to work again from 14 to 17 hrs.I learnt to use online fax and to do community work.For me it's hard to say, I had the misfortune that on my days there some of the management were out of duty for pregnancy and working abroad, so I don't have an accurate view of the general management of the department.Most of my coworkers were nice hard working persons, but besides the work we didn't share common interests. That was the hardest part of the job to be friend with person I barely knew and with no common interests. The most enjoyable part of the job were the teleconferences, it was amazing working with persons all around the world trying to make the job done in time and with quality.Great place to work. Good work ethic, personal development, opportunity to learn and grow. Very good work life balance. Industry Comparable benefits.Making a difference in the lives of people Why must I provide additional information that is none of your business.  These mandatory field requirements are ridiculousA lot to learn, limited but precise guidance, continuous performance, great co-workers, team spirit, awesome inter location communication setup, easy communication with global teams, flexible schedule.As a Territory Business Manager at BMS, each employee is responsible for managing a territory and individually creating and strengthening customer relationships. Each day, the TBM devises a schedule to achieve maximum growth for the territory. The job encompasses cold calls, planned calls, and occasionally, dinner-time appointments. Although the job is generally solitary, communication with fellow colleagues is encouraged and necessary for success in this job. BMS encourages employees to be heavily engaged in their success, but also supportive of a positive work-life balance.At BMS, I learn the root cause analysis of the non conformance events and handling CAPAS. I expose to new technologies, aseptic filling using isolator technologies.i did not want to give review but indeed is forcing to do so , , i have no reason why would indeed do that , to conclude it is good place to work , atBMS is a great company to work for.  Excellent people and team environment.  I would highly recommend anyone to work here.BMS offers a great work/life balance by allowing flexibility to work from home.  Sometimes the hours can be long but the work is rewarding in itself by allowing patients to live long healthy lives.  I was working on contract so was not eligible to receive benefits.  Management is knowledgeable on the subject matter but could sometimes have better communication skills.  Job Culture is excellent at promoting diverse skilled workforce through equal opportunity employment.Science is great, company politics not so much. Good if you are in the ""favored"" group, if not, good luck getting promoted or even getting the hired help you were promised. New people who just joined allowed to hire over people who have been here for years. I stay here because I love the science, that's about it.I have worked here for over 10 years. In that time I have had many opportunities to learn new skills and have been promoted 4 times.  I enjoy the people I work with as we all share a vision of compassionate animal care while still completing important animal research."
470,Brooks Brothers,"Needs to go public to fund growth. Allocation issues, but loyal following. Generations shop here. Quality is second to none, ties made in USA,With the retail climate it is not the time to reduce pay, take away 90% of the salesforce commission. Generally a very difficult place to work and many people leaving. I have stepped up my sales where I sell more than double the sales associate under me. I was named Senior Sales Associate due to my hourly rate was increased by eight dollars and hour.I work best when a company recognize and reward great employees and I am willing to give my best to do my job to the best of my ability.When I first was hired, BB was a great company to work for. Management changes and a poor retail environment resulted in no room for advancement, position wise as well as salary. Base salary is not based (at least for entry level) on skill/experience, but set at a specific value and isn't negotiable. Some co-workers became my best friends, other co-workers disliked me greatly and made it harder for me to do my work. No comp time for hours worked over 40, which I did often. Rarely took a lunch break- it was assumed you ate lunch at your desk. Employee discount was a huge perk.Brooks Brothers is a diversity company that gives every associate or member an opportunity to develop.You start above the minimum payment, and help to raise within your role, store and company.I enjoyed my time at Brooks Brothers I leaned business part of retail which is exciting.  Seeing product from inception to the store.Everyone needed to work well as a team in order to get goods on time.Typical day:  Answer emails, vendor questions, HK Team questions.Management: Was OK.  Co-Workers - GreatHardest part of my job- able to leave on-time.  Over-workedMost enjoyable part of my job - the people. Team envirementBrooks Brothers, has sadly, began the slow decline that so many retailers are now embracing. Associates, because they don't want salespeople anymore, are hourly, and not a very good hourly. Their seasoned staff, with books full of clients, are leaving. This is not a job to support a family, or to turn into a career. It used to be, but it just isn't that, and they're alright with that.The discount is very good, at 60% off. There is a built in client base, but that doesn't really matter, as you're not paid that way anymore. The stores are beautiful, and the product is luxurious, but the expectation of management, and the customer, of you, the associates, is no longer worth the money they're paying. If you want a good job, to make some money while in college, or to bridge yourself between jobs, no a bad gig, especially for the discount.Brooks Brothers is a company that continues to challenge its associates on a daily basis. A typical day in the assistant manager position involves ensuring day to day operations are met as well as surpassing sales goals. Through this company I've learned exceptional interpersonal skills and management styles that are imperative to running a successful business.The day usually begins with a meeting on Results, Execution, Performance, and Preparations (REPP). Over the years, I have learned how to provide excellent services to our diverse clients. Being reliable and efficient at all times. The management is very focused on building a ""great place to work"", putting smile on the face of all our clients, and meeting our targets. Co-workers are made up of people with diverse features but I enjoy working with them.Management is great. Easiest job I've ever had but is boring most of the time. Spend 90% of the time standing around with nothing to do.overall this is a great company and a great place to work, there are some things that need to be enhanced like every other job, but other then that management cares about their employees, and everyone is always willing to help each otherCompany has found ways to weed out associates who had been the backbone of the organization for years and kept generations coming through the door. Co-workers had their share of ups and downs including no more commission but try and work together for the most part.Like most warehouse work, the day is long and repetitive. The actual work isn't vert physically demanding though. I was trained in various duties, such as using scanners and operating forklifts. The management is very poor. Section Leaders are lazy and irritable, and upper management is very out of touch.Most co-workers are very friendly and helpful, but a large number speak little to no English. The hardest part of the day is the unrewarding work and low pay, but the people you work with might just make the day more enjoyable.The day to day workings of Brooks Brothers is just like any other retailer.  You help customers find what they are looking for; you process shipment; you help train any associates on areas that they might need a little help in; you work with the team to reach goal reach day.  What I have learned from here and from other retail jobs I have had it is about the people/team.  You need to find a good balance between a fun work place and a place where work comes first.  Part of that is knowing your team and knowing how to motivate them properly, however you need to set standards and expectations that are equal across the board. For me the hardest part of that balance is making sure the fun happens and that it is not just all work.  In the end the no matter how hard the work is or how difficult the customers might be, the people you work with make the job.  Our job really is people; how to motivate, personalize, sell too, or help out.  That is what I have learned as a manager and I think it has made me a better leader.Great owner, managment team and people,,associates are treated more like family than employees. I would recomend Brooks Brothers to anyone looking for a career in retailManagement and higher ups are used to doing things are certain way and are unwilling to change with the times. There is a lack of organization that needs to be worked on within departments.Brooks Brothers is a company that allows to interact and serve customers in an excellent manner.I truly enjoy selling, however with recent management chance and shrink rate, there has been alot of changes and with co-workers leaving the job and taking medical leaves and absences there has been toll on the remaining employees. With the amount of work and scheduled timing the pay rate isn't worth the effort.Overall, it is truly a great organization that hold amazing values, I love the clients and our products best.This place is ok because it can give you multi-task opportunity of working experience, and the shoppers from all over the world would make you see many aspect of personality in many people. Also, it would practice your skill of teamwork.this is a great company to work for except the general manager gets away with harassment and discrimination. no team work or upper mobility. you live on a island when you work for this company because they only see what they want to see....A typical day at work consists of keeping the store stocked and up to visual standards, shipping out any orders that have been placed, reaching out to customers, and above all providing exceptional customer service to everyone that walks in the door.  Management is fair, and willing to answer any questions.  They will not go out of their way to help you with everything---you are required to think for yourself.  Co-workers are someof the best friends I have.  We are a tight knit crowd.  The hardest part of the job is getting business in a mall that is failing.  The most enjoyable part is making a difference in a customers personal and professional life.Great company to work for. All of my coworkers are amazing people and fun to work with. Beautiful product to work with and the clients are usually pleasant to work with. Technology wise the company is pretty outdated.I enjoyed my time at Brooks Brothers I leaned business part of retail which is exciting. Seeing product from inception to the store.Everyone needed to work well as a team in order to get goods on time."
570,ByteCubed,"The company is still young and it can be seen in the management and employees, but the company will do what they can to go the distance. Not the greatest in employee development, more like trial and error, but the staff and the management are 100% supportive."
564,"C2 Solutions Group, Inc.","Fun place to work with supportive co workers, helping each other produce quality work. Some delays,but always manage to get the work done.There was various tasks that needed to be accomplished but such a laid back enviornment you didnt mind having to go the extra mile some times."
98,C3 Energy,"the company certainly have big leaders and whole lot of talented people, but it also gives no mercy or have low tolerance of non-genius people or a path that doesn't meet the leaders' scopeCulture and direction changed post acquisition.Most enjoyable part of my day was playing ping pong and working with teammates on the marketing team. Hardest part of my job was disagreeing with direction of the marketing and product construct."
304,CA Technologies,"Too many layers of management that are greatly disjointed from the overall teams.  Poor communication and no training=stress.  Lots of it.  Constant change. Unrealistic goals and  strategies.   GREAT people and culture, though.  Flexible schedule is admirable makes for better production.Love CA Technologies and their work/life balance. You do not accrue vacation or sick time so time off is subject to manager approval. A good manager will allow plenty of time off. Finance department has half day Fridays over the summer (Memorial day - Labor day).CA is not growing and retention rates are high so opportunities to advance are limited.Everyday was busy -- negotiating contracts with outside clients, reviewing, writing and closing large software deals.  Constantly learning new information through research and dialogue with stakeholders.  My co workers were absolutely great -- very supportive. We worked well as a team.  Hardest part of the job, or should I say challenging part of the job was finalizing a contract to the satisfaction of the client and bringing value to the deal. The most enjoyable part of the job was working and negotiating the deal in order to finalize a good contract between the parties.Overall an average place to work. Sometimes felt that there was just enough work to keep everyone occupied but not enough down time to develop better ways to make things run smoother. The environment is, at times, hostile. This place is not for the thin-skinned. There is a serious lack of training materials provided by the management.Wonderful experience, great people, great people development, great W2 potential, huge customer base, wonderful resources, unbelievable Club Trip destinations, leverage points galore to make business happen.I have worked with better,  more caring people, but very seldom.From the day I hired on they made me feel like family.  I would still be there today if the management (which had just changed just before I was layed off) would have done their homework to see what I did.  The amount of money they saved by laying me off pailed in comparison to the money they invested in my training.The working environment is structured in more of the standard office cubicle layout than other typical software companies in Silicon Valley. Had lots of virtual meetings.The management team has a very clear vision, the company is constantly changing to meet this vision.The team I work with are great professionals and always willing to help.Work and life balance is very good as long as you plan ahead there should be no issues at all !!The only way to advance at CA is to self-promote and manage up.  Workers who keep their heads down and get the job done are routinely overlooked, overworked and taken for granted.Great place to work with lots of opportunities to advance. Large company with great benefits, including 5 weeks of paid time off to start. Layoff every year to weed out poor performers.Very fun culture, preaching hard and dedicated work that is incentivized by casual Friday bagels, quarter beer o'clock Thursdays, and company wide awareness projects. The sales atmosphere has a very high turnover rate, due to constant change to sales strategy. (Some people around the office joked about  CA meaning ""Change Always""). Management is mediocre at best, promoting leaders that are not necessarily competent, but are noticed by top management (who are not around often enough to see the actual day-to-day employee work ethic).Ability to make a lot of money - no cap on commission up to 35,000 on top of salary, which is definitely a blessing.Internal promotion is a possibility as long as you (once again) get noticed by top management. In this environment, networking trumps competence any day.Co-workers are great, friendly and helpful.While at CA, I learned several different programs; policies and communication skills. The hardest part of my job was dealing with a team located in different time zones. The best part of my job is the people I work with.I started working at CA Technologies as an intern right out of college. I always felt welcome amongst my team and was given the opportunity to take on new tasks and responsibilities rapidly. This definitely helped me grow in my career, and I got to me some excellent people on the way. However, I have my doubts about the company's long term vision and every year there is the threat of layoffs. CA Technologies gave me an excellent foundation to continue my career as a software engineer.CA Technologies is undergoing a tremendous transformation since the acquisition of Rally Software. The business is being significantly more innovative and proactively engaging it's employees for feedback.I consider CA  great place to work, and believe it is good choice for most people.There's great job security here and I love what I do.  They give you a lot of opportunity to grow as a person and in respect to your professional career.  Everyone is super nice and has the up-most respect for one another - very collaborative workplace.Great Work Environment, They have an site montessori daycare and gym. You'll learn a vast knowledge of different software that they develop and supportMore training would benefit employees and managers.Everyone is pleasant to work with but very seriousQuiet atmosphereNot run as a technology company.  Too many layers of management.   A collaborative environment where everyone is looking out for themselves.No vision in technology. Focused on old mainframe run rate business.I learned first hand  the duties of a Security Operations analyst. I learned how to handle different alerts and asking for help when I was stuck. Management and the team members are great and helped when they can.Days are busy with many different responsibilities to attend too.There is a constant influx of new technology and ideas to better the workplace.Stressful place to work. Moving up is difficult and management is old school. Typical corporate machine. Frequent and grueling over time, but depending on the group you are in you are usually rewarded that time back."
267,Cabot Corporation,"Cabot is a leading specialty chemical and materials firm.  As such, it is highly dependent upon the ""value add"" proposition gaining traction to the customer.  This business model, when applied universally, translates to better margins especially in growth markets seeking more efficient product solutions.  However, in a stagnant World economy as we are currently experiencing, customer decisions shift to overweight economics compared to value.  This paradigm will over time lead to purchasing decisions being viewed as more commodity based especially in price sensitive markets such as energy.  In a Technically based Sales function, proving the efficacy of one product versus the other is difficult.  Especially when the customer views minor points of differentiation between your offered material and the competitors product as minor and has data to prove it.  It becomes a price and service competition with price being the key entry and decision point.  We struggled to compete on price as it ran counter to our business model.  Unfortunately, the market does not discriminate toward models and eventually reaches equilibrium.  This led to major conflicts internally culminating in Operational Cost cutting.  This required massive lay offs.Unless you fit in with the click or do non company things you will not work there. I worked there for almost 2 years and trust me Cabot is not all what it seems. I did not my work to the best of ability and was not enough,Cabot is a great company to work for. My skills were utilized and I felt challenged everyday.The people made the job enjoyable. All levels interact directly and there is advancement available in most departments.I learned more about Accounts Payable at Cabot which put me in a ""super users"" category using the JD Edwards finance system. With this knowledge I was able to train new employees on the system and help when needed.The hardest part of the job was the inconsistent workload.Event planning was also a job task that I enjoyed. Several times/year there were large meetings and events planned at our site that required customization and attention to details. This was the ""fun"" part of my job.Cabot has a family environment that is casual and easy to work within.  We are a small group that has overlapping duties.  It is challenging but rewarding.Overnight travel 50%  large region, 25-30% administrative work, Selling premium product in a very price competitive market.  Good customer relationships.Each day you were extremely dirty and it was unavoidable. The pay was great and some of the job duties were easy. In the end they laid off a lot of people for poor financial decisions.Managed entirely from Corporate. Lots of politics and posturing for appearances with no accountability for results at the top. Financial games lead to misleading financial results. Systems are obsolete and inadequate. Not a good place to work.Typical day involves a twelve hour rotating  shift with four crews working four days then off four day.  After four days off the day crew switches to nights with the night crew switching to days.Setting up and building new process development assemblies. Applying electronic-data collection and interpretation.I was able to improve my understanding of LabView programming, learned JMP software, executing DOE for multiple experiments.Supportive management but company having problems.  They are currently laying people off due to hard times.  They have treated me fair.A typical work day is spent chasing around what its corporate office wants---and there is no questioning them. Collaboration is non-existent in many areas, with individual skills existing in a vacuous environment. Cabot is a reactive not proactive company when it comes to investing in their people. Promotions and the limited training they have are catered to building its external image and gaining positive employer ratings. Lastly, unlike most companies today, bonuses only apply to management, especially its executive team.A typical day is either being bored out of your mind or work at a very fast pace. You could have 20 things that need to be accomplished in an hour to having 0 things to do all twelve hours. I have tried to become more proficient at time management. The management here is alright. My crew we all work as a team, so this is good. The hardest part of the job is not having enough people to do the job. This company follows the less is more style of tactics. The most enjoyable part of the job is the days off.fun place to work, group lunches, and casual business attire. paid holidays. Big company that cares about its employees and growth.Just a job, morale is low and I am told it has been for years. work schedule is long and being on call while on a long off is not a plus.Working for Cabot has allowed me to develop the skills and knowledge I possess today to be a successful Buyer. Management provides ongoing support and guidance. Overall culture is positive and nurturing.I worked at their production plant since 2008. Very busy and friendly environment when theres jobs. The company says they invest in their employees and help them grow in the company but not so much when me amd a couple other individuals that worked their as long as i have. I applied for multiple positions within the company to advance my skills but they ended up hiring someone from the outside. Would only go back if they hired me direct thru the company and up my pay rate to $40 per hour. Wasted 5 years of my life there.•Manager of a team in support of all manufacturing processes.  •Supports and trains Group Leaders/Team Members in all essential functions and skill sets as required effectively operating and continually improving their processes.  •Responsible for the work flow in their area of operation. Leads the team in safe and effective execution of production plans using a structured lean work and management system. •This includes leading effective response to abnormal conditions, leading problem-solving activities to obtain sustainable standards, and supporting continuous improvement efforts in their area.Cabot is a global manufacturer of specialty chemicals, with more than 40 manufacturing plants worldwide.  It is headquartered in Boston, in the Seaport District.  The company has been in business for approximately 130 years.The company produces carbon black, activated carbon, fumed silica, and a variety of other products.  Carbon black accounts for at least 75% of their revenues, activated carbon and silica account for almost all the rest.  These are commodity products, meaning they must product large volumes to earn profits.  They are at a fundamental disadvantage to some of their competitors, which are far larger and better capitalized.  Nevertheless, the company maintains relatively strong market positions.Cabot owes its success to a commitment to being superior to their competitors in engineering and R&D.  Unfortunately, the current management does not seem to value this nearly as much as their predecessors.  They have made a series of mistakes in acquisitions and divestments, which have put their viability in some jeopardy.Cabot is a very nice place to work in many ways, they pay well, and you can learn a great deal about business life there.  But there is a constant state of tension there.  People seem to get fired on a continuous basis.  The management is very anxious to promote their values in their words but their actions don't often match their words.The best part about Cabot were the benefits. The work was dull and a few of the people ruined the feeling of it being a good place to work. I would only recommend Cabot to people who are willing to deal with the hierarchy and really really really want to work with materials. Assist members of the Transportation Team in acquiring freight rates and booking shipments with carriers Ensure that there is a current freight rate entered in JD Edwards for all upcoming shipments Review daily Order Reports to identify new shipments and changes made to delivery times or locations of current shipments Maintain good relationships with carriers and coworkers in order to deliver excellent customer servicegreat company to work for, very flexible, works with you needs. interested in what you want to do in the future within the company.

Employee advancement rests in the individual.  Your high level of success at CACI is directly tied to your skills and dedication and the opportunities provided for career growth.I Typed documents such as correspondence, drafts, memos, and emails, and prepared 3 reports weekly for management. I Opened, sorted, and distributed incoming messages and correspondence. I Purchased and maintained office supply inventories, and being careful to adhere to budgeting practices. I Greeted visitors and determined to whom and when they could speak with specific individuals and I Recorded, transcribed and distributed minutes of meetingsCACI so far has been a stable employer.  It is a good place to start your career.  I do recommend this company.  You are not tied to your work 24/7.Full of blowhards and suck ups. Promotions are based on ability to suck maximum bottom since no real work is ever completed. If you are good at pretending to work and staring at a computer for hours this might be the job for you. Spending time interning for a panhandler would be a better use of time.The setting was relax and fun. You know what you job i and what your goals are everyday. Management sometime was up and down but was willing to working on fixing the problem to the ensure a better workplace.Working for the CACI I was very productive and learned a lot while working in the position.While working in my position I learned a lot on the jobI started with CACI not that long ago. I love the environment. It  feels like everyone is trying to help you.  Great benefits and good healthcare. Overall one the best places I ever worked for.GIS processing with plenty of opportunities for additional training.  Pleasant environment with lots of opportunity for advanced training at college on online.I liked working here for the most part - the people were great and had lots of institutional support and even the benefits were above average. There is much to do within the company for someone who wants to learn new things. It is a major governmental contractor with 14,000 employees or thereabouts. However due the vagaries of the government-contract world most of the office was laid off or furloughed without any notice. We had been expecting years' worth of work but it did not come come to fruition. I do not blame CACI for this necessarily - it could very well have been the fault of another contractor - but in my particular realm of CACI jobs can be on the insecure side."

Biggest issue is complacency among veteran employees. Enjoyed working there and saw opportunity for advancement when I went looking for it. Opportunity for overtime and to set yourself apart from others was pretty prominent while I was there although it comes in waves.Team members in my current project is great.They help to understand the complexity of the client systems.Management only provide need to know information.Hardest part is the uncertainty at the end of fiscal year, don't know if the contract is funded.  Raise of last 2 years is around 1% or 1.5%.Most enjoyable part of this project is the flexibility to work from home sometimes.You will find an extremely professional work environment with friendly people. They offer great benefits, and you can also have a life outside of work. The only negative thing is the lack of job security since most of the jobs or positions are based on contracts that can end at any moment.Working with CACI was a pleasure. Working there I learned how to properly input data information, how to check others work, and how to scan information into the system. After working there for 2yrs the hardest part was being under a new manager and instead of being praised/awarded for all the hard work you put in your fired instead. (however i doubt that manager is still there).The company took over the contract and immediately began removal of experience personnel - after flooding the environment with new people. Very inexperienced personnel.Good Education opportunities.Better compensation would be a good addition.Expatriation is a good addition to the contract.Greater opportunity to engage with management.CACI takes care of their employees.  Even as a contractor, they attempt to do all they can to retain good employees.  Work is always busy.  There is more than enough to go around working as a government contractor.  My management is excellent! Easy to work with, and expects you to take lead when necessary.Their benefits are goodGreat company to work for the only problem was that pay is low. But the benefits are good and the management was good. I would work for them again. Really enjoyed the balance of work and family there.First time working as a contractor after 30 years of military service.  Great experience.  Working alongside other employees who work for different contacting companies, it is clear that CACI is among the best.I started with CACI not that long ago. I love the environment. It  feels like everyone is trying to help you.  Great benefits and good healthcare. Overall one the best places I ever worked for.Excellent company with excellent benefits.  Everyone was willing to solve any issues within a timely manner.  Upper management:  "" Kudos "".CACI employs some great people, but the management at the corporate and business unit level is lacking. The performance-based raise system is an absolute joke.Caci was my first company to work for.They were an excellent organization and they took care of their personnel as well, great company.A good company and program to work for, overall good environment for warehouse and supply chain employees with great health insurance and company benefits.I had the great pleasure to work for this great company for 2 years. Excellent project managers, excellent HR, excellent directors, good play, good benefits.CACI is a great company, I actually love working here, the environment is peaceful and the people are really nice. They truly care about you having a life outside of work, They will work with you to take care of your family and personal needs.CACI is a big defense contractor in Virginia. They possess many contracts for the Navy. However, as a contractor, they tend not to do much new development work, at least at the location I am at. Most of my work has either been maintenance, making small changes to the system, or IA security. The only time I actually felt like I learned anything valuable was when I was loaned out to the Database team. In that situation I picked up on some PL-SQL. The management has very poor planning abilities and does not assign appropriate timeframes to complete assignments, usually overallocating very simple tasks, and assigning few hours for important ones, while pressing hard to follow the schedule for the sake of Earned Value.The workforce is a mix of retired military and civilian; so interaction and social environment is very favorable.  At the co-worker level you are practically family, which makes the work and life manageable.However, the company is growing at the time I'm writing this and is changing direction.The new mood of management is to promote young and headstrong types.  Those that are content with being on the low end are being weeded out slowly.Another note: Since this is a contract company, job security is not guaranteed unless you are lucky enough to still be around after the first 3-5 years.  It's not the company's fault, its just the budgets of the contracts."

123,California Pacific Medical Center,"It was great working with other health care professionals and learning how to work in a team setting but also independently.Busy and productive, very organized organisation.  I love the population we serve and am proud to give quality care.There is room to grow in the organization.California Pacific Medical Center is a great place to work at. The manager was really nice and professional. This was my first job as a HIM clerk and it gave a lot of experience.I grew up being and RN in the Newborn Intensive Care Unit. I proposed and implemented many changes with the goal of providing the best care possible to the infants in the NICU and their parents. I proposed written care plans that were to be manintained and updated as an ongoing process for the babies and their parents so that other nurses who came in could refer to the care plan and know the central problems and processes being done for the infant and parents. I proposed primary care nursing for the infants, so taht one nurse could be in charge of their care and get to know the parents, establising a bond and trust with the mothers ad fathers. I proposed a more humane treatment plan for babies dying in the unit that included the grieving parents' needs. I proposed a committee to provide a forum for nurses and doctors to collaborate on patients' care and meeting parent's needs. I worked on the Policy and Procedure Committee writing new policies for nurses to follow. I was in charge of 10-12 nurses, managing the NICU at night, when fewer doctors were available. I was also in charge during the day, managing a busy NICU. I went on transports, bringing new babies to our unit from outlying hospitals. I learned how to manage difficult prople during the most difficult times in their lives. I helped mothers and fathers be parents in a inhospitable environment. I thoroughly enjoyed my work, especially as a primary care nurse, working with mothers everyday, helping to care for sick term and preterm infants. The biggest challenge for me was making sure the babies and their families were  more... treated humanely and that all nurses recognized and respected their right to be there and their need for each other during their hospitalization. I was inspired by my own experience as a working mother with four sons and a husband at home. Balancing all this was difficult but rewarding and gratifying. I learned much that could be applied to life, to running a business, especially to customer service and satisfaction.  lessTypical day was recruiting study participants and coordinating research studys. I have learned the importance of continuing to deliver high quality customer care.My co-workers work as a team.Answer phones and operate a switchboard.Route calls to specific people.Answer inquiries about company.Greet visitors warmly and make sure they are comfortable.Call persons waiting for visitor and book them a room to meet in.Schedule meetings and conference rooms.Make coffee and set out food.Ensure reception area is tidy.Coordinate mail flow in and out of office.Coordinate office activities.Handle phone calls from people calling in sick.Gather personal and insurance information.Hand out employee applications.Arrange appointments.Cash out people when necessary.Validate parking tickets.Give visitors badges and direct them to where they can sign in.Issue parking passes.Send email and faxes.Collect and distribute parcels and other mail.Perform basic bookkeeping, filing, and clerical duties.Prepare travel vouchers.Take and relay messages.Update appointment calendars.Schedule follow-up appointments.Is a good good place to work. benefits little expensive at this company , is always under a new management. that's all.nothing else to say for now.I did word processing with a 24 hour turn around of medical reports.  I worked in the Pediatric Pulmonary and Cystic Fibrosis Center for 4 years as a full time employee.  I answered the phones, did all the filing, handled the mail and set up emergency hospitalizations at the end of the day at California Pacific Medical Center.I love working here. I love the People, I ve learned so much from working here.  The co-workers have been very helpful in making my work experience very pleasent.At the time, there was much to work out at CPMC. I'm sure by now much has been changed and improved. At the time, everything was poorly managed but I hear it is better now.My workplace is a wonderful place to work at, with competitive and skilled nurses and doctors.  The ability to participate in healthcare policy and executive management gives employees ownership and stewardship.Busy work schedule...had to work all shifts....no time to learn...emergency department was always packed with peopleI enjoyed my job at CPMC  tremendously . it paved my way to stay in oncology nursing . The staff and support was fabulous they were a 23 bed  medical surgical oncology unit.I joy servicing the public. And making a difference  in the work environment, I find it rewarding and challenging  with the help of team work.Worked for 27 years at CPMC in outpatient surgery. Very fast paced challenging environment. The outpatient surgery center has had a census from 25 to 55 pts per day. I found working with surgical patients in this environment to be extremely rewarding. I developed many skills that facilitated smooth patient admission and recovery.I love working for this company as I always feel supported by management and other staff. Everyone there is super friendly and very educated in a supportive and fun loving way. Patients that come in feeling ill leave with a great sense of hope.Management Pits department against department and employee against employee.  Middle management is disposable.  The hardest part of the job is not becoming part of the culture of this facility.  The job of upper management is to keep their jobs.I worked with this company for years and I enjoyed working with them. I was sadden to have left the company and hope to find a new position with them again. Great people and great overall environment.Worked per diem.  Staff is highly professional and maintain strict standards.  The working environment is clearly a culture of safety.A typical day as a Discharge Specialist at California Pacific Medical Center would consist of many responsibilities.  The day would start by going to interdisciplinary rounds to discuss which patients would be discharging for the day.  I would work with nurse case managers, social workers, and doctors to identify any needs or barriers for discharge.  It was very much a team approach to work toward a common goal.Most enjoyable part was Clinical Research and working with patients."
563,Canon,"canon was a great place to work at wish i could have worked longer. I love my department the warehouse was clean. the food was amazing i just loved everything about it.- Great work atmosphere- Great career opportunity- Great benefits- Great people to work with- Competitive salary- Enjoy working with global customersGood environment Great place to work, excellent benefits. Lot's of opportunities to move to different areas. Indoors.A typical day included confirmation of prior pending sales. Approval of pending credit claims and marketing program claims. Review of specialty area items. Verify emails regarding orders. Correcting or verifying status of order. Respond to dealer, sales or management inquiries. Work on processing returns and documenting conditions and response for approval or denial. Forecasting current sales with potential for meeting designated goals. Submitting trending reports. Completing presentations. Participating in team meetings.This is a great place to work if in need of a job.  Good schedules to choose from, great benefits, laid back culture. The customers called in for ""technical assistance"".  Most were nice. Company goals are very attainable.My only complaint is lack of advancement opportunities which is common with call centers & starting pay is a little low.outstanding, learned a lot, there was a repetition of taking pictures all the time. enjoy with the pay raise was great and the people.Great company, too bad they are moving. I love working here and love the hours and the people. I would recommend this company to anyone who is looking for a career in a different state.Excellent company to work for, professional environment, good benefits. Logistics operations were relocated to their headquarters in New York.Great Canon. Tell you what you need to do to achieve goals. Pay is the only reason why I am wanting to leave but benefits such as health are very good. Atmosphere is nice. Everyone is nice.Do not apply unless you ""NEED"" a job. There is no room for advancement. They do not pay well. Their vacation is horrible. Management does not communicate with employees. The benefits are not good either stay away from this company.there are opportunities to advance quickly with this company and the employees are a little spoiled with a cafe and gym in the building plus a masseuse that comes every other month. management and co-workers were easy to get along with. the biggest con for me is the work, I didn't perform well in a call center environment and there's a lot of phrases that the company wants employees to use on a call and will penalize employees who does not use them. also few bathroom breaks allowed.Good people to work with. You answer incoming calls from customers all day, so of course you will face the basic downsides of working at a call center.  Other than that, they will train you, have good benefits, and it is very hard to get hired from there.  Sometimes it feels good to help customers out, other times it is hard to deal with them.  Management is good. The raises are not that much, but they do give them to you every year.If your desperate and need the job then go for it. Plenty good people there.If you have a family to support then the wage is under the family goal. Unless managers get way more but I dont think its all that much. A lot have stayed and a lot have gone that I knew. This is either family or dont have. Dont forget floor compliance's as with every other call center your gauged more on a minute than how well you kept a customer. If your day consist of you having to do family doctor visits, or lets just say important rolls outside the job. If you explain it to HR they give you some room to do so with good cause. A + for Canon there. Everyone is great to work with and management are not really to blame. They are hovered everyday about someone or changing something.Canon is a great company with a household name in the technology industry.  Good compensation package.  Salary and Commission.Instructed employee's and temp staff of daily needs. Worked with NY for required work and completion dates. Processed all reports including all contact with temp agencies time keeping and payroll information. Worked with packaging venders to create new packaging when needed for projects. Created a Rebox Department and this saves millions of dollars each year as this process is now in the VA facility. Hardest part of job was getting enough temps to complete job requirements to meet all required completion and ship dates. Fun part was designing my own floor plans and stations to run projects.Over all great but top management direction not always clear and decision making can take a long time. Mixed culture environment great but at times causes conflict in the way of business processes.Working at Canon USA is working for a Japanese company.  The culture is evident and it is difficult to navigate.  80% of the work is done by 20% of the employees.  If you work hard and do good, your reward is more work.  If you do nothing and make mistakes, you will just be given less responsibility but these people remain at the company.  I have had friends ask for referrals and I pushed them in the opposite direction.Not a very progressive corporate culture for a company with technology at its core.Canon is a place where you will meet a great number of people from different cultures.  They are a strong technology company but could improve on how their management mentor's people in developing to become successful.- 9-5 job- I have learned a lot of useful skill with Exel and PowerPoint. I have learned to corporate with disatified customers. Pro multitasker. - Overall corporate management is poor. I got along well with my supervisor and boss.- Co-workers are friendly.- The hardest part of my job are the busy season (during the gov't fiscal year)- The most enjoyable part of my job is completeing a task that I could file away and move on from.The job was great.  My favorite job I have ever had as far as the work day goes.  Your day is busy but you they make sure you take your breaks and the day goes by so fast because of it being busy.  A typical day consists of processing lots of packages to deliver to VISA employees as you work at a Visa office that has thousands of VISA employees.  You then deliver the packages and assist with shipping out packages as well.I had a strange American boss who reported to a Japanese boss who would not address the strangeness of his management. He micromanaged and ALWAYS took people's work and edited himself since he had major OCD issues. Again they were not dealt with !"

571,Capital One,"Answered inbound calls and helped customers apply for healthcare loans. Provided information to Dr offices with status of loans and paper work they may need. Transferred customers to correct department such verification, sales, etc.. Dealing with irate office on check that should of arrived days ago. Or maybe an office that wanted to sign up but did not meet qualifications to do so. Another depressing part was letting customer know they were not approved for the loan. Had pizza parties once month for setting goals on productivity. Won gifts on raffles such Christmas parties and they also gave my kids gifts for Christmas.Working at Capital One Bank has been an amazing experience for me. I have been in a fast paced teller role, at times alone, working through pressure effectively and efficiently all while have a great conversation with the customer. I've been a Relationship Banker where I build lasting financial relationships to help the customer short and long term. I've been in leadership roles where I lead the team successfully, perform duties, and make executive decisions on a Branch Manager level. Although sometimes the hours can be rough, I enjoy every bit of it.Before accepting a management position with this bank, I was warned by industry colleagues about this banks culture and lack of advancement and nepotism.  Well, I took the chance and found that it was true.  Upper management will only promote their friends or hire them with no experience to the role.  Most advancements are for upper leaderships close confidants. Senior Managers are clueless with the department they manage and out of touch of the daily grind.  The company offers great benefits and PTO's and the company sponsored events are great.  Overall, if you are over 40 yrs. old, you will feel unease since they will change the department and create confusion to all associates and will be laid off.

There are people here who share the same passion and as one team the dream of having superior customer service internally and externally becomes a reality daily.  My favorite part of the job is my daily interaction with people, I really enjoy pouring into people and giving them the tools they need to succeed.  I have learned that hard work, determination, and and consistency are the keys to being successful.  Creating impactful moments is something want to do everyday because its those moments that matter the most and help the company grow.I cannot say enough about the company and the leadership. My three years with Capital One were a blend of positive working relationships, professional development and personal growth. Work life balance made it possible for me to enjoy the fruits of my labors. Long days were not uncommon, but there was always someone there right alongside you to support or lead as needed. Great management team, solid benefits and a fun work environment!Job satisfaction and advancement are largely within your own control.  You must be aggressive, declarative and go after what you want.  The office environment is pleasant, convenient and has lots of perks -- onsite gym, bank, copy facility, health facility, pharmacy.  They provide shuttle service to other buildings.  The culture is spotty...some teams are great and others are disastrous.  This has a lot to do with your individual leader.  They encourage participation in outside organizations, pursuit of additional training and education and have a generous compensation program.  Overall, this is one of the best places I have ever worked.A typical day is taking inbound banking inquiries such as transferring funds and offering beneficial products to customers. Not that much management around since they are constantly changing. There was an awesome co- worker atmosphere, the hardest part was the poor work/life balance. They said that I would not have to close for more than sixth months, but it has been over ten months. The most enjoyable part was making the calls fun and interacting with the customers on a more personable level.A typical day is spent working with my team on a variety of interesting and challenging projects.  Management has been very good in helping us learn new skills and make our team stronger. The recent transition to becoming a ""technology company"" has forced us to learn a lot of new things relating to cloud computing and also how to implement a suitable DevOps model in a very short period of time.  I couldn't ask for a better team.  Everyone on my team is smart and we enjoying learning from each other.  We also mentor one another and there are no ""domain experts"" within the team.The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the massive amount of work that has to be done with very few people doing the work.The most enjoyable part of my job is working on new things and trying out new technologies.  The company is very good in giving us the freedom to branch out and experiment.From day to day, the job is pretty consistent. On the phone servicing high value credit card customers. I work a ten hour day. In my history with capital one there have been many focus sessions on handling different types of customers, ways to change your communication style etc to help you excel to the very best of your ability. The hardest part of the job is the monotony. Though the culture is always changing, quality assurance expectations, incentive changes, etc, at the end of the day the job is still the same and can grow tiring. The things I enjoy most are the people and the extras. We have team outings quarterly, snack carts, merchandise, and competitions to keep things lively and interesting. The benefits are also phenomenal.Offer great work life balance.  Decent benefits.Fairly competitive salary.  Onsite gym and medical office in some locations.  Too many organizational changes and redeployments within Technology. Your bonus will be based on how strong your manager will present your skills against others - so hope for a manager who will fight for you.... Very difficult to be promoted as each department is only allowed so many promotions per year.Working for one of the Best Places to Work in a Banking culture, full benefits and a progressive attitude was a great opportunity to have. Exceptional training, mentoring, advancement and bonuses to truly make a great salary too.High stress environment, bilingual incoming calls, resolving escalated issues for customers and being empowered to arrive at real solutions in a one call scenario. Great work environment.COAF is really a great company to work for. They work hard to keep morale high and really recognize and compensate you for your hard work. My only issue, is that you are reprimanded for things outside of your control (ie a customer cannot or will not pay). Other than that, I highly recommend this company. Not just for employment but for services, too.It was an absolute pleasure to work at Capital One. I have nothing negative to say. Working with my co-workers was a wonderful experience. Most of management was very supportive and available when I needed them. The best part of the job was helping a customer overcome challenges and giving them hope. I've learned to trust my own abilities from my experiences working here.While at Capital One I was able to learn all of the skills that I possess today.  I wrote policies and procedures, assisted with third party agencies to audit financial transactions, and work with internal employees to resolve account issues.  Worked out of Excel and Word on a daily basis.  Created PowerPoint presentation to give to all levels of management.  Answer and return calls in a timely manner and reply to department specific emails.Working here was amazing. Knowing the customer by name and having conversations that where not only about there transactions but also about personal life. Management cared about employee's opinion and worked hard to satisfy their needs. The hardest part was having to leave the company to continue school. The most enjoyable part of working for this company was the overall experience being around management, coworkers, and customers.This is by far the best company I have ever worked for. The atmosphere in our whole building is just friendly and welcoming. Of course there is always one or two bad apples, but for the most part everyone is a pleasure! There are so many opportunities for advancement and growth. Scheduling is extremely flexible and they give a good balance between personal life and work. The Las Vegas site even has an on site health center! I had to leave the company to relocate and unfortunately they do not have a call center where I'm headed, but if I ever return I would definitely reapply!A typical day at work consists of customer service through our call center.  Each call is personal and has its own impact.  I have learned to think outside the box and really put myself into the shoes of the customer as a call center representative.  Leadership is great here and truly ensure you are doing the best you can.  My co-workers make the day go by with conversation and the atmosphere is very comfortable. The hardest part of my job is a dissatisfied customer. I strive to make sure every customer feels valued, so when one is upset after we disconnect it impacts me on a personal level. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I know that I have changed the mood of an upset card holder from a company detractor to a company promoter.Very enjoyable and energetic environment both on campus and  off.  Ratings for compensation and benefits plus security and advancement do not apply as I was a consultant.  Salary rates paid to consultants are very competitive if not more so than other financial institutions or employers for the level of skill required and experience across multiple platforms.Very flexible work environment with the ability for 100% remote work as on-site is not required for firewall administration, design, etc. except in the event of a failure.  Co-workers and management were always available for assistance when needed in order to help the employee and organization succeed in desired goals.A great company to work for if you can get into the right location.  There are a lot of benefits presented by the company, such a tuition reimbursement but managers tend to not like working with students.  The company promotes something but it's not enforced by management which is why it can be a great job if you can get in with good management.Capital One was a pleasurable experience for the most part. They ask a lot but compensate well with salary, bonus, and amazing benefits package that includes not only 401(k) but investments as well! My experience was in a call center. It was fairly laid back although it felt like high school most days due to the lack of maturity exhibits by some associates and most notably management. As my first corporate experience out of college, I learned that you have to stay on top of your stuff in every aspect if you want to move forward. You have to take charge of your future and if one person says ""no"", keep asking people until you get the answer you seek or find out how to change that ""no"" to a ""yes""."
395,Cardno,"Working alongside environmental company as an outside consultant recording observations, samples and specimens gathered in fieldwork. As the lead field researcher I created project timelines, ensured the quality of the data, managed communications from the work group to the project manager, supervised fieldwork and trained support staff.Neglect to raises. Hire on people with very little experience at a higher pay than people who actually know what they are doing. 1 day notice prior to out of town travel if you are lucky.I had a good supervisor and i managed to travel to many places on construction & site review.  Good place to work.  My departmement has been eliminated due to oil field cutbacks.  Cardno/PPI has decided to get out of the engineering construction business and sold this portion of the company to a senior officer and the division will now focus on deep foundations only.good people great place to work nice office, great location with good shopping. very flexible schedule, get to work from home at least a few times a week.Extremely chaotic and disjointed. Heavy internal focus at the expense of actually serving the client. This company has been going through a lot of change for quite some time now. If you are looking for a stable environment, this is not the place.Great place to work, and a lot of educational classes and web teachings. Company cares for workers education and knowledgeIt was a nice place to work, however not enough work and easy layoff's.

Co-Workers - learned to work well with my co workers to accomplish a task we wouldn't be able to complete otherwise. Hardest part of the job - Picking up other peoples slack and having to do work they should've already done. Most enjoyable part - Being able to work without people constantly questioning my decisions and expertise.Nice place to work great befits high priority on safety hours can be long Co workers are great a lot of trivial very fast pacedThis was the worst company I have ever been a part of. They don't care about their employees, they are unorganized and they don't know how  to leadThe work can be interesting and the people are friendly.  The management is 100% focused on short-term profit, hounding employees to remain billable and there is relentless pressure to increase profitability on projects. This results in poor client service and drives away business.  Incredible amounts of red tape and politics.  Management is characterized by empire-building, information-hoarding and a silo mentality.  When things go wrong there is a lot of finger-pointing and no self-awareness.  This is entrenched and does not seem to be acknowledged at any level.  Company is based in Australia so anyone with any authority is absent to leave the foxes to run the henhouse.  Red flags: Entire offices have shut down recently due to attrition.  Stock price flagging.Cardno, Inc. bought the employee owned Marshall Miller and Associates, of which I was an employee in VA for 30 years. I relocated with the company to Raleigh, NC April, 2014.I enjoyed my time in the Raleigh office working remotely for the VA coal mining group. The Raleigh office is managed well, and the employees appear contented and eager to work as a team.Cardno policy, upon full acquisition of MM&A, would not honor a previous written agreement I had with MM&A. I had taken a 17 month break in full time status employment in 2004-06 (during which I worked contract). Cardno demoted me to 8 year employee status. When inevitable lay offs became necessary in the coal based group, I was lowest in seniority rank in my department of 4.You have a job with Cardno so long as it has a contract with the client.  Little chance for advancement.  Management is focused solely on profit and gives no thought to building a viable, on-going business.fast-paced, fun, flexible job. growing company with new opportunities in the US and abroad, many opportunities to cross train with others.Metro-North Lead work supervision for 3 line of MNRR and XRF inspection/Risk Assessment  for some clients in Bronx, Brooklyn and Bronx.

I enjoyed the job until the time of the restructureA typical day at work involved completing assigned schedule work for my client. I was able to set my own hours, which helped with bringing my children to school.  The coworkers were nice people, and we got along well.This is the worst company and filled with the good ole boys.  Rude and disrespectful to employees and do not provide support to staff.  You are a number here.  They will lay you off or fire you rather than support or train you.  The asbestos division is a joke.  There is nothing like this place and you have no job security.Great place to work, safe and fun, learned a great deal! Great salary and compensations as well.

383,Caterpillar,"Every day was different never knew where i was going or what i would be doing all on the road repairs(gas,electric and diesel) respondsible for keeping van stocked up and customer satifactionI was an agency employee not an actual Caterpillar employee, however, there is good a Job Work/Life Balance structured atmosphere, there is room for advancement with the right skills, Management is good, they treat you with respect. The job culture is very diverse, and is extremely pleasant to work in. I was there four years as an agency worker and was just recently laid off, however I would still recommend this employer to everyone, times are tuff all over.  I may not be called back but Caterpillar is still a nice place to work.  the hardest part of the job is adapting quickly to rapid changes, challenging but not impossible. I enjoyed being able to crosstrain in a completely different field and fill in for others while they were on vacation.I have learned and done many tasks as part of Caterpillar INC. I have designed closed loop models for system integration/software testing. I have designed multiple software and hardware features used on Large Mining Trucks. I created the backbone structure for the first automated Python Script testing environment for Caterpillar Large Mining Trucks. I have enjoyed learning and developing especially working with leadership to increase my abilities as a leader to hopefully move into a management or leadership role. I have managed small teams across multiple tasks. Overall I have enjoyed my co-workers, model work, Python scripting, and the great work/life balance that this job has provided.Lots of favoritism, things being pushed under the table, logistics management is the worst that I have seen thus far, no advancement, the plant is divided with separate benefits, bonuses and insurance, they write you up with no solid evidence of anything that was done wrong, they nit pick and harass you because they would rather you walk out then go through a firing process, not to mention the management to employee relations, the list can go on and on... I gave 3 stars because if I were with another department I may some what like it there.When the economy is doing well especially in the resource and mining industries it is a great company to be a part of. But these industries are cyclical which can make job security shaky.Coming from a support role, the most enjoyable part of my job is solving problems.Management tries to enable you for success.My key takeaway has been that you are in charge of how far you move through your career.  You have to be vocal about what you want to do and seek those experiences.Joliet location was very hostile in the beginning, but the environment improved greatly under new upper management. Company overall provides excellent compensation, educational opportunities, support for obtaining professional certifications, opportunities for career advancement, and a general culture of teamwork.I had a great career for 20 years, but Caterpillar is not the same company I hired into.  Like any large corporation, it has had its ups and downs.  Cat provided excellent opportunities for me and my family -- allowed us to move around and provided excellent pay and benefits.  However, the last 10 years have been a real challenge with low job security and significant political turmoil.I was third generation for this company.  It is not like it used to be.  There is no incentive to continue to work for this corporation other than that in the area is pays more.  The culture is terrible. They do not care for their employees and constantly ask to do more with less and no compensation for it.  Middle management ethics is majority of their divisions are questionable.I have found that if you put in the OT, learn the culture of Cat, you can learn a vast amount of knowledge that will grow with you and your career.Pros: Caterpillar is a great company to develop and grow in your careers,offers challenges and inspires to be the best engineers in your domain . The team is diverse and supports inclusive operation. The management preaches/ supports developing quality products and supports next generation initiatives to lead the industry with disruptive innovation in its products and offers good employee benefits and compensation.Cons: Nature of business is cyclic and some aggressive restructuring efforts are implemented as the business demandsNot really an ok place to work. i would not recommend this place to work. Not a transparent facility. Favoritism is heavily practiced by management. If you were on night shift like i was...then it was almost as if you were forgotten. every aspect of your repairs made on your shift, even though correct and solid, was second guessed by day shift and redone. Management in Maintenance was atrocious, led by an inexperienced manager that second guessed his supervisors and heavily practiced favoritism between a few employees giving them preference of hours with working overtime instead of being fair and spreading it across the department. Advancement was a joke and not there. No training plan or evidence of company providing any type of training.Company operates three shifts Monday thru Thursday. Company uses Six Sigma Methodologies. Some of the Pros are gain sharing, affordable insurance and vacation & sick time. Co-workers are like family. Management has an open door policy. The hardest job would be shell prep/paint line because it's messy and hot work. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing your working for a company that you can be proud to say you work for. To sum it up this is the best job I ever had with great benefits, teaming atmosphere, and opportunity to grow.Caterpillar is a great, industry-leading company to work for to gain experience. Their Leadership and Technical Development (LTDP) program is an outstanding three-year rotational program designed to provide broad experience within a specific functional area. Offered great leadership opportunities and project experience. However, there are many layers of management, a lot of rules and regulations that hinder continuous improvement and creative thinking. An old culture and way of doing things limits creativity in the organization. Very political organization forces one to get to know the right people in the organization in order to advance in certain areas. Company currently downsizing making it difficult to stay positive and secure.when you think of caterpillar you think of a strong company however the distribution center i belong to lacks great leadership management does not follow up with supervisors and its commonly known on the warehouse floor that once you become a supervisor you can slack off because it is whats visible. Lack of advancement in the company unless your willing to relocate to the midwest. overall if you have the work ethic to come in and do your job you should be fine but in every warehouse you will have childish issues you will run into.Caterpillar is a good place to work but the pay and chances for advancement are limited. There are resources available to those that the Management chooses to offer it to. Though not so much as those who request it to better improve their abilities.The workforce is diverse. Which is both a blessing and a curse as not all have the drive to excel.and at times the lack of urgency can be disheartening.The hardest and most enjoyable part of the job is meeting the deadlines in an efficient and safe manner.I have been with the company for almost 18 years so it is a good place to work obviously.  Great people, great opportunities for training and advancement.  I have learned many different aspects of the business from Purchasing, Logistics, Quality, and Engineering.  I have been worked many different 6 sigma projects.  The management team I have had in my career has very much been involved in my career and helped me along the way to make the right decisions.As with many of the larger corporations this one can occasionally be overburdened with unnecessary / duplicate information. Too much emphasis on the individual responsibilities of the other team members and not enough individual accountability. The people are exceptional at the local level and in general upper management is responsive to their needs.I enjoyed my time with Caterpillar.  I worked day shift.  I learned to be come a better listener and how to be more organized.  I have taken lean manufacturing classes.  The management is great.  They are willing to listen and help a person reach their full potential. I like my co-workers.  I get along with them and a lot of them have become like family to me.  The hardest part of the job is sometimes is the stress but I don't let it get to me.  When I get to stressed out I go home and read or cook.  That helps me relax.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people. I have mad a lot of great friends at work and will miss them dearly.Great benefits. But after being there 3 years with no opportunity to move up. I would of been at a stand still so leaving was a good option for me So now I can move forward and build a career. I worked well with everyone. The job was very fast at times . Had to always be on my toes. About detail and make sure before I had sent a part for a engine it was not damaged ,and make sure it was right. I worked 12hr shifts standing all day.CAT is a good starting job or those who have no work experience. But not long term, the turn over rate is high and right now cat is ""restructuring"" which means weeding out a lot of people in order to save money. So, if you don't mind working in a fast paced environment with little to no commutation from management and a uncertain future with only one positive factor being pay and benefits and dealing with a lot of egos, then CAT is for you.Education and training provided is best around in availability.Parts are heavy, so this needs consideration depending on your job.Assembly co-workers say the pay is low in comparison to the task.Management co-workers say the pay is pretty good.I most enjoyed solving the problems involved in the manufacturing processes. I was able to succeed in reducing defects where everyone else struggled, so there must still be room for improvement here. The discerning problem solver would find much job security here as engineering changes happen so often."
404,CBRE,"CBRE is a great company to work for. The position I  hold has little to do with my legal education.Currently I am managing the event space for Microsoft. Over the years, I have helped Microsoft and CBRE combine the event management position and successfully managed close to a 1000 events last year, ranging from 10 people to a 1000 people. While I do like what I do, I'm hoping to find something that will put my Legal Education into practice.CBRE is a great place to work, given the right opportunities.  I was exposed to a wide variety of situations, providing me a platform on which to grow & learn.My co-workers were very serious about their responsibilities and focused on providing accurate, timely information and reports. I learned a lot about new software and new supporting excel reports that provided excellent documentation. Every day was busy from beginning to end. The team that I was a part of was understaffed for all of the responsibility placed on it. There was too much required of every member in the amount of time that was available. The team management was too focused on the time allotted for each function to take into account when the out of the ordinary requests came in or when there were issues within everyday functions. There was no flexibility and ""your fault"" or ""your problem"" were common responses to requests for assistance.It is hard to get motivate to come to work everyday for this company. In the department I work in we haven't been properly staffed for more than two years. Managers and Supervisor will listen to you and disregard any of your ideas to make it a better work environment. Many will tell you it's even hostile.The benefits are absolutely horrible. You must meet a deductible before the insurance will pay for anything. You only come to work here if this is your last hope of finding work.Great work place with tons of upside potential, that allows any employee to proceed.In the years at CBRE , I have been mentored and learned tremendous amounts of knowledge.Typical work day always starts with a safety meeting, from there we get our daily tasks and are able to speak to management with any concerns we may have. This is a company that is wanting you to further your career and climb the ladder. Hardest part of the job is being able to complete the tasks assigned to you that day on time with all the restrictions on certain accounts.I learned a lot in this company it was with diversity of team and fun some times happy hours big fun. and well experienced  and organized  team.Good opportunities to improve a somewhat outdated system. Very good schedule : M-F dayshift. Limited opportunities for advancement.Maintain major speadsheet for sourcing of National Bank. Worked directly with VPN in establishing the necessary information  need for contracts established. Set up and managed  file room.Databasing and market research mostly. Really enjoyed the people I worked with fortunately. Would love the opportunity to join them full-time. Overall great experience.Have always loved working for CBRE. Great hours, Great Benefits, Great people to work with. They also provide continued education via online courses.I loved the people I worked with.  This was a good location for me and offered a lot of diversity with job responsibilities.Property Management Company that I worked was processing work orders from The Hartford Financial Services. Clients would call or submit a work order for their location for temperature issues, plumbing, elevators not working. Light bulbs need to be replaced.  Any property issues I would process the work order and contact the Landlord / Tenant of that location. I would also follow up with the client to make sure that the request was completed to their satisfaction. Management was easy to work with. They had your back on any decision that you made.Co-workers were also helpful we worked as a team. Communication was the key to make the workplace pleasant.The health care plans cost a lot. The. Yearly cost before plan paid any thing was almost 6000. He'd weekends off and not on call.Loved my position but unfortunately JP Morgan Chase was downsizing and my position was eliminated leaving only two engineers for all of Eastern WA. I was offered other positions within CBRE if i moved to another state which i did not want to do.In a typical day of work you never know what you are going to be working on, either you can spend your whole shift behind a computer or 30 minutes turning a screwdriver.  When there's actual work we all think safety first. Manager are good and well trained some other are just ok. Co workers are great cant complain. cant say there is one other than sitting around for long periods.A typical day at CBRE is wonderful. My coworkers invited me as family the moment I started working there. The feeling was amazing knowing that someone really cared on how I felt. I've learned that every voice matters working in the building here at CBRE. Management encourages their team to strive to keep a continuous smile on our faces. The most enjoyable part here at CBRE is that you interact with different people and that they show their appreciation by awarding snacks and great compliments on a daily basis.CBRE, Inc. is a great place to work for. Ever-changing and updating, this company is filled with good leadership and gives back to the community.Overall, very flexible with work/life balance. Getting parts/materials make doing your job difficult at times. Coworkers work well with one another.Great place to work, management felt a bit out of touch at crucial times. Great people to work with room to grow. There are many tools that are available for successCBRE is a OK company. Culture is fluid depending on your account. Lots of potential to move around and up. Don't stay in one place too long though. Ttyl"
379,CCC Information Services Inc.,"Typical day at CCC was mostly meetings. There never was one day where there wasn't at least one meeting. A lot of conversations with the client mostly were on the phone but some of our customers would require an actual sales person to be on site for any troubleshooting reasons.The work culture and the environment are the best places to grow, and CCC is a fantastic place to work in. The people are very open to new ideas and are willing to grow.this company has seen better days. the current management in products and technology has become highly political. Each senior management person has certain favorites who would get all the promotions, increments and most part of the bonuses. A senior would not listen to a junior. quality and competency of work does not matter until you would do what ever they ask you to do. Developer does business analysis, Business analysts does only testing and documentation and no real business analysis. Development managers in Products development does release management and quick fixes. it is a chaos.The company really seems to put the people first.  The management really wants to help you to work in the field you want to.  Co-workers are always friendly.  The office politics can sometimes seem overbearing but seem less of an issue here then other companies.  Advancement seems to be a more of a groomed approach which sometimes makes it feel like they play favorites but I have learned it's because they actively worked towards it, as I began to experience as I move into my career.With the support of management, I was able to advance my career and was able to personally grow and develop. The most enjoyable part of my job was the relationships I made with my colleagues, customers and vendors. I had worked a long span and saw it go from a successful private company to a dynamic public company.Great training, easy to contact someone if you run into a problem. They are very willing to help you at anytime. The reps are helping use with learning about cars that are now making it to the lots. If we find something different we can ask about the items to make sure we count the items. Management comes out about every 4 months to do evaluations of our work, Do we miss some items. I was missing the two glass tips that open on some BMW's and Mini Coopers. Will not miss them any more.Company is successful despite itself and lacks heart and soul. It is hardly an inclusive culture and priotitization for any sort of employee development has been a challenge for a great number of years.Many great people to work with and the company pays well for its talent. Chicago and California offices are highly modern and help create a pleasing environment.In twenty years of working at half a dozen different companies, I would rank CCC as the least supportive and least enjoyable. There are far better employers to devote your precious time and energy to if you want to grow as a human being and professional, individual contributor.I spent a great deal of time interviewing with CCC for a management position in the Northeast, despite some unusual qualifications for the position, and compensation that was minimally acceptable.They had recently hired someone who had not worked out, and it seemed they wanted to be very careful (maybe interview for a few more rounds for CYA reasons).After not asking during the interview, the interviewer expressed his concerns about my persistance as I was leaving, and althought that was helpful to know, it was nothing close to the truth. He should have asked.  I thought he already found the person he wanted to hire, but the ad ran a few more times in a few more places, so evidently that wasn't the case.To CCC and all the other ""serial interviewer"" companies out there- please don't waste our time for your political or tax break needs. Some say they can't find exactly the right person, which in this economy (and this type of position), is ludicrous.CCC has gone down hill over the years as far as employee treatment, they have taken the corporate approach to their employees where you are treated like a number more than a person. They are a small company but have their head in the corporate clouds as far treatment, the work/life balance is nonexistent and getting time off is a battle unless you know 6-10 months in advance what days you need off. Phone reps are put at a impossible adherence standard of 98%, that equals 8 minutes off the phone a day for working other projects they assign as well as bathroom breaks (industry standard is 90-95% or 45-23 minutes a day, source:Google) I have personally witnessed long term 10 year + employees fired a day before Christmas for minor under performing on stats, how heartless is a company to do that to someone who has planned their life around the company and to do it right before Xmas, at least have the decency to wait until the holiday passes for such a minor infraction but like i said its turned to such a corporate mentality that they will trim the fat anywhere needed anytime to make the books with little to no regard for employee well being.As far as the good aspects of the job, the pay was decent to slightly above normal, the benefits where priced realistically compared similar jobs. Location is downtown. (be prepaired to pay for your own parking $60-90 a month) Off the phone employees are treated slightly better.while this job pays well and provides good milage, I lack the hours needed to make this my main career. there are only 7 managers throughout the entire country making advancement very difficultCompany is successful, not because of the products but because of the monopoly they hold with the insurance industry (which eventually will change as they cannot even support their current base appropriately). Their technology runs on technology a decade old. Innovation here does not occur and it's hardly a culture where someone can grow in or evolve in.In the past 15 years of working at several companies as either a consultant or employee, I would rank CCC, along with it's executive team in IT the least innovative, least enjoyable, and least performing out of any company I have ever worked for.If you are offered a job or interview and are ALREADY at a good company or somewhere that you can be for a couple more months/years, do not leave your current place as that would just be a bad move. It would be a career mistake and career sabotage to put yourself into a career at CCCIS.Company has gone through layoffs many times and continues to utilize layoffs and budget cuts to make topline growth requirements. Which means that license purchases, are not accounted for , innovation and purchases are limited, and come close to failure monthly with violating customer SLA's and also potential data/DR risk. Management and recruiters will lie to you to get you in. Once you start you will hear about all the red flags (from your own managers/coworkers as they too hate the company they work for and past leadership/employees who fled this company because of it's inefficiency, unethical behavior, inability to be innovative, etc. I would only recommend this company if you REALLY  more... need a job temporarily and you need to find something better and this is your only choice.  lessThey have good people here and they are working hard to make improvements. The hours are long and demands for your time reach into all hours day or night and weekends. There are lot of production issues and issues in other non-prod environments. However, they are working towards making improvements and have gotten better then where they were before.Good learning and worked on hadoop  ecosystems like pig, hive,sqoop,cassandra,design,coding,unit testing and oozie workflow scripts,shell scriptsEnjoyed the time that I worked at CCC learned a lot of new things. The people are very friendly.  I meet a lot of great people.Worked my way up in this fast paced and exciting time for companies rapid expansion. The environment was vibrant and a fair place to work.they are always looking for the cheaper employee and have no loyalty towards there employees. Middle management and most directors do not listen the the people they should  and just do what they want anyway.Don't waste your time with this company. Management has no clue. Communication does not exist. New employees are not welcomed and left to figure it out on their own.Allowed to advance into all areas of IT. Supportive management and grat environment to work in.Managed the day to day Human Resources needs of the business. This included recruiting, management development, and employee relations.Always re-structuring but great benefits and challenging workWorking here was wonderful, the management in Sioux falls was amazing."
548,CDI Corporation,"CDI Corp was an excellent company to work for. The hiring team was well versed in the HR process and the on boarding was fairly easy to complete.  Only bad experience was the exit process, no details given and when contract was about to expire very little communications from management. When trying to find additional employment there was absolutely no follow up and no new job prospects presented.CDI is a third party contract business. I actually worked as a contractor for IBM. CDI has a great system for payroll and communications. The management team there really cares about their employees and will make sure that they are gainfully employed.They are very good at negotiating with the customer and very good representing the employee to the customer.They do a decent job managing contract workers for clients but no job search. Their orientation does not seem to be a job house so much as a contractor wrangler.Great temporary employment agency. Who they vendor for is hit or miss. Some contrats are great and some are not. Some companies will keep you for multiple and exttended contracts. Chances of get fulltime employment.CDI is a small construction, development and investment company in east Tennessee that strives to do quality work for a fair price and improve the homes, land and lives of the people in east Tennessee.Subordinate to IBM work requirements,  so Little actual advancement opportunities. Mostly just a payroll administrator.IBM has a major initiative to move as much work offshore as possible. I have trained about 10 offshore groups & transferred work to them. I am about to do another one in the near future.CDI allows for my career to succeed and improve with current industry standards. Very competitive and a major turning point in the planning industry. CDI maintains and focuses on serving our clients with a combination of innovative technologies, increased efficiencies, and leading edge solutions with an end-goal of achieving client excellence.too small to grow or move up.  owners were flaky.  rainy days = panda express (free).  Fridays were very casual. I enjoyed my coworkers.Very pro family was able to work and do family events. Management was very good on making employees feel good about what they were doing. The cost of insurance was the only poor item.CDI gets the job done.  But I was looking for something a little more long term with upward mobility opportunities.  Such an opportunity cannot be had with CDI.With CDI, I have been doing Civil/Structural Engineering work.  It have been very fun and challenging.  Very large company, but a great group of people.I have an outstanding team to work with. It is a managers dream. The hardest part of the job is keeping a team of billable employees in a services industry busy whenever their is an economic down turn, or the client work load diminishes, considering the low overhead budgets that we have to work with to maintain shareholder profitability.Great company just wish previous owners did not run it into the ground as we have a lot of work to do to recover the profit margins we are comfortable with. Hours will always be long at a start up and compensation low. but the new leadership is outstanding and has given the company with a 39 year track record a real chance to recover.I've worked for several years for CDI Corp. I initially was placed as a web author for a large tech company (client) and over the years moved up through CDI to be a project manager, working on various contracts with the same client. My experience within the organization has varied a great deal based on changes within CDI management, contracts I worked on for the client, and the teams I worked with. By and large, I had the privilege of having excellent managers who advocated for my advancement and fantastic teams made up of intelligent, motivated people who were a pleasure to work with. For the last 3 years, I have also been able to work from home full time, and I have loved this flexibility.The downsides to working for CDI is that it is ultimately a staffing company. The pay and benefits are not great, and your long-term growth are limited by the contracts available. It is nearly impossible to continue advancing your career beyond a certain point, and for an ambitious person, this can be very frustrating. It can also be frustrating as a manager not to be able to see your employees advance to the levels they should because there simply is not opportunity. While local management is fantastic, corporate management, whom we rarely deal with on a regular basis, are out of touch with the local teams, and meaningful rewards for truly outstanding performance are few and far between. For instance, it's been 4 years since the company last had annual merit pay increases, and the last round of merit pay increases were so low, they didn't keep up with cost of living increases in the  more... area we were based. There is no loyalty from the corporate office, and excellent employees who have been loyal to the organization may be laid off with limited notice when their contract is up. Local management tries to mitigate this, but corporate has made it increasingly difficult to reward and retain top talent.  lessWorked in cubicles, very impersonal assignment, manager was good to work for, but limited access to SKM and power systems analysis.Coordinates and implements the established referral process for children and families, ensures the implementation of recruitment including the child find effort, implement the enrollment process, provide accure record keeping, assist in the parent committees.I learned that I was a case manager for 30-35 families and that together with the parents, teacher and core team, we can guide parents to coordinates efforts to ensure services for children including children with disabilities. Ensures that children are up to date on epsdt. The most enjoyable part of the job is work with children and families and help them.Working Remote was a plus, and  flexible schedule . Internally processes were unorganized, not easy to change, big disconnect between departments/process. there was a lack of communication and sales training.Daily tasks are spread out so you do you have some down time. Work environment is ok. Work long hours sometimes. Occasional saturday workThis is a good company that appreciates hard work and getting the job done right. Being a part of a team that knows how to work together to produce a great product was an honor.There are a million things wrong with this company, so where do I begin?1) Their on boarding system is a joke. I had no idea who my manager was and no idea what my job really entailed. 2) They try and do a horrible job covering up their mistakes. I saw a job posting for my same position with higher pay. When I confronted them about it, they took down the posting immediately and brushed it under the table. 3) Their entire internal software system is extremely antiquated. They need everything to be run on a PC and through Internet Explorer. I used to have to travel 3 miles every week so that I could input my timesheet on a brick of a laptop. I still have to use a totally outdated timesheet system that they just ""updated""4) There's little to no interaction with management or anyone higher ups5) Absolutely zero career growth and development. I tried for a year to try and get some momentum on growth opportunities... NOPE6) Benefits are a joke. The pay is already horrible, you really expect us to pay for benefits out of pocket?!?!Corporate restructuring underway, patience is needed while this is in progress.  It could be another year before progress is really seen externally."
647,CEB,"THose with masters or PHDs treated those working towards a graduate degree and just had a BA as if they were not smart enough or qualified to interact with clients.There was one individual who was the reason for 2 people leaving the company and management promoted him because of his knowledge even though his colleagues and CLIENTS were unhappy with the way he interacted with clients.I went in with high hopes & came out nothing but disappointed- specifically with management. The culture is super inmature & management lacked any leadership.Typical day for me would involve attending many meetings and working long hours to ensure all work was completedMy manager was great but was also stretched very thin.  My team was wonderful and I could always rely on them to get their work doneMy work life balance was not great and working while on vacation was the norm.  This does not happen everywhere within CEB though.8:30- 5:30 Job. Great working atmosphere, with great colleagues to help you out if you ever have a problem or question. Management is good, closely work with either an Account management or Sales Executive.  Work life balance is the most enjoyable aspect of the job.It is a great place to start your career I the sales environment. It has continually pushed me out of my boundaries and has allowed me to become a more productive and efficient worker. Having said that, the management there is as all high pressure sales environment. It is an all right position if you don't mind dialing 100 times a day and pitching all day over the phone.The work in the CEB project is amazing, challenging and gives opportunities to be focused but creative every day. From having barely any people we grew to 15 members in the team in three years and completed work volume normally handled by twice as many peopleThe one thing that I have never understood is the lack of possibility to arrange work hours more flexibly and integrate suitable technology. If we would have been allowed to work at least part time from home (50/50) it would be the most ideal project ever.I am glad to have been a part of it and will always cherish itIt's a cool career startup for a recent college graduate. Nice company culture and learning experience. Not for everyone but the right candidate or employee can be successful doing what is expected.Lots of office politics here. Highly dysfunctional. Everything takes lightyears to get done. Processes they use are archaic. Overall, the charity does make a difference in a lot of people's lives. They just need to fix themselves and they will make an even bigger impact.CEB is an ok company. I started there almost a  year ago. Not a lot of room for advancement. Especially after earning my CISSP.Really loved the culture and people at CEB. It's such a great place to learn and grow - you can really do a lot! Management is great, and if you are a hard worker, you can go far.Overall CEB is a great company to work for and to get professional work experience.  They pride themselves on hiring the best of the best, including extremely smart and innovative individuals.The environment is friendly and they offer a great benefits package that is very competitive, however in many departments they lack career advancement.Great company to work for. Salary could be a bit better but the benefits and Paid-time-off are second to none. Positive work environment and great training system. Positive managers and supervisors and everyone is helpful.There are so many brilliant and kind people working at CEB who support organizations around the world with research and best practices yet CEB does not follow its own guidance.  Horrible career pathing, low pay and poor management at the top.Work in my division often consisted of doing the same thing each day but that might have changed since then. The rah-rah culture was not my favorite.Fun but unorganized.  Good leadership in some sections but in other departments there is a lot of confusion.  Work hours are pretty good except they micro manage a lot.I really enjoyed my time at CEB.  However, the travel was over the top and advancement opportunities in the Chicago area are limited or non-existent with corporate headquarters being in Virginia.  Daily activity included cold calling, presenting to C-level executives, managing team.  The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting and talking with executives across all industries.CEB has a great company culture that promotes work life balance. It's a wonderful place to get your bearings, build a foundation, and network. Networking is a must because promotions are clearly based on who you know. Some teams play favorites more then others.Are you (or someone you know) looking for a new career opportunity in the Washington, DC area? If so, I would highly recommend investigating CEB. I have the pleasure of working at CEB and believe it is a great fit for me during this portion of my career. CEB has great benefits and career development opportunities, is true to its values and is committed to its employees.CEB has a young atmosphere. The majority of the employment population are recent graduates. The offices are modern, and if you are willing to ""play politics"", there's room for advancement.You'll learn a lot at CEB and work with some very smart people and even sharper clients. The work life balance is also pretty good. The problem is that the work tends to become extremely repetitive after about a year or two and upward mobility is extremely limited. Furthermore, upper management is still treating CEB as if it were a 200 person firm. Growing pains abound including antiquated performance metrics that handicap the company and stale, groupthink from upper management.Fun place to work for young professionals.  CEB has good training, but the career path is not as clear as they make it out to be.  High turnover."
103,Celgene Corporation,"Celgene is a fast growing biotech company with excellent benefits.  The company has an excellent culture but is slowly changing to a more larger company feel.Company is doing well but culture is little to be desired.  Not much flexibility in terms of work/life balance.  Would not recommend them unless you just want to stay 1-2 years.Good company to work for. Great people with good work ethic. Work is interesting and exciting. Many great positives in working here.Well balanced company. A typical day consist of fast paced environment. One must be detailed oriented and focused at all times. Co workers are loving and kindfriendly ppl. The project I was working on was cut short so I don't have to much input. The buildings are pretty nice. The company has some really good products so I think they'll be around for a while.I love my job and enjoy working at Celgene. It has a great culture and have learned a lot about pressure, vacuum, temperature, air quality, and chemistry.Indeed is good job portal where we can find number of positions to apply for job. Its very easy and beneficial for the candidates to surf for the positions in different locations.Indeed is a very good job portal to find jobs. Daily we gets fresh jobs updated in the portal. This portal is very helpful to the candidates to find jobs easily.Celgene is a very fair diverse employer. At Celgene I learned a great deal about risk and mitigation. The most enjoyable part about the job was providing help to patients, physicians, and pharmacies.Its a good work area, and great management. Sometimes i get access to work from home. I love it in some situations. And great support from the co-workers.There are lots of opportunities available.They also care about their employees and I have seen them try very hard to place everyone in a department that was disbanded.Very good company to work, every one in company are very supportive.I only wish the pay was a bit higher. Because of this, I doubt if I will be able to work here for very long. But for the time being, I'm enjoying learning new things and picking up a few skills.Great company atmosphere. I love the employee interaction within the organization. The people that work in the organization are very friendly and helpful. A good place to workGreat pay and benefits.  Few opportunities for professional growth and development.  If you enjoy being an individual contributor and have no particular ambition or desire to advance and progress upward, Celgene may be a good fit.  Otherwise, not a great organization.Growing business with good people. Quality does not wield the influence necessary to be more effective, but it does get the job doneCelgene Corporation as a company is great for patient and innovations.Fantastic benefits but management can be slightly better.Great oncology division. Immunology has growing pains with poor division leader. Hopefully one day it will mirror the Oncology division.High productivity and quality expected but was able to perform job functions well.  Worked overtime to complete amount of work expected.  Overall satisfied with job, salary, and benefits.It is a great environment to work and great co-workers.  I enjoyed going to work everyday. You learn new things everyday when you talk to patients.wonderful overall environment. from the people working there to the potential growth in a wide range of departments. Almost every day felt good to walk in to the company.Its a place where we can gain more knowledge and the team  members are very supportive and talented persons and gives advice to develop ourself"
168,Celldex Therapeutics,"Good company Great working environmentGreat benefits, Flexible working hoursThe company has great potential, however, they are not quite there yetI interned for this company for a summer and loved the experience. There were many mini-perks in addition to a fantastic work atmosphere and community. I got free coffee, free yoga classes on Tuesdays during lunch, free lunch on pay days, and my own cubicle as an intern! I enjoyed being treated as part of the team and was permitted to do things that other interns in other companies would never be able to do! I can't say enough good things about this company. There is a real sense of community here and everyone supports one another.Excellent company to work for. Excellent support staff, wonderful employees. Great benefits"
170,Cengage Learning,"Cengage has a great atmosphere and a lot of great people. The Tech ed product they offer really does help students excel.My job is not like most others within the company, so the experience is different than others.  There seems to be little direction for new employees and little to no training.  The on boarding process leaves much to be desired.I loved everything about this company. I worked there for seven years and only left due to health issues and to raise my child. Would go back in a heartbeat!A sales job that doesn't want you to sale and sabotages your attempts to satisfy the customer every chance they get so your efforts are doubly hard. Bonus structure changes constantly.Credit and collections for assigned territories.  Customer service and solving customer complaints.  However, the outsourced our department and many lost their jobs.In an everchanging digital environment you must be able to change with innovation. The company has gone from a traditional book publishing company to an Educational Technology company. Loved the change but wasn't fond of all of the layoffs due to price drops.I absolutely loved the customers!Had a good time and made good money. The people are very nice, also very easy to figure out what to do. Good hours alot of over time, good benefits if you work full-time.The job is a solid job and offers decent benefits.  Work-life balance is pretty manageable when outside of rush period.  When college is in-session, it can be incredibly stressful.Management is awful and needs improvement.  When I transitioned from one product group to another after nearly 5 agents left, there was little to no organization.  The only structure that was provided for this training was out of my own accord and one of the agents who was also quitting because they were expected to do too much for too little. I was ultimately targeted and forced to quit.  I was denied a position switch as well as an annual raise over a write-up through chats, which should have been handled through HR in the first place (once again, bad management). This company is engrossed in more nepotism than I had originally thought.  If you lick everyone's boots, don't have a sense of humor over chats, and don't present ideas to management then you'll be fine.  They seriously don't like you giving ideas, no matter how good they may be.  I've received responses such as ""Why did you even ask that? You should know how it works around here.""I worked at this place for a few years .As a stockpicker  u have to pick100 cases an hr if u can't then they write  you up , after so many write ups ur in the office getting getting ur butt reamed.  Managment does what its wants to do you can express your views and opinions but you're just wasting your breath . And there is also favoritism if you are buddy-buddy with the leads and supervisors then you usually get the easier jobs. If not then u get sent to returns which really sucks cause u have to process 115 cartons per hr or u get a write up . Its all about numbers . Then there's the attitudes the drama and the morale which was at an all-time low .lm  glad I got outta there. But the pay was decent and the benefits were good.The job is fine. It's not the work. Its the lack of employees who actually work.AND apparently one shift gets water cups and bottled water and other shifts don't since those shifts aren't as important. AND one of the shifts work overtime, while another shift gets credit and ice cream trucks for a great job. AND management must have a quota for those type of employees since they say nothing. AND I have never heard a floor manager be able to talk to employees the way this companies do. Unfortunately, a few good employees have to work for the team on a shift. When you need a paycheck, that's why you continue to do it. For the entitled employees that don't have to do anything except sit in bathroom for 20 min at a time, 6 times a shift...congrats at finding a job that allows it.I love working here. There are plenty of ways to establish a career and you work with hard working people who are willing to work any amount of hours needed to get the job done so there isn't any left over for tomorrow or the next shift. It is a 24 hour company with guards who stay on site even on holidays. It is a very secure building who give those of all backgrounds second chances.Honestly a horrible place to work. Most of my coworkers had some kind of mental deficiency, including 2 kids who had Downs Syndrome, which I would be blamed when they messed up. Those who didn't were people coming right out of rehab, which yes, is good of the company to hire such people, but considering there was almost no opportunities to advance, it was not a place I would like to work at long term. Also ,they had us working more so they could show off to tour groups coming through what they were doing, rather than for doing and completing the actual work.Made lots of friends, work-life balance is great, flexible hours and can work from home occasionally. Work on a ""team"" but actual tasks are done solo.My first experience working in a smaller company.  Their technology is top notch.  I did not work here for very long it was a three month contract.  I was hired to get a large project off the ground, IE. put scope together, get stakeholders onboard with the project.Lead a team of ten sales representatives to successfully sell in the higher education market.  Responsibilities include training, sales presentations, technology demonstrations, and assist with sales team development within the team.  Other responsibilities include business development and promoting institutional sales models at higher education institutions by meeting with professors, deans & administrators.   Create and market events within the IL district for college level faculty and administrators.  Events are strategically planned and executed by the Engagement Specialist in order to help drive revenue.Cengage Learning offered me the ability to work remotely and perform my job without being micro managed daily.  I loved working for them in my contract roll.Each day my coworkers and I would be led in stretches and then to our stations, which in my case was to operate a shrink wrap machine  with one other person and/or scan boxes and apply stickers appropriately. After that we would have to fulfill specific work orders- preparing packages of books ourselves, shrink wrapping them, and then boxing them up to ship. Management was pretty good. The worst part would be the combination of the work itself with the hours worked. ""Mandatory overtime"" became commonplace. Ten hour days, 5-6 days a week of just the activities described above. That would have to be the hardest part. I worked with a lot of good friends from high school over the summer. Spending time with them was the best part of the job.Great place to work to make a difference in education industry. Exciting new products are being build here. Great place for both long and short termCengage Learning is a good place to work for innovators.  It's a casual environment where teamwork is valued.  The challenge is to stand out during tough economic times, poor sales or re-structuring.Good environment, fast paced, technically challenging, remote management, which provided some challenges for communication and direction.You are the CEO of your own territory. As an outside Learning Consultant, you work from home and on college campuses year around. Using the company car provided, a typical day starts with driving to one of my college campuses and spend the day meeting with Professors about their course materials. Acting as a true consultant, I work to find the solution that answers their needs for their course and engaging their students inside the classroom. Everyone in the company is high energy and eager to help you secure adoptions and hit your sales goal. As a company, however, their biggest goal is not just about reaching a sales goal, but changing the face of Higher Education and engaging students more than ever."
319,"Central Business Solutions, Inc","My typical day starts from cashbook reconciliation, then bookkeeping, account payables and all the reports needed for our department. Deal with tricky customers, different vendors and banks that makes me learn how to interact with different kind of person. I report directly to President of the company who is successful businessman, learned lot of business and management strategy and concepts from him. Most of my co-worers are young professional, we get along well and learn from each other. The hardest part of the job was to communicate with co-workers from different countries (Columbia, Serbia and India), but this is only for the beginning year; now it becomes a benefit because we understand each other's culture more and we can learn from each other. The most enjoyable part of the job is to challenge myself, I need to handle different tasks and handle tricky customers and collaborate with other departments; it is a great opportunities for me to learn how to meet deadline, prior jobs and work with different person."
555,Centuria Corporation,"Handle all incoming correspondence, reports, and appeals.Make sure all assignments of correspondence are met on the date they are due.File records.Learn a little about how flood insurance works.Drafts letters to different Congress members.Worst management I have ever worked with in over 30 years.  Would bring in people with no background.  Did not stand behind there employeesCenturia cares about its employees, treats them fairly and is always available for questions.- stimulating work with opportunities to develop new areas of knowledge- friendly & helpful coworkers- minimal meetingsNOTE - I worked for Centuria as a contractor to a Federal Agency, so these comments are more about the place of work than about Centuria itself."
26,Chegg,"It's easy going, you choose when to take tutoring opportunities and only log on when you want to. There are no hour requirements.Your typical warehouse job, very bland work. They do feed you, but some times they expect more work than is physically possible.I learned more about how to work with and teach people who may be having difficulties with certain subject matter. This job has really helped me to hone my problem solving and interpersonal skills.The system requires students to post a question on the board, and the first tutor to respond earns the chance to answer his question.There was four application processes as a temporary position which was interesting. Working in telecommunications for the first time was an eye opening experience. I was able to get promoted to chat and do instant messaging full time with a small pay increase. An early set schedule as well which was beneficial financially.Great CultureGood Work life balanceSupporting ManagersFree FoodAverage Technical work, depend upon the teamOverall it's good company to work For.Didnt really care for the environment. First day was ok, but after a while of silence and no one talking, it became really bad.- Typical work day: load/unload deliveries, sort, pick/pack- Management/Co-workers: enjoyable place to work with fun environment, management was always there to help employees- Hardest part of the job: Getting into a routine, but once routine was figured out, everything was good.- Most enjoyable part of the job: Working in a fun environmentI was a team leader here a chegg, very good place to work. Only thing bad was when schools wasn't in session the work would slow down extremely a lot. After all it were a good place to work peaceful and quiet.walk up to 10 miles a shift restock books and pull orders work long hours walking for the 10-12 hour shift was no order no managementThe job was not hard, but more boring. I was not mentally challenged. I did not have a bad experience, but knowing that it was only a temporary position I felt a lack of motivation. I would have also preferred a cooler climate.CHEGG is a nice place to work, friendly, but hardly anyone gets hired permanently. They said it was because it is seasonal and they only needed a few full time people because during off season, there are only the leaders and two or three supervisors. they didn't get 40 hrs. a week then, not enough work.receiving books and inspecting themlearned how to use different machineshardest part: standing on your feet for long shiftsenjoyable: payrateGreat place to work, enjoyed, balanced and flexible, enjoyed working hereGreat place to work. Fun friendly work environment the biggest problem is you come in as a temp and you may or may not get hired after you work 1,000 hours in a calendar year.GREAT PAY!! Very busy and can be a very fast paste environment. typical day of work for me was to pick books, stage them, then ship them back. Employee's are great with making team members well rounded by training them in every aspect of the warehouse.Everyday is a learning experience.  Especially in the field of Human resources.  There are a wide range of full time and temporary employee issues that all need to be handled in a unique way.  This job had afforded me the opportunity to learn and grow within my field.I'd go in and one day i could be picking books, the next i could be shipping books, and the next or same i could be shelving or relocating books.My day would start off projecting how many orders will have to be shipped out and how much product is coming in.  Once that is decided, then I would need to place employees accordingly to where I would need them to meet the deadlines of the shipments.  My co-workers were great, they knew what had to be done and always knew they had to do whatever it took to get the job done.  The biggest thing I have learned while working at Chegg is that ""never ask anyone to do anything that you aren't willing to do yourself"".  I enjoyed going to work everyday, it was an atmosphere where everyone was happy to be there.This place was such a mess. Millions of books misplaced. No one seems to care about the organization.Not wanting to be there.I have not learned anything at Chegg. I walked in on my first day and knew how to do most of the jobs do to previous warehouse work.Unprofessional and favoritism. Leads, Supervisors, and management will talk down to you and, get a attitude with you.My co-workers are the only perks to the job.Hardest part of the is the stress of the job and upper positions."
362,Chevron,"At the Colfax location, you deal with rude customers, a lot of heavy lifting and busy work. The coworkers are great but the management favors certain workers and cuts them a lot of slack while being hard on the rest.Great place to work and develop. Job is flexible, opportunity to travel. Could be less hierarchical and while some places are micro managed others allow for plenty of breathing roomVery good company I enjoy working for with amazing benefits, wonderful pay and excellent structure.  Truly the best company I have ever worked for.We were a small team of people working together. There was never a lack of communication or any problems. the cash registers worked well, i had good hours and decent pay. A lot of times I would be able to get off early because of hard work and was treated as good as i was at my job.Its a ok place to work during the day. It gets scary sometimes at night because u never know whats going to happen but it was also due to the location i was in. I loved seeing the new faces and also my regulars that came in. The owner was a very lovely person. I enjoyed conversation with her.A typical day at work was very repetitive with working with customer sales and store cleanliness. Clerks learned how to handle cash and customer service as well as stocking the shelves for future purchases. The management team was very willing to work for their employees. Most of the co-workers were willing to accomplish their job effectively.It was a great and laid back shift. The people who I worked with were great and it was just a relaxed environment. When it was bought out however, it just wasn't the same and u was forced to quit because of upset between myself and the new ownerWhen I worked as a contractor for chevron I was surprised about the instability of the work environment.  During my time there I slowly saw benefits I was promised be taken away with the instability of the field of work.  Over time the things I had appreciated about the job disappeared and I was left with the realization that this is no longer a company I would like to work for.* A typical day at work is helping the customers with their every needs.* Management was very friendly and productive.* The most enjoyable part of the job was that i got to help my customers.Abundant opportunities to be exposed to, and be involved with exciting subsurface opportunities across the globe. Highly skilled workforce, open to sharing their work and mentoring othersExcellent workplace culture, stressing safety, performance, and inclusionIt's a cool company to work for bein that I been there a whole year and the work and life balance is really suitable. Depending on the area, life and work balance differs along with pay.It's a private owned gas station but the  owners are amazing they treat you like family, they always try to help in anyway they can weather is be personal or work related. The customers are so friendly and nice.I enjoyed working with the onsite manager. I think they should appreciate employees more and the good things they do. They need some incentives for employees. Overall it was alright.Great work environment, Team orientation and lots of team efforts. Great work culture to work for and a balance work and life style. Team motivation. Team FocusIt's a workplace with lots of talented and nice people, fun to work at.  Generally the Company provides employees opportunities to grow and find their best interest to suit for business.Chevron is one of the BEST companies I have had the pleasure to work for. Very close staff. Everyone pulls for each other. The benefits are great. My hours are perfect. Unfortunately this BU is closing down and going to Questa Mine site. There the project will go into reclamation. I have learned so many skills with Chevron and they always encourage me to learn more. My supervisor is great and my coworker are assume.It was great working there. Great pay and you see celebrities every now and then. It stays fast pace during the summer and spring. But during the winter and fall, it's slow.I have worked here for 2 years now and have become very familiar with the company, and what is expected with the company. I have worked as management here and feel the company has provided me with great opportunities to excel and further pursue my career.Chevron is a very fast paced environment that requires attention to detail and team work skills. In my five years of employment with this company I learned most of the skills I know and use today. The hardest part of any job is to not complete a task and leave it for the next shift to complete this happens quite often in this company because everyday there are new task and deadlines to be met.I enjoyed working at the Chevron because there was so much to do. It wasn't your typical gas station. Attached was the A&W restaurant which I also worked whenever I was scheduled there. My managers were however lazy, except for one, which led to hostility among other employees.This company is great to work for. It offers competitive pay and advancement opportunities. The owner cares about the well-being of his employees. the company offers incentives."
417,Chicago Public Schools,"All my co-workers were really nice and help, I was able to set in a fixed schedule so i could come early and leave at a reasonable time and still attend college.Advantages & Disadvantages of working in Chicago public schools:Advantages: Salary and benefits are competitive; diverse student populations make teaching challenging but rewarding;  A lot of training, project, volunteer opportunities to keep your profession grow. Disadvantages: Teaching & learning environment is very challenging (e.g. class size); No job security (You don't know when you will be laid off, in Nov., February, April, or even in August)Overall I'm still have a job just don't know for how long research,research, and more research. Educator is ine if the greatest career a person can have in my opinion but you have to have a passion for it.Each one teach one.CPS seems to favor their own.  While many of us were at our desks working, there were those who would walk in at whatever time they wanted and once they turned on their computer walked off to get breakfast.  I saw this a lot with the CEOs office.  They felt that if you got up to walk to the bathroom you didn't have enough to do.  CPS has a lot of great office workers, but they get a bad rap for being employee of CPS.  CPS GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER!!!Working with CPS is one of my great work experience I value till this day. I have been working on and off with CPS since I was a Junior in High School. I love the fast paced environment and the multi cultured people I have worked and dealt with.Transporting kids and off bus safely . Assures child is never left unsupervised on a bus.Ensures the safely and well-being of children being transported to and from school. Assure that the bus driver is not distracted from the safe operation of the vehicle.Chicago Public Schools has great benefits. CPS provides helpful materials to the students in order for them to learn to their full potential. I admire CPS No Tolerance Policy. I felt really safe working for CPS.Good feeling of giving backGreat salariesGood benefitsNetworking opportunitiesGood work/life balanceJob security in most positionsEach morning I begin to focus on the lesson plan that I prepared for  my students. I learned how to become more patience, perseverance and emphatic toward my students to enhance their academic skills. Some of my colleagues have been very supportive toward me to help promote students to the next level. My job can become very challenging because of certain students' behavior problems within the the class environment. Most of the students' parents are a great support system that usually bring the behavior problems to a halt. I love to teach and counseled students. Additionally, I enjoyed administration work while I was a Counselor. I was tremendous asset within my career environment.Working here at John Hancock College Prep is a blessing. We are currently in transition going from a neighborhood school to a selective enrollment school. The most enjoyable part of this job is seeing students succeed. Managment has be great, if one has any questions or concerns, they are always willing to listene. Co-workers are fantastic, alway willing to help one another. Throughout my career here at John Hancock College prep, I have learned that students feel diffrent everyday, this is the hardest part of the job as I have to adjust to the students.In my opinion, the teaching experience was great. Everyday there was a different expectation. The students, although challenging at times, brought the best out of me. I learned that both adults and students learn and grow during the school year. I also learned that everyone does not grow in the same directions. Management was not great. I feel that my co-workers were good at what they did and they put forth a grand effort. The hardest part of the job, however, is dealing with the management and administration. CPS enforces rules and gives deadlines and tests that are not conducive to the growth of the young people. It is almost impossible to get kids ready for the wave of standardized tests and teach them what they need to learn to pass to the next grade. CPS does a poor job of catering to the kids' needs. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be when you see the success of many students and understand that your input helped them be successful.good benefits and easy hours love the holiday breaks and pay working with the kids makes you happy and smiling,love iti will recommend this job to every oneWorking as a Special Education Classroom assisatant is very stressful. Working with a diverse group of learners is the best part of the job. I would say the hardest aspect is working along side teachers and other coworkers who honestly don't care about their position. Ive heard so many statements that teachers have made regarding students that was totally inapportate. I would also like to add that most schools aren't to fixable with conquering issues regarding workers safety and violently aggressive children.Working for Chicago Public Schools was the best part of my career. I had the pleasure of working with some of the most powerful administrators. My coworkers were always very supportive and we always looked out for one another. The children that I worked with were always very humble, while their may be some uncooperative students I still enjoyed every minute. The hardest part was just the uncertainty of holding on to your job.The Postsecondary Liaison responsible for implementing targeted strategies that prepare all Chicago Public School students for post-secondary opportunities. Must possess the ability to build capacity of your school Postsecondary Leadership Team. Additionally, provide professional development, tools and resources to assist school faculty and staff in creating a college and career going culture and driving strong postsecondary outcomes.It's by no means an easy process. The work that educators do is not something that any individual could fathom. Layer and layers of paperwork, protocol that many times doesn't make sense and initiatives that don't last for more than 3 years is frustrating especially when research states it takes 5 years to see change. You get to a point where just being grateful that you have a job isn't enough because the your health and emotional well being suffer and it is definitely a thankless job.I come in and check the Building Automotive System to see how the school is heating/cooling. I walk the building to make sure it is comfortable through out. The school is close to 300,000 square feet. On a daily bases we test the pool for PH. When needed we vacuum, add chemicals to the feeders. Any repairs that need to be done we do. Like plumbing (rodding out a clogged line, changing a p-trap), electrical (changing lights, changing ballast, outlets) & painting.The faculty is very nice. They are friendly and they appreciate the work we do for them. My co-workers are good people. They try very hard and they do their job to the best of their ability.The hardest part is working on the roof in freezing weather.I enjoyed helping the disabled children. I learned how to effectively assist special needs kids. How to handle wheel chairs and walkers. Management was not organized.  No room for advancement.A typical day may go smoothly until a person in leadership pulls you to the side to discuss things that do not benefit the children or the betterment of the school system. I learned that although I worked in  a school that everyone was not concerned about children actually learning. Sometimes it's just politics. I was not under very good management. My co-workers were influential and supportive. The hardest part of the job was knowing that some people in charge really don't care about children. The most enjoyable part about the job was the appreciation I received from parents.I love working with children. •	Confer with parents and staff to discuss educational activities, policies, and student behavioral or learning problems. Enforce discipline and attendance rules.  •	Observe teaching methods and examine learning materials to evaluate and standardize curricula.  •	Collaborate with teachers to develop and maintain curriculum standards. •	Daily classroom aide, assist teachers, provides one on one or small group support to students. •	Provides additional support where help is needed throughout Vanderpoel. •	Cheer and Pompon coach.This is a good place to get a good start on your resume, or to beef it up.  This is not a career type of place.  You have to get what you can out of it and move on - revolving door.  The benefits are ok. This was a very fast paced environment, no nonsense atmosphere.  Not much development or growth.  Lots of hard work for last minute rushed projects. This is a who you know atmosphere for higher level positions. I learned how to stay on my toes, be a professional, to be proactive, to anticipate next steps and solve problems. I learned the importance of trust and confidence as well as being very detailed and keeping impeccable records. CPS is a huge company, easy to get lost in the shuffle. Company seems to cater more to people with children."
581,CIA,"Like any large bureaucracy, there are issues, but I found lots of advancement opportunities, interesting work, and even travel! Something for everyone there.The CIA offers unique experience, and predominantly train on the job for these positions, once professionals exceed the final cut for education, a battery of tests, and clearances.  Individuals are encouraged to think for themselves within the framework of regulations, and often travel alone worldwide to assist case officers abroad with technical help.Great equal opportunities for all sexes, races, and health handicaps (I even saw a blind man pushing the postal cart through the halls). One has to get used to paranoid behavior when working in this environment.I served as an Executive Assistant at the Agency for 23 years,  I had no typical day!  I woke up every morning wondering what new and exciting thing I was going to learn that day, and I was rarely disappointed,   I was fortunate to have excellent managers who truly appreciated and rewarded exceptional performance, both monetarily and with plum assignments,  I served at eight different Embassies and Consulates all over the world.  My spouse was an agency employee as well (a finance officer) and management made every effort to see that we had tandem assignments.Our co-workers were dedicated public servants who were there for the same reason we were - to serve our country,  There were the usual petty complaints but they were infrequent.The hardest part of my job was also the most enjoyable:  being away from my extended family for long periods of time, but living overseas and exposing my children to an international life was an experience I wouldn't trade for anything!Work at the Agency has been one of my best life experiences.  They work hard to breed a culture of trust, mentoring, and good management.  From the people, to the continuous learning opportunities, and diversity of work all under one employer.  There are few companies that can provide work that interests you no matter how your interests change, and with the flexibility that they do.  A very positive culture all together.A typical day in the office consisted of typing documents that were classified and handled according to the classification code that was given to it.  When the documents were completed, it was given to the appropriate supervisor for review.  The position also required that all files were locked at all times except when it was necessary to insert additional information in them.  Management was easy to work with and like most organizations, they rated your performance.  I was fortunate to have a good relationship with all of my co-workers.  The hardest part of my job was remembering to always destroy the burn bags when there was a fire drill.  If someone forgot to do this, they were reminded that this action was not acceptable.  Having a good working relationship with my co-workers (of all ages and backgrounds) was an enjoyable part of my job.Outstanding Career Opportunities. Over my 36 year career I advanced to the Senior level of Government Service. Although I was hired on as a Mechanical Engineer, I was able to choose other career paths as desired.I had a long and successful career with CIA for 39 years.  I changed job tracks 3 times during my career and served in several different support jobs.  Training opportunities were excellent.This is an HOA management company. Company is one of the best in their industry, but doesn't value it's employees. There is no motivation or supervisor support.The best part about my job is serving my country.  I've learned key leadership skills, as this company provides some of the best leadership courses available.This place developed my research skills and taught me to be a better analyst.  The hardest part of the job was finding the right fit for my skills and interests.  I wanted to maximize my potential and be in a position of leadership.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when I had the opportunity to travel, brief and manage projects.It's very different.  Basic / Flexible hours. Everything is discreet. Management is not that great. Co-workers are co-workers. If you would like an opportunity to serve your country, this is it.The agency is everything you wouldn't expect. The management style is severely lacking and it causes a lot of problems. People are reassigned constantly in positions they aren't qualified for which also causes havoc.The office politics are very charged and can effect you easily. Stay on your toes.Security is very tight and you will have a gun aimed at your face at least once during your time an as employee here. I did meet some very famous people during my 2 years here. No names of course, sorry.Work/life balance is excellent as you can't take any work home with you. But you probably figured that out by now.Exciting - moving - hectic. Loved it all - sorry I left! Family life was the reason I left.Excellent Benefits, great work/life balance. Very stable environmentWork was enjoyable do to the places lived and visited.  Like anywhere some people were fun to be around at work and some not.There is no better place to use your technical skills and talents to the benefit of our nation's security and no better place to have an impact on our nation's leadership.By law, I am not permitted to provide information on this subject.Great federal employer and provides challenges to today's global issues that need to be solved.  Would do it all over again.Working for the government is great if you like to travel.  The pay is not so great and living in the DC area is also not so great.  Lots of opportunity to move around and learn other things.It has it good and bad points, it has good benifits and good pay.A typical workday for a finance and operations support officer is a standard 8-5 work schedule.  This all depends on the particular job, operation and location as this could obviously increase from time to time.  It is all dependent on the particular set of goals at the time.You learn to work with a variety of personnel during the course of your career.  From staffers to briefings to senior management.Management, at least in the area of finance and support, is at times lacking.  Like any office, I have had great managers and at others absolutely horrible.The hardest part of the job is coming to grips that regulations basically outweigh common sense at times.  Hey, it's the government.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the opportunities that the Agency offers and the sense of duty it can provide. It has in some offices, flexible schedules which are family friendly.  You will also have the opportunity to travel abroad if that is one's goal."
308,"Cisco Systems, Inc.","energetic environment, start up vibeone of the first ""internet"" companies because of its BBN historyno sure how it has changed over the years; company was being considered for an acquisition when I leftIf you have a good manager at Cisco, it can be a great place to work.  Generally liked my co-workers and almost everyone was helpful.  The ""People Deal"" that HR introduced was a good idea, but really lacked accountability and ability to execute between manager and employee.  The salary and benefits at Cisco are really good, but it's lost it's mojo as evidenced by the yearly lay-offs.During my time at Cisco I worked with some of the brightest and most collaborative individuals in the industry.  I have worked with colleagues, partners and customers that have become life long friends and business partners.  I supported national and global partners with a practice around cloud both private and public offerings.I was a federal sales account manager during my time at Cisco. I supported both the DoD and Civilian side of the federal government. I had the opportunity to work with all five branches of the military. I learned a great deal both about the sales infrastructure for a technology company and about how the military operates from a sales and security point of view. I greatly enjoyed my time there and hope to one day return to that work when my personal life affords me that opportunity. I would highly recommend this work to a motivated individual open to learning all about the technology world and the ability to travel weekly.This company does not slack off with monetary rewards for dedicated service and provides whatever is needed to get the job done.  Working with others in any group in the company is highly encouraged and supported if required.  However, upper management is severely distanced from the workers in the trenches and with excessive bureaucracy, new products can only be added to the portfolio through acquisitions.  The excess jobs requires a rebalance and restructuring annually with a reduction of 5% to 20% of the worldwide workforce.A typical day in IT at Cisco, starts early and ends late, you are always connected.  Is extremely fasted paced, with a steep learning curve, however that can be fun for a while.  Hardest part of the job was the politics, favoritism at the junior to middle management level is difficult to stomach as they have turned favored individual contributors into managers, which doesn't always translate to good management.  Most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with.Cisco offers exposure to plenty of new technology, but often with little training.  The option to work from home was a huge plus.  The constant acquisitions seem to disrupt the product pipelines as they keep changing what is offered to customers.  Things always move very quickly and keeping up is a constant challenge.I have worked at Cisco for over 10 years.  The company has been very good to me as it has given me opportunities to grow, stretch, and explore the world through my work.  As the IT industry shifts and changes, Cisco must continue to innovate and stretch its muscles to stay ahead of the competition.I have enjoyed my time at Cisco and hope to be able to contribute for another 10 years.This company is great. I love my managers and my team. They have a direct interest in my well being with the company.I also love the office setup and vibe. Everyone is super helpful and attentive.I really appreciate that the company allows flexibility in your workday and unlimited PTO. My co-workers are easy to work with, and I feel supported by team leads. I only wish the pay was a bit higher. Because of this, I doubt if I will be able to work here for very long. But for the time being, I'm enjoying learning new things and picking up a few skillsJordan • 11 minsCisco is fundamently nothing more than a VC/banking company that would prefer to outsource all work to contractors and or AP region.  As soon as it is able to will lay you off.  it has NO loyalty to employees and the HR ""people deal"" is a joke.  Since when is it hard to have a review program that focuses on your performance against goals and metrics without stack ranking you?A typical work day would involve testing and then meeting team members within and other teams. I learned a lot of testing tools and how to get inter dependent team work done in time. The work environment was always positive and friendly. The hardest part of the job was to get the overall picture of the test schedule and the most enjoyable part is you could go as far as you can to build prototypes.I worked at Cisco for many years in many capacities.  I met many wonderful people from all walks of life.  I learned that work was not the only priority at Cisco and in this culture I made great connections.  As a Lobby Ambassador, I was the face of Cisco midtown.  As the Executive Assistant I was the right hand woman of the Operations Director and as the Business Analyst to the sales team, I was an important part of team strategical planning.  The easiest part of the job was the friendships I forged-most difficult was understanding that at the end of the year or quarter the pressure is on and don't take anything personally.  Overall, I learned a lot and wouldn't change the experience for the world.I've worked for Cisco for almost one year and have enjoyed all the people I've worked with.  My manager is easy going and has the attitude of ""as long as the work get's done, I don't care about what hours you are in the office"".  I am able to work from home at least 2 days a week (more if my manager is traveling).  I would stay and convert to a Cisco employee if it were an option.CISCO is a good place to work as long as you realize your contract may end at any time. But they do provide a very laid back culture and an easy going management style.,I learned that CISCO is a work from home friendly workplace.My co-workers on average were very easy to get along with and helpful with needed information.The hardest part of the job was making human connections.My typical day at Cisco was all about collaborating and building great products.  As a PM, I worked closely with Engineers and UX designers to create a better WebEx administration experience.  I also got to play a major role to move us towards a more data-driven culture using metrics and analytics.  I learned more about analytics technologies and best practices.  Cisco is a great place to work.Cisco is filled with great people that make up the unique culture.  It is a big company and sometimes hard to get things done but overall Cisco is a good place to work. They give you the tools to work from anywhere in the world. The C Suite and VPs are going through some changes and the reverberations can be felt at all levels.  It will take some time and strong leadership to get through this and come out ok.I have been working at Cisco Systems full-time (For nearly 2 years). Continued Limited Restructures are causing talented individuals to be let go. Lack of strong senior leadership in some areas and poor decisions are being made.you typically start off with a day of thinking how you can increase the top-line and bottom-line revenue, and make your job relevant to the product(s) in a BG you support by marketing the product to the public domain in which this product is relevant, and then put action behind it to make it happen.The hardest part of the marketing job is when the product is actually a so-so one but you need to make it into a super-star product.My work experiences at Cisco as a self-employed contractor were excellent. Enjoyed working with smart global team members, constantly learned new things and made valuable contributions. Most contract roles have migrated to lower cost areas or to preferred suppliers.There are lots of politics involved in working here which can make or break your career depending on who you know or how ""liked"" you are.  Depending on which business unit you land in you may or may not have resources for personal development.  One benefit is that your direct manager is required to help you progress in the company.Very Political EnvironmentTo be successful it's better to say what VP(S) and directors want to hear rather than sharing ideas and truth's that would make product better Decisions are based on favoritism and not technically founded.TTM decisions are made at the expense of customers at times with plans to solve issue in downstream releases.  Compensation is very good as it includes high salaries, recognition awards, employee stock purchase plans, and restricted stock units"
485,Citigroup Inc.,"Good place to work . Good Opportunity to learn new things.Diverse opportunity, helpful co-workers.If you can get a manager that is understanding and realistic in regard to work/life balance then you will be very happy.There are managers who play politics very seriously and have unrealistic expectations for their employees, even if it requires you being on conference calls until 1AM and another at 7AM. They make it seem like that is a requirement to further your career, if you can manage to keep up that schedule for an extending period of time without losing your sanity.There are some great managers that are understanding, so you have to proceed with caution and understand that it might require you making a lateral job change if you end up with one who is not understanding.The benefits of this position in my opinion was the opportunity to utilize my knowledge of the mortgage and real estate markets.  This allowed me to ascend into management fairly quickly.  The work load in a typical day was enough to keep you focused for 8 hours and longer.  I was able to learn a great deal more about corporate America and how the market collapse had impacted that industry and the subsequent effects on consumers of mortgage products.  The relationships developed with co-workers and management were invaluable and made the job enjoyable each day. Were it not for the demise of the default department I would still be with this company.It's usually pretty busy and dynamic environment. There are lots of opportunities for learning and improving the system. Part of our tasks is to perform regression tests after implementations of improvements in the systems. The hardest part of the job is to find time to work in production and also with testing which requires time to evaluate, participate in conference calls and also do many tests. The most enjoyable part of the job is that if you are a sociable person, you may interact with different departments to get your job done and improve it. But you may not find collaboration from all departments and communication may be difficult sometimes.The big picture at Citi is that they care TREMENDOUSLY about their employees, and they do make a very concerted effort to make everyone feel like a piece of the whole. The truth of the matter is, at it's core, very different. The truth of the matter is that this is a big bank and employees are a number, nothing more. When it comes time to start cutting costs, the first place they go is to the employment pool. When it comes to investments, they do not spend money on the people that are already there. They instead, will waste thousands of dollars on systems that aren't tested or bring in outside agencies to evaluate the current state of affairs and spend a dime just to save a nickel. People are not the most important part of the organization.This job was a learning experience in the sense that it gave me a taste of corporate America. I learned a lot about banking and it's laws, regulations and policies. After one month of working the branch made me Head Teller. With that my responsibilities became counting the vault with an officer, count the ATM's with an officer, receive the incoming money from Brinks with an officer. I also processed daily transactions while giving exceptional customer service. Management was difficult to deal with sometimes. Co-workers were nice and they were great at training. The hardest part about this job was dealing with management. Most enjoyable part was meeting the customers of the bank.I worked for Citi almost 20 years, only regret was that I did not apply there sooner. Thoroughly enjoyed going to work there, each day was the same but at the same time each day was different - you never knew what type of calls you would receive, but all were interesting and sometimes a challenge. I always had support from managers and the options for advancement were varied and offered frequently. The bank was always exploring new and exciting programs and offered new positions often. I enjoyed working with a diverse group of people and felt like I benefitted from that experience.its a good place to work with great benefits and a competitive salary with job security.Good work/life balance for employeesFlexible hoursFrequent breaksGreat benefits. Company cares for its employees. Cross-training is encouraged. Management is compassionate and understandingColleagues are willing to work together to assist one anotherGood amount of time allowed for holidays and vacation timeCiti is a great company to work for if you're starting out. They pay well and have great benefits. The main issue I had working at Citi was that I felt a little Harassed by my managers and ultimately the managers harassing me fired me after i went to their boss. Overall not a terrible place if you don't mind sitting around waiting for work and getting discouraged for it.A typical work day at Citi consists of various projects related to HR, Java or data quality.  Citi provides many avenues to learn new technologies.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the various projects that need to be delivered.  My co-workers and management are easy to get along with and very helpful.  I've learned much about Java, HTML, XML, SQL and HR Data Quality.Citi offers excellent online training every year, good pay, benefits, matching 401k. Great people with professional and friendly atmosphere. Citi strives to value the importance of the employees and maintains activities of events for employee appreciation. Citi constantly wants to improve employee workforce conditions to inprove working procedures that benefits the employees. Management with Citi are very friendly and always willing to go that extra mile to help you learn to your full potential.This company was the best company I have had the pleasure to work with. The training was exceptional and lengthy to get all of the information we needed to learn the job perfectly and quickly. It was a complicated and confusing job at first, but with the correct and easily explained training we received, we excelled perfectly and I was very satisfied by the results and knowledge I gained. The company in itself is a very positive one. My coworkers and superiors were very kind and helpful. I could not think of a better company to work for.I worked at Citibank as a Teller for about 2-3 year. I had few manager changing there compare to my other job. The only thing I like about working there is the co-worker I met; Hate the last manager I worked with. The job is a kind of stressful, I hate the ""Sales and referrals"" pressure from the managers, especially the last manager I worked with before leaving the job (That manager was the worst, if a teller doesn't meet the sale or referral goal she give so much attitude and bullsh*t to the employees) The Last manager wasn't flexible with the work schedule due to shortage of employee and force employee to work even when they can't.I learned a lot working with Citi Bank, they have good training for employees. Great Compensation and Benefits.Great opportunity to grow and advancement, Management always helps employees to grow. My experience with Citi from Analyst to supervisor was outstanding, they provide me lots of training classes.Job culture is very friendly and supportive.Citi was a great experience.  I was lucky to meet a lot of great people along the way.  There was a lot of areas for improvement within management and who's running the departments.  Needs a complete overall to get the company to run effectively again. All in all I learned a lot and was able to expand my career while working for citi.Its a good place to work with great benefits and a competitive salary with job security but what I do is highly stressful as we handle many escalated calls everyday with extremely angry people and have to calm them down if possible and retain them with the bank. This is not easy. The co-workers are great and diverse and I get to help people.I do not mind working at citibank, you do have to be a fit for the job. I don't think I could work sitting at a desk staring at checks all day for the rest of my life, but it is not a bad or very stressful job by any means. It can be hard to advance once you've reached a certain point.  It also can be frustrating with all the change going on but you do just learn to go with the flow.Fast paced environment until you get the hang of working cases then everything slows down dramatically.Management is all about the numbers and not so much about developing future talent and leaders.Biggest perk to working for Citi would be the benefits package and work/life balance depending on the department.Well recognized company with great benefits and opportunity for it employees. I enjoyed working at Citi after more than 23 years I consider Citi my home. I enjoy working with everyone and I learned from management that clients is always comes first. Citi is consider one of the best company since they are in more than 100 countries.I manage a team of four that maintains our Citicards.com (pre-login) and Citi Online (post-login) sites.I work directly with my team, developers, testers and Business requestors to ensure updates are made correctly and in a timely manner.  I directly manage any escalations and process improvements for our channel. I work with my team on their goals and support them on any career paths.Hardest part of my job is managing differently personalities.  Being able to do so has made a stronger leader. The most enjoyable part of my job is working as a team. We work with a large group of developers and testers and seeing how everything comes together for a release can be petty rewarding.The work environment at Citi Group is absolutely top notch in its professionalism and attention to detail. The corporation and its businesses are run in such a way that quality and morality exist hand-in-hand. Attention to detail and simply doing the right thing runs through the core of everything."
23,City & County of San Francisco,"I supervised up to 15 team  members. Each day was usually a little different from the previous. Being  a manager I would coordinate projects subcontractors and the public to assure all safety procedures were in place prior to material installation. The hardest part of my job was trying to coordinate heavy equipment in public spaces. I also was in charge of  all the glass needs in each terminal at SFO.Respond to crisis. coordinate and schedule meetings with service providers, mental health professionals, attorneys, relatives, parents, and client (minor). make decisions to remove minor to and from placement. Consult with team to make a decision for the best interest of the minor. minor(s) may have mental health that can be a complicated factor in inquiring a higher level placement. Minor's psychotropic medication(s) and medical have to be up to date.Minor may also have an IEP.I really enjoy working for the city and county of san FranciscoI work with a great group of people I love working near home.working in a mental health clinic could be hectic, very busy; learned how to deal with difficult customers/clients; management are very nice, professional and lay-back type of people; coworkers are great, fun to work with; hardest part of the job is when a client is experiencing bad episode but the most enjoyable part of the job is when we are able to help clients live normal livesFantastic experience. A very hardworking team that believe in knowledge sharing. Typical days starts checking our emails and ticketing system. I learned how the entire IT network works in different locations of government. Management were a complete delight considering they hold all to a high level of accountability. Co workers have turned into life long friends, the hardest part of the job is learning quick and adapting to different set ups in the network. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing how appreciated you felt from management after a hard day of work,Loved it! Did that job twice, and would do it again, met great people, my supervisor was a great guy! I worked with the best crew I could have been with both times. Once October 2002 to April 2003 and again October 2013 to April 2013. Got one year experience there. Also did gardening at City College Of San Francisco in the Horticulture Department while I attended school, students job and Volunteer Gardening at Laguna Honda Hospital & Rehab. Center. At College June 2009 to December 2011, and Laguna Honda May 2009 to February 2012. I moved to the East Bay & had no way to commute to the City every day.If you would not mind working 60+ hours a week, with constant hand off trials and knowing other people are getting promoted because they donated money to the DA's campaign or have other ""connections""... Then this is the place for you.Majority of the hard working DA's ended up leaving to go to other DA's offices.  A handful of good ones remain.   Unfortunately there is no real training in the office, and commonly lateral DA's would have to correct and teach their superiors the law.  SFPD is not considered an entity that you work with, given all the poliical head butting.  Unlike other counties where cops are more than willing to help and do their job, SFPD puts in the bare minimal due their long and challenging history with the DA's office.Money is great!I used to train users in Office 2000, via class set up or individually one one one for over 12 years. I was the top technician to complete work orders (user requests) on desktop (PC and laptop), remote and server issues including printers & telephone systems for over 15 years. this government agency was 10 years behind in technology when I left in 2011. the most gratifying part of my job for over 15years was to be able to teach the drivers and users that had never used a PC to be able to help them learn and relief their fear from using a computer or a laptop. And to also walk them thru an application problem either on the phone or in person, this city department has over 50 sites with users on computers.When I was employed with the city & county of San Francisco I worked for a redevelopment company called Urban Strategies. It was an experience I will never forget. Everyone was so caring and it was like one big family. Helping others get on the right track and is always a great way to spend the day.The location was difficult to handle since it was in the heart of San Francisco's Tenderloin district..... It was a learning experience since their average clientele was not average. I learned a lot from the community and the people that worked there..From the start of you day there is a extreme amount of positive energy. The sense of teamwork is great and everyone is eager to succeed and get the job done.Working on san francisco busy bus route in the southeast sector of the city provding safety and directions for passengers of all agesA good place to retire from. The work pace is slow and the technology is behind. Ask a lot of questions during the interview because the job descriptions are misleading.Working here you must be a jack of all trades and a master of least a few.Like working with people and meeting people, with 2010 CensusFun place to work for with great benefits, good managers and a lot to learn. Had a good opportunity to learn about Property Taxes, and City Wide General ledger system-FAMISFamily feel, loving and caring people. Great management team"
766,City of Missouri City,"I enjoyed working with the government people here. They always appreciated the outcome of work. Got to communicate with different departments and understand the functioning of city to update the city website.The City of Missouri City is a wonderful place to begin a career, however the is not enough revenue to pay for more experienced employees, and their is little room for advancement or additional compensation. Many employees perform multiple job positions which decreases their effectiveness. Some of the upper management personnel seem disinterested in the work being implement by ground level employees and as such are not as aware of the actual work being performed or why the work is being performed. The hardest part of the job is knowing the budgetary situation and its impacts on compensation and career advancement which has a devastating affect on employee morale.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction I receive when a new residential or commercial development project I have been project manager for is completed and the customer(s) and all internal and external stakeholders are satisfied with the results.  I also enjoyed working with the elected and appointed city officials.•Conducts normal and preventative maintenance, installation, inspection and repair to the City's traffic signal systems to ensure proper operations at all times.•Responds promptly to all call-outs, including after hours and holidays; troubleshoots, diagnose, and/or take corrective action to restore the City's traffic signal systems to full and optimal operation.•Requisitions and installs parts to repair the City's traffic signal system.•Evaluates signal timing, adjusts signal timing, and makes recommendations for signal timing changes.•Performs recordkeeping activities pertaining to traffic signal timing plans, inventories, maintenance activities, and construction plan sheets.•Develops schedules and coordinates preventative maintenance activities to ensure proper and efficient operations of the City's traffic signal systems.•Coordinates all activities relating to traffic signal intersection pavement markings and signing.•May direct activities of Signal Technician I.•Performs other related duties as assigned.•Subject to 24-hour recall..I really enjoyed working for the city. I was able to create flyers and participate in community events that I helped coordinate. I learned how to take minutes from council meetings and format flyers to send out to the community."
712,City of Renton,"Managed daily customer transactions, collecting money for greens fees, driving range, and merchandise. I learned time management, communication skills, handling difficult customers, and learned what it is like to work in the customer service industry. Positive relationship with co-workers, boss, and upper management.Was a great summer job and liked my co-workers.  Learned a lot about customer service and dealing with the public.  Loved working outside everyday.A great place to work, and although it's only summer seasonal, I worked there for 8 seasons. Regular communication with customers and their needs kept me on my toes, but a reliable team helped alleviate the regular stressful burdens that came with a very busy environment. Typically would work either 4 or 8 hours days, perhaps longer, depending upon staffing needs.My mornings with the City begin with meetings and planning. Normally on Monday mornings, I review the weekly schedule with my fellow directors, and assign duties to the recreation staff; the staff will then follow the given directions. For the past seven years, my time with the City of Renton has been quite the learning experience. I have gained experience through growth and management responsibilities. All in all, this job has provided me with a skills set that I can apply in my future career.The positions I held had the caviat of ""opther duites as assigned"". I was in a non-union, management positon so if it took all night... the job still got done. It was a very hectic pace, but I found that I thrived in that environment. I was able to accommodate for anything that was tossed at me and succeeded in each task well beyond hopes or expecttionsof supervisors."

620,Clinical Research Management,"It's hard to rate CRM as I am employed by them but working offsite at a military installation and it would be hard to accurately rate what the enviroment is like working directly with CRM on a day to day basis. I can say that they are very communicative though and always try to make employees aware of any company changes, benefit changes or contract changes. Because I am in a contract position, I do not think it would be fair to rate compensation but I do like the benefits. I have always been able to reach my manager when needed and he has always helped me out when he could. Overall, I have been happy with CRM.Contractor for CRM working in Frederick.  Enjoy working with the people in my division.  Management is good, especially Human Resources.I am contractually bound at this time from making any derogatory or damaging remarks, comments, or statements about the company.I've enjoyed my time as an employee with this company. They offer competitive benefits packages to include paid vacation, sick leave, and retirement plans. I highly recommend this company for employement.A relatively hands-off federal contracting company.  They are not very involved or knowledgeable about the details of their employees work environment with the government client, and relatively ineffectual in helping when problems arise.Great company with good work life balance. Real concern for employees,  sponsors and clinical trials.  Does not put metrics ahead of quality.Felt like I had a new supervisor every 3-6 months because of high turnover rate in HQ management.A typical day at work includes:Perform studies as related to the project Coordinate and perform various functions related to research project Perform study schedulingAnalyze research dataCollect and enter research dataDevelop and maintain research databasePrepare survey keys and all required PDF FilesPrepare initial survey draftsAssist with the scanning and cleaning of dataAssist with Quality Control of dataTrain new team members on data collection proceduresI was responsible for our Talent Acquisition Team as the Manager. My role allowed me the opportunity to source, recruit, and hire professionals in the Biomedical Field. The culture at this company provided a great team environment with the management and co-workers. The hardest part of the job was working with our government customers and being able to adapt to their ever changing needs. So there was a lot of turnover due to the positions being contract positions under the government contracts.The most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying the customers and knowing every time we hired someone we were increasing company revenue. We had a direct impact on that in our Talent Acquisitions Team."
326,Clorox,"It was a fast job you had 2 move real fast and keep up. Good personality up there but they really do care about you up i liked the job.They look down on the good workers and praise the lazy workers. They believe that whatever they wanted to do was ok, didn't really care too much about how the workers feel. Didn't appreciate the hard work and dedication I put in.Load and unload trucks with forklifts, pallet jacks, or cherry pickers with Clorox products. Conducted inventory control. Managed and reviewed customer orders/requests and manually enter data of orders.Coordinated with shipper’s customer service representatives on exceptions, rush orders and order changes.It was easy money. No one on your back. laid back supervisors. Great environment clean enviornment. Really enjoyed my time there keep count of your pointsIt's an ok place to work. I moved while I was working there so the commute turned into a hassle for me. 82 miles 1 way. Not their fault.When working 4 10s a week I put up with it because I had 3 days off.Then my hours changed to 4 9s M-Th  and 4 hrs. on Friday. I tried it for about 3 months but after a while the 164 mile round trip wore on me so I put in my notice.The Clorox Company is an excellent place to work.  There is a perfect work / life balance. Good atmosphere, Safe environment, Excellent health benefits.Clorox (unlike any other company) has a positive, engaging and inspiring work environment.  You can work hard but you can also find time to play. Management encourages you to learn more and to consider advancement.  Excellent place to work but benefits are not offered to everyone.It is a traditional company with more than 100 years of history.  To advance in this company, one needs to be in the ""in group"" with the few senior managers.Keeping all safety procedures and rules enforced. Stocking and handling hazardous chemicals.  Very busy tidy work place, always new employees.The day always starts off good at Clorox. There are lots of people with different backgrounds and ages who are there to help anyone that just started the job. The thing that i loved most about this job was that they always had things for you to do. I learned that Clorox does not only ship clorox products but others as well, and that taught me once again uu cant judge a book my its cover.  At this job i also learned more about my personality as well as my future. Because the job had many people  that i got to meet and grew alone with them, I had a better understanding of what life is really about.Its a very good first job for new comers. It definitely prepared me for a warehouse workplace. The pay rate started off fair, and became excellent after a while. I liked it. My co-workers were the best.Wonderful work life balance, managers are very knowledgeable.  Work is always challenging and exciting. Co-workers are always pleasant and engaging.Unfortunately, the plant closed. I enjoyed my time working for Clorox. I learned a lot and felt like I truly contributed to the company. The pay was great and I loved the hours. I appreciated how safety conscience the plant was.It's not one of the best places to work but if you need something fast it's ag guaranteed job but the hardest part of the job is standing in the heat for that long it's a lot of drama there sothe Lee's you talk the Less you talk to people the betterClorox cares for their employees and that is shown through the people you work with. The people you work with here are irreplaceable. The culture and work environment are outstanding.Good company, a fun place to work.  A ton of visibility to upper level management.  Very friendly work environment, I would recommend.  They compensate the interns very well.I love working at Clorox and would continue if I could pursue my ideal role from my current location.   Unfortunately, such an opportunity does not exist in my current location. Next steps for me would mean continued heavy travel and / or another move for my family and me.My first job was at The Clorox Company, and they do great job of teaching you how to transition from college to a work environment. A typical day deals with a lot of meetings, phone calls, and some lab time. Most managers are strong people developers who truly want you to succeed. Coworkers are friendly and the work environment promotes collaboration allowing you to talk to anyone at any level at any time. The hardest part of the job is that when you're in a position you have to stay in that position for about 2 years before they will rotate you. Most enjoyable part of the job is how rewarding it is to see the products you've worked on in stores.Great place all co workers treated you like family. Learned so much while working there. Great benefits from helping you out with school and time off if needed.Worked as a team member. Ran machinery, assembly, and fork truck. There was only one other women on the shift that I worked at so I missed getting to talk to someone that had the same interests as I did. I had a hard time sleeping during the day because I had  sons at home at that time. The lack of sleep really got the best of me.Need to be able to work independently and with others that included diverse leadership styles to include:Extreme detailed, clear written and oral communication skills, taking ownership of a project from beginning to end, define current and future processes, work in an extremely fast pace environment, high quantity and quality of work needed"

I learned great time management skills and interpersonal skills. Great co-workers. Hardest part of the job - not sure."
575,Collabera,"Good Company to work with. Management is also helpful and co operative. They helped me for initial relocation expenses.Office is also Good. Help me in getting a Good Project.I didn't want to stay in the Staffing industry but it was a great first resume builder. I still hold a good relationship with my boss and see him at Earls from time to time. I wanted to move up and got a promotion my first 3 months but after a while, I got sick of a desk job. I like the hustle an bustle of nightlife and want to be involved with marketing, promotions, and sales. Collabera was great management experience but I want more!Company did great with handling issues that arose during contract.  Great staff and very helpful getting me acclimated to the work environment as well as ensuring frequently that all needs were met.  Would recommend this company for any IT contractor.I've worked with Collabera twice on two different contracts. They establish effective relationships with their clients, their contractors and do a great job of making both stakeholders happy. They view contractors as strategic resources. Outstanding Professionals.Great people to work with. In all it is a really great company to work with.Just please try to help your customers more quickly. Keep up the good work.They tell that when your Temp Job ends they will have something else for you, but they don't. I did like the fact that while I was working there I was always able to get in contact with someone if necessary. They were very nice and would call you every so often to ask how everything was going at work.With Collabera, I worked at CAT in Denison, TX.  I enjoyed my position while working there because I knew exactly what my job requirements were and had the knowledge to achieve my duties.  I appreciated that the management team gave me direction and tools, and allowed me to come up with my own techniques/processes to complete the task at hand.My co-workers and I were very successful at dividing the workload and completing the tasks that were assigned to us.  We actually completed our project 6 months earlier than expected.  This was partially due to the reports that I created to show and changes within the system on a daily basis. This report prevented duplicate efforts since there were several departments working on the same project.The hardest part of the job was when a supplier didn't respond at all to a request that was sent to them. To tackle this obstacle, emails were sent with follow up reminders.  If we continued to receive no response, the supplier's lack of response was escalated to the management team for further action.I truly enjoyed working with a fun group of people at CAT.  The most enjoyable part of the job was creating a rapport with the suppliers and being able to reach and surpass goal expectations.Assured stock levels on the sales floor are maintained at all times. Assisted customers with the selection of product. Supervised Loading/Unloading of trucks and checked orders. Prepared inventory reports and matched them with the store records. Generated the invoices for the customers to send them with the trucks. Participated in store meetings and trainings.Assured stock levels on the sales floor are maintained at all times. Assisted customers with the selection of product. Supervised Loading/Unloading of trucks and checked orders. Prepared inventory reports and matched them with the store records. Generated the invoices for the customers to send them with the trucks. Participated in store meetings and trainings.I will never work for them again. They never respond to your requests or questions, but if you do anything wrong they will bother you about it. They suck, suck, suck.The company treats its contractors very poorly and under pays them. Contractors often complained to me that all of their support came from India and no one seemed to care. Contractors get no support from Collabera once they are placed in a job. Collabera employees do not have it any better. Management is too focused on the competition to focus on their own employees. Many regional managers are under-trained, do not respect their employees, and the turnover is very high. There is no training. The pay is mediocre and the commissions are, too.see previous review - Collabera is a very good Contract Agency.  I was able to work at IBM for 5 years without any issues with Collabera.  They are professional and everything was handled in a professional manner.Collabera is a good contracting firm to work for, pay and benefits are decent. Their representatives would contact and want to know how things were going. Also, after a contract was completed they made attempts to find the contractor a new contract.I will recommend Collabera to others,  They are a professional IT recruitment agency and has been responsive to all my inquiries. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI have been approached by this ""company"" on over a dozen occasions in the past few months, sometimes via email, sometimes via telephone.   All saying ""We have a postion in PA, Want it?""  (and that is hardly paraphrased).    Oh, and I live 3000 miles AWAY, which they would know if they read the resume of mine they supposedly have.   Today alone, I have had 3 phone calls, and 3 emails, all amounting to not much more than one-liners.    The first phone call was at 5am!.     Attempts to reach the local office to complain resulted in ""We are not accepting calls at this time"".   Seriously?   Based on this unprofessional conduct, I will never to business with them, and they are doing a huge disservice to any employer they represent.In my opinion, Collabera is a great place to work and really has great training for those looking for entry level type positions.The manager at BofA are great. They are very understanding and willing to assist in any way possible. The work experience there was okay. I mean Okay. I like to keep busy. So the majority of the time there. We were looking for something to do. I like to have job security to fill like I am earning an honest pay. The co-work were great to work with. The hardest part of the job was waiting for some grant us access to the different software applications we needed to complete the request.Collabera has provided multiple opportunities to me with its clients to provide consulting services for wireless, wireline and backbone internet solution opportunities.Great contract company always on time and upfront with news from client. in my opinion it could make the contract agency stronger if they could offer some type benefits as in PTO, Sick time. other then that its a great agencyOnce you get a job and or the assignment ends, they don't contact you for another position. Never got a call back after my first assignment ended.the point of contacts through this temp agency are awesome some of the nicest people I have ever had the pleasure of working with"
423,College of American Pathologists,"I have been working at College of American Pathologists for about four years, and I really don't have any commends about this Place..........!Good place to work, I have been promoted 3 times over the last 9 years.  Each job I have been able to use my current skills and they have sent me to some training to get more skills.Working for the CAP was an amazing and educational experience.  In the year of my contract working with the college, I learned so many different aspects of marketing, including event coordination.  Definitely a wonderful place to work.Horrible directors and management for IS. Too many managers. All talks - but no work is done. Too many leaders in IT... Ignorant about any technical knowledge so they preferred to get job done by consulting companies.Leadership don't trust employees so no place for growth or learning... Too many road blocks to get something done.Do not waste your career!Fulfilling roles in medical association supporting pathologists and clinical laboratories. Dedicated effective staff.  Good benefits and some opportunities for advancement.One would definitely dream to be a part of this company and I am glad I was one. Fun place, flexible for employees, environment to learn a lotCAP is dedicated to improving the professional growth and development of pathologist. Offers excellent education and benefits to its staff. CAP standards promote quality work and a cohesive work environment.CAP is NOT a very nice place to work. Managers lie. Offer zero support on issues. If your new. The old employees will do everything they can to make your life a miserable. So take this advice. If you like back stabbing this is the company for youConsiderable work independence and focus on customer satisfaction.  CAP is undergoing significant change related to culture, information technology and response to the marketplace.A premier medical association with a dedicated staff focused on supporting its physician membership, patient safety, and the worldwide laboratory community.  To accomplish this mission the organization makes the necessary investments in technology and personnel.The CAP offers a number of different schedule options. Most of the co-workers are friendly. However, there is very little room for growth and advancement as a young adult.I have been employed with the College of American Pathologists for 12 years now. Overall it is fast past, productive, and comfortable place to work. The company is family oriented and offers flexibility to aid in work-life balance. Most of the employees are friendly however there are number who come off as bullies. The culture has changed and the company has become top heavy with management. In some areas of the company there is no room for growth.This company took care of it's employees by paying them very well and offering great benefits.Awesome place to work. Just like a home away from home. Management worked closely with you to make sure you were comfortable with new programs. Easy going and productive work environment. Collaborative team efforts.I have never worked in a more depressing, dysfunctional office, with so little communication, training, support, and teamwork in my 35 years in the workforce. Management doesn’t give you any info to do your job, or tell you where to get it, then blames you for not knowing. They’ll throw you under the bus so they look good. No matter which way you go, they micromanage you, then tell you it's wrong, you can't win. I've never worked anywhere past 12noon on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, except this place. We don't have some Federal holidays off, like Martin Luther King Day - ridiculous, especially in DC! When a support person is doing a great job, they get fired, because the Office Admin. feels threatened.The College is devoted to enhancing the professional development of its members and promoting excellence in patient care. A truly wonderful group of co-workers, who exemplify the CAPs values."
738,Columbian Chemicals Company,"I worked here for nearly 12 years and was considered a great employee and even trained others.  Safety has always been a priority for the company and the employees enjoy the work atmosphere.Good people working on combustion engineering.  The rubber applications area I worked on was considered mostly a commodity area so very little new product development.Working for this company provided the opportunity to advance as an Executive Assistant. I was able to work individually, as well as part of various teams, I was engaged and valued."
439,Comcast,"Great company & great people, great benefits as well. I have learned many things while working at Comcast- I have done an overall training of our department to grow within the companyHuddles are conducted each morning to review performance and address anything necessary for the day or week.  Consistent rotation for greeting and helping customers with an easy Queue system to track who is in the store.  Management and upper management always actively looking for your opinion of workplace, opportunities, as well as customer feedback. Hardest part of the job is getting to know the system and working for a company which does not have the best track record for customer service.  It's hard to work with people who do not like this company, which is often, but it is worth it when you are able to change the perspective of the company with your store and your own customer service.The best thing about this job is the co workers. The benefits are okay. Alot of time off. But work/life balance isnt that great. Supervisors are always on you about metrics. Numbers numbers numbers. Your numbers can be great for a couple of months with no issues until you have a bad month then your integrity as a technician is put into question.  And then all of a sudden you start receiving corrective actions for little things so they can get you out the door. Its not about the customer its about metrics. The pay is terrible for the type of work you do (climbing poles, getting into attics, rewiring houses, correcting mistakes that contractors didnt correct, angry customers, faulty equiptment and management on your behind. At&t deals with the same amount of issues but atleast they get paid well for it and they have union.A typical day at work usually is not so routine.  I can either climb a ladder, enter a crawl space, or simply install inside a customer's home.  I have learned quite a bit working for Comcast.  I have learned the basics of cable installation, also how to communicate with customers and troubleshoot their problems.  The management is very helpful and supportive.  My coworkers are very friendly and funny.  The hardest part of the job would have to be working out in all of the weather. The best part of the job is interacting with customers and learning more and more about my job.This was by far, the worst company I've ever worked for.  Management fostered a snitch culture among the employees, encouraging them to inform on one another, driving down morale.  In addition to informing on one another, employees constantly watch for 'weakest link' tickets and pounce, not for the edification of the employee, but for the sole purpose of making themselves look good at the expense of that employee.  In addition, management had its favorites and its designated 'red-headed stepchildren', often deliberately embarrassing other reps in front of their peers.My advice - do your career a favor - AVOID COMCAST!!!!this company could be a great one to work for if they could get all departments on the same page with the same ethical standards. As a customer facing employee, the majority of the job was being screamed at for misinformation, lies, or unwanted products being given to customers by phone representatives, all while trying to upsell those angry customers into more services, then begging for a 5 on the satisfaction survey. In the ever-complex technical world that Comcast inhabits, amazingly the only two fixes offered to any issue are a new TV box, or a new modem regardless of the actual issue(s) affecting service.Normal working day. Job training with new software. Super Management Team, benefits and excellent working environment.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customer issues which was not a problem really, especially when we had to apply what we learned during the training on how to deal with these types of situations. The most enjoyable part is the rewards. Comcast knows how to shower its employees with gifts, stipends and also the quarterly pay granted every individual employee sales percentage. This is what to expect while working at Comcast Cable Communications.I would worked 11 hour shifts. I would take customers calls to help them with their TV, Internet and phone service. I learned different ways to help meet customers. The management was great with helping you learn to be a better agent. I was part of a team of 14 so we would have have weekly meetings to discuss problems and new options coming out. The supervisor would also do one on one meetings to share with you your strengths and weakness. The hardest part of my job was always trying to find away to make all of the customers happy. The most rewarding part of my job was when I was able to lower a customer's bill or make customers day better.This is secure job and some of the benefits are good, but overall a difficult place to work. Customer service, although on the surface seems decent, is severely lacking. Technicians can do anything and everything to support the customer and provide great customer service, but every other line of customer service is defective in many ways. Pay is very low in comparison to other communications companies and requirements for promotion are only getting more absurd.I was able to do my work without supervision.  If I needed to work with my team, we were allowed to collaborate on issues. I learned a lot of new technical skills. Management was awesome, until they changed directors.  I loved my co-workers.  They were always willing to help, when I was new. Hardest part of my job at the end was dealing with the time restraints that were put on us once the director changed everything about our job.  I love talking to people, and giving good customer service, as well as resolving the customers issues.I worked at Comcast for many years. Moved up through several positions and enjoyed each position that I took on. It is more difficult to maintain a position in the customer service and sales departments due to the ever changing stats that must be adhered to but it is possible to get the job done. Management, for the most part, was always helpful and friendly. Once I moved into a less customer facing position and worked from the back office, I started to really enjoy my Comcast life. Office team was much smaller than the call center teams and the full team including management were able to actually get to know one another. I definitely wouldn't mind going back. I would like more money, though.Typical day at work would consist of taking calls from people who wanted to switch companies or add or remove services, or people who had service problems or billing problems, etc....  Some days would consist of team meetings in which we went over our team's numbers and other days consisted of coaching where we went over our individual performances.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the people I worked with and the feeling of appreciation from customers who believed I did everything in my power to help them.  The hardest part of the job was when I wasn't able to help people to their satisfaction for one reason or another despite my efforts to do so.Spent 13 years working for them in various capacities. Worked in the field at two locations as a technician for first year and a half then eleven + in two call centers. During that time I saw a lot of changes. Some good and some not. High turnover. Toughest thing was providing good quality customer service because of lack of training and enough tools at your disposal to assist customers. Company had a perception that they were providing great service. Comcast management realized based on responses from employees that it was frustrating and possessed limited abilities to succeed. They have since changed their policies, procedures and expectations for call center representatives.After 1.5 years of working for Comcast Xfinity, I can honestly say that I learned a lot about problem solving, great customer service delivery, and enhanced my computer skills. I have learned to address technical equipment issues as well as interpreting complex code errors from customers' accounts, turning them into basic explanation. Management hasn't been always on top of their game, this year due to short-staffing, employees quitting, but at the end of the day management still pulls through. Overall, Comcast has a lot of opportunity for different positions to apply for and also brings out the best in you. The sales environment can be quite stressful with customer complaints and coworker/new hire ambitions. However, adapting to that kind of environment will only make you stronger.In 16 years, 20 total in all with the company and different owners.  I had always been respected and worked well in the company Instead of having opportunities past your grade is tough after your at the top.  To move to management or headend is impossible unless your willing to relocate.  The Northwestern supervisors were very professional and helpful.  The Midwestern supervisors had no clue to the extent of the experience differences there is to the other areas.  I was farther into fiber than coax in the NW.  It was a night and day experience in the two areas. No matter what, always work hard.Great company, good benefits and a nice people. I started in 1984 and worked as a construction tech, moved into Installation, service and on to Head End operations.This was followed by deployment of an enterprise network, An all fiber network under the name of cell back haul.Routing cellular traffic and metro Ethernet traffic through our facilities and into local points of contact throughout our region.Deploying DWDM transport equipment, active and passive.Monitoring equipment daily, maintaining, servicing and organizing and repairing as needed.Testing, installing new routers, switches, installing circuits on a daily basis.Testing and turning up of 1g,10g, and 100g optical links.I will always value this expearance with Comcast as I endeavor to seek new opportunities.Working in cable you have to be ready and willing to adapt to changes very quickly. With almost everything being done over high speed internet the customers needs often dictate how your day will go. Overall this is an excellent company to work for with great benefits and room for advancement. The crew of technicians work hard to provide quality service to the customers as does the management team. Thought the years I've learned how to adapt quickly and change directions at a moments notice. Dealing with customers can be the hardest part of the job at times, but also the most satisfying when you can resolve an issue for a truly thankful customer.I was putting in 60 hour weeks steadily and they were billing techs as part time employees ontop of contractor per job compensation which ended in a class action lawsuit for unpaid overtime. I did not participate in this lawsuit but it caused this installation to go under.We were required to complete 10-15 jobs per day some days working up to 15 hours at a time, 6 days a week. Customers were often very irritated and angry before I even met them due to previous technicians sub par work. When you work with a large group of individuals the work reflects on everyone involved. I was able to relax customers and eliminate repeat service calls by educating them on the services properly.PROS: Good Pay, Good Health Benefits, 401k, Quarterly Bonuses,  40hrs vacation (yearly), employees who know what they're doing help you out.CONS: Forced to make sales in any position, Supervisors/Management never available, Information provided in training not acurate, Customers you handle constantly screaming, cussing, degrading you while you have to keep professional demeanor, can still get in trouble even while following policy, No job security.If you can handle not having any support or any form of leadership and can handle overly irate customers while biting your tongue and have your job dependent on metrics that you truly have no control over and constantly being given misinformation then penalized for utilizing the misinformation then this is the job for you oh also they won't mention this until after your hired but be sure to sharpen up on your sales pitches because this is definitely a large portion of your job requirement.The hours are long, expectations a bit unrealistic due to varying skill levels. You have your workers who aren't that great but can knock out a lot of jobs, or the truly knowledgeable workers who don't have enough time to get everything done properly and up-to-code.  Corporate environment can be a bit shady, people get fired for bringing up the word union or making too much noise on issues. Management are just pawns of the corporate system here. However compared to a lot of companies, they're not all bad.   Pay is average for low voltage; however, benefits really are great as well as quarterly bonuses. You will deal with a lot of cleaning up Comcasts mess so besides hands-on experience you better have customer service skills as well.    I give it 3 stars due to there being so much room for improvement and they put the almighty dollar over anything else even customer or employee experience.Never in all my years of work have I had the pleasure of working with a group that cared so much about the customer. So much so that I now worry about every interaction and find ways to better myself, all on behalf of supporting our departments that ultimately support our customers, the ones that I work for and pay my paycheck. The people I am surrounded by are intimately aware of their impact on the customer, and every decision is scrutinized for ways in which we can better serve them. I am proud to work with such dedicated people."

They have a great portal to track work performed and benefitsvery nice  people there, love to help and answer if you asking for .but not quite good for people really want to build up skills"
369,ConAgra Foods,"Love the benefits and the pros.Hours great if you like to work 12 shifts. My supervisor was great. Sometimes worked  7 days. I loved it.Manufacturing/Cost Accounting is an environment that takes a certain individual, so be sure that you are comfortable with that environment prior to stepping into the arena.Very flexible work life balanced place to work. Constant change is always going on due to lot's of management movement. Training is not as strong as it was in the past. Lost lots of experienced employees over the past year.This was a job that needed me there every day on time, ready to make the orders that were needed for that day. We made protein bar for building muscles. some of the batches need a cure time for holding until the batch was ready. Management was tuff on making sure product would run normal on the line without any tweaks to the equitment.Management was great. The pay was good. The fellow workers were of a great help. It is kinda fast paced, but after the first hour of your shift it did die down alot.This is a great paying job for the job that you do. The office staff is great at what they do. The environment in the plant is cold as it has to be to keep the food at correct temps. So, dress warm and layer clothing.I have experience in QA, Production leader ship, leading production employees on the line. I work long hours if needed , to get job done. I fill in in defferent departments if needed,due to my experience..I lead the ff1 department in our recycle team.Could be better in some areasCould be worse in some areasGood Pay For This AreaUnionizedBenefits..Medical,Dental and Vision401KConAgra was a very large company with an incredibly diverse product portfolio.  The decision to acquire Ralcorp in order to become the major player in private brand products was ill fated; many of ConAgra's branded products competed with the private brands purchased and created a cannibalization effect.  This decision was what lead ultimately to the breakup of ConAgra and concurrent corporate reorganization,very good pay, most sections of plant are climate controlled. very clean!!Union facility, updated lunchroom, company discounts on conagra productsBurn up in the summer and freeze during the winter! Business operates day by day and management does not use common sense in decisions that affect employees. Management shows no appreciation to employees and has mentality that if you keep employees mad they will work harder! Co-workers are good to work with and job pays well for the area and benefits are average for this size company. Could be a good place to work and I really like and appreciate my job, but when you work for greedy stock holders all employees are just a number. Employees make the company money and should be treated as the greatest asset but Conagra senior management feel they are more important and they know best period!The time that I worked for ConAgra food were a very pleasant and productive work enivorment. The management department were fair to all staff and highly believed in customer rights.Nice bunch of people to work with driving distance was great learned a lot of things there packageing cans to putting ingredients together for different productscompleting daily assignments staying on task and assisting with packaging operators , ordering parts and scheduling repairs around production schedulevery hot work days and very stressful not to trust management management  just like to fire people co workers are ok stress and heat nothing enjoyableTheir were many changes over the 10 yrs, most of it good. Great opportunities to cross training in various areas of the business. Worked with many management levels on a daily basis.I loved working with ConAgra and was proud to be a part of their team. Coworkers made it fun.  I am a casualty of the move to Chicago and dismantling of the companies many brands.The hardest part of the job was waiting for the axe to fall and seeing many families affected by their job loss.the work schedule for slim jims is terrible, have to work 7days before you get any days off.  work most weekends, sucks.bakery side is not much better.  u get a schedule of what you are suppose to run each day.  you come in to work to find they have changed the days schedule.  do this on a regular basis.  it gets really old.  you have 2 maybe 3 different start times. depending on what the schedule says.  come in on one start time to find they have changed the schedule.  frustrating.Family type work atmosphere. Learning opportunities available and advancement. Management and co-workers easy to work with on a daily basis. The people are the most enjoyable part of the job.Overworked.  Good pay.  Liked the employees.  Communication was not stellar.  Boss was good but overworked too.  Generally no one was happy.  Company was bought out, laid off a lot of people and moved the headquarters.It's very hard work.Heavy lifting and working ovens and big heavy pots for mixing.  Co-workers good. Rotating shift not good. Temp. Service so if people not shoe have to work."

The goal was to prove to the Department of Labor that we were not displacing any U.S. workers for positions held by visa dependent employees.  First, we posted the job on various websites and newspaper ads, candidates would apply, and I would review each application to determine if their qualifications met the requirements.  If so, I would conduct initial phone interviews, and if their qualifications remained strong, I would then schedule a second phone interview with the hiring manager so they could delve deeper into their experience and skills.The work in itself was slightly challenging only because this was a different type of recruitment, and after I had tracked and updated all the necessary information, our legal team had to review everything until they submitted the files to DOL (Department of Labor).

572,Concurrent Technologies,"Company is falling apart after losing several contracts.  They continually lay people off after telling them everything is fine.  Upper management is absolutely clueless on how to run a business.Management has dismissed many great and knowledgeable employees.  Contracts have diminished and propaganda spewed.Was a fun place to be employed at. Went down hill the past few years. Hours flexible. Got along with most co workers. Day light hours.The most enjoyable parts of my job were the ability to interact across a large organization that had many focus areas which allowed me to experience many areas of industry and client spaces.In terms of lending assistance to  employees to make themselves marketable, this company does nothing in terms of compensation for CEs.  As a non-profit there are no bonuses and the management team is out of Johnsotown, PA -- hundreds of miles away.  This is a job only.I liked the work and travelling but some of the employees behave like a bunch of two year olds.Most enjoyable part of my job is working with nice, friendly people."

On the job, you will learn every day as medical documents and rules are updated, systems are changed are for the better, and new insights are made.I've been with this company for 3 years and I really like it here. Yes, there have been a lot of changes but most have been positive. Flexible work schedules, good benefits and casual dress. The culture here is unlike other places I have worked. I also enjoy the people I work with.Very un organized the systems are very out dated and down most times. Management don't have a clue. Staff very immature and have horrible communication skills don't like to share information. Worse place to work. Very low salary and medical benefits very expensive. Not sure how this company still around. They're so focus on numbers and don't care about their employees. Very high turn over rate.I left two years ago - a happy day in my life.  If you were among ""the anointed"" by management, you'd do well.  Otherwise, the best you could hope for was to be ignored.Love the Flexible hours.  The pay could be better. Nice Culture. The dress is casual. There are activities that bring the people together.Days are very much the same. Time is flexible so long as you work 40 hours a week. Very intelligent managers and senior members. Great work environment that makes coming to work enjoyable. Would recommend to anyone pursuing a career in the healthcare industry.Do not work here. Terrible micro-management. Horrible benefits and hours.  All software is outdated. No money in IT infrastructure.A lot of promises made upon hiring that were simply untrue.  Majority of auditors have no actual healthcare experience and do not appreciate those who do. Very territorial over learning most senior auditors do not want others promoted and create a very hostile environment.great work place the collection manager is a little  on the unsavory side. But other than that its a great place to work. I would love to work in a different deptI started whenever I wanted, which was nice, as long as I worked and eight-hour day.

There is not room for advancement and the company does not honor it's long term employees.Smart, professional work environment. Wonderful group of people to work with.Recent acquisition and merger have created more of a 'corporate' feel. Very intense work environment. Be ready to give 110% every day. But, also very much a team environment.Work ethics have diminished. Pay has been cut in half. Poor management with no relatable job skills. Does not promote from within.Nice place - very disorganized as far as project planning and execution is concerned. Nice physical environment and good people.This company is now involved in multiple law suits because of its poorly run organization. The only benefit is the company paid well and was flexible which was great for anyone attending school.Laid back, yet productive.  Did your job, nobody bothers you.  They showed their appreciation for a job well done.  I would go back if they called me.I can't believe what a great family to work for. They reward, appreciate and are always in good moods. They CARE about people.Great company. Very unique industry but leaders in that segment.Connolly is a great opportunity for an individual that has not been in the healthcare field for a long time. Job is not challenging in the skill set that I have acquired."
762,ConocoPhillips,"I had a fantastic ConocoPhillips work experience. I elected for the severance and everything was nicely timed. The management was very disappointing but I got to work on big projects and was compensated well.I felt like the stress of the job was largely artificial. I didn't work very hard but definitely harder than my peers and was able to get 2 ratings and one 1 rating.Managers dont care about employees anymore. it was a struggle for everyone cutting throats for their jobs. Used to be a great place to work. since the oil price dropped, thats all in the past.Benefits are horrible but the management in the southeastern New Mexico is wonderful. Company as a whole has some issues.  It doesn't pay very well they start out out at the very bottom and it's very hard to get a raise and very hard to promote. They need to promote people who have ambition to move up and learn more don't hold someone down.There are a lot of great people to work with here but the bureaucracy makes it difficult to push big projects to completion and have a big impact.There is not always great interaction between the different business functions and groups try to make themselves look good instead of looking for what is best for the company.Traffic control - Logging in/out scale traffic - Inspect of all cars/trucks.As for management - Their skill and experience are not strong. ..........Past tense..it was a good company. Senior management will not run it like a large independent oil and gas corporation, that it is. Its not Exxon...don't try to run it like it is, quit comparing the company to Exxon, Chevron, BP & shell...Great co-workers. Great benefits. The company is pretty large for an independent, so I would expect more layoffs in the near future until the company is more in line with the size of peer companies.The management team is great and they are doing their best to keep open communication as the industry is in its downturn.  The co-workers bring this pace to life and are a joy to be around.Like any major in the O&G space, they are working hard to manage the downturn in the industry.  Given the right job in the right management team, COP is a good place to work.ConocoPhillips gave me the opportunity to expand my experience as a Cost Control Specialist. I had the opportunity to travel and work with people from different countries and cultures and was able to support them gaining the recognized expertise in multicultural relations.The managers have an open door policy and are willing to listen and assist if possible. The people are also great! I came in with a learning curve having been in Higher Education and the help I received was great!Oil and gas prices required continued workforce reductions.Obtained extensive knowledge of managing employees, budgets and projects.Obtained extensive knowledge of Land, both surface and mineral.Long hours/dangerous work in the Oil Field/not for everyone/work outdoors in extreme heat and or cold. Not much family time/can be called on to work weekends as well/pays reasonably wellIf market is good all is fine - downturn mens layoffs which happened in '15 & '16. I retired before that happened in June 2016during layoff period office environment became toxic - ""throwing people under the Bus"" - Blame game - heavy office politicsGreat support from coworkers.  I learned a lot about the economics in the oil and gas industry.  Management seemed to take a great interest in employees.Great company if you want to develop yourself professionally as a new hire, but unfortunately the company has not been managed well since the spin-off from PSX in 2012. The company mismanaged their costs and their capital discipline during the lead up to the crash in prices in 2015, which has resulted in massive layoffs and earning losses. The company retains a few good assets that are competitive and will enable them to keep their doors open for a long time. The company touts itself as an independent (nimble) E&P company, but it's unfortunately held back by the top-down management and gridlock bureaucracy.I enjoyed my tenure at ConocoPhillips. The folks I work for and with were largely top-notch individuals with solid skill sets. My Business Unit was unique in that it seemed to always attract quality team players who enjoyed the basin we worked and the results we achieved. It is unfortunate that market volitility had such a deleterious affect on the industry as a whole. In the end, the bonus outcome is that many of us get an opportunity to re-invent ourselves (in my case, again).ConocoPhillips is a good place to work if the price of Oil is high. They have a difficult time forecasting and managing the business If the oil price is low.Work there for 19 years and really have nothing good to say about the company other than meeting some really good people. I lost my job to some low life that never came to work and spent the last 11 months doing his job out in the field.our work is hard but we enjoy it my team work is goodand everybody work together management is oksupervisor stay on top of everything and work with us on any issuesOverall people are nice and pay is good but going through a down cycle due to low energy commodity prices.... maybe a good time to join if you are a contrarian.As a college student they market their ""Engineering Academy"" as a great training program, however it's just virtual training classes and computer based learning. It is helpful, but definitely not what I would call a great training program. Also, the company needs to make up its mind if it is going to be an independent or a major."
655,Conservation International,"I was constantly surrounded by people who were passionate about the environment and truly loved coming to work each day. A lot of room for growth and developmentEverything about this company screams idealistic and driven - CI is a very forward-thinking group with a lot of potential to make a dramatic impact in the realm of international conservation and development. Opportunities for advancement from within are often significant as of late due to high turnover of employees, but they struggle to retain talent and often are reluctant to advance individuals from entry-level to more senior positions without a decent amount of corporate networking.That said, this is a great group and, less a few of the management staff, are excellent people to work with.CI is a great company that has a strong mission and employees that are passionate about what they do, where they work, and the people they help."
701,Continental Mills,"I've done a lot more for a lot less. It could be a very good place to work. The leaders there seem to be afraid to learn from their mistakes and are not very open to suggestions. The job security is great and the pay and benefits are about as good as you can find now.Running production is a very fast pace environment which makes the job great. Must be a person that doesn't mind to be on the move.  While running all the different products means it's not the same day in and day out.  It is something new everyday!!  The best job I ever had!!!I left a good place of employment for Continental Mills. Or rather the promise of something better there. The grass is not always greener. It is a place that beset with the same problems as any factory in this. Morale is not so great. Emphasis on making money at the expense of employees personals lives. Benefits were slightly better. Pay was marginally better but the hoops one had to jump through to improve that were comical. No hope for forward progression to management. I had a hard time adjusting to the by the book approach they stressed and my training was thoroughly frustrating. I dont want to condemn it completely. Some people can thrive there at the expense of integrity and honesty. Alot of you will find the reputation of being a good employer a little bloated ... Its a factory just a different kind of one, with a the failings of any factory.CM is a great place to work, they have excellent benefits and the people for the most part are awesome to work with.  Overtime to get job tasks completed during busy seasons or month end is rarely available. Cubes for work space unless in supervisor or manager positions.Awesome company to work for because of its open door policy,management encouragement on committee participation,training to improve on process skills.Co-workers were always lending a helping hand.Hardest part of the job was working at nightMost enjoyable part of the job was trouble shoot issues and be able to overcome any problems to accomplish goalsA company you can grow with.  Great benefits.  Always growing. Incredible employee relations and always wants the employee to succeed in their career and gives the employee the tools to succeed.the work will tear up your body.  advancement is given to people who kiss butt to the right people.  it doesnt matter if you deserve or are good for the advancement it matters if they like you enough to give it to you.Great company with room to learn and grow. Great employees and management team.This company is the worst. They don't care about their employees at all. The HR department is an absolute joke. Nobody cares about safety or the health of the workers. There might be some departments that are okay, but I never saw them. Just a lot of unhappy workers. No thanks. I'll look for something that actually makes a difference.I'm thankful for the Job but there is not but room for advancementGreat place to work! Good pay with benefits. Some team leads need a pride analysis.The women are horrible! Racists! If the women don't like you....you are gone. They do not like white girls.there are too many women in packaging..... it makes it a horrible place to work.... if you get a job in the warehouse or in processing youll be just find if you are a maleEverybody was friendly and very helpful, enjoyed the experience working with themGreat company. Great group of people. Very knowledgable staff."
377,Conversant,"Conversant is full of smart people and smart products. While the digital media space has become cluttered, fragmented suppliers will consolidate, joining Conversant as one of a handful of true premium addressable digital media companies.I learned a lot while working here and am ready to take my skills into the sales industry. I have supported various Account Executives here with all pre-sales support and planning.From it's origins the company was a ""meritocracy"" - it rewards employees that excel at their work.  People that are just looking for a place to sit and get a salary, however, also end up here - though most of them end up leaving (both of their own accord and asked to leave).  Management listens for the most part and compensation is competitive, but perhaps not as much for early careerists.Great company culture. Great/smart associates. Benefits are very competitive with a 5% match on 401k. Room for growth in many of the positions within the business.Fun work Place with supportive management. Excellent co workers, great working hours and vacation time. Plenty of room to learn and move to other departments.Conversant (then known as ValueClick) bought Dotomi a few years ago. Not long after the Dotomi CEO became the ValueClick CEO after the then-current CEO retired. Dotomi and the new CEO were based in Chicago so the new guy decides that everything is better in Chicago so slowly makes Chicago the center of the merged company's universe. More people in Chicago. More promotions in Chicago. Decision making moved to Chicago. Technical leadership now coming out of Chicago. Why? Because Chicago. Maybe working in Chicago it's great but for the rest of us, it blows. We're being ignored and marginalized so all we see is a complete lack of, or incompetent leadership.I love my job at Conversant -- it's very different from my previous research jobs in many good ways.A typical day of work involves lots of free tea and coffee; meetings with friendly, engaging coworkers; planning sessions and discussions with my manager; a few hours of programming; and a lot of creativity and innovation.I've learned a lot about the media/marketing/advertising industry and increased my technical skills in SQL database programming, R programming, predictive modeling, and analysis techniques.The management here is the best I've encountered.  My manager tends to be more of a coach or academic advisor than a boss, and I never feel micromanaged.Similarly, my co-workers seem engaged, energetic, interesting, and fun -- it is a pleasure to come in to work each day to work with these friends.The hardest part of the job are the demands to be better and faster than the competition, which is no easy task in the past paced advertising tech industry.  Sometimes I may have to work overtime to keep up with projects, but because I enjoy my job I don't mind this too much.The most enjoyable part of my job is having the ability to invent and innovate.  I am happy to work on projects because I know my work will be used, not thrown away (in my previous job I worked on several projects that stalled, failed, or were canceled, and this was quite frustrating)."
75,Conviva,Free LunchFree SnacksFriendly and well located campusUpper management and sales need to be more upfront about the company direction and future
735,Corporate Executive Board,"THose with masters or PHDs treated those working towards a graduate degree and just had a BA as if they were not smart enough or qualified to interact with clients.There was one individual who was the reason for 2 people leaving the company and management promoted him because of his knowledge even though his colleagues and CLIENTS were unhappy with the way he interacted with clients.I went in with high hopes & came out nothing but disappointed- specifically with management. The culture is super inmature & management lacked any leadership.Typical day for me would involve attending many meetings and working long hours to ensure all work was completedMy manager was great but was also stretched very thin.  My team was wonderful and I could always rely on them to get their work doneMy work life balance was not great and working while on vacation was the norm.  This does not happen everywhere within CEB though.8:30- 5:30 Job. Great working atmosphere, with great colleagues to help you out if you ever have a problem or question. Management is good, closely work with either an Account management or Sales Executive.  Work life balance is the most enjoyable aspect of the job.It is a great place to start your career I the sales environment. It has continually pushed me out of my boundaries and has allowed me to become a more productive and efficient worker. Having said that, the management there is as all high pressure sales environment. It is an all right position if you don't mind dialing 100 times a day and pitching all day over the phone.The work in the CEB project is amazing, challenging and gives opportunities to be focused but creative every day. From having barely any people we grew to 15 members in the team in three years and completed work volume normally handled by twice as many peopleThe one thing that I have never understood is the lack of possibility to arrange work hours more flexibly and integrate suitable technology. If we would have been allowed to work at least part time from home (50/50) it would be the most ideal project ever.I am glad to have been a part of it and will always cherish itIt's a cool career startup for a recent college graduate. Nice company culture and learning experience. Not for everyone but the right candidate or employee can be successful doing what is expected.Lots of office politics here. Highly dysfunctional. Everything takes lightyears to get done. Processes they use are archaic. Overall, the charity does make a difference in a lot of people's lives. They just need to fix themselves and they will make an even bigger impact.CEB is an ok company. I started there almost a  year ago. Not a lot of room for advancement. Especially after earning my CISSP.Really loved the culture and people at CEB. It's such a great place to learn and grow - you can really do a lot! Management is great, and if you are a hard worker, you can go far.Overall CEB is a great company to work for and to get professional work experience.  They pride themselves on hiring the best of the best, including extremely smart and innovative individuals.The environment is friendly and they offer a great benefits package that is very competitive, however in many departments they lack career advancement.Great company to work for. Salary could be a bit better but the benefits and Paid-time-off are second to none. Positive work environment and great training system. Positive managers and supervisors and everyone is helpful.There are so many brilliant and kind people working at CEB who support organizations around the world with research and best practices yet CEB does not follow its own guidance.  Horrible career pathing, low pay and poor management at the top.Work in my division often consisted of doing the same thing each day but that might have changed since then. The rah-rah culture was not my favorite.Fun but unorganized.  Good leadership in some sections but in other departments there is a lot of confusion.  Work hours are pretty good except they micro manage a lot.I really enjoyed my time at CEB.  However, the travel was over the top and advancement opportunities in the Chicago area are limited or non-existent with corporate headquarters being in Virginia.  Daily activity included cold calling, presenting to C-level executives, managing team.  The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting and talking with executives across all industries.CEB has a great company culture that promotes work life balance. It's a wonderful place to get your bearings, build a foundation, and network. Networking is a must because promotions are clearly based on who you know. Some teams play favorites more then others.Are you (or someone you know) looking for a new career opportunity in the Washington, DC area? If so, I would highly recommend investigating CEB. I have the pleasure of working at CEB and believe it is a great fit for me during this portion of my career. CEB has great benefits and career development opportunities, is true to its values and is committed to its employees.CEB has a young atmosphere. The majority of the employment population are recent graduates. The offices are modern, and if you are willing to ""play politics"", there's room for advancement.You'll learn a lot at CEB and work with some very smart people and even sharper clients. The work life balance is also pretty good. The problem is that the work tends to become extremely repetitive after about a year or two and upward mobility is extremely limited. Furthermore, upper management is still treating CEB as if it were a 200 person firm. Growing pains abound including antiquated performance metrics that handicap the company and stale, groupthink from upper management.Fun place to work for young professionals.  CEB has good training, but the career path is not as clear as they make it out to be.  High turnover."

295,Coursera,"Work from home and study from home from top universities that can recognize your achievement using coursera course certificates that can be posted on linked in in order to let employers find the best employee for a specific positionRewarding work in a stimulating environment. Good management and great teaching staff which strive to develop their team members to the best of their capabilities. Coursera is a great company to work for.People just wouldn't leave work. Because it was fun. They have free dinners and lunches everyday. Also had piano and ping pong. We had a make - a - thon, which was great."
714,Cox Automotive,"Management is the killer in this organization due their inability to recognize, compensate, empower, train and promote internal talent. There's no vision for the future and a huge issue with communication within the department. There's no career growth. Your coworkers are the most enjoyable part of coming to work daily.This company is a typical BIG business. Employees get treated horriblely. Training is a joke and communication is nonexistent. Fellow employees can treat you poorly,  harass you and completly get away with it. Management refuses to take care of their responalites or correct wrongful doings. This is the worst job I have ever had. People hazing me and being down right awful to my face is actually allowed here. You get benefits here. That's it. Manheim Phoenix is the worst company you can work for.The company benefits are good and after 13 years the pay is good.It is also close to home,and there are some good people that work there.I agree 100 percent with the other reviewers about NO advancement. You MUST brown nose or be friends or family of management to advance.I have learned a lot about the auto auction industry working there,such as structural damage to vehicles.Most of my co-workers are great to work with others do whatever they want and you will carry the extra load.My new manager brought his old employees with him and they get away with everything,being late,costing the company serious money,etc. The hardest part of the job is figuring out what the company wants because they will not communicate it to you.I worked here for 3+ years in management. Customer is always right. And I mean ALWAYS right. Steal? No problem. Attempt to defraud the company? No problem. Upper management has no spine and most of the managers couldn't flip burgers at McDonald's. But if you're in the clique you're good. Private pension is nice and benefits are good but don't expect fair treatment.I worked as a contractor but saw the benefits of the company and the culture.  Great company to work for - management was nice ;paid wellGreat company culture you really take pride in your job. Honestly nothing bad to say in my opinion. Anyone who is lucky enough to land a job here would be lucky.rough days working outdoors(cold,hot,wet).pay does not equal work for these conditions.poor management,people sent home when they are needed.most promotions given to kiss a**es.business seems to be ran by good ol boy network.This company brags on treating employees with the utmost respect, offering them the highest technical equipment and a wonderful work environment. While that may be true for some locations it certainly is not for Manheim Nashville. Technology can't keep up, management doesn't care about the attitude or professionalism they display or of the people it employs and acting inappropriate and talking filthy seems to be encouraged. There are good benefits here and that's about all I can say. They are great to the dealers, they truly produce, but they care nothing else about this company . Numbers are all that matters and if you're looking for a place where you can make a difference this is not the place for you!I think it's a good company to work for I do agree with some of the other reviews that advancement is based on brown-nosing and who you know not what you know and that's the sad part because it's not fair.Working for Xtime which is Cox Auto.Seems like a very nice place to be with and benefits are great.Managers are very nice to work for. Regular day hours Mon-Fri.Pay & compensation are good as well.I landed an opportunity with my dream company to work for after years of pursuing the chance.

Terrible management that allows supervisors to act in an abusive manner. High turnover in certain positions due this type of management.  Certain managers in this department have hired and fired mutliple employees in the Facilities Ops Specialist role, STAY AWAY.  Upper management and HR do nothing to stop this type of behavior.  Very unprofessional group of managers.  Worked there for 1 year and left because this department is a joke.Cox Automotive is a great place to work.  The staff is very helpful and professional as well as their Management who are always willing to come alongside and answer any questions you may have.The good ole boy attitude is alive and well at Cox. I wasted  years there and was bullied for the last four years.  If you steal, lie, and cheat you will do well or if you are a female and are willing to date the married customers.  HR is a joke and the managers have their jobs because of who they know and not what they know.great place to work.  great culture. work life balance. good leadership.  gym on campus.  coworkers are great.  work from home is available.It was an awesome place to work.  Loads of diversity and culture integration. Training is ""fly by the seat of your pants"". Co-workers are great individuals to work with.Great business to work for if you have a passion for cars  family oriented the owner work hands on they take pride in there business!Fast paced environment. Company vested in employee development. The company is well structured but lacks consistency. organization. The only consistency is constant change which creates uncertainty.I loved my 6 years with Cox Automotive - however after 6 years of hard work and going above and beyond, my department was eliminated.  Assistance in finding a new job did not pan out as several other people were displaced at the same time.Was hired about a month ago and they have done nothing but give me the run around,saying my background check still hasn't came back.It doesn't take a month for one to come back especially if you have a clean background!"
719,Cox Enterprises,"Cox Enterprises is leading communications, media, and automotive services company. Together we are all family day in and day out. The staff, management, team all work together to make it a safe, fun workplace.This is a good place to work. Be careful about taking extended leave for health reasons. They may realize that you are no longer needed. Corporate really cares about their employees.I truly enjoyed my experience with AutoTrader.com as a Regional Business Manager/CFO within Sales Operations in the NW!  Many colleagues became friends and stayed friends to this very day...a close nit group. A great learning experience and fun time in my professional career!Gather business requirements for technical implementation leveraging virtual infrastructure.  Hardware and software architecture.  VMWare DRS, HA, SRDS, Vmotion, Storage Vmotion architecture, implementation, and deployment.  Documentation, optimization, performance tuning, and critical success factor monitoring.Great company but is transitioning from a family run business to one run by non family who are incented to grow profit at all costs. While this is perfectly respectable it is causing difficulty for the lifers to adapt to and as a result cooperation within the parts of the organization is lacking.I enjoyed my time at Cox Enterprises. I got an opportunity to learn a new technology involving SaaS and be a part of the implementation team for Oracle Fusion Goals and Performance Management tool. The management is really great but it needs more skill to deal with immediate managers. On the whole a good experience.During holidays, the company lets all the employees go home early the day before a holiday. The company is all about family. They give plenty of vacation days and sick time. My co-workers and very intelligent and great to work with.I worked for Cox Enterprises for 10 years, I started out in the mail center and while in the mail center helped the facilities team as well. I whent full time with the facilities team in 2010. I was told several times b y my manager that I would be promoted and was passed up by employee's that I had trained. Those employee's were promoted because Cox Enterprises promotes diversity to look good in the eyes of all that view upon them. The company says one thing and does another. They cheat and lie to present a picture that is false.Coworkers, other staff, and executive team were all productive. This is a very established business and they treat staff very generously. It can be challenging at times however the overall benefits help.This is a fantastic company to work for, and, the atmosphere is laid back.The people you work with are great, and, not a lot of micromanaging at this level.I enjoyed working at Cox while learning new tasks daily.  Supported clients from multiple auction locations across the nation as well as Canada.Typical day consisted of many phone calls to regular customers. I enjoyed creating flyers & brochures to display in lanes on sale day.A 365 nightly job with which drivers used prepared, packaged and and then delivered, using their own cars, newspapers such as AJC, Daily Post, and New York Times, to a provided list of customers.Can not say enough good things about this companyEnjoyed it very much.Enjoyed 15 years so far. good people to work with. Had a good environmentContracted was extended to use my skills and abilities to assistThis company had a look of perks dealing with the auctions. It made me more knowledgeable of what goes into processing documentation, vendor relations, and insurance as it relates to independent and franchise dealership."

82,Crowdstar,"Fun fast paced company with room to grow. I enjoy working with all the teams from community, to developers to management. Onsite Recruiting and Sourcing for this wonderful gaming companyMy typical workday consisted of QA testing and regression. I learned about the QA process of Facebook games and more of the QA process in general. The co-workers were by far the best part of the job; Everyone was very personable and professional."
746,Cryolife,"A typical day consists of numerous processes in flow that require heavy attention to detail, team work, and self accountability. I have learned how to create the product we produce as well as all the necessary procedures from product formulation to packaging it for shipping. Management is constantly searching for new ways to make production more time and cost efficient, as well as speaking with employees to obtain advice for bettering procedures. Co-worker relationships are  typically healthy and everyone is usually willing to lend a helping hand. The hardest part of the job is following behind fellow co-workers and trusting their integrity to their duties because one mishap from any person can halt a production. The most enjoyable part of the job is being in a process with co-workers that you can trust to do their job efficiently and are able to complete a process flawlessly.They will work you to death. Low pay, Advancement opportunities are rare. Look elsewhere. Fear and blame culture. This place will exacerbate any anxiety you already have.This is a great company to gain experience and get your foot in the door, but the pay is too low to really consider a career here. The new CEO has spoken about working on raising pay, and if that actually happens I will definitely reconsider looking elsewhere because other than pay, the company is great to work for.Nice company but no advancement opportunities present. Good job for people fresh out of college. I like the type of work they do, but not somewhere you would want to stay forever.Working in production, is simple and boring repetitive work. It's the same tasks, every day. With that said, the company is headed on the right track and does offer good benefits.CryoLife is a excellent place to work.  The job was challenging but the most fascinating part of CryoLife is that the company helps to save lives.  I was able to see first hand how the company helps families.  I worked directly with 2 sets of organ donor families and 2 sets of organ recipient families that had visited CryoLife.  I worked directly to welcome them as well as set up all of the audio video to broadcast their presentations.  CryoLife is growing rapidly and I was very disappointed to leave.Had several responsibilities in this role. - Created marketing and sales tools- Collaborated with R&D and the engineering department- Helped to resolve any product issues- Developed sales training and marketing plans- Helped to stay compliant with FDA- Supported the entire country and worked with sales forceThe most enjoyable aspect of the job was helping the sales force close business and being in the field with them.Working for this company was a challenge because it was a very busy, fast paced company. Lives depended on the speed in which products came in and out of the company. It was a company where everyone really worked together as a team and it felt like a family.The most enjoyable part of my job is the opportunity to work with various groups throughout the company.A mid-sized medical device and vascular tissue company with a history of providing customers with unique solutions. A typical day at Cryolife involves team work on every process. From staging of materials to aid the flow of production to cleaning of work stations.I learned about formulations, tissue processing, exposed to how to write SOP's and many other production related duties.Management was very hard working and open to feedback.Great co-workers.The hardest part of the job involved packing shippers on dry ice, very physical work.the most enjoyable part about the job involved filtering bulk solutions, and filling syringes."
612,CSRA,"CSRA has been very good to me. My coworkers are great and management keeps you informed of everything. Great place to get your start in the IT Field. I love it here!A positive work environment without the typical stress of deadlines. I learned that a full Agile development lifestyle can be very effective with Government customers. Some of the best so-workers I've had the pleasure to be a part of. The hardest part of the job was keeping the communication open throughout the team and having higher management support a decision\solution until the end. With an Agile approach there was no direction or an individual to make the difficult technical decisions when needed causing re-work.*	Ensure that all HIPAA and Government security requirements with regards to sharing and storage of Personal Health information are meet at all times.*	Maintain the timelines on enrollment/credentialing schedules, communicate with providers and other departments to update as needed, clarify carrier information requirements, and maintain a strict level of confidentiality for all matters pertaining to provider credentialsI have only worked for CSRA for just over a year now and it appears to be the right fit for me.  The management team are good, hard working people who seem to genuinely care for the workers.  My co-workers and peers are great to work with.  They work as a team and extended family.  So far, this has been a great transition from Active Duty Military.Morale is poor.  People seem very unhappy.  There is high employee turnover.  Senior management is very uncaring and disorganized.  In the quest to cut costs they have made it very frustrating for people to do their jobs. Worst place I ever worked.CSRA has a smaller budget than most Defense Contracting companies, and therefore, they pay their employees far less than bigger contractors, such as Raytheon for example.  If any employees want any On-the-Job Training (OJT), you LITERALLY have to break an arm and a leg to get CSRA to fund any training related to your career field.If you wish to work for a company that will provide you with job security and advancement; this is not the one.  Compensation is horrible espeically with the amount of work you will be given.  It is rare that they back fill positions when others leave, so that means triple the work for you and no additional pay.Worked at CSRA. The compensation is very competitive. The culture for my project really depends on the federal client. Had to be in the office no later than 8:30. The Agile Sprints were 10 days and very fast pace. Lots of work.If you are looking for short term employment working in a call centertalking to rude immigrants all day. Supervisors cheat you outof you PTO time. If you have a family member pass away you will be forced to use sick or vacation time. All though the company states they cover bereavement..Some days were more stressful then others. Everyday I learned something new which in my case was a good thing. Coworkers are great. Management staff was there to assist.The company used to be CSC.  We merged with SJA in October of 2015. Though they are trying be a a more ""hip"" place, its still has a  way to go.  Not all of the offices are on board with things that make coming to work fun and exciting.Most people I worked with have very poor skill sets and are lazy, Management are very unprofessional. Most will only speak to you if your a certain rank... many haven't transitioned to civilian life. No raises, Never recognized for work.. not what you know its who likes you. If you need a job go for it.I enjoy the individual and group training of the soldiers. I like to make sure they are properly trained to survive. This job allows me some freedoms to change how things are taught and find different ways to teach the same thing.  Some are visual learners but most are hands on.  I like the variety of individuals and groups.In the two years I was there, the company decided not to give anyone raises one year, because a merger wasn't working out the way they'd planned. They hadn't given managers a raise in five years. They also transitioned two weeks of sick leave and two weeks of vacation into three weeks of paid time off for me. I only had two weeks of vacation as a new hire, but some were getting four weeks of vacation, and they also got three weeks of PTO. Those who had accrued up to six months of vacation had six weeks to use it or lose it. Nobody took six weeks of vacation; the company saved a fortune. Asked, in a conference call, to justify significant cuts in the vacation accruals of their most veteran employees, the company president responded, ""I'm sorry that impacted you that way. Next question.""Lots of pressure to produce good work, but no recognition when you did, and with no raises, absolutely nothing but your salary for compensation.Company is not really caring for it employees.. There is no benefit to be a employee of CSRA over being a consultant here.. THEY treat you as temporary employees and never cross train of place you elsewhere if one project ends.. AVOID itAmid restructures a whole lot of turnover has occurred and salaries have been affected drastically. New requirements have been placed for roles with no salary adjustments to match certifications.The Company continues to experience new management changes and most likely will continue until next year.  Excellent employees who have great skills and knowledge of consulting.CSRA has a great work life balance. A great deal of the employees, subcontractor and military personnel are friendly and good to work with.I would just like to thank CSRA for the opportunity to work for a great company. The communication with management to subordinates and other workers is awesome. The pay is also great for the hours work. Great leadership and well experienced personnel on ground to help operation continue in a smooth process.Originally started as CSC working on the Army Material Command Logistics Modernization Project. Last year the Federal segment of the company merged with SRA to become CSRAI've been with CSRA for a few months and I enjoy the company and the colleagues who I work with. There is a huge opportunity for growth. My work schedule was fit to coincide with my personal life and that a plus for me."
621,CSS-Dynamac,"On a typical day my duties consisted of data entry of DOT applicant information, assisting applicants over the phone to complete mcs-150 forms, 80-100 outbound/inbound calls a day, and sorting mail. I learned information on hot to obtain the legal number from the department of transportation and the legal requirements to be able to posses and apply for the number. The management I must say was not as ideal as the job or compensation. At times I felt as if I was not assisted enough and some unprofessionalism was an unfortunate characteristic of the management. My coworkers were very helpful and easy going people. The hardest part of the job was the occasional disrespectful applicant who is frustrated with the application process. The most enjoyable part of my job was the laid back atmosphere and the friendly personalities."
633,Cubic,"CUBIC is a good company to work for with the understanding that they a a bare bones type company willing to make any cut necessary to maintain or win the next contract. An example being cutting full time positions and making them part time on call. CUBIC also has a long history of hiring and promoting those they feel are loyal over those that are the best qualified. This leads to a mid level management tier that does not fully understand the Army requirements and forces lower level part timers to pick up the slack created.Job security is unfortunate with this company. Never plan buying a home if you depend solely on your own salary. You may start tomorrow and the next day you may be looking elsewhere. As for the rest, it is fun to work for. Many company/employee events.Prepared PCs and laptops in accordance with corporate standards for use in various business and engineering environments.  Installed various hardware(client and server) and software(OS and apps). Network setup for both LAN and WAN. Performed authorized custom installs when appropriate and assisted in conversions and updates. Performed workstation and LAN analytics to trouble-shoot and repair systems. Answered helpdesk phone to directly assist users with hardware/software requests and/or problems. Maintained and controlled the PC/laptop inventory.Scheduled and organized work load between first and third shifts. Assisted and supported other operators, team of two Data Center Operators. Established operator procedures and maintained/updated documentation. Served as the direct contact/laison for in-house and contracted support groups.Whole day workNo enjoymentOld style school.No Job security, boss always watches over your shoulders and very micro management.Very cutomer focused.  They believe in a good work/life balance. The management is in touch with the employees on a regular basis.A typical day at work included a lot of typing and paper work. We reviewed soldier's benefits and life insurance policy for soldier readiness processing, reintegration, and whenever they felt like coming in to update information. I made dog tags, I tried my hardest to make sure that one guys ex wife was off of his paperwork and that was probably the most difficult to deal with...angry people. But it was easy to calm them down. I really loved everyone I worked with.The Service desk offers a great environment and I am blessed to be part of such a great team that really takes care of each other. One of the down sides of the IT department is the advancement, most of the members of the service desk have been there for about 3-4 years, and the common trend is that employees have to move out to move up professionally. Since working with the company I have only seen the department hire out rather that promote within.I train US Army Soldiers in Military Vehicle Maintenance where we teach them what it's like to learn simple maintenance in the US Army.Seems like a good company, however, after running out of funds after only 5 months on a ""2-year"" contract, I can't make a fair assessment.A typical day was training soldiers in scenario's they man encounter when deploying. I learned some different languages, worked with people from other countries.Great place to work with high energy, extremely talented work force that strives for Customer Service. Goal oriented organization that allows employees the freedom to develop the programs they are responsible for in a positive environment. Challenging environment that develops employee abilities and strengths.Great company for advancement and learning experience. I enjoyed my work experience with this company. The most enjoyable part of the job was the learning experience.This is a good place to transition to if you are leaving the Army and are looking to supplement your retirementso it is a good fit.Worked outside everyday had very little office time just took care of what needed to be done mowing the grass using a variety of tools provided to me.I enjoyed my time with CUBIC and I felt that the management took very good care of their employees. The work I did was 9 to 5 and the vacation time was very fair. My coworkers were competent and reliable for the most part.The defined work hours are changed and there is no set, Day shift, mid shift or night shift however, at the end of every rotation your overtime hours convert to a 7 consecutive days off every month. The promotions are not always available unless you have a degree and even then there is not a whole lot of room for advancement. The work is good, the pay is decent, and if you are competent then the work environment is ideal. This is a great job for a recently retired from military or a starter job for someone that just got out of the military.Company management okay.  Challenging position. Workload very heavy for one person.These jobs were government contracts and throughout my whole resume' are basically the sameOutstanding working environment.  Leadership went extra mile to take care of subordinates.I enjoyed the job very much. It made me feel good helping evaluate and analyzing soldiers getting ready to deploy to a combat zone. Knowing what we were doing might save there life. Most of us in the office were retired Army so we all got along well. We all had that sense of urgency, for mission accomplishment. We had and met high standers every rotation. The hardest part of the job, it was considered part time only 58 hours every two weeks. At times during a rotation we would work 115 pulse hours per week. We would not get paid for the over time but were given short work week (days off) in lieu of. No body wanted to leave there full time positions so advancement was not happening. Being able to help soldiers was the most enjoyable part of the job.Trained soldiers in the use of weapons, communication equipment and tactical driving in milkitary vehicle. With the use of powerpoint I gave classes on the above mentioned. Ran and supervised the weapons ranges. The most enjoyable part of my job was training troops and making sure they had all the tools to make back home safe."
657,Cubic Corporation,"During the beginning 2 months of my time with Cubic, things were great.  I was getting a steady workflow and received praise several times for the work that I was doing.  Then, things started to slow down and I was asked to help with documentation.  During this time morale started to sink within the company as many people were finding work elsewhere.  Once the documents were finished, I was once again place on my original assignment, but the workflow and praise had changed.  There were several times that no work was available.  During my last 2 months, I was once again moved to another project.  I took over for an engineer that left the company, and was handed a project that had very little information associated with it.  I then had to figure out what was going on, as the time went along, I received no direction or feedback from the project manager.I really enjoyed working for Cubic.  The Senior Management Team was very receptive to 'thinking out-of-the box' always encouraging new ideas and productive ways to change or streamline various business practices.The call center has a great Manager, but lower management is stuck in Junior High School. There is poor training for lower management, as there is favoritism and extremely immature behavior among them.There is very little praise and will tell you what you did wrong or how bad you are at your job with a smile. Was promised to have weekends off during the hiring process and interview, but was told that I had to choose a weekend day to work, as ""It's a requirement"" for the position. And there is very, very little room for advancement in this office.There is a call time limit (approx 5 mins per call) and that is nearly impossible due to the systems that are provided. The computers are not PCs, but simply one giant connected system that runs so slow, that the first 3 minutes of the call is just waiting for the customer's information to pull up.Unless you are desperate for a job, I would not recommend this call center.This company is not a good company. Instead of interviewing the workers for work, it feels as tho you are being interrogated by an FBI agent. This company really needs to find someone better to represent them. I feel as tho the guy in charge has ran off or scared off potentially good workers.This is a great company to work for. Excellent benefits, decent pay, and they do a lot for the employees (free company picnic and Christmas party). But there is little room for advancement and some of the management is questionable.Great company as a whole that has a definite grasp on what a customer wants and needs when it comes to a system that can benefit the public in their travels using public transportation.Cubic is a great place to work.  People are friendly, things run fairly smoothly, and the work in itself is very stress free.  The work environment is clean and quiet, with no need for any safety equipment other than ESD protection.Cubic also abuses the temporary staffing services more than any company I've ever known of.  In my time working for Cubic I was promoted two times and given very high marks on my reviews for workmanship.  Setup stations and trained workers on various tasks which I also created training materials for them to follow.  I applied for every full time position available at Cubic for 2.5 years and never once received even an interview.  If you aren't on a personal level with management here you will never get hired.  During my time working here and getting to know most of the long time employees, they all informed me on several occasions that the job postings are solely for show.  Some workers have been at this facility for 5-6 years as temporary workers.  I have several certifications and many years IT experience, yet was never considered for jobs I was more qualified to do than what I was doing.In short, unless you're going to work in the offices or know the upper management personally I wouldn't recommend working for Cubic.  This is not a place to start a career as you will most likely be a temporary worker for the rest of your life.  I was hoping to make a career at Cubic as I loved working for the company for a long time, but eventually being abused and underpaid as a temporary worker gets old.  If you want a throw-away job work here, otherwise  more... move on.  lessGreat job for veterans/retirees from the military with experience with working at NTC. For non-salary positions its typically an 8 hour work day and management is willing to work with you if you need time off.Co-workers were fantastic, a great place to be if you really want to work and get things done. It has a great environment, a great building, and a great learning experience as an intern.Currently, I am working for Cubic Transportation Systems in the area of Financial and Transaction Processing Management for Clipper Card. We manage the day-to-day operations of the clearing and settlement functions, as well as reconciliation of ACH daily transfers between financial institutions, participating operators, and other vendors. Typical day at work consists of cross-training, majority of reconciling and clearing our GL accounts and research. A lot of our process are manual and very tedious due to system enhancements and reports currently not being automated. I have built strong relationships with my colleagues and are always helpful as we consider ourselves ONE TEAM. When we are not hectic with schedules, we set up fun events for everyone to enjoy.Interesting business domain.Opportunity to work with embedded development, if you're into it.Too many non-technical managers.This is a good place to work. I worked with a lot of great people. I did learn a lot working  here but the travel in the department I was in was very extensive.I worked with the company for about 3 years in the call center. Management had their favorites. My manager had her bulldog that would watch your every move. If you didn't bring food or dress up for the monthly potlucks you were an outsider. Training was lacking and the systems that we worked on was very slow. They wanted us on and off the phone in 5 mins but you done good to get the customers account researched in 5 mins.Your bathroom breaks were timed and you will be talked to if you go to the bathroom to much. It is very micromanaged.Cubic was a good place to have worked.  Management expects a lot from the employee, but they gave a sufficient amount of time for one to learn and hone their skills. At Cubic, I wore several different hats of responsibility and I was afforded both time and training to succeed in each of my roles.  Cubic manufactures revenue collection systems geared at mass transit systems throughout the world.  No two systems are the same as the customers requirements vary from location to location.  This creates individualized requirements for each product built and shipped which leads to multiple customer requirement profiles.  In my opinion, this is both the hardest and most enjoyable part of the job as every item has specific needs, whether it be packaging, documentation, specialized transportation or a chain of advanced notifications/authorizations prior to shipment.  Along with good communication between departments, the employees at Cubic were great to work with.  There was a real team atmosphere among all departments.If you are getting out of the military and looking for a slow transition back into the civilian world this is a great job! Unfortunately there is no room for growth and job security is very low. With that being said, Cubic Defense Applications is a great company with great benefits.Upper management is nowhere to be seen, ever. My program manager is great, but above that it's a crapshoot. Benefits are terrible, and got worse with ObamaCare. Health insurance costs are ridiculous. Good pay, good pto.No room for growth.Worked  as  interpreter, adviser, for US Army ( Special Forces )for overseas culture.  ..............Enjoyed my time there. Would go back in a second. Free coffee.I think this company was a great company to work for. I really hated when it moved all the jobs to Mexico. My co worker was helpful and nice to work with. Management doors was always open no matter what the problem.Great company to work for. The people are what make the company.A fulfilling position, adding real time training with the army units, before they deploy.My position is to have contact with the rotational units, presenting a series of problems for them to resolve, using the training and protocols they have already used.Most recently, I have portrayed a Charity Relief Organisation, my dealings with the unit produce a conflict of interest for them between the mission and their own humanitarian relief.My position requires a lot of research in order to produce informed and coherent arguments and reports when meeting the civil affairs teams.Most of what I do is free play, not scripted. I find this interesting as often I have to keep my wits about me and think on my feet as the meetings progress, for better or worse.I take a lot of pride and job satisfaction in creating the same problems that they are likely to face on deployment, so that the troops will not make the same mistakes and come home safely."
516,CUNY,"It was a lovely place for learning and teaching, and gained respect from students. Supervisors were very nice, always held thanksgiving party for all staff.College Assistant typical work life is like working as hotel doormat.Management is a joke! They don't care about you. All they care about when is their next paycheck! Co-workers/students are a joke, they are smart in their academics but lazy as F$#K! You can literally not show up for work and get still get pay, and not get fired.Most enjoyable part of the job is leaving end of the day!In theory, CUNY is a good place to work.However the demands of the job supersede the compensation provided. My colleagues are helpful. The commute is awful.performed numerous transfer evaluations for transfer students using the BOSS and TES SystemAssisted students with undergraduate admissions and transfer related issuesMet with students to discuss their evaluationsprofessional work atmosphere hundreds of transfer caseloads per semester in addition to the case files from the previous semester that need to to be evaluated and updatedI worked in the CUNY SEEK department as part of my school's work study program in order to pay for my classes and books.  It was enjoyable and gave me additional experience working with the public.Wonderful people and greate place to work. Recommended to all cuny students to work there. You can meet various people throughout the entire CUNY system.Best place to work, professional development guaranty, Fun environment, flexible and prosperous. Working in that place made me a better person in terms of learning and capacity buildingCUNY campuses have been nationally recognized as culturally diverse institutions of higher learning that foster a profound appreciation for different cultures, languages and world perspectives.go in, do the job, leave at end of shift.  best part: possibility of studying while working. hardest part:  when classes canceled but school not closed, still expected to go to work.not a good place to be. no chance for advancement. whatever job you do will stay the same so will your salary. managers pressure people into working crazy hours for free. some make sexist racist and homophobic comments all the time . one of the executives of the school said that arabs were not even human beings to the new york times. a lot of the people are just awful . incompetent and lazy are rewarded with big salaries. hard workers get taken for suckers and punished for it. some high level staff are convicted felons who were hired anyway .google it . a lot of nepatism. know somebody and get hired don't and you wont. if you are good at that go for it. if you are a woman a minority (other than asian) or lgbt stay away from this place. you will be treated like garbage. the amount of waste and fraud is very very high. this place is corrupt.relocated assets for 23 collegesreconciled cash and bank statementcollected data, coded computer entriesprepared quarterly and annual reconciliationsIts a typical day at work but has you own your toes literally, don't sit and help students with there technical issues. the co-workers are nice though.Working for any government agency you obtain a great amount of experience only if you choose to work hard.internal promotions are always available but compensation never meets the amount of resposibilityoverall very good just some problems with contract being renewed due to this being a city job. The management is well rounded but the really good people don't last long since the compensation for good work simply isn't there.Prolidase is a metallopeptidase that is ubiquitous in nature and has been isolated from many different organisms such as bacteria, archaea and fungi.  Prolidase specifically hydrolyzes dipeptides. It requires zinc and/or other metals for activation. Routinely used laboratory isolate of C. albicans, ATCC 36232 produces significantly reduced amount of prolidase. We investigated to determine the enzyme level during different phases of growth in minimal media. The data for prolidase activity yielded negative results. It was also concluded that DBP/Tween-80 mixture was not toxic for the respective strains. All toxicity assays performed with cultures of the chemical dilution were positive indicating the absences of toxicity at the concentrations utilized. For the whole cell assay, MnCl2 was used for activation of prolidase. The qualitative assay of this whole cell was also negative. We assume that the amount of time affected our results. We can conclude that an appropriate future strategy with a time course spanning from 12 hours to 72 hours or longer may yield better results.I have been with this company for 25 years and I enjoy working with them. I love my job. The benefits are great but the salary is not.On the campus that I was employed it is somewhat laid back atmosphere except when employees that have been at the campus for many many years try to sabotage newer younger employees that may help the institution by introducing positive changes. There is no regard for authority for those older employees, some of them believe they are above authority because they have tenure. Sometimes employees who do no work outlast employees who work really hard.on the positive side for the most part everyone is very friendly and there is a sense of community amongst most employees making the work environment very pleasurable leading to high employee morale. Benefits are really good too!!The job was okay. You have to deal with people that are crazy and rude on the phone. Management cares about how quick you can end the call. Doesn't feel like people are actually being helped.My typical work day consisted of various clerical duties such as typing, data entry, filing and retrieving, answering telephone/providing information/relaying messages, serving as a receptionist,opening/sorting/distribution of mail, providing photocopies. I worked under the direct supervision of the College Office Assistant. Assisted the professors, adjuncts, counselors/advisers with open enrollment/registration of incoming freshmen and continuing students. My co-workers and I had a great and wonderful rapport. The fulfilling part of my job was seeing those students you helped graduate and move on successfully. The hardest part was leaving...I enjoyed working at CUNY.  It was a great experience.  I love the interaction with staff and students, which was positive.  A typical day would be meeting with students to assist them in identifying an internship in their career interest or lecturing a seminar (Critical Reflections or Fundamentals of Career Advancement).  The hardest part was finding an appropriate internship for a student at the last hour.  Fortunately, the student was able to secure one.I enjoyed the flexibility of my schedule.  For the most part, it was a nurturing environment as well as a supportive.I love working at CUNY.  Although you may have the same title as some other employee, your task may be triple theirs and nothing can be done.  You can get lucky and get in a laid back department or you can be placed somewhere, and become the manager and paid as an office assistant."
522,Cushman & Wakefield Inc,"Very fast paced. It was a place to grow, and get to know a lot about NYC and the hospitality industry.Strong female man hating culture in mid-management that covers for incompetent females that should not be in management.When the company goes public it would be a great time to “clean house!”Very poor company, discriminates against minorities and women, would sell their mothers for a small profit, no ethical culture other than survival of the fittest, watch your back.Excellent work atmosphereMeet very interesting peopleClients are exceptionalCo-workers are the brightestLooking for advancementTo mobilize and deliver our vast knowledge, resources and talent throughout the world on behalf of our clients, and to enable them to make the most informed real estate decisions.

Building a relationship with the vendors and contractors as well as the tenants.

I worked with a small group, I only had one Property Manager, One Cheif Engineer and 5 engineers, because I help manage 3 buildings. The hardest part about this position is some one being stuck in the elevator and as and employee your hoping, your able to get your tenant or tenants out. The most enjoyable about this position is working as a team, and getting the job done together.The company was good, but the upper management need to be more involved"
0,CyberCoders,"As a selection representative you figure out how to construct your business starting with no outside help. You buckle down putting in 10-12 hour days, yet it will pay off in the event that you keep at it. Try not to enter this occupation supposing you can bear to be lethargic else you WILL fizzle. Great commission setup is fine for a few people however unquestionably not everybody. Youthful air and positive vibes all around.Fun culture and work environmentGreat money opportunityGreat growth opportunityUnlimited SnacksAbility to work remoteGreat company partiesCyberCoders is a solid culture company. The people and most management are very strong and are willing to assist in any way possible. It is not a 9 to 5 so you definitely need to be ready to work long hours to be successful.Sink or Swim.  Management is very hands off, even if you do well you can get swept in layoffs.  Company is not going in the right direction and their approach is very bullish.  Plenty of potential clients/candidates would not work with me due to the ""stigma"" of working with Cybercoders.  It is truly a double edged sword.allstate is a fortune 100 company that is a great experience to gain professionalism and experience. Really fun coworkersAs a recruiter you learn to build your business from scratch. You work hard putting in 10-12 hour days, but it will pay off if you keep at it. Do not enter this job thinking you can afford to be lazy else you WILL fail. 100% commission setup is fine for some people but definitely not everyone. Young atmosphere and positive vibes all around.I managed a database of clients and candidates. I did all my own business development by cold calls, emails, linkedin inmails and referrals. I sourced for candidates and matched them with my client staffing needs. Negotiated pay and bill rates and coordinated interviews and placementsCyberCoders is becoming a giant staffing firm the industry - and rightfully so! They are surrounded with so much talent from everyone in the organization.Great place to work at! Company culture is great. Love the people and atmosphere.Like the saying goes""work hard play harder""!!CyberCoders is very unprofessional.Money hoardersthey will call you all the time just to make the quotaA good supportive company and they provide pay reflective of the level of experience of the candidate.I worked for Cybercoders for about 4-months. I had heard many good things about them over the years so I was excited to be offered a position to join the team. Unfortunately, from the day I started I saw a lot of red flags that reminded me a lot of another large, international recruiting firm (RHI) where I previously worked. CC has a churn and burn environment and they micromanage you - pulling up reports throughout the day on your activity. They have a TON of meetings - team meetings, company wide meetings, individual meetings - EVERY WEEK! Over the 4 months I was there people quit or were being fired practically every week. The 3 new people on my team that started the same day as I did, were gone within 4 months. Yes, they did have cool quarterly sales party's at an ocean front resort in Orange County. And a summer party that was a blast! But aside from that, the work environment was tedious. You had to achieve a certain # of ""CA's"" per week (Cyber Actions) that you earn by securing a new job order from a client, submitting candidates for open jobs and scheduling in-person interviews between your candidate and client. If you don't meet the required number of CA's, you must attend what I referred to as a ""dunce or disciplinary"" training session for each week you missed the mark...driving 1.5 to 2 hours from their Playa Vista location to Irvine for a 45 minute meeting. Basically, taking up your entire day of productivity when the reason you're having to attend this meeting in the first place is because of what they deem your lack of productivity. Unfortunately,  more... if you have several job orders open with different clients for the same type of position, the candidates you submit only counts for 1 CA, even if you submit the same candidate to 5 different clients. So you're constantly scrambling to meet your CA numbers. A lot of people found ways to trick the system into thinking they earned CA's in order to avoid disciplinary action. WE ARE THERE TO WORK, not to surf the net or mess around so treating us like children is unnecessary.I placed four full time placements within the first 4 months I was there at a profit of almost $100k for the company, but when I called in sick one day when I was supposed to attend one of these disciplinary meetings in Irvine, I was called that very morning and told ""this isn't working out"". Yes, I was fired. I was shocked and surprised. I reminded my manager that we had just met a few days prior and he said I was doing well and making good progress. I could tell he was annoyed I had called in sick rather than drive to Irvine. He just repeated himself ""this isn't working out"". I do not recommend Cybercoders to fellow recruiters. It's a cut throat, micromanaging, churn and burn environment. Plus, you're on a draw, so you may as well just work as an independent recruiter rather than share your profits with the company because you're responsible for 100% of your own salary anyway.  lessOver the years I've seen many many jobs from Cybercoders for which I felt I was well qualified, but have never landed so much as a phone screen when applying through them.Cybercoders reason for being is to insert themselves between you and any prospective employers and extort money from those who might find you a promising candidate. Your interest or potential suitability for a job makes no difference to them, your resume won't leave their computers unless they think they can get a commission out of it. It takes more legwork, but try to filter out Cybercoder ads, target job searches to only return actual employer generated positions and send them your resume directly. You won't get every job you apply for, but at least you don't have to meet some anonymous recruiter's commission checklist before employers see your resume.One word Resume Farmers! Read many reviews were people were contacted by their 'recruiters"", recommended the candidate apply for the job via their link and never to be heard from again.Excellent recruiting environment.  Collaborative, excellent management with top-notch tools.CyberCoders is the leader in full-time technology staffing nationwide for a reason.   You are working with real people working with some of the worlds best companies providing life changing opportunities that help thousands of people grow their careers and income every year.  I read one review that said we were a Spammer and owned by Experian?  Not true.  We are not owned by Experian and your personal information isn't shared with any agency.  Our job requires many phone calls and many emails to insure we reach our targeted audience, but we are no more a spammer than Groupon or Travelzoo when you ask to receive exciting updates that match your specific interests. If you have applied for jobs and are not getting a response, there is no interview request.  You could still be a very good candidate, so followup with us and we'll do our best to make a match.  Hiring managers are very busy and find it hard to reply to every resume, so some go without a response unfortunately.  Internally, all employees of CyberCoders are treated very well with generous compensation packages as well as many in house treats and fun catered events.  The culture is fun and casual, providing recruiters with unmatched marketing and software tools to reach thousands of new passive talent everyday.Nothing feels better than helping someone find a new position and helping a trusted client fill an important need all at the same time.  Ultimately, recruiters are your friends and can help you.  Try us!After swearing myself of not returning to the staffing agency world, CyberCoders came along and completely changed my mind. Their approach and constant dedication on investment to staying ahead of the curve with regards to their technology and how they approach the best way to service both their clients and candidates has given me a place that I'm very happy to say I work for.There is plenty of opportunity for growth and the organization is not flat at all. The company as a whole is on a pretty exciting growth path as well."
774,Cyberonics,"As Cyberonics, it was an excellent place to work.  Since becoming LivaNova, not so much.  New management structure and style significantly hurting morale.  Could impact success of the company over time.Totally dysfunctional management.  Total management management by intimidation.  Company does not recognize sales as the work horse.  Cut commissions to make a numberIn the past, this company was a fun place to work with a lot of ability to grow within your position.  In the past 5 or so years, the politics have really ruined a great place to work.  It was disappointing to see such a great company be overpowered by a few individuals who have too much control.  People fear for their jobs daily as they can be let go on the word of one person without the proper amount of research into the situation from the HR department.  In the past I would have highly recommended this company.There is a disconnect between the employees and management. Requirements were often not passed down or talked about between departments.Great Health Benefits and nice coworkers - super busy environment - great team building and training - an atmosphere driven by patient care and concernAttend clinics at my neurologists office and assist with diagnostic testing on the VNS devices in patients, as well as offer different dosing strategies to optimize efficacy with these patients. While in clinic, I must sell VNS to the neurologists and all the office staff in order to obtain patients that VNS will help. I then call the patients and schedule appointments with them. I educate/sell them on VNS therapy. Once I receive patient approval, I proceed to a surgeon's office and assist in setting up consults/OR dates for these patients. Once I set these dates, I proceed to the hospital and have the purchaser buy the necessary product at the price I have negotiated with them. I attend the surgery in order to run diagnostic testing to ensure the device was properly implanted, after which I contact the patients neurologist and schedule a 2 week follow up in order to have the device turned on.I took a quality job and relocated out of state. Things to watch-out for. Thier Quality organization has high turn over rate; either people quit or get fired. My predessor was fired after 10 years of service for poor performance, da! another fellow who was relocated from CA was fired after 1.5 years of service for poor performance. When they relocate you, they would get you to sign a contract that if you quit in 24 months, you owe them the relcoation money; unfair proposition, they sort of pass on all the risk to you. Thier style of management is micro type- top down; for 12 months, I averaged 12hours/day of work and when I expressed concern, I was told they were paying me more so they expect more. There is lack of medical device professionals in the area and so they mostly fill thier positions by relocating people out of the area or get H visa workers by promising them green card.Great organization allowing you to be creative, yourself and fun.  The product is amazing and ultimately we all get the opportunity to help improve the lives of our patients every day in the role we play with Cyberonics. The people are diverse, kind and helpful and I believe this is truly a great place to begin, grow or continue your career.A typical day at work is spent looking for a new job!I am learning nothing new while here.Lack of quality leadership/management at all levels of engineering.Most managers lead from behind--never making any decisions or providing guidance. Management moves you from project to project with no warning making it difficult to focus.Many good co-workers. Too few experienced people. Too many Ph.D's with no industry experience and a chip on their shoulder. Too many contractors with no ""skin in the game"".The hardest part of the job is to stay focused and positive in a backwards environment with too many meetings and distractions.The most enjoyable part of the job: For me, there is not one.Company as a whole does not know how to develop new products. They do not have the right mindset as they have never done it before as current product is over 10 years old. They are growing too fast with inexperienced leaders in too many key positions.Low tech electronics designs. Low tech manufacturing.""Meet the dates we'll fix it later"" mentality.Poor career choice for me, but I needed a pay check.I am a professional with 20 years experience who took a job with Cyberonics over a year ago. I am being passed on for promotions while being used as target practice by management for juniors to advance thier career. I have seen this happening to a few others around here as well. If you are 45 and over, kiss your career bye if you take a job in there.A typical day at work: is spent in planning meetings, filling out redundant documentation, and training on how to fill out this documentation.What I learned: I learned no new skills while employed at Cyberonics. It is a very boring job and my role and  responsibilities did not match the job description that I was hired for!Management: Young and inexperienced--to the point of being ineffective. No people skills--not a good people manager.Your co-workers: A lot of good people but a very cliquey atmosphere and culture. It's hard to fit in unless you already know someone that works there. Group to group interaction is poor. Too much ""us against them"" mentality. No sense of team work, even in your immediate group. The hardest part of the job: Figuring out what you are responsible to do. There are too many overlapping and undefined responsibilities group to group. I worked for a group manager and with several project managers. Each have a different idea of what my responsibilities are. The group manager never managed--too busy working on his own projects.The most enjoyable part of the job: None for me so I left. As an engineer there is just too much documentation and not enough engineering work. Things move at a VERY slow pace due to poor culture, lack of experienced people, and lack of resources. I simply did not research the company enough before I joined. The location is in the SE Houston I-45 Corridor. It's a VERY hard commute unless you live in the immediate area. Housing  costs in the immediate area are relatively high. Turn over is high depending  more... on the group. Departments do not work well together. It is a reactive organization which means poor or no planning. Small company with a  small company mentality--trying to present a facade of a mature well run company to drive up stock prices.No sense of job security:Big push to off shore manufacturing. Low tech product and manufacturing processes. No product diversity.  lessThe company overall does a good job trying to make employees happy. Job satisfaction varies department to department. Engineering and new product development in general is lacking. The company does not know how to develop new products nor has the culture or mindset to get it done. There are a lot of new hires that have never designed, developed, and launched a product into production. They do have masters degrees and PhD's but no real on the job experience. This is evident across the whole company and not just R&D. The existing products have been on the market for decades with only minor modifications. Their engineering and manufacturing processes are outdated. Interaction between groups is very difficult as responsibilities are overlapping and undefined. As with most organizations, the stock performance for next quarter is the most important goal. Product quality is an after thought. There also is job uncertainty in the future as manufacturing is moving off shore to Cost Rica. Who knows what other functions will follow... Definitely not a long term career choice by any means.A typical day at work is spent in meetings leaving little time to focus on tasks. Decisions are made by committee as most departments lack leadership with real experience. Project/Team meetings leave you frustrated and confused and are little more than a waste of time in most cases. Most people work on several projects that end up magnifying the problem. The only way to complete your tasks is to work 50 plus hours a week.I have learned nothing while at this company. In fact my skills are going to waste.  more... I no longer do anything technical that requires any thought or creativity. Often I feel I made a very poor career choice coming here.Overall lower level management it lacking due to inexperience. Mid-level management is just trying to hang on until retirement and upper level management is more concerned with boosting the stock price so they can cash in on their many stock options.Most co-workers are great. Due to the size of the company it can get very cliquey depending on what department you work in. So, you do need to watch your back.The hardest part of the job is trying to figure out what is expected of you day to day. It is also difficult to focus due to boredom.The most enjoyable part of the job is using the onsite gym.  lessA typical day at work is spent reviewing and creating documentation. Then training on how to do it and recreating it after the FDA audits.  I have learned that you spend an exponentially greater time ""properly"" documenting a new design than you actually get to spend designing it. Unfortunately, I have learned no new marketable skills while here.Upper management seems out of touch with what is really going on where as mid management is spread too thin to direct limited resources properly. This creates a lot of frustration when extra resources are promised but never a reality.Immediate Co-workers are great but all in all the company is very cliquey. Too little cooperation between departments. Always an ""Us against them"" environment. Too many inexperienced people in key roles.Chances of career growth are limited due to small product portfolio. It's all about who you know, not what you know which leads to inexperienced people in key roles that are unable to make a decision. The hardest part of the job is staying motivated due to boredom, too many meetings, and lack of interesting work. The most enjoyable part of the job is the rare opportunity when you actually get to perform design engineering work....and yes there is a ping pong table and on site work out room.Great workplace! The management is dedicated to providing an environment that is conducive of employee engagement and cohesiveness.Cyberonics is a good company to work for especially if you crave autonomy.  Challenges surround the fact that the company only has one product and it is very mature and not well received by many key opinion leaders.This position provided ample opportunities to work on a variety of projects.  The Legal Department also grew over time as the legal needs of the company grew.After the two week training period was over, the complaint flood gates opened up and all hell broke loose. I worked all day, everyday...seriously. I worked all day, everyday.Great company to work with. Manager, with a wrong attitude to sales people.Too many meetings for problem resolution. Procedures need to be streamlined to better minimize so many meetings."
437,"Daiichi Sankyo, Inc.","Very good to work and the manager, business users are very co-operative to work with. They maintain the professional ethics and balanced expectation.Not convinced that another reorganization is going to happen.  Management is terrible otherwise the culture is good.DSI does not pay the industry average in compensation.  The health insurance benefits are expensive and not the industry averageGreat working environment, great pay, great benefits, wonderful people to work with. There are not too many hard parts, I love the company.  The most enjoyable would have to be the team I work with.7 years ago, this was an exciting and growing company with great benefits and competitive compensation.  I learned a lot from my co-workers, my teammate who I provided back-up support to the VP  of Supply Chain and Technical Operations, providing executive support and putting in overtime as needed.  I learned the Purchasing process and was elected to be in charge of all the ordering of equipment, vendors and consultants at our new Bethlehem Plant in Pennsylvania, which was a challenging but rewarding project.  I learned how to support the Japanese culture, which was interesting.  I took a class on how to support the Japanese culture.how to greet the Japanese professionally.The unfortunate part, was the company went through some changes over the past few years, losing our CEO, and resulting in multiple layoffs.  This made it hard to advance within the company, morale was low and there was no job security.great culture, work/life balance for full time employees. plenty of hands on experience. The only thing is contract work is for a long period of time.  Contractors are not really involved as they could be or should be in the company overall activities if they've been there over a year.DSI is really the place where I learned the most about Payroll.  The manager who hired me saw the value of finding and keeping exceptional employees.I learned the ins-and-outs of Payroll Administration, including the role-out of a new system.  I have also come to realize that without all team members sharing a common vision, motivation and production...The best part of the job was interacting with all of the different people, from 48 states and Puerto Rico.  A very diverse employee population.  I learned so much from so many different people, personally and professionally.typical office environment with little advancement opportunities. Decent work/life balance. Decent cafeteria. Companies is not stable and constantly does layoffs.The company was a wonderful place to work for many years.  In the last 5 years there has been tremendous change and turnover in upper management.  It was very stressful with yearly/ bi-yearly layoffs.  The company has just gone through a total restructuring.It is not the same company I worked for, so I don't know how it currently is to work for.For years, DSI was a positive environment to work in because they stressed a team environment.Traveled 12-14 overnights per month for 4 1/2 years.  My pay was very dependent on what my co-workers did in their role of sales representatives as we were all paid on the same products, just with different weightings.My direct managers were both fantastic!!  Couldn't have asked for better district managers!Hardest part of the job was being gone from my family and young child all the time.Most enjoyable part of the job was learning about the disease states, how the pharmaceuticals I sold helped people, and meeting so many wonderful providers, nurses, and other people across Montana and Wyoming!Amazing employeesamazing culturegood compensationi have nothing negative to say about Daiichi Sankyo, it has been a great foot in the door to the pharmaceutical industryExcellent products with excellent leadership from the top down.  Despite losing patent rights on their blockbuster anti hypertensive Benicar, they have acquired products and made themselves a viable and strong force going forward once Benicar expires.  Excellent training and excellent benefits!Loved working here.  Loved my coworkers and Managers.  Culture at the Parsippany location was enjoyable.  Ability to telecommute when weather is bad or children are home sick.My workday consisted of meeting deadlines; managing staff and trouble shooting. Upper management was very supportive of ideas. This company provided superior benefitsCo workers functioned as a team, supporting each other and working togetherMeeting daily deadlines was a must! Payroll can never be late.Most enjoyable part of my job was seeing results from organized preparation and execution. But most important was working with a dedicated staff.Currently transitioning in the United States. Awaiting product approvals in 2018-19. Large geographies, limited products and coverage.  New upper management leading US efforts.a typical day at work would be to talk to Life Insurance agents. I learnt a great deal of people management skills in short time. i also created relationship with Life insurance agents and assigned my agents of Auto and Home division to make product sales.DSI offered a competitive salary with good benefits in the market of pharmaceutical sales. They stood out in the type and quality of training received prior to entering the field as well as continued support and accessibility to resources in the home office. My partners are top notch individuals with a strong work ethic. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the changes in the managed care and healthcare reform as it effects our efforts.Great place to work with wonderful people. I consider my job to be a ""home-like"" enviornment with competitive benefits. My present supervisor is stellar and I consider myself blessed to have such a long career in the same department for 6+ years. The most enjoyable part of my job are the problem solving efforts and the interaction with people.Overall not a bad place to work, typical day includes; selling benefits to doctors on certain products for certain patient types, setting up business lunches and presentations, managing inventories in offices, and of course a lot of driving. If you don't enjoy speaking, selling or a high pressure management structure I wouldn't recommend this job to you. However if you enjoy competition, and don't mind the stress, this job can be enjoyable. The management in this company will put INCREDIBLE amounts of pressure on you to win quickly, this could be a good thing or bad depending on how you handle stressful situations, in can crush you or make you stronger depending on your personality type. Your coworkers are usually great, competition is fierce but friendly and generally people are willing to help you. If you are looking for an entry level pharma job this company can be a great test job to see if the industry is for you, it may not be a long term solution however as layoffs seem to happen every 2 years or so.Nothing to say about DSI.  If they had not had a restructure and handled it poorly, I would have stayed.Company was good and culture was good until they partnered with AZ on a bad contract.Daiichi originally started out as a great company, however many changes made in the last couple of years has lead to many employees leaving the company for better opportunities.  Many of the decisions made do not seem to be well thought out.  already submitted a review about this wonderful company. Ruch culture, great benefits, and work life balance. Promotes empployees from within and values their employees."
228,Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,"Fast paced environment, interaction with coworkers in this department of Revenue Control was always positive when it came time to helping one another. This was also demonstrated in other departments; Customer Service Billing and IT department. The hardest part of the job could have been the last few days before End of Month deadline, but because of the comraderie and the willingness to work as a team, the Revenue Control department was more times than not, able to meet/surpass the monthly goal.The workload is excessive, not within job descriptions and with zero compensation to take on extra responsibilities that is the responsibilities of other departments.  You enter at entry level, you are told during the interview that there is plenty of room to grow, yet when you make an attempt to climb the professional latter, you're told, ""if you want to grow, find another job"". Poor morale.Dana-Farber is a world class facility that I felt honored to be working for. The compassionate care for patients extends to it's employees and there is a real cohesive effort by all departments. While the benefits are nice the actual salaries are not particularly competitive and it can be difficult to advance within the organization without proper connections.I enjoy working at DFCI. The environment and people I work with are great. The benefits here are also very good, no complaints. I would recommend this position to everyone and anyone.Great Place to work, excellent opportunity, great management support.Daily challenges getting all priority deliveries around down town Boston and other campus locationsManagement gave me the tools necessary to deliver services.When I started at Dana I was at the front desk, after a couple of months I was promoted to the multidisciiplinary clinic.  I say the hardest part of the job was to see patients with Cancer Metastasis go into hospice and eventually they were gone.  Even though I would try not to get attached to them, it was quite impossible. Even though it was hard, I enjoyed working there knowing I was giving my best to someone who were in their lasts daysThe Institute needs change at the top and it will trickle down to the staff and employees.  So many of the senior management have been in the same position for over 20+ years and they have not kept up with the times and the typical response is "" that's how we do it here""Weekly events include seminars with various topics related research areas. and there are free snacks during the seminars.      People are very nice to work with. The public kitchen is well maintained by everyone. By the way, the coffee machine is awesome!Good Place to work, I m Dependable, conscientious, team player for operations.I considerer this position as a service to the organizaitonGreat Manager to work forI absolutely loved being part of such a care-driven team. I was thrilled working with the patients, it was incredibly rewarding to function as an asset to the doctors and nurses that provided such necessary care to patients in their toughest moments.If you're interested in pursuing a degree in healthcare this is a great experience to work in a hospital.There are long hours and a lot is expected of research coordinators. I didn't have the best training and stuff was kind of handed off to me in a mess.Great work flow  some people are great to work together with. there a lot of favoritism at Dana Farber, with coworker on section floor but over all the patients are great.Humbling and rewarding experience with patients.Great benefits and perks.Many different experiences with personnel as to be expected some good  and some that can use improvements. Overall a good place to work.Very competitive. Everyone works hard. Miss it due to the casual academic culture. Very easy to make friends. Can talk to everyone. Very smart people, with lots of hope and wonderful plans for the future.Excellent place to work. Cares for their employees and truly sees the value in the work that they do. Truly care for students as well.A normal day is very busy.  There are many difficult manual differentials to be done, and many difficult patients that must be resulted so that treatment can be given to them in a timely manner.  Working the later shift, I've gotten to know many doctors when they come to the lab to look at differential slides.  The hard part of the job is knowing how sick some of the patients are, and that they might not survive they're illness.  The best part of the job is working with really nice people where we can always find some humor even when the work day is very hectic and stressful. Plus everyday is a learning experience when new patients come in with unknown illnesses that have to be diagnosed.Dana-Farber has introduced me to some of the most impressive people I know. Both the main campus (hospital) and the development office in which I worked were inspiring places to work.• Formulate logic behind inventory analysis to understand current pricing and payment strategies• Identify gaps in inventory and sales management to reduce working capital by $10MM and improve order to cash cycle • Create client-facing workshop slide decks for natural supply chain discussions across the globeWhat can I say?  Working for DFCI was great.  They are very flexible with you especially if you have kids and go to school.  The management is wonderful and super friendly and they never make you feel inferior.  The advancement opportunities and compensation are great!  Great benefits also!  I'm sad I had to leave this place due to moving out of state.  Wish every place was like DFCI.Great first job out of Graduate School. This is not exactly what I would like do be doing with a Clinical Research Management and Regulatory Affairs masters degree. I feel like I could be doing more than just data entry. Really interested in a Regulatory position.I worked as a biostatistician for 8 years, and really learned a lot of statistics. The workload is diverse and you can deal with any type of project ranging from genomics to small mouse experiments to large-scale clinical trials. Statisticians routinely consult on anything from the design of research through publication of manuscripts.The drawback of this job, and what eventually made me leave, was the enormous workload. Meetings with department management to adjust project allocations led nowhere, and 50+ hours per week became expected. Advancement opportunity was very limited and I was only eligible for cost-of-living raises for the rest of my career. As one of my managers commented: ""No one has to work here, and anyone who doesn't like it can just leave.""I thought that the science at DF was amazing, as were some of the clinical investigators that I worked with. The major drawbacks for me were the indifference of my superiors, lack of advancement potential, and enormous work load."
166,Danaher,"Work there was like anywhere else,you do your job everything goes fine.I worked in many areas in plant, we made craftsman tools and packed them to be shipped to sears and other places.Their was a lot of good people working there and miss seeing them every day.The hardest part of the day was when four or five trucks came in at same time to be loaded, it was like none stop and some times overtime.no sure how things are nowadays but compensation was good, work balance was good, plant director ok, good place to learn lean tools.Hight pressure company that works you 7 days a week 14 hours a day.   Set unrealistic expectations.   The initial interview are all smoke and mirrors, and change on you after you start.They also gave me insights on the job Description also. Good place to work.I enjoyed working there.Good Benefit's.work sometimes, 7  Days.I enjoyed my time at Danaher Motion, I held a number of positions there, as I worked there for 30+ years. The management created a lean work atmosphere, that challenged us as a team. The hardest part of the job was to make our daily rates. We all pitched in as a team to make our rates, and our work experience enjoyable.Daily working with customers world wide through emails and some phone calls.Learned more about end of life management. Management changed during my time here. Too many changes all at once made things very difficult. No change over time to accommodate changes. Retired too many people all at once with a huge loss in contacts and information.Co-workers for the most part was easy to work with most of the time.No collaboration with other areas to stream line processes.Working with data collection and system conversions.Trains its leadership on ""Danaher Business System"" principles. Leaders are then expected to drive rigor, build talent that promotes the DBS culture. The result is every employee thinks and solves problems like a scientist. Status quo is constantly questioned and business model continuously strengthened.Great! Very professional staff.  Team work environment. client focused. Exemplary Client Service and satisfaction integral and non negotiable. Wonderful place to work.Good company to work for. Very busy!!Customer care has expanded many roles and back up many other divisons in the company.A typical day is answering the phine to customers calling for repairs, returns, or want to place an order.Data entry for orders, returns, repairs, etc. Creating UPS labels for returns, Entering credits.My coworkers were always friendly and helpful, as was the management team.The hardest part of my job was the stress of a complaining customer. The most enjoyable part was being on the morale team and planning team building events for the staff.I liked working for Danaher.The Danaher company that I worked at was wonderful, pre-Danaher. When Danaher takes over, although tough, the business improvements are definitely good for the business. The people, however, suffer. There is complete lack of concern for long-term employees; people who have no other skill than what they have been doing for 30-40 years. They do not want old people or old ""tainted"" culture. If you are young and ready to climb a ladder, this is the place for you. Otherwise, steer clear.management your co-workers,working with good and nice people,the hardest part of the day was trying to work with some people that didnt wont to do their job.It was a good place to work and a good company to be involved with the company is associated with Sears and machining making tools.Many opportunities to learn, but very few opportunities to advance.  Work/Life balance non-existent.  Feel like you are an infidel if you need to work at home, call out sick, apply for FMLA or handle personal family matters.  Currently, there are NO managers as all have left for other, more lucrative and appreciative opportunities.Executive leadership does not follow through on engaging employees or developing them for growth.  There is a whole division of employees who are heavily engaged in helping the business leaders implement company strategy, but are completely ignored and continuously unrecognized.This job was challenging and i love a good challenge. I found this job very rewarding. The 200 people that reported to me were an absolute pleasure to work with. Together we built a great team and became the top in this facility.Most days I would just go in and just get right in to working,  Everyone was really nice and approachable never any problems in the workplace.Working at Danaher is very frustrating since Priorities are swapped like underwear.I learned so far that even the most skillfull people can be disabled by mismanagement.A very busy place to work, I learned a lot about parts and packaging and shipping.Co-works were very friendly and helpful.I have worked with Danaher for over 2 years now and have been promoted to 3 positions within a 6 month span. I went from machine operator, to Cybron Production and Scaling, to Quality Assurace Technician. Paying attention to detail and the need to learn more than my assigned postion, I am able to advance in my knowledge and understand how the departments work together to produce the desired outcome of parts and assembly. I enjoy leaning how to make new molds, how to adjust them, and gaining knowledge of what is part does for each customer we produce for. The engineers work closly with me to teach me details of their work, so I may improve constantly on my job in quality. I work closely with management in my daily work schedule where I feel free to make suggestions or offer advice to make operations more organized or improved as well as follow instructions given to me, I work overtime and in the place of those that may need to miss a day.I work weekends when needed and other shifts when needed.Although, just an intern, they treated me very well. There was not anything particularly hard about the job, my duties were fairly easy. I enjoyed my years there.High customer service demand. Most work was done individually without much team work. Required a lot of push demands instead of being able to be proactive. Requires more communication between departments internally. Customer service is required for internal just as much as an external customer. Getting to personally talk with my regular customers in other service centers. Emails and instant messaging doesn't always work for explaining issues.Good company with good products. Ability to learn new technology and challenge yourself. work environment friendly and fun."

502,Dealer Track,"learn as manual tester for the following test cases, test scenario, test plan of the auto insurance company. the most enjoyable part of the job is health plan and 401k plan.If you are OK with working with a lot of people who i feel do more meeting with each other (talking about floor supervisors) than helping train properly.This is a fast, steady,paced office with people personal information coming through, so confidentially is very important and entering accurate information is.It’s a good company I learned a lot from that client I learned many thing from project manager I thought of continuing with this company  we are unable to do .DealerTrack was a great place to gain knowledge and is always on the cutting edge of technology in the automotive industry.  The rules are not too strict and you will learn a lot of you want to from a lot of very smart people.It was a very nice placer to work. Love the people and the supervisors.  Flexible hours and nice pay.  Easy to find from the main highways.Too much drama to deal with and the amount of negativity drains with the second you walk into the doors! Do not recommend working here! No upper management, the office manager does know what she's doing, the team leads act like their too good for their jobs and the work is not worth being paid so little for. You are better off in retail on weekends than doing this!Great company culture, and excellent benefits. Ability to work remotely and very flexible with time off. High turnover due to restructuring of departments and recent acquisition.The work environment is neatly organized. However, management is horrible and unorganized . The employees work well as a team. The hardest part of the job is taping boxes.Dealertrack Technologies, Inc is one of the result oriented working environment where each and every employee has their own Identity.Dealertrack is a big company to work for.  I work from 7:30-4:00, which are pretty awesome hours. They are pretty flexible when it comes to hours.  I think the best part of my job is working with my co-workers.  We are definitely a team that works together to solve any issue.  I've been with my company for almost 12 years and have learned a lot especially about management skills.  I think the hardest part of my job would have to be the amount of standing I do a day, but I wouldn't have it any other way.  I like to up and about.Fast paced environment with plenty of opportunity for advancement. Multiple locations across the country with many carreer paths to choose from.Great place to get a foot in the door as well as a little advancement; advancement is limited however and usually requires substantial relocationGreat work/life balance, benefits are amazing!

I enjoyed working with new clients everyday and learning state laws in regards to registrationDealertrack excels at helping clients connect their marketing and operations across both digital and physical environments. They pay  really well.However, it was a great opportunity and I learned a variety of skills.  My supervisor was very down to earth and all employees, including temps, were treated to a monthly lunch.  The work was repetitive but everyone was always nice and lighthearted so it made the work less torturous.DealerTrack is a growing company. There is room for advancement and has a great environment. Great benefits. Opportunities are fair.A typical day at Dealertrack included reviewing your case load and working individual tickets, via email or phone.  Placing calls to clients to update them on the status of their issues.Not too much working pressure, the engineering team is pretty nice and willing to help you at all times. The engineering team is also willing to absorb the new technologies."

Left in dark concerning direction of the company and future growth. Experiencing extreme growing pains as the company moves from small to large. Corporate staff is more focused on the bureaucratic ways of the olden times instead of setting DEI apart and developing talent. Micromanagement runs rampant. Was once run as a family oriented business but those at the helm are choking the organizational culture, there is little left. There is no advocate for the employee.  Work-life balance non-existent.The company has serious issues with compensating employees for work done outside of your job description. You are constantly being asked to perform duties that don't pertain to your job description and when you inquire about compensation, you are continuously given the runaround. They are quickly developing a negative image in the contracting world because of their lack of structure and knowledge. I understand that companies go through growing pains, but there is a point in which things become ridiculous. Also some individuals are underpaid, while others are overpaid.The culture of this company is antiquated with inflated egos poorly managing the staff. I question their ability to obtain or maintain government contracts. There is poor knowledge of the contracting world among management and compensation and business etiquette is poor. This is a horrible place to work and I strongly advise anyone applying for a job here to find a more established business.They took good care of me and the benefits were awesome.  They went to bat for me when negotiating my pay.  They offer a really competitive 401K plan and were willing to pay for me to attend Cisco Live in San Diego, CA.  Really nice people to work with.Defense Engineering Inc. (DEI) is a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, headquartered in Arlington, Virginia.Very small company.

Assets IT support team with trouble shooting and setting PC setup's for newly hired interns. i enjoyed coming to work everyday, encountered new problems that we able solve to create a more productive environmentI liked DAN because of the work sponsored happy hour that we had every Thursday. Everyone is pretty much cool, however, please do not expect a raise or a promotion. They will get you to work very hard for a reward and will never give it to you. I worked at the front desk and I am very sociable. Many team members vented to me about their problems in the office. Unfortunately, everyone seem to have the same problem: snotty clients and false promises. But the work place is very pleasant.- It is a routine Job from 8 to 5 everyday. - Lunch is not paid. We have to take an hour lunch because Finance is treated different than the rest of the company. The rest start 9 AM. - The rest of the company get overtime and Finance doesn't- Vacation is the only thing that keeps people enjoying their job because we get paid holidays and up to 2 weeks vacation for entry level people and 6 sick days.Overall, it has been a great place to work.  There has been significant growth over the last 3+ years, which allows for a lot of opportunity to learn, grow and make a mark in the longer term process and efficiency building. The hardest part is change management with teams trying new ways to manage day to day tasks.  Getting teams to embrace change and to think of more efficient and effective ways to do their day to day tasks, is a challenge. My co-workers have been awesome.  Everyone is willing to help and look out for each other."
126,Department Of Agriculture,"I never worked for the Department of AG.  I dont know why this agency popped up.  there is not review to say.    blah blah blah  nothing to say.  Never worked at this agency.Through UGA I was able to intern at the USDA. I was not paid a salary but was given class credit as compensation. A typical day involved arriving to the lab on time with a plan for that day's procedures. The first half of the internship involved learning basic lab techniques and following protocols. The second half of the internship involved troubleshooting in order to create my own lab protocol for future interns to follow. I mostly spent my time learning from the head lab technician, but would occasionally work with the head of research if he was available. The best part about the job was learning new things related to biology and being able to think through my errors in an environment suited for student advancement.You assist landowners and farmers on a daily basis to receive government subsidies. Work with genuine people all around. Not just within the office but the producers themselves.The USDA FOREST SERVICE is a wonderful agency to begin a career.

I learned how the government works and what it take to please your supervisors as well as the community. Management  was more hands off, which I loved as long as you knew your expectations and performed. Co-workers, some worked just as hard as you, some did not. Some were long term, and some were not, with that approach. The hardest part was management having a difficult time making sure everything was communicated effectively and everyone on the same page. The happiest part of the job, was knowing that you save someone from losing their home are their hard earned possessions or property.The Temple office is a great place to work.  The people are friendly and the work environment is good also.  I have learned a lot from them and they seem to be very helpful.Fast paced.

The incumbent uses this knowledge and skill to apply techniques to obtain and evaluate a borrower's ability (or lack thereof) to reinstate a delinquent loan and to conclude whether a borrower has the potential to repay the loan.Management could get too micro manage and only care for production instead of being people oriented. Customer service is not their priority but making their numbers. Coworkers are hard worker but afraid of management and losing their job. The most enjoyable part of the job is that we could make a difference in people's lives, and that is satisfaction enough.I job shadowed a lab technician. There was not much I could learn about benefits or other employees. The work environment was more constricted to a specific area.I work in an agency that helps farmers improve their land.  We have a very diverse group of employees.My job is to maintain files and assist the various groups with the administrative duties, answer phones, put postage on our system and to ship the UPS packages each day.

610,Department Of Justice,"Most Exciting career in law enforcement.  No regrets, only fond memories knowing that our children slept soundly while we were arresting the most violent individuals in this country.Great co-workers and team environment. Lack of upward advancement and career opportunities as a contractor. Management is inexperienced. Salary and benefits of contractor company are incredibly low for the quality and quantity of work provided to the government.If your not hired directly as a federal employee and go through a contractor company,  expect people to treat you like garbage! You get paid way less and the health benefits are so bad there isn't a point to even purchase it.  I worked as a Financial Analyst in FLU and the Assistant US Attorney is smug, condescending and doesn't deserve his position. Other AUSA attorneys say he is unteachable and errogant. Keep in mind the U.S Attorney's office hires these people fresh out of law school with little knowledge of what they are doing. Half the time people sit at there desk and twiddle their thumbs all day. I was very disappointed and expected to learn and experience much more when I was working there. The women are very catty and quick to make up lies about you...the only good thing about this job is you can request a 4 or 5 day weekend almost on every federal holiday....again, showing u how much everyone wants to really work there. If you want a good job and a lasting job,  look somewhere else!Great benefits, plenty of room to advance and move within the company. Management could use some more training but overall great work/family balance.  Yearly raisesHigh stress correctional environment with increasingly acute and chronic medical and psychiatric patients. Law enforcement benefits are exceptional. Pay compensation lacking in comparison to hospitals.Have not received a raise in almost 8 years, not satisfied with working conditions. Very unsafe.  Director is very stand off does not engage with staff uses he super-intents to talk to staff.Early mornings, lots of responsibility.Learned to produce meals for a large number of people.Decent management team.Lots of different personalities in co-workers. Earle mornings...4 AM!Seeing peoples response to great food.i wish that I can go back to working for the D.O.J. I would recommend any young person to start in the government to get a good salary and they can advanceFirst, I have a busy morning to start off with but, work in a good environment with employers and employees.Since, I've been employed whether through my current position law enforcement and health field it has touch me to have good work ethics and more diverse.Management in both my current position micro manages, but, although it can be overwhelming at times it only makes me into a better employee and complete my job duties correctly.My co-workers are so so because when dealing with different personally it can be a bit difficult, but, I can work with anyone at the end of the day. Dealing with the strict environment and some managersThe public and learning different work related materialDOJ's Asset Forfeiture Management Staff (AFMS) comprises of several departments including it's information security team. Forfeiture Systems's (FS) security team deals with continuous monitoring, incident response, vulnerability assessment, vulnerability remediation, working with various security tools, and analysis of vulnerable findings within AFMS networks. The essential part and the most challenging part of the job was to maintain a good security posture so management would be satisfied with overall security structure. The most enjoyable part of the team was the flexibility in work schedules and balance between professional and personal life.Workload is sufficent for pay. Some Managers are amazing and others not so much. I have learned many of skills that will assist me in my career. The hardest part of the job is when Managers do not provide training. I am not saying this is every Manager. I have experienced the lack of training from more than one Manager. The most enjoyable part of the job is the majority of coworkers are extremely friendly. DOJ fosters a positive work environment for the most part.Day normally starts with my initial paperwork then begin driving routes. Friendly environment and we all help each other, along with management. The best part is being on the road meeting people while completing the task at hand.My time with the Justice Department was enjoyable and exciting, as I have gain many years of experience as Paralegal Specialist. I was able to work with inter agencies and many agencies within the Justice Department, DEA, FBI, U.S. Marshals, Courts and Prison facilities. My daily work schedule was pretty busy setting up interview of witnesses in cases and organize documents and filing pleading and arrange conference calls closing case files.  I didn't find the job to hard. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the attorney win there cases because everything was done in a timely manner.This company dose not train new employees very well.  This company expect you to understand what was told you, they do not explained nor show you how to do the work.  This company has very bad communication skills as well as the management  team is very un-organized and un-appreciative of a good worker.  The management teams is extremely strict and some what bully's their workers in doing other duties that is not within their job description.As a language professional you perform a wide variety of translations and interpretations which makes the job challenging but fun and rewarding at the same time. Co-workers are very well educated and come from different backgrounds. Management sees you as family.

Where you end up is completely up to you.This is a typical government agency. The people I worked with were great. Sometimes the work became mundane, which is why I was always looking for a challenge. Being in the administrative field tends to get a little boring at times. However, you get out of a job what you put into it. I really enjoyed working for the federal government with the exception of the commute. The only reason that I left there was due to some extenuating medical issues that have now been taken care of to the best of my ability.While I believe the benefits could use some tweaking, CBH is an outstanding place to work.  By far the best place I have ever worked.  The nurses were treated with such respect from management staff and they were truly appreciative and rewarding for hard work!  Would highly recommend!Review loans that are in potential foreclosure status. outbound and inbound calls from customers to advise status of loan.A great government agency with a stellar reputation; however, I wish I had done my due diligence into my job title and overall duties and responsibilities because there is not a lot of leverage and career growth for non-attorney staff (unless you are an analyst or project manager). That said, I worked to gain a new position on my own with little guidance or mentorship and to date, has improved my standing considerably. Overall, management could be much better especially to assist employees interested in building a career at the DOJ on a non-attorney track. The work-life balance could not be better and the benefits packages are also quite excellent. There are trade-offs to any job, but the DOJ does provide its employees with an alternative to private sector work that most find attractive."
644,Department Of Labor,"Enjoyed every moment of this position. Everything was paced perfectly, and my co-workers respected  my time.My professional and sub-professional work history has spanned a period exceeding 30 years.  I am in reasonable good health and love outdoor activities.  Management in the companies that I have worked for varied as the work environment demanded.  I enjoyed underground mining and stability monitoring of mine works.  The hardest and most challenging work in underground production was longwall and continuous miner continuity of operations and complying with state and federal regulations.I would get to work and put on my coveralls, gloves, hairnet, and hat, and start to assemble the machinery to be used for the day, as well as using the power jack to bring in the product of the day for cooking and packaging.  Then after assembly my team and I would continue to work until break.  My co-workers and I would all have designated jobs and activities to do, and some of the workers would excel in certain areas as opposed to others.  Creating a relaxed but diligent environment was necessary to finish the day's work on time so we could get a head start on the next day's preparations.I was a student trainee for the black lung office. Within this job I had several duties. This included making sure all documents processed within that day got mailed out to the client, the lawyer, the judge, and/or the survivor. I was responsible for tracking the large documents that have been mailed out. Overseen the file room and mail room. Overseeing the large file room and keeping that in order helped me gain valuable operations management skills. I also met all requests gave by claims examiners and senior claims examiners.This was a very enjoyable job. It was only for students so when I graduated I had to quit.A typical day at work shows high demand from the clientele we have either over the phone or in person. The work provided to us is consistent and we always learn something new everyday. With the change in daily instructions, sometimes there is an issue with lack of communication which can make the job difficult at times. But the best part of the job is always being able to satisfy the client.Working in this department is a difficult prospect. The salary is good and competitive, but the job is a perfect representation of the metaphor ""a cog in the machine."" Processing the same amount of work day in and day out and being mandated on a metric basis is very demoralizing, add in the lack of advancement and this job has a clear turnover.Greeted patients and provided triage depending on need, such as appointment schedules and records.  Managed office supplies, vendors, organization and upkeep.  Prepared treatment rooms for patient examinations, keeping the rooms neat and  Maintained a clean reception area, including lounge and associated areasMaintained a case management for at 20 veterans, conducted workshops such as resume writing, interviewing skills, dress for success, stress release and more. I learned how to conduct case management and a new software. The hardest part of the job was not being able to find suitable employment for a veteran. The most enjoyable part of the job was going beyond my job description and see the veteran get medical benefits due to my refer. The technology for this local government was great and training also.On a typical day, I would go to a local bakery to be picked up by the people in charge of the internship program I was in. The program was held at a house, belonging to a local entrepreneur. The least enjoyable part of the job was working with people unprofessional, and ignorant. The most enjoyable part of the job was making homemade goods and selling them to the public. This job also gave me an opportunity to make friends with co-workers.I was tasked to implement safety features and render audits to  center staff. I also supervised a security staff of 45 around the clock. Working closely with staff and trainees in making there campus life safe and without concern. Implemented active shooter drills.At DOL Job at work and family life of employees are balances. Compensation at DOL is competitive while benefits are exceptional. Job security and advancement are guaranteed as long as the employee performs right. Management is always pro employees, while job culture is based on the mission of the agency.I enjoyed my last two positions with Goodwill and when my time was up and no longer eligible to work for them due to a four year limit I continued working as a volunteer at Foxwood because I enjoyed the job and the work I was doing.Management at this job was really, really good.  Lower-level employees, especially the older employees, were unqualified and routinely obstructed work from being done.  Once I got access to the systems that I needed access to (6 weeks) the lower level employees were suddenly really hostile.  Files disappeared. I got yelled at for retrieving files that I was supposed to have to do my job.  It's not a professional environment on the lower levels. People spent hours (say noon to 3) at lunch and worked through one or two cases per day when the cases only take 15 minutes at maximum to enter into the system. Trying to squeeze promotions out of management and eliminate rivals were my co-workers' main goals.The best part of the job was getting paid.  It was easy, light work and the pay seemed phenomenal for how little I was doing.A typical day was helping the clients as needed on the computer,It was very easy talking to the management team.  Good relationship with my co-workers.  The hardest part was having the clients wait for their turns for a computer.  The most enjoyable time was when we all spent time together.Worked with finance and accounting management to audit internal controls.  Worked on a variety of audits.  Prepared budgets, audit reports.  Management and trained audit staff members.Good company to work for with many benefits and chances for job advancement.

Felt I was very good at customer relations, trouble shooting issues and communication.A typical day at work is just coming in 8am in the morning and continue working on the most recent task assigned to us by our boss. I have learned so much working for this department, from gaining more customer service skills to gaining more experience working in the Office field. The management and co-workers are very friendly, understanding and flexible. The hardest part of this job is when we get assigned a last minute assignment that needs to be done right away. The most enjoyable part of this job is having the opportunity to meet successful people on a daily basis and having the opportunity to gain more knowledge and experience working in the office field.The Department of Labor, Job Corps Division, gives youth ages 16-24 the opportunity and ability to continue growth and development in life through vocational and academic pursuits.  Many are able to correct mistakes of the past or enhance their education and skill development through disciplined training.  The residential setting is a huge adjustment for the trainees and only 2 of the 125 centers nationwide are non-residential.  Just as anything else in life, you get out what you put in!Co-Workers are energetic eager to go set health and safety inspections.  Management is easy and understanding, My enjoyable part of my job is going out in the field to translate."
131,Department Of The Interior,"Great work experience with a lot of demanding, but rewarding elements. Allowed me to utilize an environmental education role that I previously had no experience in.

Learned a lot about law enforcement.Management was ok.  Co workers were the best. Hardest part of the job were long hours. Most enjoyable part was a successful criminalcase.The best part of this job is being a National Park Service Ranger. Everyone who comes in says ""you're so lucky to have this job!!"" To do it well it means working hard, spending a lot of hours of preparing programs and sometimes, waiting for hours on a ridgeline for wildlife that decide to go somewhere else on a whim. The vast majority of the jobs the the NPS are seasonal, summer type jobs, so that's one reason you'll see a lot of retirees as Park Rangers. When you only have work for 6 months a year, you need a 2nd source of income. There are generally very few people out in the parks who don't really want to be there, so the working environment is great.To look for NPS jobs, you have to find them on USAJobs, the Government's official website. Search where you want to work and be sure to tailor your USAJobs resume specifically to the opening you are applying for.best job I have ever had though it was unfortunately a seasonal position. The company itself had great job security for full time workers as well as noteworthy benefits. The job itself was hard work but very fulfilling.on certain days I would go in and do maintenance at the main office fixing things like electrical problems, Repairing buildings, Installing siding on buildings, Installing Instillation under buildings, and on days im not at office I would go out to camp grounds and keep up with the camp grounds and fix and repair things such as fixing broken door handles, Installing water pumps, Installing solar panels, Installing hot water heatersMy direct manager was wonderful. She tried everything she could to get me on permanent, was like pulling teeth in the State Office, not because of work performance but because I had no military status. I held very good positions because of manager but was not paid for those positions. The experience was well worth it. I learned about project analysis and project management. Took courses held through the Federal Government for Federal Appropriations Law and Project Management. Assisted in multi-million dollars budgeting and database management in financing. If I could only rate Karla Norris...she was an exceptional manager. Because I worked for the federal government most of us were not native to the area..different walks of life, great working with people from all over the united states.Excitimg career choice nevera dull moment. Damgerous but rewarding. Tons of opportunities for growth.   Senior officers are nice and very open with help and leading new officersIt was an amazing experience to associate with wildland firefighters (an incredible group of people).  In coordinating training within the State of Utah, working with State and Federal organizations, I learned a lot and learned to work with an appreciate a 'work culture' previously unknown to me.The system includes 413 areas covering more than 84 million acres in every state, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. These areas include national parks, monuments, battlefields, military parks, historical parks, historic sites, lake shores, seashores, recreation areas, scenic rivers and trails, and the White House.I thoroughly enjoyed working for DOI. The work was challenging at times, but always enjoyable. My coworkers and management were so easy to get along with that it made my job much more enjoyable.The best people I have ever worked with and would like to stay but I must work on 100 ton vessel to advance my license. I have worked there for two years and have enough time to upgrade to 1600 Mate. Would like to get more time on 100 ton vessel to upgrade to 500 ton Master.good job just needs better job security. however work is starting to heat up so overall a great place to work. a typical day would be getting to job setting up equipment and taking care of business.I only worked with the NPS for a summer. The entire summer was full of fun and learning experiences. They had a lot of things for us to do on the weekends when we weren't working such as traveling to different parks, learning about the NPS, going to DC, among other exciting experiences. I would love to work for them again.Management is aweful.  They only care about themselves and getting promoted.  Management doesn't care about the actual workers.Learned how to get things done in a GOV environment. It is different than Commercial workflow. I also gained the experience of a Nation wide collaboration of combined systems and people.Although my work in the federal service has been incredibly rewarding and my career has continuously progressed, my passion lies in community engagement and meeting the needs of the people within my community. My ability to lead is the richest when I am focused on leading a team that is focused on building a better future for youth, families and the surrounding communities.The DOI is one of many Government agencies that represent the worst that the Federal Government has to offer. The have taken full time positions and re defined them as term positions or seasonal positions. Advancement is impossible unless you are on the ""in"" with the agency. Nepotism is rampant and pay is low.I really enjoyed saving people lives and property. It gave me a sense of happiness and joy knowing that I help someone who need it my help. I enjoy traveling seeing nice forest and other towns that I never seen before. Enjoy seeing animals in the wild.Great place of business. Room for growth and learning. Great opportunities. Great atmosphere. I loved this place. They really do work with your ideas as an individual although they are a large company"
617,Department Of The Treasury,"They allow a work/family life balance.Management is old fashioned, if they like you you are golden if not it does not matter how much you try, you won't move ahead.I interviewed and prepared income tax returns of several low to medium income customers. Happy to have filed approx. $60,000 of Income Tax returns in a short span and saving Tax preparation fees worth $4,800.This was a great volunteering experience with Foundation Communities that is doing an impactful work year-after-year helping local communities with their finances and improving there quality of life in general.Excellent quality control by IRS by making sure all volunteers go through an entrance exam before they can get registered as a Tax Preparer.Had an excellent learning experience!The internal revenue is a great place to grow. Everyday you have a work leader who gives you the run down on how to be succesfull at the task at hand. About 1000 tax documents need to be edited and reviewed a day. The Hardest part about the job is knowing when to take breaks throughout the day. The most enjoyable part of the day is the end when everyones about finished with their documents. Its a pretty bland and boring day. But very easyI learned how to effectively deal with upset customers. I learned and took pleasure in helping customers be able to manage their finances so they are able to take care of all responsibility including paying taxes. I enjoyed helping identity theft victims feel secure n knowing the action i took internally would not effect their tax liability or refund in the future.The duty is to service taxpayers & that is what will occur. Typically there is a mix of telephone calls and paper cases. Many systems and skills will be learned. Workout because we love to eat there. The people are nice and most will help you in any way possible. There are organizations and other outlets for training and skills development.Earnings and benefits may be good, but atmosphere is only good for advancement in larger work centers.  Small call sites are stifling, and ridiculously rigid.  Lots of backstabbing and miserable employees.  Only work in larger sites, if you dare.loved working for the IRS i was a filing clerk and a mail clerk handle and sort documents. management was awesome great work environment fellow co workers were amazing and friendly and helpfulExcellent  highly recommend working for the Internal Revenue Service.  I worked for the Internal Revenue Service for twenty years.  In each and every day enjoyed looking forward to benefit my clients.Good place to work and climb up the ladder.Worked well with co-workers.  Managers listen to your opinions of how to distribute work between co workers to get done in time.Professional work environment. Many opportunities to learn and advance.  Job stability with flexible work hours.  Satisfying pay.  Work fairly easy.My typical work day started at 6:00 am where I managed a caseload of 150 plus tax cases.  I learned a great deal about analyzing tax accounts, procedures and systems.  As far as management there is definitely room for improvement.  I enjoyed all of my coworkers there were many people from different nationalities, backgrounds, ages cultures.  The hardest part of the job lack of moral, encouragement and support from management.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being recognized for a job well done and helping tax payers.Nothing to really say, it's your typical government agency. Wouldn't go back. Taught me a lot professional though. Great time off.AM shift is 5:30 am - 2 pm and PM shift is 3 - 11:30 pm.  Management needs a lot of improvement and training.  Not all are bad but most still need adequate training.  Best part of the job are the people you work with.  Hardest part of this job is finding out the correct answers on how to solve certain issues.  Not everyone is on the same page and are given different solutions to one problem.As a Taxpayer representative and being able to handle different people from all backgrounds, this was an very interesting position that I loved to do.  This position was one of the best positions to have that was directly related in my field of an Accounting degree.  My co-workers had made it an easy place to work, because they were enjoyable to be around while we processed and answered questions related to filing, preparing, and adjustments related to individual and business taxes.My day was productive and busy. I have learn how things worked in the corporate world. I enjoyed working with the people I encountered. hardest part of my job was staying focused, I worked at a different pace that what I normally worked at. I enjoyed the people and the work experience I that I got to have at such an early age.When I worked at the IRS, it was my very first office job.  I had no expectations of office work in general.  It was a lot more wacky and fun-loving than I thought the IRS would be.Defined job responsibilites - training provided to perform various jobs that you may be required to perform on an as-needed basis.  Defined career path structureLearned several new things on a weekly basis.  The job at times was very stressful.  Enjoyed the people that I worked with and got to know them on personally.Ok place to work, the majority of the job is on the phone helping customers. depending on your manager, management can be a blessing or not. Co-workers are fun to work with.After a training of basic tax knowledge, we would be able to help tax payers to prepare their tax returns. It is a great chance for accounting students to have a general overview of how the taxation system works.Great place to work. The learning environment was amazing. I was given many different opportunities to expand my knowledge and customer service skills.."
233,Department Of Transportation,"If your an engineer then this is the place to get into too! The HR department is good but slow. The location is awesome and free parking in Boston is a rarity!On a typical day as a Lead Administrative Assistant I am responsible for clerical duties for a group of 44 individuals. My group deals with safety of the National Flying Space, which includes taking phone calls for accidents, unsatisfactory conditions reports, safety risk management for all the western area and routing this calls to the appropriate specialist.I review time and attendance to ensure accuracy and compliance with government and state laws.I review travel authorizations and vouchers for all specialist and managers, so that all monetary reimbursements are per FAA travel policies.I review all memorandums and letters, routing for signatures and tracking within our filing system, also keeping with records retention laws.Demanding career with odd hours, compressed schedules and minimal hours between shifts.  This job required 100% performance 100% of the time.This job demanded a ""Type A"" personality, so one typically works with a room full of high level/performing individuals and personalities clashed with regularity.Air Traffic Controllers work in a dynamic environment which is constantly changing from special procedures, weather conditions, congested airspace, and enroute spacing.Working as an air traffic controller was extremely rewarding and exciting.  Learning to do the job was difficult and even after an assumed competency there was much more to add to one's repertoire of skills.  The subtleties necessary to become an effective controller made all the difference.Air Traffic is a wonderful career oppotunity but not for everyone. Stress is high and must be willing to work shift work/weekends and holidays. The benefits are tremendous though and the FAA provides many of career opportunities for advancement.as long as you stay part time at ups you will be just fine but if you flip to full time and they don't like you they will have you fired for sure.  PTO was good and vacation was good and free benefits but no personal life at all.The DOT job environment was satisfactory and professional. The benefits in the DOT motivates the employees to provide the best quality work. The most enjoyable part of my job was working in a all round technical work as part of my rotational assignment.This was one of the best places I have ever worked for. The management was amazing, caring, understanding. The employees who I worked with were wonderful and we were a big happy family. I miss working there so much.The people I worked with were very good people. I have a bit of  humor built in me and I was always kidding them. It seemed to strengthen the bond between workers. Also always helped out where help was needed.The hardest part of the job is the heat in the summer. They pay one of the top pay for bus drivers in Indiana, with benefits available. Co-works are like family.During my time at the Department, I was associated with the completion of roadway surveys through their S.T.A.M.P.P program. I learned a lot through this program including data entry and leadership skills. A typical day was working first shift being responsible with state-issued vehicles and navigating within the four districts we were concerned with to complete drainage, guiderail, and shoulder surveys.The work day passed quickly due to big load work. I am learning how to behave and work as a team with my co-workers. Management is very good, friendly, cooperative. Meantime, I am meeting the company requirements, codes of behavior, etc. I am feeling very good in such good working atmosphere. However, professional grows       is limited, although, I did take and passed all professional exams that are were offered to me. Besides, my salary get is stuck somewhere in the middle of its scale.These folks are fake and have a management style that only benefits the management. Employees are talked about behind their backs and are ridiculed.Good team work. Staple and good Benefits. flexible hours jobs.Paid holidays. Job Promotion opportunity. Flexible hour.Excellent work life balance environment. Management uses a  hands off approach. As a professional they trust you to do your Job well and on time. Once you learn the job it will be less challenging technically.This company have the best on the job training ever.  This company likes to work with their employees and love to see them grow and advance to another level.  This company allow you to advance to a higher level and works with you.  They also provide training and classes that will help you become better at your job or future career.The management team is unprofessional and some of the co-workers are not so friendly and open to new people/employees.A typical day is scheduled pick ups, bus inspection before starting the route. Pre-trip and a post trip, paper work for any incidents. The hardest part is dealing with customers under the influence who may harm other's or themselves,Having worked for the FAA for over 25 years, I have seen it progressively slide downward.  The professionalism that used to be a hallmark of air traffic control is gone.  The integrity of managers and too many employees is gone.  A sense of progress and vision is non-existent.  In conversations with peers around the country, the same refrain is heard again and again:  ATC needs to be contracted out to fix it.  The ATO is rotting from the inside out.  The head of the snake needs to be cut off.The hardest part of an ATC job is working within the management structure.  It's hostile both directions, and many managers refuse to take a stand out of fear of reprisal.  The only enjoyable part of the job is the pay and the benefits.  (Know anywhere besides public ""service"" where you get a pension AND Social Security AND a 401(k)?)Passing the FAA Academy is difficult, but if you can make it through it is a very awarding career. The FAA HR and hiring process was not very efficient or effective. The HR department is difficult to contact and not always the most helpful. Employees themselves were very friendly and helpful, but the training program has a very low pass rate.The bus driver deals with a lot of stressful noise from a bus load of kids on a daily bases. But because the kids don't understand what a privilege it is for them to ride to school on a bus and the parents not making kids understand the important of bus rules. Makes a bus driver day to day job very difficult. Most drivers have high stress level, high blood pressure, and are more likely to have a heart attack than any other job and get paid the worst in any job field I know. The bus driver does not like the pay or the health risk. But we do it for the kids.We know they need us even when they feel they don't appreciate us. We love our children.Hadn't I had a serious of accidents I wouldn't have retired great job great co-worker's,...good benifits. I love the atomomy and versatilty of it."
248,Department of Veterans Affairs,"Excellent, top notch professionals work here. Cumbersome processes across the board make it difficult to produce great work.Loved my experience working with veterans and involving in programs such helping the homeless and interacting on different levels with far strong oral &written communcation skills.I enjoyed working a at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Will miss everyone. My upcoming retirement is January 3, 2017. Looking forward to part-time employment helping others.Although I enjoy my job, the workload is extreme. Work environment is stressful, only due to workload. Supervisor is extremely helpful and understanding when it comes to home life.Government job so all of the standard good things like Job Security but this is not a good place to advance. Supervisors would rather hire from another VA for promotions so they don't get accused of favoritism by promoting within. So, even though you may work hard and excel at your position, you will be treated the same as those who do the bare minimum. Sooner or Later even the most motivated workers figure this out so you either move on or become a bad employee.Upper management did not communicate well with staff members. It is a very political job and promotions are hard to get. Paid well.The place is ever-changing from new management to new rules every other day. The constant changes can cause much chaos, but on the other hand, it is very rewarding when you know you have helped a Veteran in a positive way.The path lab is a great area to work. Management is supportive of advancement. Co-workers are considerate. I abhor filing, but enjoy typing dictation.Have enjoyed my time working here. Has great opperunities for career advancements, and working there is simply rewarding in itself.Working with the staff has taught me more about the veterans that are in need of assistance. The breadth of knowledge that i have received , as well as the varied tasks that your staff manages daily provided an environment that was both exciting and challenging.The VA obviously doesn't do their research when hiring contractors. ATP2 has Cassandra House who has made threats to employees. Austin, TX VAFSC. LackWorking with the vets in the hospital, nice coworkers how to get along the hardest part of the job getting up in the morningIt is a place where residents are well taken cared of and protected against any form of abuse. Management takes action as it happens. Good team work among staff. Good learning environment.Very supportive staff. Flexible work schedule. Learned that many tasks are ongoing, so if you need quick gratification this is not for you. Overall very nice place to work. Ability for autonomy.Organized Clinic appointments for out-patient care, and assisted with scheduling appointments for Physical Therapy and the VA MOVE Program. Management and co workers were usually nice. The most enjoyable part was helping Veterans.Difficult to progress once in if at too low a level, prior experience is does not matter as much as being at a certain pay grade for an amount of time.Steady work, no layoffs, nice people generally, serving the veterans.  So, the job can be rewarding. Personal development is not encouraged. Creative thinking is not encouraged. Cost savings are not encouraged on projects. Many functions are inefficient.enjoyed helping the veterans and all patients they need to know that there is someone here to help them with the rules of there insurenceMy experience here was good with other agencies that I worked with was good. I did not like the policy that as a case manager I would not be permitted to attend the funeral of those Veterans who were my clients, this bothered me the most. Depending on the value of the Veterans belongings families were not notified. A lot of dishonesty going around.As a work study student, I gained valuable experience working with veterans, their spouses and other members of the student body.  This position is great for gaining experience to use in future careers.I worked as a volunteer and the experience was great. I worked with a friendly staff who gave me my first work experience. They tought me phone relay, I worked in the mail room and they were great"

Sooner or Later even the most motivated workers figure this out so you either move on or become a bad employee.I love the benefits and love the Government Holidays off. I love the fact that we always get the weekends off.I learned to how to become very efficient and very organized, since I started working at the VA.Hardest part of my day is finding enough time, to call all our patients to get them scheduled for their appointments.Greet veterans as they walked in. answer multi-telephone line, took minutes for meetings, check emails and forward to appropriate counselors, ordered supplies, process veterans payments, timekeeper for the office of 30, took picture Id's for new employees, open and sorted mail. It wasn't a hard part of the job. Love to stay busy. Also assisted veterans with completing their vocational rehabilitation applicationsChallenging work day in monitoring and interacting with Veterans to provide /advocate and provide safe and  adequate services for our Nations Veterans. The learning process involves how to efficiently promote customer services. Management is often effective in promoting adequate /up to date trainings.It was a career position but the work culture was not what I expected it to be. The frustrations occur with management that are promoted when they behave badly. The organization is now going through a paradigm shift, and the hope is with younger talent the work culture will get better.A typical day at work consists of providing quality work to a diverse group of patients, I've learned to be patient understanding all the different dynamics in patient care with the role of being a leader. I have affiliated myself with Peer Positions, Group Leadership and give my employer exemplary work to receive the highest evaluation for performance and dedication to the VA 5 years in a row. The most enjoyable part of working for the VA is that I am giving care to every culture of patients and doing it gladly to those who served with their lives to give us these freedoms.A typical day at work is busy unless the unit is full, and therefore no admissions are coming. I learned what teamwork really look and feel like for once. Management was excellent and go above and beyond for the staffs request. My coworkers overall were easy to get along with, I still keep in touch with some of them. The hardest part of my job was when I would have to work in palliative watching patients expire and then performing post mortem care. I honestly can't say what was the enjoyable part because there were so many enjoyable moments. This job at the VA changed my life literally.Being a Federal civil servant is a tough job but being one at the Department of Veterans Affairs, especially in a hospital setting, serving veterans, is great.  The biggest challenge is not serving veteran patients, but rather other staff who don't believe in human freedom.  But never fear, the VA finds ways around and through these people.  It's government work.  You cannot just fire people; in fact, you cannot fire them at all.This was my first full-time job.  Although I had worked previous part time jobs in college and between full time. This gave me an appreciation for veterans and what they were entitled to.  At that time, it was easier for veterans to use their home loan benefits but some also struggled with staying in their homes.  I learned a great deal about real estate, claims and processing new home loans.The job itself is relatively demanding and requires a very intensive, months long training.  However, once you understand the job the days fly by. The people who work there are kind, you don't really come into contact with managers, and the hardest part of the job isn't that hard, you just have to buckle down and do it.I enjoying helping out veterans and this position give me and opportunity to give back.  I enjoy working to assist other people and working with the VA I feel like what I do assist numerous people.  I work 8 hours a day five days a week.  I have worked on both sides of the picture.  I have assisted active duty personnel and now I assist veterans.  I feel that communication between upper management and  supervisors could be improved.  What I do it is all about the numbers.  But I feel if we could be more detailed it would cut down on errors.I would open the day with printing the daily schedule for each provider. Check in the patient and review their insurance and take payment if need be. I would also schedule for follow up appointments. I would have a list of new consult patients I would call and schedule for future appointments. If appointment was over 30 days I would add them to a list for them to use ""Veterans Choice"" and find them a provider within the network that they could use /see before their appointment at the VA hospital. If they did, I would forward the medical information to that provider. I would print follow up appointment letters and sent them out to the patient.LPNs are instrumental in providing holistic care to all residents through accurate assessments and medication administration. I was well-mentored as a new nurse and was able to develop important nursing skills.  I was the charge unit of each individual unit as needed and it was my responsibility to coordinate and manage CNAs in the care of the residents I was accountable for.  The hardest part of my job was adapting to limitations within the state-run facility.  The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to improve quality of life for my residents and to bring peace of mind to their family members.Great employer to interact with staff and patients and families.  Majority of work performed was a combination of utilization review on charts and hands on in the field home health with assessments of patients enrolling in home health services and follow up and treatment on current patients within the program.It definitely slides downhill. Everyone has to much on there plate but if you're an LPN or below you are at the end of the slide. No breaks and 10 minute lunches are the norm....yet the RNS and providers don't know and they don't care because it's not they're problem. RNs have it''s not my job disease and will let a Vet wait for hours because it's beneath them to checkin a walk-in.  Then they lie to you about not knowing. Frustrating place to work. The Vets are OK. Some of the providers act like it's their own private practice and are very disrespectful toward non provider staff. I've never been treated with such condenscending arrogance,  and I've been an LPN for over 15 yrs..The hospital is a great place to work most people are friendly and willing to help you, great experience in the medical field learning new challenges and update in a hospital environment and great working with Americas greatest hero's OUR VETERANS!!!Very high pace environment with great compensation. However, management poorly manages people with a diverse background and acts unprofessionally at times. Management is not supportive of employees and can be harsh with deadlines. The culture is very punitive and negative.check messages often, check patients into clinic and made followup appointments. contact providers when their patients check in, or cancel appointments. I have learned different systems that the Veteran's Hospital use. Management is always there for discussions, suggestions, and family issues. My co workers are team players and get along with everyone.The hardest part of the job would be not enough time to go out for lunch. i do enjoy working with people from different background,The typical work day consisted of organizing files, scanning  and uploading them to the current server. I learned that no matter what your duty was you always had to finish what you started. My co-workers were amazing, friendly and very supportive. The hardest part of my job was locating the exact dates of a term. I really enjoyed this job and serving as a person who contributed."
551,Dewberry,"It has been a great company with good work life balance. Dewberry wants you to succeed financially and career wise while having fun life outside of work.Dewberry is a great company to work as various departments can be available in one area. I learned computer skills such as Autodesk AutoCad and Bentley Storm/Water Cad. In addition, I learned a lot of each municipality and city differs from one another.I traveled working in the pipeline survey area. It's more like they hire their friends that have no experience and let go people that actually know what they are doing.Nice place to work, all employees and the office manager, were always nice. I loved the schedule and all the people that work in this office were very professionalDewberry is has a great productive and friendly work environment. Everyday one can learn different things in technology as you are expected to be on your toes. I am very lucky to have a very relax and friendly co-workers and managers.The co-workers are the best part of this company.  They make up for the lack of support from management tolerable.  This company is very top heavy---which wasn't always the case and its sad to see that its come to that.Tasks included: Scheduling inspections for affected homes to assess damages from Hurricane Sandy such as finding unsafe amounts of lead or asbestos containing materials;Uploading data collected from Lead and Asbestos Reports onto a case management system to track progressUtilizing a switchboard phone system to handle a high volume of telephone calls in order to assess clients’ needs; andProofreading and editing Lead and Asbestos reports before entering data into case management system. It's a very lax work environment as long as you get your work done. You get your own work space and computer. You make your own schedule and the pay is hourly; I had a part time position so I was able to come in at any time as long as it was between 8am and 5pm from Mon - Sunday and complete up to 30 hours a week. Co-workers are very friendly; the environment is very professional.  There are copious amounts of paperwork that you must process accurately and efficiently.Emergency Management. Please let applicants apply.I performed field services for FEMA hurricane disaster management on Louisiana GulfCoast. Involved numerous assessments and monitoring, including public and privateproperty assessments; demolitions, salt water damaged tree removal DR 1607, DR 1603Hurricanes Rita and Katrina.A typical work day is working hard at the computer.I learned a lot at Dewberry, and the really cool thing is that I'm still learning a lot. To name a few, I learned how to use MicroStation and how to manage LiDAR data. The co-workers are very nice and easy to talk to. The ironic thing is that no one seems talkative, though.The hardest part of the job is being able to finish the task in the given time that's handed to you because the task can be a large quantity of work.The most enjoyable part(s) is constantly learning as you go and seeing the final product make a huge impact in a community. For example, the hazardous debris projects.I learned a lot at Dewberry in my field of work, and gave me the work experience I needed and involve myself in. It gave me the opportunity to work with a team, on an individual level, and on my own to develop ways to better myself and the way we worked. However, management seems a little sloppy. While I was expected to be temporary, the way it was handled was poor and was essentially laid off without being told so. While the main project was coming to a close; they told us to find other work within the office -- but no other projects were in line leaving many of us stranded.The most important thing to Dewberry is that you have an engineering degreeDay of traveling from job to job. Management errors at times. Most co-worker were hard workers. I learned time management, How to lead a crew, operated different survey equipmentGreat technical people and strong managers. No strong growth for technical people. Most of the fast grown in their career are those who management to move to the management track.In this position I learn how to review contracts, PO, mod, etc. and jobs set up and to billing clients on a monthly basis.  The hard part is to get project managers to submit their invoice proofs on a timely manner.I enjoy going into work everyday! The office environment is great and the work is fun.Performed intensive assessments of damaged homes and estimated repairs required for habitability requirements.  Separate calculations from Xactimate sketches were made to differentiate actual storm damage, previous repairs, new repairs, deferred maintenance and neglect.  Worked with a cohesive group of talented individuals with a very wide range of background from all over the United States.Received great work experience in a variety of fields of Civil EngineeringGreat place to work.  Would recommend it to anyone looking to work here.I have worked here for several years and the company is nice to work for. Headquarters is in Fairfax VA.Depending on your position you can work a lot of overtime although they pay for it which is nice. The contract work can be stressful and there are ridiculous demands at times. Overall, not bad benefits and a good experience.Overall the environment is good. Not a lot of training in other areas and no room for advancement if you are working within Administration. Everything is outsourced to the Corporate office in Virgina."
487,Diageo,"Diageo was the first office job I had after graduating high school so it was defiantly a good learning experience for me. Even though it was a temp assignment I got to learn how to work with other on a very professional level. The team made me feel right at home and taught me more computer skills than I did in school which was very thoughtful and helpful for me. They really wanted to me do well in life and that's what motivated me to work hard to get a higher positive.This company is under investigation by the SEC for channel stuffing. The CEO needs to go to reset the business as it is a slave to delivering for wall street at the expense of growing brands. Management has all been home grown and lacks any ability to motivate or think of the result of the team over the result of the individualOverall great company with great benefits and employee perks.  Fast- paced environment that celebrates success and employee accomplishments.  Great place for growing families.  Flexible hours, work from home options, and summer hours Fridays year around in the Norwalk office.There is always something going on in the background and you cannot rely on job security.The people are nice but it can sometimes feel like high school with cliques and gossipingOverall, the culture is good as they generally allow you to be somewhat flexible with work hours and locations and it's almost an unwritten rule that nobody really works FridaysI Have work for Diageo for 14 years and 8 months to be exact.I had an excellent manager who help me be  a stronger leader.I learned alot from her and other managers within company.There were some challenges with scanners malfunctioning,short staffed during are busy times.Finding a way to keep things moveingI had a great team to work with. learn alot of things from them.And was able to install my knowledge and  skills in them.Diageo is a family oriented company and has been a fun place to work.Management positions are very political. Be prepared to suck up if you want to get anywhere.If you disagree with your Line Manager you probably are in for a rough time.Unlike other promoting jobs they give you your schedule ahead of time and supply you with everything you must need and know before a shoing unlike some of the other promoting companies out there. They pay for gas and hotel if needed.Diageo is definitely a good place to work. Young but experienced team makes it much easier. It was a pleasure going to the office and enjoy the good atmosphere with your peers.I loved this Job. It was one of the best jobs I had. The co workers were great. Management so what sucks but The benefits were great. I recommend working for this company.Amazing leading brands in the industry, that look really good in your resume.HR does a good job recruiting brilliant people, unfortunately, they don't last, either from a re-org or they leave.Diageo is a good place to work for and fun products. but the yearly re-org stressed people out and lost talented employee.Fun place to work. Boys club exists as with most other corporate organizations. Overall great experience. No matched 401k.worked here for years had some slow times but was always compensated for time missed. well paid and awesome at recognizing our hard work.Diageo is a great place to work and grow.  They give you any chance that you want to develop with their company.  They provide various training as well.Diageo is a place to grow and develop skills by providing the learning tools and opportunity with people who are willing to help.I was Proud to work with the People,the Machines & the Product. There was a feeling of Pride to make she a fine finished Product I know the end user could enjoy. We all worked together. From Upper Management to label inspector.I usually try to arrive at least half hr to an hr early to get settled in by reading my Holy Scriptures and eating a snack. i always try to get a lead on what were doing that day and what is our goals for the day. speak to all co workers.The hardest part of the job is not being busy it makes time go slow, And my most enjoyable part of the job is whatever we accomplished or achieved that day did we break some kind of a record or something because its all history and should be written or kept a record of......Overall great place to work. There are a lot of perks including excellent pay and social environment. They hire top candidates and have very aggressive brand plans, so you will have an opportunity to grow as a professional. However, it's very competitive and management value clones (""yes sir"" type people). There is no room to be authentic or creative. Too much energy to deal with the corporate politics, and there's a reorg every year or so.Best strategy- work here for 2-3 years, learn a lot and go to another CPG. You will get a higher title, more respect, less stress, but salary may not change.I started as a LP and was promoted to Warehouse last spring. I learned a lot from the operators and warehouse employees. I wasn't a fan of the micro managing and the inept HR department that didn't help me when a manager was messing with me while I was in probation. He told me that he was timing me while I was in trailers. I guess safety wasn't important at that time. The Union didn't help either. All in all I loved working with the OTMs, and it was mostly a good experience.Very enjoyable companyCulture was inviting and openChange was often acceptedWork-life balance respectedGreat company to work forThe best part of my job was being able to work with minimal supervision along side of a great crew.  The worst part was when the machinery would break down, and sometimes red tape and politics caused delay in resolution.  I am grateful to have been awarded the opportunity to learn more and more each day."
462,Discovery Communications,"Never a typical day at Discovery! We process, route and resolved issues reported via phone, email , voicemail and chat. Also had a technical bar ,where we would meet with end users to resolve issues. Great place to work as long as you are ready to learn and go to work everyday with a clean slate. Best part of the job is your team! Very lax environment workload is distributed amongst , everyone is always willing to assist as long as you don't ask the same question constantly.This was once a great and fun company to work for. Times in the Miami office were wonderful and relatively smooth. Management had its faults but was overall great to work with. Coworkers felt like family. But once CEO ZAZLAV came around. The company went in to the toilet. While he gave himself huge raises every year. The company brand took a dive. Final straw was the move of broadcast operations to Sterling VA on June 2015. Worst mistake of my life to move up there for a year. Management in Virginia were and still are in over there heads. Wish they left our Miami office alone. We had a good thing going here.I worked at Discovery for 3 years and watched at least three rounds of layoffs. The co-workers, benefits, work environment, and pay are great. However it is clear that the greed of higher ups has effected the way they do business and the corporate culture. Management is back stabbing and looking out for themselves, as they have to be when no ones job is secure.I worked at Discovery Communications for 3 years. Discovery as many other companies offers great benefits: Salary, 401K, Legal Service, Fitness Reimbursement, tuition reimbursements, Health & Dental plans (Extra: On Site- Wellness Center & Health fairs) However, most companies offer some or all of these benefits to stay competitive.Discovery is going through a huge change in direction, less creative, innovative and exploratory to a more public corporate culture. Focus more on short-term results rather than long term growth to make quarterly and yearly earnings expectations. Let's don't forget that this is likely to get worse since Discovery has been cutting and shifting away positions towards Latin America and Europe.As a working mother, I struggle with being a good mom and being good at what I do.  I can honestly say Discovery has been an amazing place to really enforce work life balance.  With on-site day care, wellness, fitness and options to telework, I've been able to juggle my career and shuttle kids to girl scouts, sports, doctors, and talent shows.  Although my salary could be improved, I think Discovery makes up  for it with other benefits.I am grateful for the opportunity that Discovery has given me these passed 2 years. This organization has been a wonderful launch pad for my career and allowed for both tremendous personal and professional growth. I am fortunate enough to be under an amazing management team that really nourishes professional growth. I have demonstrated the compromise of my role as a Programming Manager, developing working tools that have allowed me to get a better overview of the objectives and have helped me to make the best strategic decisions.  I have demonstrated my competency in the business process, creating competitive programming strategies aligned with the region needs, monitoring broadcast ratings and competitive landscape regularly and developing initiatives to support content strategies.They run a professional operation there.  It's obvious you're working for an industry leader with a high standard of excellence. (Although, standards have dropped a little and a dropping.) Management has made some dubious choices as to whom they promote. Publicly traded company; money is ultimately the bottom line, don't expect life-long loyalty.Discovery has been a good place to work. It offers good work-life balance and good benefits including on-site day care, doctor/nurse offices, and parental leave.Loved working for Discovery. Great culture, great benefits including maternity leave. A lot of women in leadership roles. Great HR staff.Great place work. Management works closely with the staff.  Lots of room to grow in the with many locations if you are willing to relocate.  always away of the status of the company.Great place to  work. Value is found in share price as is executive compensation. Recent layoffs do not help the majority of the company.Very political. They don't really care about your career growth. Upper management is very condescending and don't want to help others grow.The company is an excellent place to work for. Excellent place to start from fresh out of school. Good people to work with.  Good benefit. Good location and safe place to work.The relationship between management and staff is very lose. There is constant communication both formal and informal. A typical workday is the open discussions held to discuss how to better serve the clients. Management is open minded and spend a lot of time on the floor among the workers. Co-workers got along very well and shared mutual respect. They were also supportive of each other and very team oriented.The hardest part of the job is implementing new ideas that are recommended by the staff.And the most enjoyable part was making lasting friendshipLove the upbeat attitude of the workers. Close-knit group. After hours get togethers allowed us to get to know each other on a new level, which ultimately helped be successful on the job.Fun workplace with great people and a very balanced work / life atmosphere.  A great place to start your career and grow.  Lots of movement with a clear career path.Domestically, Discovery Communications is in transition, moving from a strictly cable media company. For example, a stronger focus has been but on digital media.* In Cost Center Accounting, created cost centers, activity types, statistical key figures, Cost Center Standard Hierarchy, cost center categories, document numbers, maintained default account assignments and automatic account assignments, validations and substitutions, distribution and assessment.* In Profit Center Accounting, configured Profit center structure, Standard Hierarchy, Configured Profit center Master Data, assigned different Controlling Objects to Profit Center Accounting.* Responsible for identifying and documenting all CCA and PCA test cases.* Generated reports using Report Painter and Report Writer.* Documented the configurations and prepared functional/ technical specifications.It was a very gratifying experience working for a great company like this. This place has good energy and people are very friendly. In addition to this, most of the people are very professional.I would say overall the company is great. However, there is not much movement or growth. It is also somewhat political. If your boss doesn't like you, you will not do well.Very helpful team of managers, supervisors, and editors.many times a month the company would hold classes for editors to learn programs such as photoshop and After Effects."
15,DNV GL,"A nice company that's going through a lot of changes.  Unfortunately, the European mentality (which can be great) is this company's biggest problem.Working for DNV GL was an experience of a lifetime. The work/life balance was absolutely amazing. And the opportunities provided by the company were amazing. There was a lot of room for growth. The company encouraged all of their employees towards individual growth. The management treated you like an adult, with minimal interference, while maintaining a supportive role in everyday activities.Recently after merger, things changed otherwise good place to work.New CEO is promising and expecting to bring commercial culture and get rid of old way of doing the business.The department was highly disorganized, employees over worked, demanding overtime, management problems.  Too many projects and not enough people to do the work.DNV GL comprises of the technical experts in the Energy Efficiency field and the culture has an open and collaborative environment. The company allows you to grow that is congruent to your work results. The employees are dedicated and solution oriented.Worked in the renewables independent engineering group, exciting work, however the company planned a merger very poorly and suffered with a poor accounting system, and horribly understaffed and burned everyone out.  Would have been nice if management could have executed their vision much better.Very friendly, hard working but fair company to work for. Nice offices in Singapore. Very international workforce, supportive management.DNV GL has high standards that are values based. Great opportunities for those interested in doing their best and exploring the world.Love environment and disciplines in company. Process oriented , and very driven environment. Management is ideal for work conditions .I love that I am being paid to do something that I am so passionate about. There is nothing I love more than being able to connect business owners with incentive dollars from the utility that they can use to reinvest in their own business.The effect of two mergers coupled with poor mid-level management practices are having a marked effect on the company's professionalism. In particular, their energy-efficiency evaluations have seen too many examples of unprofessional practices, as noted by customers and utilities. Business development is in decline, resulting in a sharp decline in moral.great place to work, and travel a lot, but difficult to be closer with the family. Nice benefits and friendly with the coworkers.Good place to work and just like all companies, there are some challenges.  They have a heart and want to do the right thing but at times are constrained by having to make a business decisions that go against the employees.  Overall, I recommend DNV GL.-Large company benefits with a small company atmosphere-Flex time-friendly group of people to work with- Great location in Dublin for lunch- over 300 offices world wide - multicultural work enviromentgood place to work, flexible, salary is not high, but it is fair enough. People are friendly to each other. The location is close to home.I work 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM and I've learned numerous skills.  I've had the opportunity to work on global projects and interfacing with upper management.Nice place to work with good benefit. Treating the employees well and professional. Learning new thing from colleagues through project work.I have enjoyed my time with the DNV GL family. This company is very fast paced, co-workers are very close. The company sincerely cares about you and your family with flexibility towards it when needed to be there for your family. This company is great to start off as a first place to work in the corporate world.Working as an intern for DNV GL involved a wide range of technical problem solving. There was a good balance of individual and team-based work. I gained a relevant understanding in corrosion science and enjoyed being able to directly apply my several years of engineering training for a useful purpose.The company's take is you learn 80% of what you need to know on the job, 10% thru training materials, and 10% thru mentoring.My most enjoyable part of my job is to make sure all customers are taking care on a daily basis.  If the customer is happy, I am happy."
19,Doximity,Great team spirit; enjoyable place to workCo-workers are great. Exciting place to work.
25,Dropbox,"Overall smart, but humble group of people who are working on big problems for the right reasons. Here are some additional things to note: -We have an ability to work on projects that have a global impact from anywhere in the company which makes for interesting and challenging work and you learn a lot in a short amount of time.-People are not only the best at what they do, but they're also super humble and down to earth (i.e don't be intimated by all the ivy league linkedin profiles, they're also really cool, genuine people and you don't need to come from an ivy league school to work here contrary to what others say).-Prior to joining, I thought the team was much larger and much further along than it is and as a result there's a lot left to do as we scale and grow. You get the luxury of an already well known brand but the infrastructure of a small to mid-size company with a lot of things to still tackle!-They do a really good job of empowering/involving offices outside of HQ so we get to be a part of the strategy conversation vs. just implementation/execution-On the sales side you get to be the first and only ones calling into large Enterprise accounts, you don't have to worry about competing internally or dealing with a bunch of red tape internally to sellDropbox is a decade old ""startup"" that has yet to make a clear profit.  Benefits and pay are competitive for SF.  Workloads are high as many people leaders are not competent at managing others.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with smart people.  The hardest part of the job is taking some executives seriously that have no business managing other people.  The HBO series ""Silicon Valley"" should do a future season based on this company.The perks of the job are way better than the job itself. Being security there can be boring if you're not the favorite of the supervisor. Work loads are Not evenly distributed. There's no room for advancement and no guarantees to anything promised. But the Benefits are awesome and its definitely worth it not having to buy or bring lunch everyday.Dropbox was behind on invoice processing so brought in 3 temps to catch up, using NetSuite software. They also use their own software for email management; and also Zendesk for task management. That was new to me, so was a good learning experience.They have a very young group at Dropbox, so wasn't as professional as I'm used to. My manager was very supportive and always available for any questions or suggestions on process improvements.Fun place to work. Great management, great bonuses, overall great place to workAt Dropbox, there are a lot of really smart people tackling interesting problems.The compensation is great, the food is better than a majority of restaurants, and management trusts you to figure out how to get your work done."
389,Dupage Medical Group,"Management was subpar at most. I was walked on a lot for being a new person. Too many social conflicts between co-workers. Patients were wonderful. I did learn a ton while working here after my first year out of MA school.My co-workers are amazing and if it wasn't for loving them I'd quit (its rare to find people you genuinely enjoy working with and consider friends). The pay is such garbage and if you go into even 0.15 hours of overtime (which equates to maybe like $8) you will basically get fired. The raises are a joke and the benefits aren't that great.Wish I could give 0 stars.Dupage medical group bought out the employer I was working for. When they bought us out the company went down the toilet in just weeks. If you want to feel like you don't matter and stressed all the time this is the place for you! This company only cares about making money! So short staffed be prepared to work yourself to death you will be doing work of 4-5 people and when people quit they are not replaced! Management is the biggest joke the managers don't even know how to schedule a appt and they just dump on the employees even tho they are rn they will never join in to help there job is to laugh play on there phones and eat all day! Biggest joke of a company!Horrible place to work, the management within MPAS is awful all they do is hire their friends from a company that went under and they cannot find jobs so MPAS gets them.  They know nothing about the jobs just how to criticize how we have been doing it and being successful  So, that being said MPAS now is going under, bad reviews super amount of turnover and the sad thing about the whole thing is the upper management just doesn't care as long as the seats are filled and money is still coming in.  How about how our new clients feel, oh that is if they even new all the wrong that goes on within the walls of MPAS.the company is okay to work for for a time. there are almost no opportunities for advancement in either position or pay. the working environment was clean and secure as long as you don't rock the boat.I was on the phone for 8 to 9 hours with an hour lunch. Took over 100 calls a day, scheduling, cancelling appointments for all of DMG doctors.I learned how to schedule appointments on the Epic system. The co workers were nice when we were able to see one another, we were in our own cubicles. I did not eel that I had any opportunity for growth with this company.I loved speaking to patients but missed the face to face interaction.Dupage Medical Group is definitely not what they make it seem. It's really repetitive and the training is kind of stupid. I don't want to sit and watch another person take calls when you could be taking the time to actually show me how to navigate the system. Also one of the supervisors in the customer service department is racist! STAY AWAY. you've been warned!The company CEO needs to pay more attention to its employees and patients rather than the revenue its generating. There is no room for growth and the mid level senior leadership is not good at communication.Was a very fun place to work at but it lacks leadership. Management is not easy to talk to.  Days were always good there but sometimes it felt like we were not allowed to be ourselves.Management is the worst I have ever experienced.  Manager of PACU has a hard time trying to help with patients when needed and has no filter with employee's privacy.  Manager of facility has no tact when dealing with the nurses but is sweet and accommodating to the physicians.  They except the employees to live, breath and die for this ASC.  The pay is low, hours unreasonable, and benefits are poor.  The coworkers are very clique', some you have a difficult time knowing if they are friend or foe (but not all). Stay away!.The patient were all very nice and a pleasure to work with. The employee with the other doctors that the office was shared with were very nice to work around. The nurse in the offiice I worked in was nice at first and then was completly differnet after about a month.Very stressful and emotional. Very overwhelmed with trying to adhere to all the policies. The doctor's schedule was nearly impossible to navigate. Only certain patients on certain days and only certain times are available for certain issues. Patients were expected to wait for a very long time to be seen for certain issues. If nothing was available then you had to call the nurse to get permission to slot a patient in an open spot that didn't pertain to their issue. Too complicated. Especially for the patients and that made it very difficult to calm them down. If you made one mistake you were let go. Training was difficult. It consisted of shadowing an employee for 5 weeks. Then you got a whole notebook explaining what doctor works where and when and what times and days they were available. Patient's availability did not matter at all. 9 doctors, 7 locations and 2 hospitals. And still the appointments could take over a month to get in. It was very sad. I cried almost every day.This was a horrible place to work for; you are paid very low and never acknowledged for the hard work  you do. Employees are given very low raises yet cuts are never made to the salaries of those in the C suite. No women have high positions and productivity standards are unrealistic. The motto is ""we care for  you"" but they do not care for their employees. All they want to do is get bigger and bigger and the phone systems are horrible because they are too big. I was told I would be on hold for a minute trying to get a referral after 35 minutes I hung up.This is the worst company I have every been employeed by.  The pay is very low, and the medical benefits are terrible.   Very high deductible and we can only go to DMG doctors.  Ridiculous productivity expectations.   I literally run all day from patient to patient with not a moment to even stop and use the bathroom!  Quality of patient care suffers terribly due to greed for money and constantly overscheduling patients.  If I were a patient I would not return becsuse they are not given fair time and attention due to DMGs policy of overscheduling.   This greatly lowers qulity of patient care.  So many employees feel used and abused.  Suggestion to improve employee and patient satisfaction,   don't treat employees like machines.  Very greedy organization.   They care more abut money than patients or employees.  Very high rate of turnoverYou will have no life because you work 7am to 7pm.No breaks, one 30 minute lunch.Running to the bathroom between checking in patients.When someone quits, they are not replaced, you are expected to do the work of the people that quit,Very, very, unrealistic expectations.I've learned many new skills within the podiatric specialty area. I very much enjoy my position within the department and I have had the pleasure of working with very professional, and friendly, medical assistants and Podiatrists. I have never worked with a better group of people. At this current time, management of musculoskeletal operations is undergoing many changes which presents communication and organizational issues within the department. I believe that aside from my day to day contact with my fellow co-workers, I find the most enjoyable part of my position is engaging with the patients and administering quality patient care.I totally enjoyed working for the Doctor's here. All of them were down to earth, intelligent, funny, social and compassionate. They are trully the only people I miss working for. The staff was ok. Depending on the day it could go smooth or dramatic for you. The staff was moody. The Doctor's were always professional and never yelled or embarrassed the staff. The pay could had been better. The benefits were good. Management was good and fair. Management appreciated hard work and so did the Doctor's. If you were not sure on how to do something the Doctor's would assist and never embarrass you in front of a patient or co-worker. It was awesome.I enjoy working at this company- benefits are OK would love for the organization to consider employees for job advancements.Great co-workers and Doctor's. Practice manager (Asthma and Allergy) is unprofessional, spreading rumors, and with no management skills. Manager is unable to do any task without the Nurse Supervisor looking over her shoulder showing her how to do it. The Doctor's are getting ripped off - paying 2 salaries for the work of one person. No flexibility with scheduling or changes. Huge turnover of the staff. Annual pay increases of less than 3% with POSITIVE reviews.DuPage Medical is an awful place to work. The company has grown  too quickly for upper level management to handle, which has compromised the quality of care given. Patients would complain often about this. Expect to be worked to the bone for a 17 cent raise and do not expect to move up within the company. DuPage Medical Group: We Don't Care for You, Just for Your Money.Dealing with sick people all day. Great co-workers. working every minute. Very nice place to work. Long days. Need to stay focused."
116,DuPont,"Overall Dupont is an OK company to work for. It's health benefits can be better and it has a pretty bad career advancement but the team environment is great. The environment is relaxed and very friendly. Many team building activities. Work load can be tough at times and very easy other times. The hours can be pretty flexibleI liked working here close to home and new faces to meet great workplace and good hours good people to meet very safe place to workIt was nice to be able to play with the kids, build relationships and take care of the families as they each checked into our department.Fantastic family-like work culture. Plenty of work available for optimizing processes and developing pilot processes. Great at teaching Co-ops new laboratory techniques and how to use analytical software and laboratory equipment.I made a very good living working for this company, but 7 day straight rotating shifts catch up to you.  They have a very strict A & T policy and no sick days (you must be hospital ill or take the points.)  Every man for himself.very helpful people who want you too succeed in the industry. positive company. products are great and are able to compete with others in industry.The least supportive environment. Everyone looks out for themselves, no teamwork. A lot of arrogance and negativity.  Management is self serving. Arrogant technical fellows with mental issues constantly berate co-workers and do not get reprimanded.  They manipulate and take work away, then complain when you don't meet your 70% billable goal. A lot of hot air with these technical geniuses that needs to get deflated.  I left a stable job to work here, biggest mistake of my life as this place is a major disappointment. They lost their magic. Bosses only care about making themselves look good.Learning Sharpoint and Sap **** Awesome Job! Perfect Manager Perfect Office. New Equipment and Old Building. Two Cafs. Lots of Coffee and Knowledge. AN AManagement was organized. We were always busy. The co-workers I enjoyed, we were truly a strong team. I learned all the DuPont computers programs and forms that needed to be processes for a successful outcome.I worked for DuPont for 26 years until the Nylon business was  sold to Koch Ind. in 2004. I worked in the laboratory organization as a shift lab tech. lab Inst. tech,  lab training coordinator, lab procedure writerSafety is they're number 1 priority. They care about people, not gust the bottom line. The employees are top notch if you had a question, they could answer itGreat exposure to engineering instruments. However during the Co-Op I was basically a glorified secretary. Tons of paper pushing and virtually no freedom of engineering practices.My experience entailed following operating procedures, troubleshooting, operating a DCS, locking out, tagging equipment, making, filling, and packaging of chemicals, load and unloading trailers, use of forklift/work saver. I also have an excellent safety record. I have attended and also ran safety meetings.DuPont has been a great company to work for, as it relates to pay, total compensation, and working within a challenging career field. I feel their management team is out of touch with what the crew needs and wants, and there is an impression that the plant is divided between the haves (front office personnel) and the have-nots (operations and maintenance personnel).Worked with a scrum master who treated the scrum team poorly...often cussing at and harassing team members, especially those who were leaders. The scrum team repeatedly talked to management about the scrum master's behavior for well over a year. The scrum master was never removed from her position--and she was a contractor. Only after several team members left (the body count was at least 7), she was assigned to another team. Now she's been hired as a full-time IT manager. One of Pioneer's core values is to treat people with respect. I never noticed that core value being executed the entire time I worked there.Company profile and standards are changing and down sizing is a critical factor among senior management. Direction of company is not assured. Chemical, and agriculture products is the only life line of the company.Enjoy working there a lot. I've learned a lot of the job field. Very friendly people. Everyone at work is willing to help you learn and become the best you can beRunning warehouses for on of the largest trucking companies in America on 2 dedicated accounts that kept me vrr busy with lots of overtime was a pleasure. I hate JB Hunt lost the accounts.My role includes the processing of customer orders, internal stock transfers, and review availability of materials for both.  I am constantly communicating with, supply chain management, external customers, internal customers, and sales management regarding their needs and out ability to fulfill their expectations. I also review processes against continuous improvement goals and account manager expectations.Decent pay, but must be willing to work 12hr rotating shift and 2 weekends a month. As far as the work goes, it can be boring. No challenge.the atmosphere there was friendly and the operators worked very hard each day. I learned to drive for the first time, about tools, different types of pumps, distillation columns, valves, heat exchangers and piping parts. The hardest part of the job was leaving. I liked working and getting to know the managers as well as my co-workers"
708,"EA Engineering, Science, and Technology","Pay is on the low side.  Perks;  flexible schedule when you are not traveling, some PMs are pretty laid back.  Bottom line; too much travel! Better be single with no kids. it can be hard trying to balance your life.Great company structure and many oportunities to grow and expand your talents and experience. Excellent managment structure and work/life balance."

Aprendi que tem sem planejamento o trabalho não evolui.Pouco contato com a direção.Uma equipe unida18 cidades para conciliar.Conhecer pessoas que mesmo distante faz parte do seu dia a diaVisita diaria a clientes pré-definidos, todos os dias aprendo ou renovo novos jeitos de contato e negociação com os clientes, os contatos com a direção e gerencia é só em momentos especificos, bastante querido pela supervisão e colegas de equipe, o mais chato no trabalho é só a falta de comprometimento da nossa logistica, o melhor de tudo é no final do dia atingir metas e objetivos.Na profissão de vendedor voce tem que ser o melhor, superar metas desafios e dificuldades, e leva uma grande vantagem fazendo seu próprio salario.Cumprindo sua parte, nao tem dia típico,todos os dias voce aprende algo, gerencia, sorria enquanto colegas e descobre o respeito. A parte dificil, fica agradavel.Como a meta realizada,cateira de cobrança limpa e o bom salario claro.Um dia típico de trabalhoFuncionava da seguinte maneira: visita aos cliente pré-selecionados visando uma avaliação dos itens faltosos que a empresa trabalhava, e em poder dessas informações realizar a cap´tação de vendas dos produtos a ser implantado pela empresa. Feito isto, acompanhar o pós venda: entrega, prestação de serviso dos colaboradores, etc.Fácil adaptação, ajuda quando o funcionário precisa, todos que trabalharam comigo excelentes, a parte mais difícil foi a distancia  e a mais fácil que o produto tem qualidade.

110,eBay Inc,"Put inventory into bin location, kept inventory, took pictures and published merchandise. Handled shipping and customer service. Local, national and international shipping.Excellent place to work. very supportive people and very good management group.employee benefits also very good. career growth also very good as always more opportunities to explore on different tasks.The only con is that you sit down the majority of time. It has a variety of positions to choose from so you will never get bored. The pay is more than enough and it has a flexible schedule.As a seller on eBay, I am my own boss. I set my own hours, sell whatever I want, and keep nearly all the profits from whatever I sell. With so many different people visiting the website, there's a market for virtually everything out there, including old collectibles and toys. It's a good way to make some extra money and offset the cost of any hobbies you might have. The only downside is the selling fees from both PayPal and eBay itself. They aren't too extreme, though they can be annoying, especially for smaller sales.I enjoyed by time at eBay because I had a great managers.  She had the ability to recognize strengths and weaknesses.  I liked that she held people accountable for producing a good product.I honestly don't understand this forced rating system. My opinion on eBay hasn't changed int he ten minutes since my last review of it. It's a great place to work and I regret having ot leave it.Enjoyed working there, many tasks to many to list but some are management, training, reporting, customer service, supervising a staff of 12 24/7 and being on callGreat work environment, Very flexible work schedule, you are making a difference by enabling connected commerce in all corners of the world. Fun place to work with many talented and friendly co-workers.Needs more organization and training more for representatives. There was a lot of hiring but not very many chairs open. A lot of under time was given and people were sent home A lot. It is a nice place to work if the promised hours were given.Great work environment, Team orientation and lots of team efforts. Great work culture to work for and a balance work and life style. Team motivation. Team FocusIf you want long hours you will find it here. Which can be a good and a bad thing. Yeah everyone needs the money but at the same time the astomspare of the whole place is kind of a downer so it just makes it a hard company to work for. They have very strict policys but they do offer alot of free lunches and a turkey at thanksgiving and ham at christmas. Every holiday they try and offer either a lunch and a gift or raffles.you can sell up to a certain amount of money. sell anything you want take good pictures and price it right and get money thru paypal or check. also good selling exposure as well as business interaction.After finding all items you must clean them, take photos, list them online, package, then ship. The hardest part of the job is finding the items for resale and the most enjoyable part of the job is offering products to people that may be hard to find or that they enjoy collecting.I love eBay! I have had much success and met wonderful people from eBay. I would rate overall a safe and fun site to work with.Telecommuting Infrastructure allowed for flexible workplace environments and schedules with excellent full-time training opportunities and benefits.Good work life balance, but some employees are in coast mode.Could be better opportunities for advancement, seems like they bring in a lot of senior leaders from outside rather than cultivating inside.Indeed's parsing software does not recognize the fact that I DID NOT WORK AT EBAY. This is on my resume as a task regarding independent contracts while freelancing.If you enjoy working in a standard call center then this is perfect for you. I did not like anything particular about the job. They were not organized when I worked there and they made the training a little stressful.Posted postings of CE items to be resold on Ebay. Took pictures and wrote descriptions about the product. The hardest part about this job was to find what to write about the product when you didn't have all the information when they give to the task to do.Full of life lots of people in and out. many interesting characters. Always extra work time available and constant feedback there for your growth in your profession.They take good care of there employees and everyone loves working here, they are plenty of opportunities to advance and they love to hire within"
430,eclaro,"Typically, I would look for security related events triggered on our environment using our security monitoring tool (SIEM). I would report and create a ticket of a network attack or malicious activity that is observed in our network.Everyday is always different than the other days because Network Security is always fast evolving, so I really need to put passion in everything that I do. Your Job becomes hard if you don't put your passion into it, but it becomes so rewarding if you put your heart into it. I always find myself enjoying as I grow in my profession that's why I always do my best in everything I that I do.Eclaro is a great place to work with and as a whole they are very supportive with the development of the skills of their people. Professionalism is one thing I learned and dealing with different types of people is the most challenging  one."
653,ECS Federal,"The company is good but you do not receive a raise and the only way to receive a higher salary is to get a higher paying position....only theres no room for advancement to a higher paying position...pretty much stuck.Great location, great group of people to work with. Continuous opportunities for growth. Excellent pay and benefits.m Management is very knowledgeable and friendly.ECS is a great company to work for. Management is very understanding of balancing your personal and work life. Only cons with ECS is the compensation and job advancement. The salary is not adequate to your job responsibilities.Management is supportive while we work off site with the Goverment client. Upper management makes everyone feel like they are part of the team.The company is a great company to work for they are really understanding and it is a very open environment. Great coworkers for the most part. My supervisor was great just wish it was a little more money.Working with ECS provides us the ability to provide real-time support to ongoing military operations around the globe. By supporting U.S. Army efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, or training and validating Field Support Teams prior to deployment, our work is relevant and necessary.I have been working with ECS for around 1 year now and feel they are a great company to work for. ECS Federal is a good company to work for, very diverse both in employees they hire and in job opportunities.ECS is your typical mid-sized consulting firm. Unless you work at the main office, you will more than likely be one amongst the many faceless minions. There's not much room for advancement, and the benefits are pretty lacking. The latter wasn't always the case, but beware: health insurance is now based on a defined benefit structure rather than a defined contribution, and to get a decent plan, you will have to shell out $$$$The helpdesk is a great entry level job into the IT world. Starting with tier 1, employees deal with different applications and work to help the customer solve their issues or escalate the ticket up for further assistance.Working as a government contractor I get to see the other side of the federal work coin. Where the brunt of the effort is focused and needed. As a contractor I do nearly all the same tasks as my government counterparts, but with the added incentive of knowing inaction or complacency can get me removed. The change of pace, the pressure to perform, has done more for me in terms of desire to improve than my years in government service. Best part is I am allowed to work with whomever I choose on the contract. I can surround myself with equally motivated co-workers from both the contract and our government peers. Allowing me to surround myself with the best people on both sides.On par with other contracting/consulting firms; not better or worse than others for which I've worked. Compensation and benefits similar to competitors.The constant churning of responsibilities and management expectations make this a difficult place to be. Add to the fact that you never know if/when a restructuring will take place and leave you unemployed!ECS is a great place work. The company management are involved in work and personal aspects of the employees. The work is interesting and they encourage employee growth.Daily challenges understand priority and workflow. Managers not empowered to set or establish priority and timelines. Constantly changing priorities. Do it because I said to attitude. Limited appreciation for individual experience and input."

Recruit, interviewA typical day is acknowledging and making future reservations while learning how and what the expectations of people and fulfilling their needs. Keeping management aware of changes and be flexible to change along with working closely and assisting co-workers with assignments. the hardest part of the job was can please everybody, but you do your best. the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing and hearing people give me or the job compliments on a job well done.Arrive to work in uniform.Prep food and Hotel lounge for Happy Hour. Assist the guests Needs.Maintain A clean workplace; buss tables and wash glassware.Maintain a professional attitude when dealing with guests as well as coworkers.Take food orders from Guests when in the Happy Hour Lounge as well as Taking orders for room service.

Close out for the night turning in all receipts and exact payments for the services rendered.Clock out and Exit the Building.A typical workday you go clock in then head down to the basement/laundry room. Once down there you immediately start sorting the dirty laundry to start washing and drying them. While doing that process for a long time co-workers always will talk and play around alot,their main language is spanish so they would mix between talking english and spanish.Around 7 pm the managers all leave so it would just be me and my co-workers finishing up all of the daily task until the end of all of our shifts at 11:30 pmResponsible for all end of day reports, accounts closures, and accurate audit of the days transactions.Monitor and maintain all area of the hotel including rooms, pools, and all common area to ensure property meets andexceeds guest expectations and safety.Responsible for checking in as well as checking out quest.Served as the main liaison between customers, management and sales team.Monitored cash drawers in multiple checkout stations to ensure adequate cash supply.Replenished supplies, bags and other materials at each cash wrapUpper management including HR doesn't listen to the people. HR forgets everything and lose everything.  They are not supportive of their employees.  They only take the word of the manager without doing a thorough investigation.  This job has its favorites, no matter how much of a good worker you are.  The employees work well with each other (we were like family).  This company including upper management used to be so caring: they went from sweet to sour with the change of upper managers.Embassy Suites was always fast paced, fun, and lots of room to move up within the company. There was always something taking place in different rooms, whether it be booked for parties, business trips, or just family reunions. I learned a lot about the culture and origin of Embassy Suites, from who founded it to the history of how long its been around. Management was always so great, they always made you feel special and part of the family. The hardest part of my job was learning how to bartend, this is where I learned most my bartending skills. Overall I would say the most enjoyable part of my job was to laugh and go about everyday duties within such a positive environment.We worked together like family but, as a employee working based off of gratuity I feel like the company is cheating us. There is no way that I am busting my butt working 12 to 15 hours a day and only making $12 an hour for a party an hour for a party that cost well over $40,000.  someone has some explaining to do .Working in the food department we were always slammed whether it was someone dining in to eat, or ordering to go or ordering room service we did it all, if the bar needed to refill on one of their beverages I had to go and get it for them. There is always something different that you are doing, its routine its just you will never have the same day.I worked the overnight shift which was a self managed shift. It was great and allowed me plenty of time to spend with family.  This job didn't come between anything other thing that went on in my life. i.e., church, family outings, birthdays etc.This place makes you want to never go home, I really loved working there. The work is very fast paced, but it makes your work day go by faster. You can learn different criteria's and earn different job experience. That's definitely one of the pros of working there.the company does not care about their employees, in fact the banquet department, which included a sales team, RARELY attended any banquet events; they only saw the individuals when it came to selling a banquet event and when it was time to pay for their eventI had served in the past, but working as a banquet/cocktail server offers the opportunity to meet and experience many different cultures. I would definitely do it again. It is a fairly easy job and I enjoyed being a part of the hustle and bustle.I have out look with appiontments but some days do not go as plan, Guest issues or employee concerns has to be taken care of...Check on previous day revenues, balance all accounts. Check on food and beverage, Embassy suites breakfast is always busy and I am always happy to help. Daily Huddle at 10am ...update all department on what's going on for the day and very near future. The hardest part of the job is the are a few days that I wish we have more than 24 hours in one day. The most enjoyable part is certainly seeing the team grow..... that moment when they gets it. Teaching is fun but when that student is transitioning to become a teacher himself/ herself is the joy and it's all worth it.Working at the Embassy was an great experience for me it was nice and clean with OK benefits. Sometimes we were short hand and it caused me to work harder but I love been in a good work environment so I didn't have a problem with it.It's been a pleasure working for such a great company. They truly believe in promoting from within. I have learned alot from all my managers over the years but since I currently moved to the eact bay the commute is not what it used to be, and thats why I am now looking for other opportunities.I use to enjoy my job here but things have changed do to management.  They judge you on your past and hold that over your head but I work with some good people that like me for me.  I work hard and Im always there I never call off unless I'm very sick which is not a lot.Checking in guests and providing customer service was a typical day at work. I learned how to work with the public and deal with complaints in a fair and personable way. I loved my co-workers and we had a great time every day. There really was no hard part, except that in down times our hours would have to be cut. Also, our salaries were very low for the caliber of the hotel.my experience with embassy suites I would describe it as a growing experience, a typical day at work started with a quick meeting with the chef or supervisor and get informed of people in house, specials of the day including soups and entrée, in my  time working for embassy suites I learned how to work under pressure, manage it and get the work done with a smile on my face , management was good, I personally had a great experience whit my co-workers, I had the pleasure to work with people from different parts of the world and learned about others cultures and use that experience to give the guests a better service, like any job involving food production the hardest part would be getting everything ready on time and keep the work and food flow, but at the same time the most enjoyable part of it its when the guests congratulate us for the good job and having the satisfaction of knowing that you did your best!!My typical workday was very busy from start to finish. I learned a lot at the Embassy suites Hotel. Management was great and my co workers were very hard workers indeed. The hardest part about the job was my feet hurting and that's it. I know the rules of life, no pain no gain.I learned a lot while working here. The training was one of the best I have ever had. The work was easy going. The people were great to work with. The hours were long but the coworkers made it worth it."
638,Emergent BioSolutions,"This is a vey reputable company. Some jobs operate on a shift schedule. The company however offers amenties tat allows the employee to be comfortable while working late and weekend shifts.Lack of trust and dishonesty abound.  Due to their reliance on government funding they are blocked by red tape and can't get out of their way.  More political than strategicHave enjoyed my time here.  Wish I could continue working with such a great work force.  Have learned a lot and would love to continue to learn.Emergent Biosolutions is a great place to work. Excellent environment and I learned a lot throughout my time working there. Quick career advancement if you are a hard working employee. Only reason I am looking for other employment is because they are downsizing and I was a part of an employee severance.24-7/365 manufacturing of Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed (AVA). I learned how to use SAP software. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the monotony of executing the same procedures everyday with minimal variance.Nice place to work, they really care about their products and employees.  They just opened a work out center and a cafe at our headquarters.never worked here before. i worked for emergent professional services which is a staffing agency. indded selected the wrong employers name for my employment.I almost always worked over my scheduled 12 hour shift. Upper management was not honest when they hired me as a temporary employee, knowing that they were making a transition within a couple years  that I would likely not be a part of. My co-workers were great, many of them were in the same boat I was. I learned to operate with great attention to detail, but few functional skills that will translate to other jobs in my future.As a manufacturing technician the job itself was repetitive but enjoyable because of the team environment.  Over the years, however, Emergent has become more and more dysfunctional.  This is mostly due to a few rotten eggs in site leadership.  One or two bullies and sycophants in the upper echelons really create a trickle down effect of unhappiness.Good place to go to get experience but the management can be terrible.... Not a lot of room for growth. They claim you can successfully move up the ladder but it turns out its very difficult unless you know someone....Benefits are great especially PTO.We worked two shifts, nice place to work. People are nice and I gained a lot of experienced. The most enjoyable part of the job is we travel.Emergent is similar to other companies of its size in that some dept are well managed while others are a nightmare.  Be sure to vet the managers you'll be working with prior to joining.Growing and in some ways exciting company to work for.  A lot of positives - good corporate culture etc, but a lot of politics in getting promotions.Difficult product space orphan disease state, large territories.  New division to the larger entity still ironing out the details.I've had the ability to learn a lot about a wide array of company systems and processes.  My co-workers are great and make the job enjoyable.  Management holds all of the decision making power and even then, only senior management is allowed to make any decisions.  There is definitely room for growth for those without advanced degrees and those with advanced degrees aren't given much room to exercise their expertise and problem solving skills.  The hardest part of the job is the rate at which work is expected to be completed as there is not much time between a decision being made and completion of that task.The people are at the heart of this company.  Colleagues were outstanding.  As the company grew, management lost site of staff and instead of truly working on the culture they resorted to a façade.Working for Centric Parts through Emergent was ok, not the best as they tend to have a very poor choice of employment rights although they say they are equal and are willing to help the growth of the company has always been more important than the safety and health of their employees. It is great knowing you will always have work Monday-Friday plus overtime when needed.The company has grown significantly.  Lots of opportunities and lots of positive changes over the past years but growth pains too just like any company going through significant growth and change.  Ehtical company with a strong CEO. Work along side many talented people.The company did more for me in terms of personal growth and benefits than I thought any company ever would. The work/life balance left something to be desired and compensation was a little lacking for my position.Long hours are always encouraged without the recognition or compensationManagement does not embrace the values of the organization but forces the staff to use themManagement always seemed unprepared for audits when lower level personnel pulled the majority of the weightWould never recommend them as a good place to work.Management is run by two peopleNot a good place to workI was treated very badly and constantly humiliated by the employees relations person in HR. Sr. Counsel can not be trusted.Bullied."
624,EMMES,Company offers fantastic benefit package and a rigorous onboard training program.  The roles are clearly defined and work/life balance is achievable.
742,Emory University,"As an employee at the Woodpec, I helped students and faculty with gym access. I also helped them with directions and would be asked to assist with special events when needed.Good benefits and good people. Some zones are laid back and a pleasure to work in.  The housing zone is not one!The bad, do not pay enough to live within 25 miles of campus.  The pay rise goes to those in the crony system and the rest of us do not even get a COLA.  The rise is always less than the rise is benefits, parking and inflation whilst management hands out fat bonuses to themselves.Highly political environment with a lack of respect for veterans, usually by those who have never served. I've been there many years and still don't have a full set of uniforms.  Technologically challenged management has us carrying a 10 lb walkie talkie from the 70s, a flip phone, our personal phone and defunct ipads whilst trying to perform maintenance.  I feel like I am wearing a batman belt and trying to work without throwing out a hip or my back from the weight of the walkie talkie alone.Working for Emory University is great depending on the department you are working for. The benefits were very good and the University was good at acknowledging your accomplishments. However, some management teams can be uncaring, play favoritism when enforcing company policies and non communicative with department changes that affect your role within the department. Working with the staff and students can be a challenge but the diverse environment leaves plenty of room to create new friendships and partnerships across the campus.OMG I miss my Job with Emory.  They offer the best benefit package with matching on your 401k with 6.9% match, plus a guaranteed raise each year for performance and cost of living.  the best medical benefit package ever, they covered my fertility treatments.  I absolutely loved my Medical Director.  I can't say enough positive things except if you get in make sure you stay in.Stable place to work. Great benefits. Moves very slow. Very political. Not a place geared toward millennials: Not really flexible with scheduling, no real promotion potential, low pay, etc.. Many things that millennials look for in a new career are not here at Emory. They advertise things such as flexible scheduling, etc.. However, these they are not enforced throughout the University. My department also needs work with diversity and inclusion.Options to move within, great benefits, good work-life balance. Management varies depending on the school and type of work. I really enjoy working in the academic environment.Emory has a good work life balance, but there is not often a plan for advancement or a way to build upon your skill set. Management for the most part in my experience has always been supportive. Your co-workers as all do are in a range from some hard workers to others that are just here for the paycheck. The hardest part of the job is that no matter how hard you work they are very strict with pay scales and so you are rewarded the same, the hard workers and the dead weights. The most enjoyable part is that they have always been supportive of home life and if you need to do something personal.I would say working at Emory was pleasant. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting people and establishing long term relationships.this is such a supportive wonderful place to work. great benefits for all staff, faculty and students. i would highly recommendEmory University is a great organization to work for. The salary scale is rather low for the area but the benefits and job security make up for the low pay. I enjoyed my 5 year employment with the University. The work/life balance was very fair. The Emory culture is awesome!I loved working for Emory. Unfortunately during the time that I worked for them they did not have enough work for me to maintain my expenses. The rate of pay was great and the benefits, even,  for me as a per diem employee were amazing. I would go back to Emory in a second.Typical day is a coronary or a valve that may take an entire shift to complete due to training of Fellow's. Management changed over the course of my time here, but the one they have now I believe will take the department in a new direction as they bring younger people into the department for the culture to change with the advancement of medicine. Amazing surgeries that take place in this facility, so my learning was truly above and beyond! I always enjoy learning new things at work, so it was never a dull day. The hardest part was that as a strong employee, you get burnt out because the surgeons always want the most experienced in their room.Not enough employees or assistance. Over worked and under paid. Raises were insufficient but great benefits. Average company. Same concerns with other medical facilitiesEmory University is a very pleasant place to work. No micromanaging, extremely flexible schedules for most departments, and a pretty relaxed environment across many departments within the institution. Honestly, the work/life balance that is fostered within my department is unmatched; it's hard for me to consider trading it. However, the disadvantage that I find with Emory University is the lack of advancement opportunities for certain positions. There are some positions that have been deemed ineligible for advanced titles, and the hard part about that is once you're stuck in that type of position, depending on how specific the work is, it can be difficult to transition out. It is hard enough finding other positions in Emory without having to worry about how specific your current role is and whether or not it translates well for other positions; even though your title is generic and many others employees with the same title but in different positions are eligible for advancement, and also, there is actually an advanced title for the job category which actively used but it only applies to certain roles that have the same lower level title. To make this make sense, there are several program coordinators, but certain program coordinators in specific roles aren't eligible for advancement to program coordinator sr., which is completely unfair. In my opinion, Emory Central HR needs to take a long, hard look at their job descriptions and the positions that they are being applied to and make some revisions. A few other issues that I would like to mention outside of lack of advancement  more... are that 1. Once you are hired into a position based on your then current qualifications, i.e. high school diploma, but then later complete your bachelor's degree, it is hard to be reclassified or receive a pay increase commensurate with your new qualifications. 2. They would rather have one employee doing three jobs and paying them for only one than to higher adequate staff to get the work done.  lessI highly respect the leadership.Opportunities to advance.Each academic school has own sub-cultureAttracts world class talent and eventsVery diverse work environmentEmory has been my home for 16 years. It is a place where achievement is rewarded and hard work and dedication are praised.Emory University continues to be inquiry-driven, ethically engaged, and a diverse community, whose members work collaboratively for positive transformation in healthcare management and accessibility.The hardest part of the job was managing the office without sufficient assistance.  A lot was involved from maintaining memberships, updating software, training staff, managing annual the conference, orchestrating all logistics for various trips for members, communicating with international management team, reconciling finances/budgets/profits, placing/mailing weekly orders, maintaining stocked products, filing, answering phones, and entering all fundraiser donations, attaching proper literature per level of membership, and maintaing office calendars of events.Supervisor was very supportive and nurturing of his team members. He allowed professional and personal growth for team members. Colleagues help each other and value team work. Emory offers great benefits.I really liked this job because I got to work with animals and medical science five days a week, I could take the Emory Bus for free, and I also got free food for my snakes.My typical day at work is great i greet all my co-workers and my boss as i come in .I learned all the skills to do my job as well as to be a team leader.The management work well with me as i follow their  instruction on projects, i get along well with my co-workers we work as a team.There is no hard part on my job,it is always interesting.The most enjoyable part of the job is finishing the task completely with my team.•	Consenting and interviewing potential research participants, scheduling and overseeing study visits, and creating reports for IRB and NIMH•	Determining eligibility by administering the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders •	Point of contact for research participants and clinic patients; answering phones, and scheduling appointments			•	Managing electronic and physical patient files•	Verifying validity, and calling in refill or new prescription requests"
421,Endo Pharmaceuticals,"I had a pleasure to work with one of the finest company where each and every employee are very friendly and cooperative . I enjoyed working and the team was very helpfull from the outset.I would like to go back again if I get a chance to work with the same client again and again.I worked here as a contractor for 8 months.  The Management that I worked with were very nice and respectful.  Work/life balance is important to this company.  The company encourages employees to ""give back"" to the community and even schedules one day off a year for the employees to participate.Great job should just pay more attention to what is going on with employee.  Moral boosts numbers which manufacturing does which makes the company more money and produce more efficiently without mistakes. Still a good company.Good company to work for. Products have a place in the market, and you are given the resources needed to succeed. The management seems to have a good grasp on the steps needed to keep the company on a good trajectory.About a 2. The morale is low and not much support from HR and senior mgrs. Not had a raise in 3 yrs.Been lied to by Managers, HR and Supervisors. Not a good training system for Operations or new Supervisors.Expected to work much more hours than promised. There's a swinging door when it comes to the job turn around and Im on my 4th Plant Mgr in 3 yrs.I worked at Qualitest for 2 years. Started off a decent place but then went all corporate. They treat their employees horrible. Basically its like thanks for making us over a billion dollars this year with that being said here's your 17 cent raise on top of the horrible wage we pay you now. Job security is decent but trust me if they dont like you they'll make you want to quit. No advancement opportunities. You stay in the position and wage you were hired in at. like I sad its a stepping stone job. Most enjoyable part of the job is the occasional hour lunches. Hardest part of the job is having to deal with gossip, drama, favoritism, harassment (with no help from supervisors) and discrimination.Great place to work, gained a lot of valuable knowledge about the Pharma industry.Work was never boring, had a lot of versatility and challenging aspects to job function.Management was very helpful and supportive to my ideas, and helping me advance in my position(s).Co-workers were great, we worked together as a team on all projects.The most enjoyable part of the job was customer satisfaction.I enjoyed the job and people. Great work experience. The pay was a little low. Management doesn't do a great job of informing the direction of the job market.Mapped out my territory according to call plan, called on physicians and staff, in offices and hospitals, recorded information in computer, provided lunch and learns, teamed up with teammates for conventions and meetings, worked with district manager to discuss prospects and how to get increase in market share.I learned a lot about how to get past the gate keepers, how to engage the physicians in a conversation, how to add value to their business, and how to work a convention or event.The hardest part was when my territory was changed and I missed meeting with my regulars.The most enjoyable part was when physicians and staff told me they had success with my product-especially when it was recently launched.Identify and determine the customer base of Urologists throughout a defined geographic territory which includes Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York Convey the clinical benefits, ensure order placement and fulfillment, aid in billing/reimbursement of Valstar and participate in the intravesical administration of Valstar to patients with BCG Refractory CIS  Track the historical and present buying trends of Valstar and Fortesta among my established customer base of Urologists which has enabled me to maintain existing business while targeting and generating new sales Establish and monitor the purchasing channels for Valstar between numerous Urology Practices, Besse Medical, Smith Medical Partners and Specialty Pharmacies Every day at Endo was a different day filled with new challenges and learning experiences.  We were constantly learning existing Legacy and making new recommendations for process improvements.  Once a process was mastered and demonstrated to have successful results, I would train my team in order to provide them with the empowerment to move forward with this new process.  We would find ways to improve the process via reporting, excel vlookups and building structure across the organization. The most enjoyable part of the day was knowing that I made a difference in my team, their challenges and the company.Easy work, great managers, great co workers, you would love to work here. everyone helps each other out. From top to bottom it's a great place to workYou will probably be laid off months after you are hired. Confused management and dull drugs to represent. Do not even consider working hereIts always fun to work for Endo. The product mix enables you to have a welcoming atmosphere from the staff and HCP. Endo has that family type of atmosphere and it still gives value to its employees and  treats them as individuals.Great place to work, if you have a nice team.Learned a lot of new stuff FIORI is new technology which is in market for less time.The hardest part of the job is there is less communication between the team members, don't know what they are working on so messed up doing same work twice.Of all the pharmaceutical companies I worked for, this one was the best.  It offered a ton of vacation (4 weeks to start) and the products were legitimately there to help people (pain management).  A lot of great people made the aches and pains of the job bearable. The company provides great compensation and benefits. They go out of there way to provide the best environment to succeed in your territory. I've been with the company for 5 years and feel very secure in my position with many opportunities for advancement, and continual education paid by the company.There has been many changes and downsizing to the company. As of now the company is working with a skeletal crew. Many jobs are not getting done because only one person is in it and they are overwhelmed. Not only has there been major downsizing but the turnover rate is high as well. Unstability.Requires a lot out of its workers but it is a good paying job with outstanding benefits.I am a current healthtronics employee with over 7 years of service. This company called EndoPharmacueticals acquired Healthtronics some time ago and is starting to make life difficult for the Healthtronics employees. Healthtronics used to be a fun place to work because we would always have great functions (Summer and Christmas parties) that kept the employees morale high. Now that we are a part of Endo, it is not fun anymore. Endo tried to make sure that we did not have a Christmas party all in 2012 by shrinking the budget of the people who were responsible to plan events like this but we managed to have the party.Several months ago, Endo created a shared services division in which all of accounts payable from not only our company but a few others that were acquisitioned by Endo. Lets just say the employees in shared services are not happy because they are not being treated well (keep this in mind when applying for any A/P position).Just recently found out that we many not be getting yearly raises this year because the company ""did not do so well"". Hmmmm, that it funny for them to say that when Endo is building a muti-million dollar buidling to repace an old one they used to have. If the company was not doing so well then why build a another building?I just thought I would give a warning to anyone considering applying here. Even If I do not know who you are, I do care enough to say find a company that will treat you well and respect your hard work.Endo Pharma is a good company. The compensation and benefit packages are good."
195,"EnerNOC, Inc.","EnerNOC goes well out of its way to make the employees happy; whether that's free coffee/snacks, gym access, resources, benefits or just compensation. They pay well, come with a good reputation and the culture at OMP is great! Where they fall short is their mismanagement with company direction (i.e. we switched our corporate focus 3 times in my less than 1.5 years). I enjoyed my time there, but definitely felt there were some dodgy things happening in the background. I would definitely recommend the company, but don't get comfortable - things could change drastically, without any warning.I gave only one star for each category based on the recent massive layoffs that completely exposed the gross incompetence of senior management and their crass disregard for the adverse effects on so many who were only hired in the last two months.  There were many new employees hired since July to work within the company's EIS offering.  Unfortunately sales were slow and costs were high so they decided to cut hundreds including those who they recently lured away from other jobs and opportunities.  Those people are left with one week's notice, upon which their insurance benefits expire and truly pathetic severance packages.  These people were victimized by the company.  Was senior management so incompetent and out of touch with the numbers that they would continue a steady stream of new hires?  Or are they really that crass that they simply did not care about what they were doing to individual lives?  Take your pick because in either case, they are not to be trusted.Great people and management.  Very fast paced environment.  Lots of opportunity to learn and grow your career.  Small enough to make an impact and meet executives.In Energy management company like Enernoc Demand Response does has tough challenges due to Government interference on rulingsGreat place to work. It was definitely a meritocracy. Good ideas were put into place.I was able to have a good work/life balance while working there. I did notice other teams where work/life balance seemed to be strained.I was able to work remotely quite a bit, but this seemed to be a team-by-team decision.EnerNOC is an extremely fast paced organization, but in some regards lacks critical experience.  Most of the staff at EnerNOC are fresh college graduates which breeds a launching ground for these folks to the rest of their career (Not necessarily with EnerNOC long-term).  This type of work force also lends itself to a lack of vested interest in objectives and goals and promotions to folks that may not be completely qualified.EnerNOC provides first rate demand response, procurement and energy management software. The company has doubled in size in the last few years and had few competitors in terms of track record, focus and quality/breadth of offering.Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. This is expected to become a big company in the energy industry.EnerNOC is by far the worst company I have ever seen.. Everyone is a phony, hard charging type of clown that would push you in front of a train for a buck. Turnover is relentless, the work is mundane and management is useless. Rumor is that the idea for the company was stolen from another student at business school, like all good ideas.You will quickly be an expert in any department you work in and will be treated valuably. It is hard to maintain a work/ life balance in some departments, however in others it is cut and dry. Ultimately I have had a great experience, and have been treated great since day one. My managers respect me and are always my advocates.EnerNOC is growing fast and is not for everyone, but if you give it a try and have internal drive- you will NOT be disappointed.Interview process was very thorough but now I see why- the employees here are truly best and brightest. Many also have major accomplishments outside work- truly work hard play hard! As an Engineer was pleasantly surprised at the major investments company is making in technology!I cant say enough about the great people! I cant speak to past but it appears the company has made a tremendous investment in ensuring the employees concerns were heard and working hard to create culture of people that are not ony challengd but rewarded and given the flexibilty to have the work life balance that was previously lacking. My goup in particular has a tremendous promotional rate- the inside sales team (BDA's) - truly a feeder pool for outside sales roles.Good place to work and reccommend it to one and all. No hassles with management, and environment is very peaceful & conducive to learning while working.I took this job because of grandiose talk during the interview about how they were going to make the world a better place and were excited to create green technology. After working there for a little while, I realized they only wanted mechanics that could add. Almost all of my time was spent in machine rooms or adding up kWhs on the computer. The company was so against using computers that almost everything we did had to be printed out numerous times. Any time a new idea was presented, it was immediately shot down by management, even if it had the potential of increasing productivity by a lot. Other companies will pay better and have you do less work in the industry. Everyone generally leaves within a year of starting here.Manager didn't know processes of their own employees, and the department had very weak procedures and controls. People don't stay more than a year. The managers have no idea whats going on.I was hesitant to join after some of the reviews online- i was pleasantly surprised to see that little of that actually rang true. YES it is a challenging environment but I was actually seeking that in y next employer! You are surrounded by talented people always willing to help (in my opinion). Also it may be cliche but it really is work hard play hard- my previous employers eliminate the ""fluff"" like social events, holiday parties, employee recognition awards- EnerNOC appears to be committed to keeping the entrepreneurial environment they set out with. Engineering has Innovation days that you only task is to come up with an innovative idea- regardless of topic- for a techie like m- that's a huge plus!It was a great place to work. Had an opportunity to research new and latest technologies. The co-workers are great and very supportive. I did not like though working alone, I am more of a team player. Management is great, and encourages new ideas.EnerNOC is a great place to work if you don't have a family and don't like to sleep. Whatever you do will never be enough.An interesting place to work. Smart, younger workforce routinely being pulled in a million directions with varying results and varying levels of engagement.Culture between depts and floors can vary. Fast paced and stressful in Engineering, but outlets exist in fooball table, kayak, and paddle boards.A great collection of smart people who are motivated to contribute to a mission-driven organization and change the way the world uses energy."
444,Enigma,"It was a good company but it was not the type of work i was looking for.the hardiest part of the job was sweeping up every piece of hair like every 5 mins.

My fellow co-workers were helpful when needed but management in the job was not very helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I got a chance to better my communication skills but the worst part was the long hours and the lack of care and communication throughout the management of the workplace.this has got to be the best work i have had since i have last school and from today because it takes skill to paint and gloss very tall and wide buildings at chesire oaks. I really did enjoy working with this company i had learnt so much from it and can hopefully bring me somewere in the future. It was very good money that i was earning with them for my age i couldnt of asked for anything better and would love to go back there again.we would start the day with going over were and what we were going to be doing always up beat everyone always happy looking forward to the day ahead. i learned communication skills how to talk to people face to face and work as part of a team the management were always asking if u needed anything they were always there for help and they would be out in the field just the same as us who worked for them never putting anyone down if anyone ever made mistakes they never pulled you up in front of everyone they were awsum and the co workers were brilliant as well we all worked as part of a team so would help each other out. the hardest part of the job was all the walking in all kinds of weather and the most enjoyable part of the job was the people i spoke to some not so nice but that was part of the job and i traveled more over scotland in that job than i ever did growing upi liked my time whilst working at enigma, there were a lot of young girls that used the store so i felt i could relate to them and help with clothes advise and picking out diffrent outfit options.I did work experience here and thoroughly enjoyed it. I worked the tills, dealt with the stock, priced items, helped customers buy items and advised customers when they asked me questions.Very sad that it was closed.

631,Ensco Inc,"While I was at ENSCO the corporate culture was all about fair play with the employees. I enjoyed my time, but our contract ended with the Government and we were not offered additional employment.One of the better positioned companies to ride out the offshore energy slump.  Clear expectations and a safety focused culture make it more safe than the ""old"" oilfield.Responsibility is the name of the game on an offshore drilling rig and platform, safety is key and when it is used properly it can make for a great workplace, I learned a lot about permitted jobs and how to work with a great team. The management is well versed in company policies and it shows by their safety records.Some days are okay, some days we get so busy that we only have little time to rest. Which is just normal in the industry. Being a Driller for more than 10 years but still learned more when I joined Ensco.The working environment is highly dependent upon the local rig/ship management, therefore, you can have a great team and poor management or vice-versa.Enjoyable work place , day by day challenge due client requirements Good place to learn and adapt to the fastest program change Satisfaction on goal achievmentsThe most enjoyable part of the job is working with a knowledgeable team and sharing new skills and ideas.   Typical days on the rig consist of scheduled preventative maintenance and repair in a safety oriented atmosphere, including pre job safety meetings and minimizing downtime on various diesel engines, hydraulics, pneumatics, pumps, gearboxes, reverse osmosis water purification systems, sewage treatment systems, air compressors and heat exchangers.   I have learned a lot from my supervisors and we are encouraged to do our part at improving industry safety standards by doing one task at a time and empowering everyone with stop working authority.I loved working offshore with but with the market down I must find something that's more reliable for my family! It was good money and good benefits. So with all that said I will stay with what ever I can get!I am a hard worker and strive to do my very best at obtaining the max potential and output at whatever I indulge in.  Very punctual and trustworthy. Company strived to provide workers with most and best knowledge to perform tasks at a very high level.This job required 12 hr days, 7 days a week for 21 days straight.Once aboard you were basically on the vessel for the required time of your hitch. There was always an under lying worry that should something happen at your home, or to a family member, your ability to get home should your presence be required.AMEC Paragon is a great place to work at, with great leadership.  Pros:Proven leadershipOpportunities to advance and learnCons: NoneWasnt a bad place to work, lack of communications, We built gear to gu under trucks for the purpose to test tarck layout and find problems and in-perfectionsworking 90 hour weeks paid off when i was working. being off for 14 days straight was nice. cooking for 200 men. Learned how to multitask.Roustabouts are usually responsible for cleaning, working basic machinery, scraping paint and repainting, loading and unloading heavy shipments and helping with any miscellaneous tasks that arise.The hardest part of the job is safety as well as the heat but everything must be triple check because in the blink of an eye anything can happen if equipment is not check right or loads or not rigged right.Management is the crane operator as well as the deck foreman they're my boss and any job tasks that we take on they must approve of it and see if need a (JSA) Job Safety Analysis.The most enjoyable part about offshore is they make it feel like home off the clock with the physical activities and social parts.Installed, maintained, and repaired electronic controls for robotic drilling equipment, diesel engines, automated Voyage Management System, and internal/external communications equipment.Ensco is not a bad company to work for, but due the current market situation they have had to stack ships and lay off a large amount of employees.Wonderful place to work with nice employees and tons of resources for training and assistance.  Management is very approachable and tries hard to interact with all employees with occasional town halls, ""pipeline to President"" forums etc.I enjoyed my time at ENSCO very much so. It was on a 14\14 day schedule. I would give anything to go back to this job. but with the slow down in the oil industry I cant.Enjoyed working rotational shift. After spending a long period of time working hard, the quality time off to spend at home or travel is rewarding.Great motivating supervisors to work for. The company provides some of the best training for my career. The hardest part of the job for me was being away from family weeks at a time.They merged with Pegasus and is now UniversalPegasus. and is now a different company. Before the merger it was a good place to work. I learned lot about pipeline mapping and went from board draftsman to AutoCAD designer."
12,Enterprise Solution inc,"Good place to work. Excellent work culture. Great value of work.Excellent management. Always ready to help out. provide guidance to gain your goal. Good ways to communicate with other employees.This was a high call volume call center for collecting medical record for several different companies, the objective was to schedule at least three on site reviews which was the hard part because some doctors office didn't like to have technicians come in so it was a very competitive job and you had to be assertive and persuasive in order to get that done. Sometime we would have races to see who get the most onsite reviews scheduled within a time frame. I enjoyed it i was always able to get five or more and that was the fun part.Work life balance is good. Good testing tools-Quality Center, Jira QTP, and In-house tools. Good testing methodology.The people at ECS was not professional at all. No one on the office side was helpful. I would go to a job site retrieve all the information that I was required to retrieve, upload the information, and think that I would be going forward to the next job. However; I would have to return to a site because they do not work together in the corporate office. It was a high turnover rate for the Field Tech Coordinators, in the 11.5 months that I worked there, I had 6+ Coordinators. The most enjoyable part of working for ECS was going to various job sites and working with different people every day.Working as your own supervisor was wonderful! It put great responsibility on me, but also taught me a lot. With this kind of job you need organization. The only downfall was there was not always work available. So when the cases slowed, so did the heavy paycheck that you relied on.A typical day at work is driving to site location all over New Jersey for chart retrieval. I learned how to maneuver Electronic Medical Record programs that I am using to retrieve charts. Management has been very good to me. They work with me with scheduling for issues that arise that causes me to miss work or change work times. I do not have contact with other co-workers because I work alone. Hardest part of the job is dealing with rude workers at some site locations. Most enjoyable part is working alone and only checking in through job website and applications.Upper management was very poor, Middle management made up for that, in how they interacted and treated employees. The company took pride in their adherence in HIPPA and continuously updated employees and quizzed them on information. Based in a call center environment, as a field tech coordinator, you are provided with a team made up of 10-20 individuals that were from the same general area in the United States. It was my responsibility to account for these team members to show up to their pre-scheduled job site and provide tier one technical support with our software that was sent out to them, where they scanned the pre-chosen medical records from the office they were assigned to. The company lost a few major contract and were forced to lay off 3/4 of the employed staff,Focus on client satisfaction with excellent service; enable the efficient knowledge transfer from the consultants to the client user so that the client end users can expedite the implementation and mastery of the system.Encourage the client users to take ownership of the implementation with advisory support and solution architecture.Travel  to site, transpose patient's medical record charts to electronic medical records (EMR). Send data to corporate office to transfer to EMR. Follow Medicare and Medicaid regulations.Great place to work, Contracts vary so each job will be different, Management is very supportive and the environment is a just do it type of place.Enjoyed work place and gained the skills  by dealing with complex business scenarios. Found lot of opportunities in working with various technologies and gained skills in short time.At ECS the work was really great and the doctors and staff were easy to get along with. My co-workers were very great friendly people and at times very helpful. The hardest part of the job is when you have to keep calling the doctors and there staff to let them know that they have past due medical records that need to be sent out. They start feeling harassed and pressured. Your job is to keep as calm as possible ans explain to them that you can allow them to have an extension. The goal is to keep them happy all the while make sure you get your job accomplished. The management was difficult. Due to them not acknowledging their employees. They don't speak to you nor do they even look at you. All in all i loved my job and wished that my assignment never ended there.A Typical work day varied; because it typically was often a different location. The exciting part of the job would be changes in the job locations. The most enjoyable part of the job was working independently. However;  management, whenever needed was awesome, they were just a phone call away. The hardest part of the job might be no full-time employment available. The position is just a temporary position; which is made clear before the position is offered. A GREAT COMPANY TO WORK WITH!It was incredibly easy working for this company. I worked off a schedule that was flexible to my needs. I drove to different cities and recovered medical charts from private practice physicians for Medicare insurance audits. I had the opportunity to learn medical procedure terminology and a feel for what a medical organization can expect with insurance audits. I learned how to carefully process sensitive information. Unfortunately I didn’t have the pleasure of getting to know any given person regularly due to me working at different sites daily, however it was nice to meet new people.This position enabled me to work with many different sales teams and see many different management styles. Providing true value to the field organization with strategy, fostering collaborative thinking and a consulatative sales approach incorporating all buiness lines. Leading presentatations for end user customers for roadmap planning.  Planning and development for new products to be launched globally. The most challenging aspect of this job was covering such a large territory so throughly. Most enjoyable was the company, people and level of expertise and size of projects delt with.The compensation was very fair and working from home allowed for autonomy.You will be working independently. I learned some valuable things about HIM and EMR. My experience with ECS landed my current job, which I love, for me. Overall a great experience, but not a lot of security. Great work if you are looking for a position in the HIM field.I enjoyed going to different clinics and seeing new people, management was good. I liked that you were almost your own boss didn't have people looking over your shoulder, there was a lot of trust.Consulting at Enterprise  Business Solutions gives good exposure to end clients. Get to work and gain valuable experience at end clients in different industries.Travel to scheduled Medical sites and retrieve specific requested documents for requested dates of service by either paper scan, print to scan or EMR flashdrive.I learned how to navigate through several different EMR systems.Management is friendly and easy to get along with.Hardest part of the job is traveling to unknown offices and working by yourself.most enjoyable part was meeting different people and seeing different Medical offices.Great opportunity if you enjoy working independently and mostly figuring things out on your own. If you are even semi tech savvy, it's super easy. I have worked nearly full time all summer and have exceeded the 12 week commitment required. This has been great, in that it is a part time job, thus you I have earned a lot of overtime pay. If you follow the guidelines/expectations, call in to your Coordinator as required, do daily reporting online, you will be be offered work. (If it is available in your area; it is all project based and you are informed of that upon hire.) There can be issues with communication, but this is the case with any company, and at least it is all via telephone/not in your face. The job is not permanent, no benefits, and some wear/tear on your vehicle, all of which you are informed of during the interview process. However, it beats drawing unemployment, and affords one the opportunity to network in different offices daily.I enjoy working with Enterprise Consulting Solutions.  If I need any extra training they tell me where to find it.  If I need help with uploading charts they have tech support to help with that.  Overall, this is a great company to work for."
770,EOG Resources,"My 18 years with the EOG family was incredible.  I would still be there had it not been for the industry downturn.  I understand and can work in every facet of the oil and gas industry.I loved my job at EOG, despite some of the frustrations. Their corporate policy of using mostly contractors being the main issue. I learned a ton about the material management and logistics involved in running an oil and gas operation.Working and maintaining development with automation and controls in the oil/gas industry. Managing techs in the specific area. Daily checks on the network and data sent to Cygnet. keeping contact and communication up up Engineers and Lease Operators. Ordering parts for each specific job and making sure correct parts and devices arrive to location on time. Programming end devices and setting up communications. Training new techs on the automation with software and weekly meetings.I worked as a contract Buyer.  They do not treat contract employees well.  Some of the actual employees will treat contract people as second class.   Contract people are not paid as good as many other companies.To many buddies hiring buddies without experience.  Company management lacks safety culture and is not being held accountable for their actions.On the other side, the field personnel are in experienced but shows ability to advance and learn.Learned a lot about inventory management and co workers are awesome to work with hardest part of the job was the drive to work.Learned something new every day. The work I did on a daily basis gave me a challenge, that is what I enjoyed most. They gave me the tools I needed to get my job done.Very enjoyable work environment, All of the lease operators were very helpful with sharing any experience they had about route and what to look for problem areas and information pertaining to the job. always answered any questions that they could.Monitored the meters in the field via computer and learned to build and create alarms and messages through the SCADA system. Management teams were very helpful.Everyone appeared to get along very well with each other.The hardest part of the job was actually being laid off due to the downturn in the gas and oil industry.A typical day consists of coordination of work flow for our 4 field offices with 6 Field Superintendents, 10 Production Foreman and 12 Administrative Assistants.  Liaison between them and our Field Production Manager for everything from organizing training and meetings, documenting compliance with requirements, addressing issues and working together to cut cost and maintain productivity and safety.  I also coordinate interdepartmentally to establish a division wide schedule to communicate when which wells will go to production. I also oversee logistics in utilizing and the tracking of 66 pieces of company owned production equipment.  Generation of cost analysis reports, equipment/trucking report and regulatory report for the Texas Railroad Commission.I have worked with a great group of diverse people during my almost 9 years with EOG and have made many friends that I will have for the rest of my life.  EOG is a great company to work for and has a family atmosphere.  My current Bosses are very thankful and appreciative of my work and let me know often that I am very appreciated.  The hardest part is not knowing the fate of the oil industry in it's current downturn, which is why I accepted an 'early retirement' package that was too good to pass up.Culture/atmosphere at EOG was mostly satisfactory. The environment was fast-paced and challenging. I had a great experience and I learned a great deal more about the oil & gas industry. I hope to take the skills I acquired and apply them to future job opportunities.Enjoyed my time there. Met some great people. Great work environment. Learned a lot about the process involved in day to day well activities with vendors and clients.EOG is big on professional development, which is a wonderful benefit. My initial team and boss were wonderful. However, another manager was not and several people left just because of this person.Able to work self paced as well as team member usually a variety of tasks to complete, such must be multi-taskeropportunity to get educational assistanceopportunity to get health assistance (gyms, support)good payGood place to work and enjoy the co-workers.  You try to help out when needed or at least when asked to help or just give a little bit of encouragement which goes a long way sometimes.EOG is an excellent company to work for. My co-workers were the best part about my job. The hardest part of my job with EOG was the logistical challenges I faced. The amount of area that I had to cover was great.My work at EOG involved supervision of a team of accountants and clerks tasked with revenue accounting duties for a large E&P company.  Over the course of my career with EOG, my duties were expanded in accordance with my increased experience.  Management training was provided along the way.  In addition the performance review process provided excellent feedback to allow job growth and improvement.  The pace of work at EOG is very fast.  I relied very heavily on my team to get all their work done and to help make decisions for the group regarding job assignments and deadlines.  I provided the expertise on division of interest maintenance, which documents the ownership of oil and gas wells from an accounting point of view.  This allowed me to interact with the other departments such as Land Administration, Legal, Marketing, and Division Land and Administration. The management team at EOG have been working together for a long time and were very knowledgeable about their departments.  The hardest part of the job was balancing the demands from upper management while providing supervisory support for the accountants who reported to me.  I enjoyed the relationships I formed with all my co-workers and the rewards systems in place at EOG which acknowledged hard work and special effort.Respectable professional atmosphere that is fast pace. Job is detail oriented.  Management keeps you well informed where you're at as well as the company.Typical work day included all aspects of well construction. I learned ways to be more efficient and effective through the use of new technology and forward thinking. Management was effective and efficient. I worked with many co-workers from across the U.S. Drilling in N.Dakota included working during harsh winter weather. I enjoyed the N. Dakota climate changes and being able to travel to see and learn new things.Worked as a safety consultant for EOG conducted safety inspection of maintenance work and new construction of well sites. Also conducted monthly inspection of H2S monitors and fire extinguisher along with monthly checks of cascade systems at each of the well sites. Managed confine space entries. Performed noise surveys, NORM surveys. Investigated accidents to identify causes or determine how such accidents maybe prevented in the future."

351,Ericsson,"The company's internship program is great. Work life balance is also good. Co Workers are very helpful and approachable.The most hardest part of the job is to understand the product.I enjoyed working at Ericsson as they were proactive and forward thinking. Teamwork approach and management was excellent. We put in long days but the end results for our customer paid off well.- Devilry , customer satisfaction, flexible and self authorized at my work. - Focus on customer and lead.- Manage my daily work with little intervention from my manager. - Remotely managed and diverse co-workers from the glob.- Full responsibility in selling and managing multi million projects.- Result oriented, time management, acknowledged.I loved my job. Just no Job Security, no advancement. Tried getting a transfer. Not easy. Old manager was easier to work for. Once getting a new manager. He only cared about himself and not his workersI was fortunate to work with really amazing people. The people in the organization makes this one of the best places to work for.Started my first job with MNC. it had a great experience.Learned new things and willing to learn much more.Good atmosphere and got the opportunity to work with good and professional people.Through +12 year of working inside telecom industry "" GSM , data transmission and FTTXdelivery projects "" make me gain technical knowledge and management skills , member ofnational and international organization team works , share different challenge and successstories , all aim me to build my work experienceI worked at this job for 19 years. worked as a technician back when it was nextel-sprint. once ericsson took over the maintenance contract for sprint things spiraled down fast. many jobs were outsourced to India and most senior techs were let go so they could hire young fresh techs just out of school for way less pay. just a sad thing we see now with businesses here in the usa.Maintenance Program Manager driving periodic software deliveries, achieving above the target WLA performance and concluding escalations from Customers and Stake Holders.Working in lean and agile software cross functional team, achieved continuous delivery of maintenance releases  with high quality, on-time delivery and with allocated budget.Leadership team member of Bug tracking tool migration activity (change management)  and successfully planned and migrated Bug tracking activities from ExtraView to  MHWEB (Ericsson) across multiple global operation teams with out impacting day to day operations of 2000 developers and testers.Work at Ericsson is demanding but exciting in that there are multiple avenues to grow and develop across several wireless technologies.During my time at Ericsson, I worked with outstanding people maintaining wireless networks and deploying next generation technology while challenging was also exciting to learn new skills.The hardest part was learning and adapting quickly in order to support our customers. I enjoyed have the flexible hours and time, work life balance was acceptable.Decent pay for the work, excellent learning experience.  Allowed me to work the hours that I liked and allowed me to go to other depts to learn what they did as wellEricsson had excellent products, but was missing the market moves toward lower cost R&D, and was drawn into the 5G race too far in advance of the market.  The Chinese continue to take share and Ericsson is scrambling to address cost overhead.The management is too focused on the short term and should have seen the longer term trends long in advance of the current bad results.  Co-workers are well qualified but out of touch with the customer.Hardest part of the job was to sell good business with flagging product line up.Most enjoyable part of the job was hitting the marks with products that had the attention of Sweden.To get anything done here takes way too long.  Our customers have spoken, our employees have complained.  The job culture is not conducive to the work they are trying to accomplish and it has shown in lost contracts and lost sales. On top of all that, there are at least one or two layoffs a year so you're always on the chopping block.As with most large companies trying to do more less. Technology and industry is changing and the company is trying to keep up. Layoffs are constant and staff development is poor.When not thinking about the problems of having only one customer that everyone's job depended on, this was a great company to work for.  Co-workers, were a joy to work with as were many of those I was not directly working with.However - because the presence of Ericsson in the US was almost completely dependant upon their Sprint contract, the ground we were on was always shaky.  In the end, it was the contract that ended most of our jobs.Leader in the wireless broadband area.  Company performs many trend researches and has great vision.  For example, Ericsson talked about Connected Society with billions of connections long before IoT became the buzz word.  Company offers a lot of online learning materials to employees.At Ericsson and I must say the benefits and the experiences that I got from the work I was engaged are probably second to none.  I reported to a very engaging and skilled director that served as a mentor for me and helped me grow.  The one thing that I did always dislike is that every year there were layoffs.  It is difficult to keep motivated when you know that around 4th Quarter there will be a culling of the heads in the office.  This may have been unique to the Overland Park Office and not as frequent in PlanoLove working for Ericsson, learn many things, how to manage capital   assets, how to manage other employees to build core switches in a live environment, how to work with implementation managers on meeting deadlines and ensuring job was up to specs at all times. A typical day at work was usually very long. The most enjoyable part was when we all work together to accomplish the same goal, plus meeting new co-workers.A typical day at work consisted of logging onto computers and phone. Outlook was a daily tasks of checking emails and responding to customers. Ran reports and attended monthly meetings. Hardest part was waiting on other vendors and teams to provide eta's to give to our customers if units were not locally at the warehouse due to damaged or lost.Ericsson's home office was in Sweden and cell phones were just coming into view. Many visitors came to office and many presentations were made regarding this new product.Good company, great benefits, coworkers very professional, work environment and schedule flexibility are great. Needs improvement: too many layers of management."
768,ERM,"ERM is a great place to work if you are a technical person (i.e, consultant, geologist, etc) - if you are in an administrative role there is virtually no opportunity for advancement.  Co-workers are absolutely the best.This was a nice company to work for, but the management has made decisions that have been driving good employees away in droves. After a few rounds of knee jerk layoffs of some of their best employees, other employees are getting out at an astonishing rate. Your work life will be about nothing other than maintaining the highest billability possible so the company can meet unrealistic profit expectations. While trying to find your own work to maintain that elusive billable goal, your rates will be inflated so project managers will cut your hours while still expecting you to do the same amount of work...thus lowering your billability through no fault of your own.  Sick days will also lower your billability, as will the umpteen pointless meetings they will make you attend every week.  Unless you are a field person, don't expect to meet your billability goals with our working at least 50 hours a week.  Also expect to work late into the night and over the weekends on projects for senior people who waited until the last minute to meet a deadline. Your personal life means nothing to them...also, they ate up all the budget for themselves so you can't bill all your time to the project.I used to work for this company. This is the WORST company to work for, the management is two face, they tell you all the great things FALSELY FABRICATED which will in a few months turn out to be a bunch of lies. There is NO JOB SECURITY, they will hire you for a specific project or role and once the project ends they will make up an excuse and fire you on the spot. The management has too many politics and issues among themselves. I WILL NEVER WORK FOR ERM AGAIN AND WILL NEVER RECOMMEND ANYONE TO WORK HERE.Field work was fun and challenging.  The work provided me with good experience and I was able to learn from qualified people.Leadership is nonexistent. Some departments desperately need a management change.Partners seem to promote people who are incompetent and arrogant. Most PM's are not very knowledgable in the their field of 'expertise' and play the blame game when review time comes around. Limited chance for advancement with current management. The only performance metrics that ERM seem to care about is sales targets, face to face meetings, and billing percentage. Those are hard to achieve if you are not writing proposals and denied direct contact with clients. Forget about proper training and mentoring. These important development activities are essentially nonexistent and when you can help, it's unappreciated.Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them.Laid off due to cut backs, I did full cycle Accounts Payable. Three check runs per week, coding invoices, as well as entering them.Personable, deadline-driven and self-starter Office Administrator/Executive Assistant experienced in working in a fast-paced environment.  Solid team player who offers a positive and cooperative attitude.For the most part, I enjoy working at ERM, however, I would like to pursue a career in my field of study. At this facility, being in the admin position, I am not granted the opportunity to advance into the field that I would like. Job advancement is there for those who have degrees in this line of work. My bachelors is in Psychology and I am pursuing my masters in Legal Studies. My coworkers are the sweetest and most lovely bunch of individuals I have ever met. From the first day I started, they have all been equally nice, helping, and full of support. The hardest part of my job is watching everyone around me work in their career while I am working a job and waiting on my opportunity to advance into my career. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I am in a very friendly environment and I love the people that I work with. I have learned ample skills that will help me in future endeavors.Great co-workers caught in a changing culture resulting in a very high turn over rate.The company is a very good one to work for.  The Information Solutions groups is basically a separate company from the Environmental Consulting side, which is unfortunate. There seems to be a lot less internal competition and insecurity in the Environmental side.  A lot of opportunity if you have SAP experience.A the location I worked, the company seems to tolerate if not condone less than professional work - doing more to curry to clients than to meet regulatory obligations or professional ethics. Disjointed managment, lack of cohensive values. The company has a reputation of hiring then firing personnel once they are done with them. Cyclical nature of consulting does not help either.I worked at ERM for 7 years,  I gained great experience during my time there.  I was able to develop my technical and problem solving skills in the field and reporting.   My co-workers were always enthusiastic to perform the work and ready to get their hands dirty.A very high-pressure project (ALCOA Chatham/Cap-de-Ville ESIA) executed with personable superiors and great work team."
776,"ERM Group, Inc.","Partner oriented organization with a strong emphasis on billable hours, certifications and advancement. Very challenging and interesting work requiring a lot of international travel.This job was never meant to be a salaried position.  Work weeks would range from 40 hours a week to 90 hours a week, all while getting paid the same weekly rate.  The travel ranged from 50% to 80% based on the month.Working hard and doing the right thing isn't enough, you have to be willing to play the game.  Do not underestimate the power of politics.The management tries to addresss the low morale however, actions and words don't match.good experience. some work very interesting, other work not as interesting. no additional comments at this time. the experience likely outweighed the negativesMany projects with interesting work.  Opportunities abound with work. If you like to work and have no life outside of work, this is the place for you.  There was a tremendous variety of projects to work on.  Colleagues were there to help and share techniques to complete high quality jobs.  The hardest part of the job was working for a poor manager whose reputation was well known as someone who would make your life difficult if not miserable.  The best part of the job was when I was released from the position and no longer had to deal with the individual in question.Overall a fine place to work if you are a robot, lacking feelings and desire to do anything but work.  Additionally, since annual growth targets were unrealistic, firings and layoffs have become the norm.  Expect no understanding, mercy, or pity from this bunch of wolves.Tetra Tech was a great company to work for.  Work life balance was great.  Compensation was good and benefits as well.  Definitely miss the people and environment.  Always looked forward to going to the office.ERM was a great company to work for.  The people and overall culture was positive and a great atmosphere.  Great benefits and a great work life balance.The work day id between 8 am and 5 pm. One knows exactly what and how to do the work assigned. little room for creativity. Can be monotonous.The company has a set way of doing things and there is not verring from that.The hardest part is meeting the expectation of the different project managers.Used to be a fun place until Obama's war on coal. Smart workers but hard climate to work in. Co-workers are fun to work with.I really didn't enjoy my time at this company. The employees made me a little uncomfortable. There employees weren't too friendlyThis is a company that is trying to transition from a mid-sized company into a large one.  They really don't care much about anything other than what the spreadsheets say.  To that end, they have zero interest in employee development.  There is zero training and zero opportunities for advancement.  They hire outside the company for very nearly every position and don't even tell us they're looking for positions senior to our current level.  While I was there, they assigned EVERYBODY an ""employee level"" that basically just puts you in a specific box.  It's nearly impossible to climb out of that box and advance.I was there nearly 10 years and found that as time went on, they were doing everything possible to get rid of the long term employees and replace us with cheaper, disposable people who would stay for a couple years and then move on.""Leadership"" if you want to call it that, came from England.  They wanted no input from us colonists whatsoever and if we offered any, we were silenced almost immediately.Great company to work for and provides out of the box thinking to handle any size project. Use all the current up to date computer programs to maximize the design and turn around time to satisfy any client.ERM will remain the worst company I have worked for during my 20 years in the work force. I joined in 2007 and realized within a month that the office I belonged to had some serious issues. It was back in the ""Opco"" days when one ERM office would actually compete against another ERM office for profits and sometimes ignore common sense when delivering services to a client.Aside from the competitive nature of sales and MY client attitude, I joined a team who's leader told me ""you are in a different Opco"", I cannot help you..."". Needless to say, I did not speak to him ever after unless required to. in 2008-2009, ERM, globally, decided to ""address"" this counter productive issue and ""deployed"" a new strategy around ""collaboration""... Wow! What a giant step forward in recognizing this rotten environment! I thought the company would turn this around and work on getting new blood with a different mentality to offset the bad vibes often encountered within the office. It did not happen, 5 years later... Ended in the ""me, myself and I"" mode for over 7 years... As for the ""strategy"", ERM put all its eggs in the Oil and Gas and mining basket (recruiting, etc.). Fast forward to 2014/ 15, such markets have stalled and ERM is now leaking its wounds and looking at growth elsewhere... Maybe a diversified sector growth portfolio would have been wiser? Bottom line, stay away : poor strategy, poor leadership, poor knowledge sharing/ management, rotten work environment...Very typical corporate environment. Globally minded, empowering a revolving door of post graduate, energetic, youth. If travelling lifestyle is desirable to you, this is a great place to work.Very laid back friendly company to be a part of. There are many opportunities to volunteer on environmental projects as well as opportunities to interact with other employees out of the office.Fun workplace environment with great people, but the work was not as sustainability focused as I initially had hoped. Also, poor management and little to no mentorship. Easy to get ""pigeon-holed"" into work.It was a pleasure going to work everyday as my coworkers became good friends.  I developed a good relationship with my clients and even though the job was hard, I loved it because I like to be busy all the time. The hardest part of the job was working crazy hours during the end of the month closing.  The most enjoyable part was making new friends that until today we communicate.No good things to say about the Atlanta office with the exception of the presence of a hard working crew of staff scientistsLack of diversityUnethical practicesLow moraleDemoralizing business practices (requires billability exceeding 100%)Several of the best staff left due to poor people managementHuman resources lead at Atlanta office lacked integrityThey were understanding when things could not get done and they never expected too much from you. Great company, very humane.I would get in at 8 and be done no later than 5:30 (with an hour commute on each end).  I learned that ERM talks a good family game but refuses to consider that 5 day in the office meant 50+ hour work weeks.  Profit is the only motivator, and training was something that would be sacrificed for the almighty dollar.   The majority of the people that I worked with were dedicated professionals committed to their work.One caution:  if you thought that your experience and talents would provide you with an office or at least a cubicle, you are wrong.  ERM believes in an alienating model of open workspaces where there is no privacy or the ability to relax at your workstation, because you are in a situation to be surveilled at your workstation.  I have spoken to people leaving and turning down positions with ERM and that has been one of the largest issues working with this company.Some very nice people and the my coworkers are fantastic.  Chance for promotion and career development somewhat limited."

We sometimes worked close to home and sometimes we worked away from home. The people there we nice and very productive which made us work great as a team. We would work 8-12 hour shifts Monday through Friday and would usually be off on the weekends. Overall it was a great job and a great experience.With only a few Clients accounting for 90 % of the revenue , there is limited career growth Staff get fired when there is downturnAnd management recently shows extreme unprofessional action by firing the VP of the company He was hired back in short time when Client gave ultimatum to pull all contracts which would have collapsed the companyI went to work for ETIC because of a project that never came to fruition. Instead of losing me, ETIC put me on a project out of my home state and I commuted for nearly a year. The project was tough and I received a lot of support from where I needed it.

It is very well organized.Do what you love, make it happen.On my free time, I work on designing the wedding floral parasols, I get to use many different kinds of materials.My mother and I currently own 3 shops together. When we started this 3yrs ago we had 1 shop and I did the photography, loaded the photos to the laptops, edited the photos, and she did the rest. This worked for quite a while and we even managed to open a 2nd shop but then I got sicker, at that time, and she had to take over everything. Eventually I got better and was able to start up social networking which brought in some views (not a lot but more than before) to the shops. So it ended up that she runs the shops and I run the net (which kinda became a thing of it's own).My mother goes to garage sales, second-hand stores, estate sales, etc. to find things almost every weekend. She takes photos in the mornings and loads them to her laptop when she gets the chance. She does thorough research on all items as well as VERY thorough packaging.The company is a good company, the people are amazing, its stellar. It is full of so many smart, creative people, there is no doubt that whatever you do there, you will find something cool out about yourself.  What it presents to the outside world, is exactly what it is on the inside. Politics are not prevalent, and employees have a genuine interest in helping you out.Etsy was great in the sense you had complete freedom to choose your work load and schedule. Complete control over your marketing,  design and management. On the downside, you had to juggle many roles at once.Etsy HQ is a warm and truly unique workspace. It offers an open-air seating arrangement with communal desks. The company has made a proactive commitment to sustainability and provides quality, locally sourced goods for employee meals and events. This is a non-discriminatory environment that actually celebrates individuality, promotes gender equality, and encourages work to be executed colorfully, thoughtfully, and communally. There is an attitude that we all have something to learn from one another and that everyone's ideas can propel Etsy's teams to greatness and the company to higher ground.I love working for myself, however the income is not steady enough for my household needs.Great way to make money working from home.  I've been searching for a job for quite a while, and selling on Etsy has kept my head above water for quite a while now.I enjoy the flexibility of selling handcrafted items on Etsy.com. I can easily work from home or when I am traveling.Though products on Etsy are sometimes priced unfairly by the people who use the site, Etsy has become famous for helping artisans connect with their audience worldwide. The site has a positive atmosphere, and the developers tried to make both selling and buying items as easy as possible.loved it the best part was satisfying the customer in what they wanted"
45,EventBrite,"It's a reat place to work forhave great work life balanceFood and snaks are all good.nice and smart coworkers..........................Eventbrite was an admired brand in '08-'10 full of Stanford grads but many have since moved on and replaced by folks from dying brands like eBay and Twitter. Ticketing/e-commerce is now commoditized SAAS and the company's ""strategic"" projects has failed to deliver any differentiation. Both Product and Strategy teams have abandoned the marketplace mission as they struggle to make Eventbrite a destination page for event discovery. Instead the team executes multi-year efforts on refreshing the look and feel of the website to occupy time and without substantial metrics impact. The Engineering team moves at glacial speeds and mostly comes from other events-oriented SAAS companies (read: never worked at pedigree like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, etc). This breads an engineering culture that lacks real processes or documentation. The ""bench strength"" has never worked on large-scale services at aforementioned firms and thus many of its services/experiences have broken under larger loads. This lack of know-how also creates a fear of touching legacy code, building hack upon hack. Recent acquisitions have built off-shore engineering centers making it even harder to develop. With compensation well below market rate and and unknown equity value, more subpar talent is recruited.I loved my time at Eventbrite, I would love to go back to work there.  They have a contract with my staffing agency not to hire temps directly from themIt is a fab office with a focus on the individual, definitely not cubicle land."
256,EverQuote,"EverQuote is a flat organization where everyone has the ability to make a measurable and large impact to the business - even at the entry level. The company is growing very quickly and there is a huge opportunity to learn a variety of skills (coding, analytical). While, auto insurance isn't the most compelling industry/product in the world, the work we do revolves around consumer behavior and can be very interesting."
671,Evidera,"Evidera has many positive things going for it.  There are opportunities for anyone to succeed if they're willing to think big, work hard, take ownership and really commit to whatever it is they're doing.  The only limits are those people place on themselves.I have been at Evidera through many major changes over the last five years.  We are better and stronger than we've ever been before and as a free standing company, in control of our own destiny.  That's a great place to be.Productive, fun, simple, enjoyable, didactic, interesting, workplace. I recommend to other research assistants and anyone else who is prospectively looking to work hereA great place to start your career if you are a researcher; offers considerable opopportunities for growth and advancementOrganizational structure provides limited options for operations staff who have expectations of long-term employment; limited resources made available for skills development of operations staffMy experience here as a SAS programer was very positive. Everyone here knows what they are doing and works together well as a team. Demands of the job are not too high, but expect to pull a few all-nighters when projects are due."
182,Exl Service,"Large international institution with great work life balance. Job advancement could be improved though. Very standard promotion track. Don't have early promotion even if you are good in most cases.Typical BPO company - long hours, solid analytics training, exposure to client. Benefits are ok, promotion based on performance.Its a good place to learn and practice. You get to work with some great minds. I manage a client engagement on my own with no or minimal intervention with my seniorsEY is a great place to work for, can be very competitive and lots of politics, but great place to gain experience and make great work friends.it  is what you make of it . you should start here with a considerable amount of work experience. Not a place to teach you how to do your job.This is a great Company to work for if you are willing to take the initiative in gaining more knowledge about insurance policies and subrogation against third parties responsible for a loss in hopes of recovery back to the member/client.Great place to work. This is one of the largest Decision Analytics outsourcing companies. People get lot of opportunities to work on challenging consulting projects."
683,Expedia,"Great hours, very quick and easy to get through the day. They had fun games during break times and provided candy during the shift. Worked with several other college students - worth it!I used to love this job when I started as a Lodging Support Agent. After you've been there for a few months the cracks start showing. Management lacks expertise on everyday work tasks and one is forced to ask other peers for guidance and support. If you are able to reach one of the leadership positions then you'll have a bit more job security. Overall the place was fun to work with, good peers, more bad than good supervisors. Benefits are ok, but as far as receiving good travel benefits, then you're better off looking elsewhere.Over 250 employees lost their jobs to outsource overseas. I wish that would not have happened, I enjoyed coming into work and they were a great company to work for.Little that we knew at the time, they sent several employees from our call center to train call centers Philippines, El Salvadore and other countries. Not even two years later, they closed Flagship call center where Expedia all started in Tacoma, WA.This position has given me the most creative license in coaching and developing employees.  Expedia breeds a culture of working hard, but also being playful at work.  They are not afraid to try a new process, fail, learn and move on.Great place to work.  Great work and life balance and excellent benefits.Management were great and very diverse. They believed in having fun at the same time believed in taking care of business.Enjoyed working at Expedia. Very good work culture. Nice work-life balance. Pleasant working environment.Was able to learn new tools.I'd almost bet there is no better company than Expedia to work for. Their benefits , culture and work life come in second to none. Best company I've ever had the chance to work for. I will be back aboard at the first opportunity. Dream job for sure.Company has several struggles of running the office. The overall atmosphere is highly stressed, and no one talks about in fear of losing his/her job. Micromanagement is extremely high as well. There are good people there. Their benefits are wonderful.I loved working for Expedia, Inc. The workplace environment was as if I was spending the day with my family.  The benefits were great. The training was extensive and on going.Company provided wonderful training for new mortgage professionals as well as seasoned veterans. However the training doesn't provide you with the reality of the hard work you needed to put in.  You would need to provide your own book of business or cold call or network constantly in order to live because you have no salary or any kind of compensation even though you were required to be there between certain hours.I love my job. It is fun to be able to be apart of the guest experience. Management is awesome and so are the benefits. The most enjoyable part is being able to interact and meet new people from all over the world. A typical ay at work is answering the phones, guests questions, and planning their vacation.I did a 10 month contract at Expedia.  It was a great experience.  The team I worked with were fantastic. I respected the management who seemed genuinely interested in the development of their employees.  There were several programs to develop and grow their existing employees skills and career.It has as any other companies many pros and cons.Not bad office. Coffee, tea, clean water, snacks, mac book pro.Colleagues aren't that helpful (especially from different teams). Everybody are scared for their own job.Excellent place of employment. Able to use travel benefits to see the world and also learn many different levels to travellingFace-paced environment with good people to work with. Stand out individuals within the organization. Benefits and perks are great.Expedia is a wonderful company to work for. Great enviroment. Excellent benefits. The harder your work the more money you'll get paid.Pay is great and benefits are good, local HR and managers - not so much.  Other sites have free soda, free snacks, and even free beer IN THE OFFICE on a regular basis.  The Springfield site is very different, people have gotten fired for drinking in Springfield.I have been working in the customer service industry for almost 8 years and I found my experience at Expedia to be disheartening. Training was an absolute joke and the agents that are released to the floor are no where near ready to take calls. As a Tier 3 agent I feel we should have the  knowledge to perform our job duties, especially since we are dealing with  customers who have spent thousands of dollars. The lack of support from supervisors and leads is sad, they could careless if u fail or succeed until one of your actions cost the company money.  Proper training helps build any successful company's foundation and without it you'll find that your costing yourself a lot of money correcting employee mistakes.Expedia is great for work life balance. Its not fast paced like Amazon and people here tend to get into one position and never leave. You wont advance your career here much but if you want a comfortable job its a good place.great place to work as family center person. Balance work and family life. You will be sure to have time to accompany with your value family members. Also you can improve your skill set in this company.I've had a difficult time here at Expedia, which is opposite to my previous Corporate experience. Many of the people are great to work with, the overall culture is fantastic, but pay is low (comparatively) and advancement difficult for me to understand. Mgmt speaks to a ""work-life"" balance, but when I'm called as I'm entering the movie theater at night because they need something within the hour I don't much feel balanced."
5,Experis,"Good experience.  Professional and helpful.  Submitting time sheet is easy.  They have employee appreciation days.  They work well with you when you need time off.so many clients and productive work. Management is reachable and good to work with them.Average Compensation with Poor Benefits.No relocation allowances and no paid leaves.I have enjoyed working as a Financial Consultant for Experis.  I am their employee, and have all the benefits of a full time position, and can be choosy about the positions that I accept.I transferred to Experis to be able to get back to doing technical recruiting and have been able to do so. However, the staffing firm culture where recruiters are competing against each other even though they work for the same company and where there is little to no work/life balance has left me with an overall negative impression of the company and the staffing firm industry as a whole. This company clearly values quantity over quality which is not a fit for me.If you are not concerned with work/life balance and have no recruiting experience they will hire you instantly. However if you are a Senior Recruiter like me and value quality over quantity than this may not be the place for you.High stress with metrics and lots of changes. Pay cuts and layoffs and taking away of benefits really has left me angry and overall I'd give them a 3 or 4 star.This company is amazing. Excellent benefits, excellent recruitment. Worked with the Office 365 Ambassador Team and learned more than I could have imagined.Worked with many good people, unfortunately it was just a year long contract, and changes in the contract position made it no longer worth the compensation level.  I would recommend anyone seeking contract work to try them.I have learned the way that many Engineers work and how short term it is with their projects.  If you work smart and hard, you will earn the compensation you want and deserve.Leadership could be better, but generally colleagues and managers try employees well.  Decent work/life balance.  Great training program for new recruiters and leadership mostly tries to set people up for success. Benefits are great and base salary is awesome for no experience in the field.  Flexible work from home and lots of vacation.Flexible working hoursFlexible scheduling environmentGood salarydesirable work loadThis experience stretched me in the realm of customer service and supportSince Experis IT is a vendor for Microsoft Studios games division, there are many down times at the company which means important people are let go from their position with no other reason than, 'Your project is coming to a close and we don't have anywhere to move you.' This is understandable to get rid of the excess work force that had ramped up during project heavy times, but they get rid of cornerstones of the company on a regular basis. The direct management of the game testing company is pretty solid - they are approachable, helpful, and always open to feeback - be it good or bad. Experis management, outside of our facility, does not understand the gaming industry and bases peoples performance on their bug output, without taking anything else into consideration.The atmosphere at Experis is a very fun and laid back atmosphere. The people that tend to work there, though some of them are quite young, are almost always a joy to be around. Coworkers are what make this place into a fun environment (that and the testing of video games). The people that you directly work with and relationships that can form because of that are most enjoyable parts of the job.One of the hardest parts of the job is that we are almost never given any sort of design/requirements documentation. We must files issues and reverse engineer documentation based on the bug resolutions (Fixed, Won't Fix, By Design, External).Another tough part of the job is that the developers almost never hit their milestone acceptance dates which creates backed up work in a Waterfall environment. Constant  more... risk and mitigation planning is what gets us through the times when delivery dates are not met.A typical day at work for a QA Engineer contains but is not limited to:Running bug triage to appropriately prioritize bug fixesEngineering tasksMentoring testersWriting test specs and test cases for deliverablesReporting to partners for transparent coverage detailsExecution of tasks createdRisk assessmentClarifying or expounding on results of testingRegression testing  lessThe company is absolutely terrible. They will say that the position is ""temp to hire"" but it ends up not being that way. They will let people go for performance but honestly that is not the case. If the company you are contracted to gives a raise for some reason they will immediately start analyzing everything you do to look for a reason to get rid of you. They will give you no notice of when your contract will end, they will extend it without asking you, and they are very rude. They treat you like a number not like an employee. DO NOT go to work for Experis. They are absolutely terrible.Overall they got me into a great opportunity and the rest was up to me.  Got me an interview right away a job shortly after.  Even considered going back for better pay long term and new opportunities.I have worked with a lot of agencies and by far Experis is one of the best.  My recruiter checks in with me on a regular basis and addresses any problems or concerns I may have in an efficient manner.  I would recommend Experis to anyone looking to fill temporary roles.Great place to work.  Very professional and the benefits are good for a contractor/consultant position. I would recommend Experis to individuals that are looking for a consulting role.I was contacted twice by a recruiter between May and September of 2015, and accepted a position as an Office 365 concierge ambassador on a contract for 18 months. In December we were called to a meeting and told that there were a low volume of phone calls and everyone had to accept a reduction in our weekly hours, from 40 hours per week to 27.5 hours per week.  Then towards the middle of the month we started noticing people going ""status unknown"" in Skype for business, which we use to communicate. From working with a previous company, ""status unknown"" usually means a person is no longer working with the company. It was confirmed that the company was hiring a large number of new employees while firing older, higher paying technicians. The one and only reason given for termination was and continue to be, performance. Performance based on surveys from sometimes angry clients who are more upset with Microsoft than with the service providers, these surveys are based on a five star rating,  one to three are bottom boxes, four stars are also bottom boxes, I was told by a not so friendly manager,  and five stars are top boxes. If an agent gets a bottom box and the client writes a letter of appreciation to management, it doesn't matter because, ""Strive for the top box guys, that's what keep management happy""Technicians who have been working with Office 365 when it was called BPOS have been fired for not being able to provide the proper support, that's just wrong. Another company did the same thing with many of the same people, get certified people to secure a Microsoft contract,  more... then fire those people and hire less qualified techs to do the work for significantly less. I started in October, and in February I was called by two managers and told that my numbers are down and improving but not fast enough, in the weeks leading up to this, I requested two days off to make funeral arrangements for a relative, my manager told me I can only take one day off, and explained that ""You are not the only agent who has had a relative die.""Manpower/Experis,  no matter how big or small, everyone gets what they deserve, eventually.  lessEvery Monday I would receive a list of new hires from JPMorgan Chase (nationwide; about 100 users per week) and would organize them into an Excel spreadsheet. I would then order software and applications required to perform their job. I learned great data analysis skills as well as organizational skills and time management. My co-workers were always very positive and motivational.Experis Finance has provided a rich variety of work experiences for a consultant in finance and accounting, as well as internal audit. It is a fairly flat organization. They are not at the cutting edge of technology, in that it has to be well-established before adoption for their consultants. Local management is very competent in leading their practice.When I first began working at Experis, my office lost three of its most senior business development managers and its IT director at the same time. They had all left the company after gas prices plummeted and there was a great deal of pressure for production from neglected accounts. Then, the managing director left the company, and there was no leadership whatsoever. A team member who was not at all prepared was pushed into an IT director role without the title or compensation, a new managing director was brought in, and gas prices continued to fall. For a year now, the office has been in a ""transitional stage,"" and without any change in direction or clear and effective leadership, there is an intense pressure to produce at an exceedingly high rate. This company has great vision and all the necessary potential to succeed and grow, but this particular office is lead with the most policy and least principle of any office in which I've had the misfortune of working.I would say its a decent company to start your career or during early phase of your career.This firm has a decent clientele and one can get some diverse experience.I was always treated with great respect and given every opportunity to express any personal issues with a placement and helped professionally by building my skills to advance in my professional career."
752,Exxon Mobil Corporation,"Exxon Mobile was a fun place to work where my job was to manage the store and register all purchases. I also ran the lottery machine, counted cigarettes, and account for closing the cashier. Managers worked well with staff and were accommodating.I really enjoyed with full respect to any job done.  responsibility is a key for successful and awesome part at the work places. I learned any jobs can be done on time if you love your job and each day you will learn more than you expected.  Fair with employees, equal opportunity, payroll on time, safety. respect and love for your co- workers. the hardest part of the job is when you haven't done your job yet. Enjoyable part of the job when working as one team.ExxonMobil is a company that expects it's employees to conduct their business with integrity and the highest degree of ethical consideration. It's policies underline the importance of these values and management is supportive in how these are implemented on a daily basis. As an event planner I had the opportunity to work with a wide range of people, and found working with such smart, considerate, driven people to be very rewarding.Assessed customer needs and responded to questions. Cleaned and 			straightened work area. Issued receipts for purchases and gifts. 				Worked with customer service to resolve issues. Weighed food to 			determine correct pricing. Operated cash register with proficiency. 			Worked overtime shifts during busy periods.Conducted daily pre-shift 			and weekly departmental meetings to ensure organizational efficiency.Receive and process payments by cash, checks, credit card or automatic debit.I have realize that over time, both your or your job can change in terms of the the life cycles of products, natural turnover of people, personal life changes and what not else.It’s essential that you have a decent relationship with your co-workers since you see them so often, and often work side-by-side on daily work duties. The hardest thing about my job is knowing when to stop. I don't think I ever felt there is one recurring part of my job that is the hardest.Its a morning job from 9am-11am, Monday - Friday, I will always instruct you on daily task as long as you are willing to learn fast, and also there'll be short break and we also have health care center for our worker which the bills will be taken care by usVery good compensation and benefits. Culture is cut throat and competitive. Politics is critical to succeed  for all levels of the hierarchy. Backstabbing is a norm. Have not met a person who doesn't know the exact date they can retire with full pension.Enjoyed my co-workers. Always given high priority and challenging jobs. I worked all over the world and had a chance to teach others, sometimes with an interpreter.Always given high remarks on my job performance, daily and yearly.I retired which maybe was a mistake as the company was moving to the Woodlands and I did not want to make the long drive everyday. i learned to get along from people which came from other cultures.I was responsible for planning and prioritizing my work. I learned how to self manage my days work. I felt that management supported me not only in my daily duties, but also when I was designing various tools to assist fellow employees in their jobs. I enjoyed the people that I worked with and still stay in contact with many of them. The hardest part of the job was seeing it move to Texas. The best part of the job was feeling appreciated for the many things that I did.•	Lead carpenter, oversaw day to day operations of the repair facility.•	Preformed repairs, in building and fill all orders for must need services •	Inspected and tested equipment in order to locate damage and worn parts and diagnosed malfunctions •	Read work orders to determine required repairs.•	Monitor process indicators, instruments , gauges, and meters to detect and report any possible problemsI learned and furthered my knowledge of company PNL and how the pricing could effect profit along with how to balance the two as to not lose customers. A typical day involved opening the store by 5:30 in the morning and taking care of news paper inventory, doing daily paper work and balancing of books and product inventory, ensuring cash deposits were properly counted and logged. This company has a wonderful management team and team work between managers of other stores. It is an enjoyable place to work but due to relocation being necessary for our family due to my fiances job it is necessary for a new job to be acquired for me.ExxonMobil is a very strong and well disciplined company. However, it can be political, robotic, slow moving, and stuck in its ways. I was exposed to many different sections, divisions, organizations, and business-lines while I was at ExxonMobil. One of the primary things I noticed was the culture, happiness, and well being of the employees ranged dramatically section to section. Some areas of the company were very good while others were terrible.Another major take away is the ranking system is very political. Your ranking depends more so on how well you are liked by your knowledgeable-others than your technical abilities.The world's largest publicly traded international oil and gas company, providing energy that helps underpin growing economies and improve living standards around the world. The company operates facilities or markets products in most of the world’s countries and explores for oil and natural gas on six continents.I loved working for ExxonMobil. Everyone was driven to succeed. Company was very well structured vertically, change of command was very responsive and listened to employee needs. Not very much red tape due to the leanness of the organization.  Hardest part was the work-life-balance. I was away from home over 75% of the year.ExxonMobil has very detailed plans on how job functions should be performed. The management teams are very well structured and always seem to include people of professional mentality as well as generally good people. Regular internal audits are used to confirm adherence to reporting requirements. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interactions with team members on a daily basis.Majority of the Exxon's are owned by cheap Indians who don't care about their employees safety. They're are no benefits. The customers take their frustration out on employees because of the poor functioning equipment.A typical day at work was enjoying preparing meals for customers.I learned about different blend s of spices different foods and ways to cook.Managers was good.team players.not/any hard part about the job.satisfying the customers making sure there food was prepared properly.I have been with Exxon for over three years, in that time I have worked for two owners and a handful of managers, all have been  great people. We went from super busy to super slow, due to highway construction and and area expansion. I maintained my position that the store could be awesome again, and this week my faith was proven, with the opening of Fuzzys Taco and Golden Chick restaurants in the store.The hardest part of this job, consistent customer service.Some people are great at this job and some don't last two days.Customers are my joy on the job, knowing their families and going through tough times with them.I have been loyal with this company for a year, i have never been late, always clean, stock and aware of store maintenance, I have accepted inventory, learned how to properly file paperwork into the computer and was receiving 38 hours, After months went buy I am the only white, female person working I do not feel comfortable working in this atmosphere. I was also forced shorter hours not even making part-time hours. I live and pay all my own responsibilities and need to find a more stable company to work with.the work environment was a 5 out of 10.  no one took responsibility for their own actions and people were blamed without any cause.  highly uneducated management staff which produced a poor reflection of the Exxon companyFair Management. A lot of hours. Paid overtime. Closed on Holidays.Generally work 8 hours per shift. Only one Co worker. Responsible for customer service, also daily, weekly and monthly paperwork. Weekly inventory. Ordering and receiving product. Stocking, cleaning, pricing."
90,Facebook,"Facebook was an amazing place to intern at. The culture is amazing and the people are amazing as well. It is a high pressure area but you still feel relaxed and able to do the work. I enjoyed every aspect of this job fully. It is such a fast moving environment, if you aren't quick on your feet, you can be left behind.Facebook is a great place to work.  The culture of innovation provides opportunities that many companies cannot.  This is especially true for security professionals.  The only downside is the lack of career path development for security professionals in this organization.Facebook kind of embodies the American Dream.  Once you're there, anyone can become anything they'd like if they really work at it.  Facebook holds high performance/product expectations, but they take care to provide everything you need to get the job done and more...Being a non exempt employee of Tesla Motors Incorporated is good. However, this company has one of the worse issues people have to deal and work with because the leads are not encouraging others for more morale, but instead insuinating their management to doing nothing or doing nothing about talk going on in the inside its very poor in that way. Furthermore, the company's assets going green is a great idea, but the best face the experience that Tesla just might not be a growing company, but a mistake. What do you guys think?-Job growth was extremely limited-Broader impact beyond core role was never recognized-Witnessed performance reviews become highly political as the company grew from 4K to 16K employees -Nevertheless, all was manageable and generally happy until my manager and head of function was forceably replacedThe work place is full of energy, it keeps you on your toes.  The personnel all well experienced and extremely capable.  The management is firm but helpful.  The team really wants to succeed and makes this understood from day 1.  It is also imperative to work together, teamwork is paramount.  Have truly enjoyed my time there and am looking to take what I have learned and accomplished and put it toward new challenges.At Facebook, the culture is a very healthy and stress-free environment. We are expected to complete our share of the work load without being micro managed. Co-workers are allowed to help and collaborate if needed. Some challenges may include making sure clients are satisfied, and that their business is utilizing Facebook to its full potential.Productive and fun workplace, we have restaurant on Campus, I love it. Transportation by Bus , it is great. It makes job very easy. sometimes I continue my work by VPN connection  in the bus on way home and at Home.I do not have anything negative to say about working for Facebook. The people truly cared, they gave me the tools I needed to suceed and there was not a glass ceiling for growth.Working at Facebook was an amazing experience. The culture there was great. The benefits were top tier as well. They fed us three meals a day. Supplied employees with their own personal computers for work.Love the culture, awesome coworkers and great opportunities to grow and learn and expand your career. I had a wonderful experience and made such great connections and friendships.Facebook onsite with PROUnlimited was an excellent opportunity into viewing corporate work life.  It gave an inside view of how larger companies work together to create a product that is end-user driven.  The culture is also top notch as they push to have users experience and attempt new ideas.  They certainly strive to set the bar higher for new entrants and individuals seeking a challenging work place.Don't want to go into too much detail about what happens at one of these offices, but to put it in a nutshell, words almost can't describe how much I appreciate the opportunity to work with this company. It is definitely an experience that I will never forget.The opportunity to network within the company is amazing! They provided me with a monthly amount of advertising money to promote my business for free!This is place is exactly what you would expect from an established Silicon Valley company. The people are smart and helpful, the management is flat, and the atmosphere is amazing.Weird horrible management and no room for growth. Great job to do while figuring out your career! Flexible enough and easy workloadFacebook was a great place to work, I was very disappointed when my contract ended.  The Co-Workers and Managers were awesome, everyone got a long and everyone wanted what is best for the customers.  Helping customers place ads with Facebook was a true learning experience.Do not like working for cognizant, they do not care about employees at all. Management is horrible, they are rude and do not respect employees.It was a great place to work because of the culture. The work becomes routine, and they don't promote much from within. It still tries to function like a startup instead of the tech juggernaut that it is.Was able to learn from a wide array of Chefs from different backgrounds and expand upon my culinary career in a large institutional kitchen setting.   Opportunities to create eight item menus based upon a theme or region and execute your personal menu for a large group of patrons.  It also forced you to be quick on your feet and adapt to changing environment.  For example, if you had a popular dish and it was running low, you had to be prepared to come up with a substitute dish on the fly.  Also very informative to learn how large scale kitchen production works.Great to work for a great company. Hard but you succeed. Great opportunity for growth within the company.

77,"Fanatics, Inc.","Responsible for quality of all product lines rather than a single product, worked with global IT teams, with cross functional teams, and with various business units within the company.*some days are busy, some days are not so busy but there is always work to be done*I have learned so much about myself working there and things I need to improve on* Management is very organized, open-minded (they care about their employees and how they feel)*Co-Workers are very kind, and will go the extra mile for youYou live and breath sports, but at the end of the day I was just a data entry slave. There was no teaching involved, even though they claimed to. The communication was awful and some of the employees would party on the companies dime at vendor conferences. Very unprofessional.A typical day at work consisted of 8-11 hour work shifts. i've learned how to receive, ship, consolidate, pick and return orders. The hardest part of the job is meeting hourly or daily quota. Some days were better than others. The most enjoyable part of the job was the experience I gained and the people that i met."

388,Federal Reserve Bank,"Everyday was chaotic with no such thing as nothing to do, or not enough work for the day. Learned what it means to be professional and how to work in a professional environment. Co-workers where very helpful and would always try even if they didnt have the answersThe Federal Reserve Bank was an enjoyable job to have, incoming calls to sign up for direct deposit was simple. The longest call would be about  minutes roughly, the caller would either give bank account information or sign up for a prepaid card for their benefits to deposit on. Management was reliable and always there to help, there was not a hard part of the job necessarily however there were some people upset that they had to have their check deposited instead of receiving by mail. The most enjoyable part of the job was that you would sit by someone new every day and would get a chance to get to know all people around you.My role is unique in the sense of offerings that are provided to employees through our onsite clinic each day to participating and running projects.  As a nurse manager, I run the onsite clinic and update the providers schedules at multiple locations, manage and supervise direct reports, update departmental policies and procedures as well as administer disability leave management cases for Short-Term Disability, FMLA, LTD and if needed, ADA.Hard to obtain perm job as a consultant.  Management does not understand true value of Project and Program Management beyond IT.I enjoyed working at the Federal Reserve Bank. Great benefits for the employees and promotion within is a priority.The Federal is very diversity oriented.While working at the Federal Reserve I was a Law Enforcement Officer. As a Law Enforcement Officer my duty was to Deter, Detect, and Defend bank employees and property. I worked closely with other officers and reported back to management on daily activities. While working on the entrance posts I developed strong customer service skills, continuously serving employees and guests of the bank.I started my career at the Federal Reserve which developed my discipline to the control of the process...Every action or step was detailed and reviewed at each critical point to ensure all information was 100% correct and concise.  They was no room for errors...The staff was couched and developed to be as successful as they wanted to achieve.Extremely professional environment...All the management was top selected from various colleges from around the country.I very much enjoyed working here. Of course, the security was strict, but I had a great time with my co-workers. There were, of course, many crazy days where the calls were non-stop, but it made the days go by quicker. The management were friendly and courteous - promoted from within.good job, happy to work - great benefits nice people, long day but job offers every other Friday off.organization fair to employees with benefits and compensation.Scoping and driving process improvement, organizational change and functional strategy initiatives across the Corporate Group Organization. Key responsibilities include creation, promotion and execution of an integrated vision/plan for the delivery of relevant information and analytic solutions to business stakeholders, establishing project control monitoring capabilities to highlight key areas of concern and emerging risks associated with the organization's technology portfolio; providing consultative services in shaping business and technology strategies, road maps and implementation plans.I worked in shipping & receiving. Had a lot of interaction with drivers.hard work ,but fun ,some time. We received monies and payed out also. The management team was always there to help with any problems we incurred. the day usually went fast because we were busy.good environment,cafiteria,gym. the benefits were also goodI felt working for the FRBNY was a great experience and I believe having this company on my resume helps with career advancement.Due to the nature of the business, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta was highly regulated. There were many regulations to follow. However, the regulations did not interfere with quality work performance. The most enjoyable part of this job was the interaction with Employee Relations activities. It allowed for creativity and  planning on upcoming events.Great first job, great pay and great management.I worked with entry level programmers like myself.I learned a great deal.The training was wonderful and I made wonderful contacts.The most enjoyable part of the job was the day to day interactions and collaborations with fellow employees. The environment was very productive and energizing.Agile methodology with Sprints. Great company but really busy with integration of new technologies and implementing cloud based infrastructure. Great teamThe culture was not for me. In order to get a proposal or project completed, there had to be numerous sign offs and work had to be flawless. The concentration was on perfection instead of completing quality work in a timely fashion. Some of the projects I was assigned were originally started over 10 years ago, progress stopped 10 years ago, and nobody finished them. I picked up the pieces and completed them...from something that started 10 YEARS AGO and they didn't need to be completed. This is really an up and coming organization.Created use cases/requirements documents, supervised group of BA's to insure tasks where completed on time and on budget.  Lead Production support tasks to insure completion and resolution of enhancements and defects.Management was good to work with and provided support for all employees and contractors.Co-workers were a pleasure to work with.  I enjoyed our development staff and enjoyed working along side our business partners in Parkersburg VA.  The hardest part of the job was not working too many hours.  I tend to enjoy learning the application and often times became a workaholic.The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the team.  I really had an incredible team of development and Quality Assurance.Normally you would go on to find out what your workload was like each day.To work hard and own up to your mistakes.Management tried to work along with each employee to solve daily problems.Everyone tried to work to solve all problems.Resolving accounts at the end of the day.The support you received really made the job worth while.The job ended at the Federal reserve, with the merger of the larger banks.Nothing worth identifying for this employer at this time. This employer has nothing worth identifying at this time or in the future.I would bring up the system and being to monitor files sent by other financial institutions. Once we had all of them we would process them and send them out either electronically or physically to each institution by a strict timeline.I learned everything that I could about the banking industry so that I could advance.Management was great in that they always tried to keep us moving in an upwardly fashion.My co-workers became my extended family after 21 years of working with them.The hardest part was making sure that all files sent were accurate and timely.The most enjoyable part was the friends I had made."
588,FGM Inc,"Overall, very good experience with Government contractingFGM is a great company with amazing people working there. The only reason I left the company is because of my commute."
408,Field Museum,"The company worked well with its staff to make a good working environment. My co-workers assist me anytime I needed them.This was an awesome place to work because I got to work with actual scientific artifacts and digitization equipment. The downfall is there is zero job security.I loved being a steward of the museum. what a great privlidge! A typical day is hanging pictures in an office or locating and fixing a leak in a collections area.Management gave me the freedom to schedule my workdaysmy cohorts were all great!Hadest part of the job is working in a collections environmentmost enjoyable part of the job is all the people I got to deal with day to day.I worked in the Exhibits Department as a maintenance/production Technician.  Each day I worked on several assignments, repairing, maintaining, or cleaning different items or areas in several galleries.  I also helped with staging new temporary exhibits, or de-staging exhibits that are leaving the museum.  I worked with many other skilled co-workers.  I worked on site, or in the woodshop, where I learned many small tool skills, as well as worked with large machine tools.  I used my artistic skills as a painter, in the paint shop.  Very cool to work maintaining the animatronic characters throughout the museum.   Sometimes assignments were very challenging, but this helped me to find creative solutions, and not be afraid of any surprises.  I appreciated working at the Field, as it was an outlet for me to make use all my skills as an artist and woodshop worker, all the time.  The Museum has always been a place of learning and education for all past and future generations, and for me to be a part of this, was very fulfilling.  My only regret is that I left.This was a total educational experience for me.  I learned hands-on about the hospitality industry through catering, equipment, budget analysis and set-up requests.The Museum dedicates itself to teaching people of all ages about science. It is a fun place to work and you gain skills such as teamwork, patience, confidence, and communication. In a usual work day I would arrive early to check in and wait for early campers to be dropped off. I would check in each camper as they arrived and make sure they got to the room they needed to be in. Each week I was assigned to a different classroom as a helper and aid to the campers as they performed science experiments. There would be an outdoor break for lunch that I would supervise and sometimes work handing out snacks. At the end of the day I would make sure each child was picked up by their parent and would wait with the campers whose parents were late. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with all the children and teaching them new things about science. The hardest part was learning a sense of responsibility for so many children at once. Overall it was a wonderful first work experience that taught me many valuable skills I can apply to any jobA typical day working at the Field Museum for me is to work on the museum's main insect collection.  For me this means to identify, sort, and rehouse specimens in preparation for entry into the collection.  I have learned to identify and research the various taxonomic groups that describe insect phylogenies.Scanned items (which need identification),supply register change,assigned breaks and cleared voids.Attended work on time everyday, Liked working with the public,A typical day at work consist of working along side other internsLearned to clean archaic material. Most enjoyable part of the job is the employees.No where else on Earth can you see a 65,000,000 million year old dinosaur right next to a glowing fish or a brand new children's play lab.  This place has something for all people.There are many places to explore, interesting exhibits, fun co- workers. Meeting people from all over the world. The hardest part of the job is Inventory.Observed all exhibits visitors and Premiers, Provider detailed information.In This job people talked more then they worded. they place it all on two or three people. Co Workers talked about and started fights with each other. The Hardest part of this job was getting along with my co workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was Cleaning and staying out of troubleManament was never there to get a review, Coworkers were fun and helpful to customers. wasnt anything hard about the job. My most enjoyable p[art of the job was helping older people and i learned how to be a supervisormoves to slow. other than tht its ok. the people are great. cons have no to be not enough hours. everyday was the same thing. it was liers there just wasnt for meGreat environment if you like interacting with kids and meeting new people from different states and/or countries. Friendly, welcoming and helpful staff. I've always worked with others around me but this job gave me an opportunity to experience on my own So I've learned a great deal of closing out registers on my own, making sure each draw is properly balanced at the end of each day. Hardest part of the job is when traffic is slow. I mostly enjoy interacting with customers, getting to know where they come from, what they are interested in and how I can better assist them."
447,First Data Corporation,"A great company for right out of college. Great stepping stone and learning toolThe company is operated poorly. Employees are treated like an expendable number and if asked without the fear of being fired would agree and then some. The company manages with fear of getting fired.  The health care benefits are TERRIBLE!!!! They lay off people, departments and whole facilities without hesitation nor advance notice.  You have a job today but you will have no idea if you have one next month.Challenge-Find a First Data employee who is not looking for another job. Impossible!!!This place is for people who are workaholics. This place thinks work is more important than family. Working both days on a weekend is a negative when it comes to family. Working five days a week is good and working an extra day should be voluntary. The zipsort department thinks that employees have to work 6 days a week all the time. They don""t ask if employees to work the 6 days a week.Don't take a job at this company. They are constantly transitioning jobs oversees so there is no stability. Director level and above management is completely out of touch with how to create a good culture. The turnover is insane which speaks to the lack of culture and overall issues with the company. The systems are antiquated and there is no desire to fix it. Management's answer is to not fix the systems and to even place tighter deadlines that results in longer hours, and by longer I mean past midnight. Honestly, worse job I have ever had.The job was rewarding to me because at the end of each day I either was apart of a team resolution or I researched and resolved issues.Learned that my way may not always be the best way to handle a task. I always conferences with the agent that perform.the task daily My job was always challenging because each day there are different issues which gave me the opportunity to be involved with many different divisions of finance, credit, and legal areas. I looked forward to my challenges each and everyday because that was my enjoyment. The hardest part of my job was leaving unresolved issues at the end of the dayextremely high turnover of employees. First Data set very high quality requirements of the employees increasing the stress on the employees with no consideration to the amount of changes to job description on a daily forum.They flood the market through multiple avenues. Selling against your own company at every turn. Then they give you no support. Lost 10-20 deals on circumstances where they never even replied to me. If you are a hunter and can learn quickly to become self sufficient, you will have a chance of being successful.Normal as usual routine clock in briefing from supervisor and manager. I learned many things about management for instance  important of human resources in providing tools for  jobs from machineries to manpower and also managing devorsified environment.  I will say that the management in my department is poor for some reasons first unfair rise which led to many leaved and difficult to bring in new employees.My co-workers are such are good people. I like to be around them.Hardest part  of job when we have  5 million pieces of mail to go out at any day that have high volume and we short of staff as now a days. Meeting my co-workers make some jokes.My time at First Data was short lived as my department was moved to Omaha, Nebraska.A days work consisted of reviewing accounts for potential fraud to make sure a persons debit card was not being compromised.My coworkers were a good team.The hardest part of the job was not being able to satisfy every customer and the most enjoyable part of the job was when someone did say thanks and appreciated you for looking out for them.I really love this Job! They work with you on just about any challenge you come in contact with as long as you are performing your job duties. You are recognized for your hard work, overtime, and overall a wonderful company to work for. They work with your school schedule, tuition reimbursement, Ample advancement opportunities. The managers coach you to succeed!I've been at FDC for 3 years and have learned a ton.  For an individual looking for a challenge that will accelerate their career, FDC is the place for you.  The most enjoyable part of my job is my teammates, opportunities to solve problems and drive change.  FDC has a ton of process improvement opportunities and management is making investments to make it better.The pay rate is not competed to other companies. The weekly working hours of associated is fluctuated and going down to  day by day. There is not an opportunity to grow up career path in learning new things , jobs cross-training, to higher position and professional careers.A typical day at work is very productive, there is always something to do...if not technical than administrative.  The environment is team cultivated.  The hardest part of the job is the fact there is no formal training and because the position is so demanding you have to really engage yourself in learning the processes quickly and efficiently. It is a very challenging position.Numbers driven corporate culture that preaches ""Genuine Concern"" for the client but will fire employees who do not hit their quotas regardless of leads generated from primary lead source.  Merchant market is saturated with competition.  Referral partner makes all the difference.  Decent salary, short sighted management, insufficient training, high turnover.Working with multiple banks all over inland empire. Following up and managing staff leads and progress in sales stage. Daily engagement with business owners and their staff to earn business and present business solutions. Closely work with management and staff to acquire business and cross sell more banking products. Being busy is always great, whether it's working on daily reporting or always being in communication with staff and clients.When I worked for First Data it was a great place to work. The benefits were very generous, stock purchase plan, good 401 k plan. The building in Marlborough was State of the art 10 years ago. A lot of the jobs are dependent on contracts with other companies.Days were never dull here, most people were loads of fun to work with, work was interesting enough to keep the job from being boring. management was awesome, my coworkers were fun, the managements did things from time to time to make the days fun and to motivate us all, the hardest part of the job was some of the deadlines that we had to meet to get come claims out. the most enjoyable was just the whole experience of the job.A very short time frame to complete quality work, if work flow is behind we only have a 4 hr window to  complete all work including work that is behind schedule time.The back up flow of work that comes from the day shift due to unseen delays by the system. Hard to maintain the quality of work the company so desires to produce. Very self rewarding at the end of the day with work all completed on time with no mistakes. Management has little knowledge of what it takes to complete all work including work delayed due to unseen delays. I get along with all my co-workers and help where ever I am needed.A typical day at work would be to get 25 fraud cases completed in 1 hour as possible. I enjoyed what my position was but do not make any mistakes. The management frowned dearly on those. You was always documented all of your mistakes. It would have been so much better to learn from them, they never corrected or showed you how to fix mistakes. I enjoyed my co-workers. My Manager never came out of the office.In business for over 35 years and well established in the Credit Card Processing Industry!  The had offices throughout the US and offered relocation packages to all employees.  I was able to travel the Eastern US at least 3 times monthly and able to establish relationships with a lot of well known organizationsI enjoyed working at First Data.  I enjoyed assisting merchants in getting their point of sale terminals up and running.  The atmosphere was great.  Management as always there to offer practical assistance."
105,First Republic Bank,"I would never trade my experience with First Republic Bank. As a junior in college, landing an internship with such a prestigious company was a dream come true. The culture is incredible and although competitive, everyone collaborates to provide the best possible service. Everything is for the clients and First Republic truly takes fantastic care of their clients.Great opportunities to make a lot, great compensation. Leadership can be a bit difficult and sales pushing. The space to move up seems only dependent on your production.fundings HUD Review Draw Docs Review Appraisal and Title Commitment Review Operating Agreement Fund bank account Review Trust Agreement Wish LoansFirst Republic Bank was my first real job since earning the paralegal certificate.  I hit a home run with FRB landing my dream job.  Wonderful job in the Office of General Counsel.  Wonderful co-workers.  Wonderful culture.  Wonderful work/life balance. Awesome FRB employee referral program.If you need a good-paying job and don't mind sitting at a desk all day, this job is just fine. The company, however, asks for stressful scheduling and undervalues most employees.First Republic isn't a bank. Its more like a company that treats you like family. You are not a account number, but a face. Impressively, the banker know not only you, but you family, your dog, and your hobbies.Amazing company ethics, and such a great café. The food was awesome and an amazing price! Management of my particular team didn't really hold people accountable for the job they were doing. Many things flew by the manager. I would definitely  recommend this as a place to get a great start for your career.A typical day at work was preparing lunch for the customers. I learned how to make different foods many ways. The co-workers was very helpful and friendly.Management under pays and expects excellent work from each individual. Broken Promises and bad work life balance. They hire contract workers to do all the work with little pay and tell you they will hire you on as permanent but never get to it. They have a hiring freeze every other month which causes implications with employment. Too much work and not enough help.Lot of opportunities to learn and grow.Management is not easily accessible.More work pressure.Amazing colleagues.Great work culture and Good work life balance.First Republic banks keeps up with newer technologies.Awesome subsidized food cafeteria.Fun work environment with supportive managers. Not all about the numbers rather they focus on how you develop and grow within the company. Colleagues are all educated and fun to work with.

Good management team; listen to your suggestions to make work more efficient.Super fun place to work with.  Everyone always do 110% to achieve whatever is best for the clients which retain high  customer satisfaction.I worked for FRB 6 + years. Terrible management, It is quite disappointing. I love the culture and customer service FRB is carrying however I will never work for them anymore!They have a great executive management team, the office environment was very high end.Be yourself. Have a conservation with the interviewer and a questions and answers meeting.i love my job duties but overwhelmed with emails and other duties. one person can't finish all the work. I can never get out the building on time. No social life with co workers.Employees were friendly, environment was not pushy, while working here I got the chance to be one of the first to work on their new in-house customer data system called FlightPathWorking at FRB is like being a bird in a golden cage.Great place to work if you want to stay at one location and do the same day after day and not move up.I learned a tremendous amount about trust accounts and actively managed accounts.  This position allowed me to analyze investments from many different angles.A great place to work.  The company does a great job of blending culture and work.  The people and culture are amazing and the company really cares about the employee."
39,Fitbit,"Fun office and nice people. Fast paced and exciting. Company is growing and processes aren't always in place. Management is establishing itself and becoming more like a publicly traded company.Great place to work. The people are wonderful. Great Perks. However, management can be a bit stressful. Overall, a great place to work.Not a good cultural fit.  The hardest part of the job are the hours worked.  Expected 24x7 including weekends.  Receive calls as late as 11:45 pm to address last minute needs.Fitbit is a victim of their own success.  They are hiring at it is getting crowded.  The work environment is youthful and vibrant.I absoultely addored working at such a progressive company.  The co-founders are creative, quiet, intelligent,friendly people.  The co-workers are just as amazing.  The hardest part of the job was working there during the national recall of their number one selling product."
41,Fliptop,"Fliptop is an amazing place to work. In a typical day, you collaborate with engineers working on best-in-class cloud scale technology as well as a seasoned sales and product team building partnerships with top brands. I met challenges and gained success through communication and close teamwork with my colleagues.The hardest part of the job for me, because I was having so much fun with the work, was optimizing for a healthy balance with life.I enjoyed most the opportunity to work with and learn from top-tier talent."

Great advancement oportunityGreat people to work with and a good place to aquire technical skills. However, not a lot of options for advancement, and low compensation for the work required.Fluke is a great place to work if you enjoy working long hours and being in a non cutthroat fast paced environment. A lot of training and mindset is around Kaizen practice which is a great tool for other job markets. Advancement is accessible and they also have great benefits as well.Worked with lots of great people who were focused on solving problems, finding timely solutions and still having fun. Working at Fluke gave me the opportunity to wear many hats, use my strengths and improve my weak spots.I left to raise my 4 kids.Its a nice place to work, all colleagues are nice to work with.

259,FM Global,"I would come in and make sure e-mails are answered, filing is down, work on project assigned to make sure to meet dead lines.  I loved coming to work everyday enjoyed working with management and staff! working independently and  solving any problem that would come up.  I am ready for new and exciting chapter to begin.Great company with many opportunities for advancement.  Excellent benefits and competitive pay along with a great employees make this a great place to land.A typical day at work:  Arrive between 7:30 & 8:00 (my start time.)Phones would already be ringing since we are a Global company.  With the type of insurance we handled it was very confidential in nature and we made sure it was kept that way.  When not on the phone  customers would visit our private work area, or offices for an explanation of coverages.  Particularly the people from Europe since they purchase insurance differently in other countrie.. It was a very busy atmosphere.The company has excellent benefits; sick days, vacation days, flex time, 2 personal days, a gym , walking paths, excellent salary, long term disability coverage.  FMG is a big supporter of the United way.  During the fund raising time, they had various fun activThe most enjoyable part of my job was working with my client base.  That I loved. I also worked with great Account Supervisors who were  very knowledgeable of day to day operations and kept things moving.The best part of my job was interacting with people and providing assistance to those new to the U.S.  I simply loved it.The hardest part of the job me was setting objectives for the year and meeting them.  Also difficult was my initial budget exposure, getting reports  from  Finance and  becoming familiar with all the lines on the report.   What I learned:  Our CEO was the best.   Also, being a multi-cultural company I learned so much from the various people I met regarding their cultures and concerns.  I met people from London, Sweden, Australia, and every office where FMG set up location.There is so much I learned  more... it would be impossible to write it all down.But I always refer people to the Company.  lessIt was really nice working therepeople there are very friendlyI learned a lot while working thereCo-Workers are pretty freindlyI enjoy each and every moment Management is very goodThere was no typical day at workGreat place to work for anyone that's a loner and loves the open roadGreat Pay, Great BenefitsExcessive travel near zero office communityGood place to work if you have a background in Engineering and Insurance.  Very relaxed atmosphere with many, many long term employees.  People have spent their whole careers at FM Global.After coming from a larger insurance company, it's amazing to me how FM Global stays in business. The IS management has no real industry skill, and most of them only have their jobs because they've been here forever, ""Tenure over merit"" should be the company motto.There is no emphasis on career or professional development. While HR puts an emphasis on it, in practice managers just sweep it under the carpet, and ignore fundamentals like goal/objective setting, and skill advancement/training.Aside from incompetent management, and lack of career advancement opportunities, the work life balance is pretty good, and the benefits are adequate.Had I known what I was getting in to, I would have never accepted a position here at FM Global, and I would not recommend the company to any of my friends/colleagues.everyone are very supportive and has a lot of learning experience.Flexible to work.Fun to work with FM Global.The business is also really vast and a lot of free to express thought of natureHard to get to firedUnderstaffed and OverworkedManagement promoted due to tenure and not skillsgossip and backstabbing encouraged. Very political atmosphere.If you are looking to advance this is NOT the place for you.Nice vacation package, great benefits, 401k, health insuranceI worked for this company and was very unhappy with the job, the pay and especially the management - who are very sarcastic and treat the employees like overpaid idiots who can't do anything right! They even make up problems and put you in the middle just to prove their point! You try to defend yourself and that seems to make them even more determined to make you look bad! The pay is low and they didn't even give me a pay raise for the last three years that I worked there! They like to justify it by telling you how much they pay for your benefits. Come On! They treat you like a grade school kid by telling you not to be late because the CEO's window, in the Johnston headquarters, is near the entrance and he can see you! Like he even knows who you are!! SPARE ME! I worked there for ten plus years and had to work for the most agravating supervisor in the world. her name sounds like face. SHE WENT OUT OF HER WAY TO DO AND SAY EVERYTHING BAD ABOUT ME IN ORDER TO GET RID OF ME. I was glad to leave there and look for a better job with a good. That was a Big relief!A nice building to work in, but if you are applying with any experience or education it means nothing. People get moved departments due to years of work and are giving job roles with no experience.Most managers have worked their way through the ranks after years of grafting, and by pleasing the right people. The pay is below average, and they value benefits as dollar signs.If you are happy to work in a building with an average age of 40 + who have worked there for 10 - 20 years then this is the place for you.Finally they have bad management who are lacking social skills and people skills, who show presentations of themselves to their department, it is very cringe worthy.A good experience but at the same time it was comfortable but not exciting work. If you want a place to settle down this is that kind of company but if you want to be in a fast paced environment this is not it.Great benefits, nice work environment and job security.  Limited career opportunities for administrative positions.Working with professionals using cutting edge technology.Learned to support every operating system, infrastructure technologies, and client/ server supportGreat management, employee orientedco-workers are a great group of people both professional and personal.Hardest was keeping up with ever changing technologymost enjoyable is learning the latest technologyThis is a great company to work for in terms of benefits and great people, however those in management positions have worked their way up from the very bottom and although they are extremely knowledgeable in the tasks and skills required to get the job done, they fall short in effective management styles that need to be implemented for the success of a total department. Stable company, good benefits and pay, but absolutely terrible management - most managers are horribly unqualified to be in charge of people and take credit for the work of others. Also, too much nepotism and more lateral than vertical movement.I worked for six account managers doing a variety of jobs. I learned the basics of commercial insurance and always improving on my skills. Management was fair and responsive to ideas and ways to do my job more efficient, Co-workers were supportive and fun to work with. I really did not experience any difficult situations or jobs that I could not complete in a timely manner. I enjoyed going to work everyday and working for FM Global was an excellent experience.Small insurance office.  Headquarters are in Mass so little chance for advancement.  Busy work environment.Love the company, great benefits, great co workers lots to learn here at this company and they have been in business for a very long time.The organization is huge and the practices are excellent and work culture is wonderful. I have gained great knowledge from FM Global.Really nice place to workExcellent work cultureNot too big not too small in terms of work forceRelaxed work environment, not all that stressfulFair amount of independence in terms of approach to workMost managers don't micromanage"

740,Forest Laboratories,"The people here are wonderful to work with. I wish the company was a little less old fashioned and would allow telecommuting.Allergan is the result of mergers and acquisitions and as such comes changes and job uncertainty. As with all changes come some good management and some arrogant management, with the latter a reason for good people not to stay. When you hear the peers of the bad manager even criticizes them it make you wonder why they are kept on in the first place.Allergan is a strong company that has always had a great culture.  The work/life balance is good.  The benefits and good, but have been slipping over the last few years.  Following the merger with Actavis, the company has been overly focused on mergers and acquisitions and less concerned about research and growing existing product lines.It's awful to see and hear from others how poor or non existent the culture is at this place.  Management (including Jr/Sr/Executive) is so poor due to the fact the CO only wants to save a buck by putting inexperienced and bewildered people in place just to follow orders like clowns and repeat their superiors like parrots.  It's a good place to stay away from!Good culture with good leadership. Work life balance is not as good. Hard working people with a good compensation package. The opportunity for advancement is good since there are many divisions.The work is very easy an 3rd grader can do it, but the work environment and management is extremely poor. One the worst company's I have ever worked for. If one manager doesn't likes you the rest doesn't either, you never get off at shift end time. The worker's most of them are lazy and they don't do anything about it. They just had two lay offs and the last year and a half if you have standards do not apply for this company. The hiring manager feed you a bunch of lies to make you think it's a great company to only be hired and find out it was all lies!  Only great thing this company has to offer is health insurance.As far as warehouses are concerned, this was a laid back place to work but we also took our jobs very seriously. Management was great and co-workers worked hard.I worked there for over 5 years before the location shut down due to lack of work, combined with other reasons. I really did enjoy the responsibility that the job required.Allergan is a forward thinking company that considers its employees as an asset to its success. Great management teams and benefits. A global technology leader and is on the cutting edge of science and technology. They have great benefits and a strong team environment.selling devices, aesthetics and pharmaceuticals for a top notch fortune 500 leader. innovative and growth pharma on the frontier.  Selling to physicians, hospitals and group purchasing organizations and having the ability to negotiate contracts is a must.  you need to be driven and a leader. Management qualitiesAfter the Actavis merger and Allergan purchase, there was a rapid change in management  ( three managers in three years) that created a very challenging and strange work enviroment.This is review for the Allergan/Actavis (former Forest Laboratory, Inc.):Really fancy, high research culture, very productive and very good managed company. Very good team worked lab with very good relationship between workers and management.Direct following all FDA guidelines (cGMP, GLP).Dedicated to advancing treatment of Eye Disease. Extremely Pofessionalatmosphere, Loyal, Great company culture.Tremendous pipeline, with true advancements/first in class/first ever treatments.Specialty Sales- where Pharma reps are truly consultants.A tyical day at work begins with assessment of what previous shift had done and what is priority at the moment according to management business interest for the day.Team work are highly examplify in the way the process is arranged. No one person can run the process from start to finish. You need one or two people to verify part of the work you have done.The hardest part of the job is that some of the equipment in use is highly complex.Whenever target is met brings moment of celebration. This is my joyous moment.work was stressful long hours with no appreciation for employees hostile management rude and not caring of employees feelings coworkers were pleasant but also alot of drama and favoritism. the hardest part of the job was the lack of respectPleasant society of people to work in a lab.  Would have been nice to have a research facility at the location or access to a gym at the workplace.  In terms of advancement at the Waco location, there were none other than applying for a different position.  I enjoyed working for the company, their flexibility, management, and work environment.The people I work with throughout the US and even globally have been a real pleasure.  People are responsive and it's been a real team effort that's really hard to find these days.My only complaint is that the company is changing rapidly and there's really not a feeling of stability.  The buying and selling of assets is constant and at the highest level everyone else is just a number.  Once you get down to the director level and below it's the greatest of experiences, but the CEO only has corporate interests in mind.You can be relocated and happy you survived the most recent merger and then let go six months later in the next deal of a lifetime.Allergan is an awesome company to work for. You get surprise rewards and days off. Our Sr. Site Director has an open door policy. She listens and is really great. The company is understanding to life events and changes. We have a Monday thru Friday schedule only and get all respected holidays off with pay. You couldn't ask for more than that.Great teamwork environment. manageable travel requirements. Supervisors encourage autonomy.Excellent training for me as a new position in the role of MSL in a new division.Excellent small immediate team with great extensions.Hardest part of the job was back to back conferences is multiple cities.Best part of the job fostered independence with weekly conferences with supervisor.Allergan is a nice company to work for that offers many opportunities with great benefits.  The Orange County campus has amazing talent. Work hours are flexible for most positions.I was given opportunities to learn different trades. I worked with different people. I enjoyed getting to know about different departments. My supervisor was always there if I had any questions and gave positive feedback and constructive criticism.The majority of my career was with Forest Laboratories prior to the Allergan acquisition.  Forest was a family oriented environment where management and employees worked hard and cooperatively to ensure the highest quality work was achieved.  I am proud to say I had a successful 16 year career with this company until the acquisition, which resulted in the elimination of my department as well as all its employees."
246,Forsyth,"Now as a research assistant II, I’m working at Forsyth institute, Cambridge, MA. My responsibilities are mainly including cell culture and Lentivirus infection. I inserted  site-mutations into vectors to get lentivirus and infected to target cells. I did shRNA to silence the target gene. I have been working on cell culture including cell lines and primary cells for many years. I’m familiar with sterilization techniques. I also do western blotting, DNA/RNA isolation, DNA subcloning, and real time PCR as routine tasks.I also work on mice for many years. I do breeding, genotyping and section.A typical day at work started with report . Meeting with  each patient, assessments of each patient, vitals, treatments, medications, dressing changes and all patient care. From there organizing my time to make sure all tasks are completed by the end of my shift. Many times my co-workers and I would help each other to care for patients when needed. The Hardest part of the job was sometimes to give every patient the amount of time with me as I would have liked. I very much enjoy providing quality patient focused care to each and every patient I care for.Wonderful company. Friendly atmosphere. Great opportunites for growth and advancement.Working at FCA seasonally has been a great job and opportunity to go to school, but still have a job during the holidays."
231,Foundation Medicine,"There is a struggle to do well in this environment. You need grit to work here, but it's worth it.A good company to become part of the next generation of cancer research. Foundation Medicine is leading a transformation in cancer care, where each patient’s treatment is informed by a deep understanding of the molecular changes that contribute to their disease."
589,Freddie Mac,"Great place to work. Good culture. Ability to learn new things. Encouraged to move around the company to different departments. Difficult to get promoted or increase earnings if established employee.I work in the IT department and we make up more than half of the company, even though we're a financial institution.  So if you're looking for an IT position, you're in good hands.  One thing that stands out at Freddie Mac is that they are very good at building their employees, not only to do well at their jobs, but outside of the workplace through their wellness rewards program and teleworking option.  I recognize Freddie Mac as one of the leaders in developing their employees through numerous vendor and internal training.  They make all their employees and contractors priority one.I was a contractor so my experience may not be representative of most peoples experiences, but it was by far the most difficult companies to work at. The team of 15 analysts had to squeeze into a small room, working 12-17 hour days, we also involuntarily worked weekends. My manager even went as far as to reprimand some coworkers for asking for time on Sundays to go to church. HORRIBLE experience.As a previous team member the company is doing good work in the REO area to assist homeowners.  The company is aware of how the REO department can impact homeowners and has put some really good programs into place to assist homeowners possibly stay in their home and/or assist the homeowners move to the next phase in their life.•	Worked in the design and development phases of the application using ROR framework.•	Used Rails, AJAX, JSON, CSS and JQUERY to design the front end of the application. Back end of the application is developed mainly using Active Records.•	Created and deployed new features and amend existing features.•	Developed and tested many features in an AGILE environment using Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS JavaScript, Bootstrap, Rspec, and Html.•	Involved in developing and implementation of the web application using Ruby on Rails.•	Coded model level validation using Ruby programming with emphasis in web security.•	Handled caching in Ruby on Rails.Freddie Mac has a great work/life balance.  They promote improvement by providing college reimbursement and health by providing health club reimbursement.  The company's culture is one that attempts to create a close family like environment for  employees by providing monthly events.  They attempt to keep the employees informed by having monthly Townhall meetings and has an open door policy.Management in the Business Rules area of Strategic Delivery demonstrates cronyism on a daily basis.  If you are not one of their 'favorites', they will go out of their way to withhold support and advancement opportunities.  Leadership is poor, at best.  The leadership team understands the technical side of the business but has little to no experience managing people.Big company with lots of opportunities and good work life balance. Lots of training and development opportunities. Easy to move around within company and people are friendly and easy to work with.Good culture. Productive company moving in great directions. Great co-workers, network opportunities.  The learning experience is an asset you carry with you to other career opportunities.Freddie Mac is a secured campus, with five buildings in row that reminds me of a college campus. Cafeteria was delightful and Tysons Corner mall was a five minute ride up the street.While Management is very political and bureaucratic in nature, this company offers employees great opportunities for work-life-balance at a reasonable pay.Freddie Mac is one of the best organizations to work for in the Mortgage / Finance Industry.In the almost 15 years of working at the firm, I have had amazing opportunities to work in multiple divisions within the organization, and be recruited into special projects that impacted the firm at large.  Freddie Mac offers competitive salary and fantastic benefits such as relocation benefits, outstanding healthcare and work life balance work arrangements.Smart motivated people doing good things. One challenge is that the perpetual state of conservatorship makes it harder for the company to align itself with long-term business goals.Scrum meeting daily Work on test case execution Log issues within ALMCo-workers are helpful and knowledgeable to the best of there abilitiesThe most enjoyable part of the job is working with the development teamIt's not a bad company, the issue with the company is its small, and people in positions of leadership do not dedicate enough effort to grow young employees.Clean, productive place to work, enjoyed my co-workers they were the most enjoyable part of the job. However advancement is hard and management is poorly trained.Excellent environment to workI did the PMP certification.The management is great. It was pleasure to work for these people.The co-workers were so knowledgeable, smart, and friendly.Promotes innovative ideas. Very Challenging work environment. The company also company offered ability to utilize my industry expertise and analytical skills.I learned about the single family and multifamily mortgage market and the financing of these different types of mortgages.  Management is very open to change, and co-workers are the brightest I have worked with.  Overall direction of the company is the biggest unknown, as the government is in charge.Good TeamExperienced Business analysts TeamWell formed SIT and UAT Team Best Work CultureFull versed infrastructureIts a very professional environment, and help is always there when needed. Also the new material that is ever provided to has complete instructions on how the work should be done."
213,Fresenius Medical Care,"Busy from the beginning to end of the day administering HD.Typical day at work begins at 630 am, you never know when you will leave. Management tries to retain employees, nice to work forcoworkers are hard working.Hardest part of job is never knowing when you can go home.keep production line running in a efficient way that met all guidelines, help produce product fast and efficiently, as weel as package, box, and stack correctly on palletsDon't get paid enough for the work. To many hours and   Employees aren't treated equally. Don't want to pay enough money for work.askedWages were better than any job I've had in many years of nursing. Hostile and unsafe work environment. Worked sometimes 24 hours/day. Never got lunch breaks. Managers threaten your job if you tried to stand up for yourself and made you work 18-24 hours/day with no breaks. Treated like a piece of garbage.The days are long and shifts are less than ideal, but the work itself isn't too difficult.FMCNA offers excellent benefitsPay is fair, considering high school or equivalent is all that is required for most positions.Co-workers and supervisors are typically pleasant to deal with, But I have never worked for a company that upper management will sit in team meetings and blatantly tell everyone how unappreciated they are, which can be extremely discouraging.worked as consultant. Excellent work environment. Had an excellent opportunity to work and learn a lot from the team. Highly motivated people and valuable mentors.Would not recommend working here, you spend too many hours working and not enough to do your own stuff, you wake up so early and go home really late.if you want to move up this isn't necessarily the place for you but job security is for sure. some clinics are better than others but for the most part each clinic is the same.Upper management are liars, uncaring and only worry about the money and getting their bonus. Clinical managers are treated very poorly expect to treat fellow employees poorly to get them to work long hours for low pay. CCHT's are the backbone of this company but are treated so poorly and under paid. I had a Director of Operations that was two-face, played favorites and took advantage of her position. Do not expect any support of HR when you have been wronged because they stick with upper management and do nothing to support the employees.I learned alot from this place it like a school,  if you are willing to learned they will training you and show you the rope , and get you ready for the job you wantFast paced environment with many job duties. Most of time spent on electronic medical charting. Co-workers not always cooperative with each other or management. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the patients and helping them in their daily life. The hardest part of the job was balancing the amount of work with required meetings and required training. Lots of deadlines for getting work done to present at meetings. Always something new happening requiring new training. High expectations for patient results which are not in anyone's control. Great medical, dental, 401k benefits based on what you choose for your personal needs.Worst place I've ever worked mangement is horrible and they discrminate I would never recommend this job to anyone go somewhere else to work. HorribleYou will never be able to spend time with your family. Never know when you be getting off.Alot of work for one person. Tech work hard but they get the end of the rope,Poor management they have their favorites does not respect the team as a whole does not respect the RN's not enough time to safely and effectively do your job always putting other stuff on you and then want to you to get out on time poor scheduling management does not care about the employees the pay rate is poorer than any other dialysis facility around poor staff turnover always hiring new people and people always leaving does not recognize the people that are valuable to the company and that stay and do more above and beyond anybody else. Nobody gets written up no matter how many times they call in or they are not showing up for work or they are continuously late for work. So the practice continues its a circus.Corporate headquarters  in Waltham is starting to run out of space for employee offices/cubes. Meeting rooms are slowly taken away and replaced with offices for those of the directors level or higher. Employees have the largest cubes I've ever experienced and the building as a whole is beautiful.I've grown so much working with Fresenius in my posting skills and advanced to a Senior PAR cash posting. I have an amazing supervisor and team membersA job experience and very interesting ,I gained lot of things,in conferences they were very helpful and easy to understandpoor management in the clinic as well as poor compensation for employees with longevity with the company. poor management from higher-ups. overall poorly run company as of the past year.I take great pleasure in the  execution of my Phlebotomy duties. I enjoy meeting new patients on a daily basis.  Our conversations are usually very interesting, informative and motivating, this allow me to carryout my duties effectively.   However, I am required to do a lot of driving, which cause me to  incur various expenses, such as car up keep.  Sadly, I am not  reimbursed for these expenses.This place would have been ideal for me if I had better gross motor skills. They train you as a tech before they allow you to perform nursing skills. You need to be able to setup the dialysis machine in less than 5 minutes ( I couldn't) and if you are good at that kind of stuff this is the place for you. Otherwise friendly, helpful atmosphere.I love my job and wish I could clone it for all my friends. I work remotely and have never felt so well supported even in a huge corporate office environment! I am valued and appreciated for my ideas and contributions."
488,Fusion,"Have staffing service representatives that will help you find jobs with your experience. Will offer training when required to get a job that you are interested in.Fusion is always ahead of the curve and on top of their game.  Their facility is run smoothly and professionally.Their many aspects of business including a in-house cadaver bio-skills lab is just one aspect that makes them so unique and a valued asset within the medical industry.It was fantastic working different events for fusion staffing. I enjoyed it a lot and met a lot of really great people! Although the you must be on your feet for many hours, the high pay/hour was very well worth it in my opinion. I loved how you got to choose the events you apply for so that it doesn't mess with your schedule at all.Fusion is awesome. They always have jobs available for you to choose from. I really love working for this company. Very nice and polite staff that are very helpful in assisting you.Low stress atmosphere to work at. Due to the oil and gas slump also a non-productive atmosphere as well. Other than that not a bad place to work, well established and personnel are knowledgeable. Technology is up to date.At Fusion, we’re in the business of connecting customers and online retailers to highly optimized ancillary products in real-time. While many would consider us a marketing technology company, we like to think of ourselves as a people company.Family friendly environment. Heavy focus on work life balance and CSR.Fusion was great when I first started with them. But they changed their managers and staff; after that no one called or communicated with me. As a Consultant that made it difficult.I serve as a key resource to ensure all aspects of the maintenance of numerous scalable and highly available eCommerce system environments are available 24x7x365. On a day to day basis I liaise with vendors, internal clients and partners to resolve problems in a timely mannerWorking here has let me gain high experience in customer service and helping others to chose what is fit for them. Great work environment and always very professional. Always busy and always a good vibe with this company.I loved working their but they dont secure you with a stable job. They are very easy to work for and make it fun to be their. They need yo train people a little more on what they have to do.Fusion was an excellent organization to work for. I gained more confidence with my business skills with meeting with large companies and communicating via email to procure Auction donations. I learned great time management skills with working independently or in a group format along with my resourceful and helpful co-workers.Not being able to help customer with getting health insurance.Co workers were fun and foced employees. Learned to be an active learner .Fusion in Monroe is a busy work place. As  a bus boy it took a lot to prepare tables each time someone would leave as for there was always another group of people waiting to be seated. Other than that it has great management and great cooks.Love trying new things like the taco dinner we had back in November 2013Wasnt a very good enviormenti was the only worker besides the managerOn a typical day at work I answer inbound calls, make outbound calls and value each customer and provide satisfying solutions to their request or issues. Ive learned the importance of customer service from working here. Management and co-workers here are fine.Was a normal day after you left the shop, when you got their it was a day of the unknown.I learned things about wiring houses that the inspectors wanted too see.The person in charge after someone left was not the person for the job as that person knew nothing about wiring or building a house or what it took to do the project at hand.The hardest thing was dealing with the manager that was put in the position.The best part was when we got to leave the shop and the coworkers were fun to work with and we didn't have to deal with management.Great Company, nice people, great bosses and employees. Always something to do. You are able to use your creativity.Very fast paced environment with great full time hours. I've learned very much about anti-aging skincare products and the benefits. Co-workers are a joy to work with. Management is very reasonable. The hardest part of the job is not satisfying every customer. The most enjoyable part of the job is providing exceptional customer service and great skincare advice to amazing customers.Good ambiance .Always different media It's always fun to meet new peopleI was a flight attendant on reserveVaried each day when on Reserve"
619,FutureNet Group,"This is a fine group to work for. The operate with high efficiency on a global scale.They don't hire personal to train.

Thy celebrate every festival which is fun. Also the projects are long term.Very happy to be a part of FNG , a nice place to work , employees are really nice and friendlythe working culture is very professional and organized and niceThe atmosphere here is stifling and oppressive.

584,Gallup,"For my first job right when I turned 16 making two dollars over minimum wage; I was ecstatic about this job.  We made our own work schedule with breaks whenever we decided. I learned how to time managed and it taught me what being accountable for yourself is about.I worked at Gallup for a very short period of time. This was because I had been ill and just recently found out I was pregnant. They have a minimal 20 hours you must meet weekly, but with being ill and doctors appointments, I was unable to meet that requirement and was terminated. Truthfully, my medical absents should have been excused, but clearly was not. I was working as a telephone interviewer, and by outbound calls, spoke to various people about taking a survey. Many said no, due to the fact we were always calling around their dinner times, and I was often cursed at, yelled at, or hung up on. Although these statements are true, my experience at Gallup was not entirely miserable. During my employment there, I learned how to professionally handle complicated situations over the phone and how to maintain an understanding of people's time schedules. The management and other employees were very nice, especially during the training period of this journey. It seemed there was always something going on in the office, other than working. They had games set up that you could earn a spot to, and each hour team were able to win prizes.I got to do the StrengthsFinder and found out that my strengths are- Competition, Strategic, Achiever, Activator and WooWorked part and full time through college earning tuition reimbursement while a full time college athlete and part time employee at Strike Zone and at the Gateway.Gallup has an amazing culture, which allows for a material amount of autonomy in execution.  Their only requirement of employees is the completion of time sheets.  This enables the teams to develop ways to complete work that fits the individual or small team needs very well.It's a fairly straight forward job; you know what is expected of you, you come in and get your work done and leave. The work environment is incredibly positive and encouraging, and there is plenty of room to advance in that career. The cold calling can be difficult at times, and dealing with difficult customers on the phone can be challenging, but in the end, you know what you're doing is going towards something bigger than yourself.You'll love this job if you like struggling to meet quota and talking to rude people all day. The pay is good when you can actually meet quota which is rare unless you're a chick. Nobody wants to pick up their phone and participate in a stupid Gallup poll. The questions are very personal and repetitive. If I got called by Gallup I'd tell them to f*%# offI loved Gallup & the people who worked there, had there been a chance for FT, benefits etc, I'd have stayed there until I retired.You make your own schedule but Gallup doesn't open until 3pm. The training takes three to four weeks. During the training period you get a guaranteed $10.00 an hour.  Once off the training team you can start on banks if youre good enough. Your days consist of mainly taking surveys. You get a half hour break time that wont affect your dial time, any longer than that and you lose some.good flexibility and good pay if you can handle the work.  I had no problems when I had 2 best friends there but one left and one got fired.  same thing day after day week after week really gets the best of you after about a year.Gallup tends to lure most of their applicants in at the beginning: promising you lots of benefits such as health insurance, job security and easy relocation/reestablishment past the contract period, tuition reimbursement, and a high base pay. They also continue when you arrive for training: you are a prestigious member of their company and practically irreplaceable, etc. (their ""group interviews"" and the first night of training is basically sitting through a long propaganda lecture about how great Gallup is). What they neglect to tell you is that is purely a commissions based position (after the training period) and you may struggle to earn minimum wage a lot of the time. They have a lot of confusing methods you have to learn through a brief classroom training period and also as to how you can ""progress"" at this company. I asked the manager about it at the group interview and he pretty much admitted this is basically a dead-end job; the only real way to ""progress"" is by adding more hours on your schedule, but this definitely isn't a career to carry you through life (unless you're impeccably charismatic and persuasive on the phone, in which case you'd be better off being a used car salesman or a real estate agent where the pay is more promising). Obviously with these kinds of jobs there is a high turnover rate, and the kick to that is that they are constantly dealing with the new people and dealing with space decreases as you desperately try and find a place to work everyday (unless you manage to earn a desk, which can be done in 4 weeks at the very SOONEST). You won't be  more... very appreciated, either in this environment or society in general, because you'll be doing cold calling all over the country at the weirdest hours that disturb people - you're basically a telemarketer in their eyes. Be prepared to deal with that. The props I can give are the mostly flexible hours. As long as you work 20 hours/week when you start, you can work anytime as long as you work a full shift on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. Note that your hours here aren't necessarily calculated in time but production units. So yeah, you can begin work at 3pm, maybe not complete as many surveys as anticipated (yeah there's a quota for each survey project), clock out at 11pm and maybe you've only earned less than promised pay. Because if you're not on the dialer, you many as well be slacking off in their minds. If you need some extras and you don't mind struggling through a job, this is good for you. If you prefer stability, a stable work environment, more appreciation, then I'd look elsewhere.  lessThe work environment and people were awesome and the spirit and everyone  was so positive i enjoyed my time working there.i currently work here at Gallup and its a great job but only a great student job or part time job. If youre living on your own taking care of bills and things like that its not the best job. Only reason i say this is because you wont have a set pay itll vary depending on your surveys. Besides that its an okay job i guess.A typical day at work involves greeting my co workers, calling clients and gathering opinions about various topics. I enjoy working with all my coworkers and managers. The hardest thing about my job is making sure I spend adequate time with my respondents and making sure that I stay on task. The best part about my job is the opportunity to speak with a wide variety of people.call and place surveys for the company, nice co-workers, clean environment, flexible with those who are in school. I would not recommend the job to a friend though.I enjoyed my experience with Gallup. I learned and developed customer service skills via telephone while working inside their company.A typical day at Gallup was a blessing or a curse. You never knew how the people you were calling were going to be that day. The hardest part of the job was having to stay on the phone while being cussed out by a complete stranger.Typical is sitting in a small cubicle with an auto dialer . Calling and asking people questions. Management is okay people who work there very nice. Job is extremely boring.  Everything must be read verbatim. Best part is its flexible hours worst part is pay.Did not like working here. The people were rude and cold. There was not a chance for job advancement at any time I worked there. Just awful.Enjoyed coworkers and got along well with management.  The company lunches and frequent traveling team leads that gave insight into upcoming projects kept things interesting.  Weekly Agile design meetings were the best.I would recommend working here.I've been at Gallup for the past couple years. The people are extremely talented and you know what is expected of you when you come to work.Writing and producing a shared vision is an amazingly fulfilling experience.  Talking to an audience one - to - one exhilarates any tired mind.  Some of the characters (co-workers) are interesting (pretentious)."
30,Galvanize,"Great place to learn data science.  The experience is like drinking from a fire hose, so be prepared.  You will learn tons, and most of the time feel like you don't know anything.  Then you have your first interview and realize that you actually know a lot.Typical day at work is relaxed and productive, setting up for events was fun. I learned a lot about how events are run behind the scenes. The management was awesome, very hands off and no micro-managing, super relaxed and made it easy to be motivated. The co-workers are also great; drama-free environment. I love this job!"
36,Gap,"They were very friendly and made the work enviroment great.Working at Gap Inc is a lot fun. I like how it can relaxed one moment then in the next moment it can become competitive. The motivation from my managers to push myself and be aggressive, makes me want to do so much better.Great Company always listening and helping you and treat you with respect Confidently and proactively help resolve issues for customers and balance number of customers in a busy retail environment. Contribute to a constructive work environment by consistently treat all Gap Brans workers and shoppers with respectThe typical day at work, for my position, is fast paced. I learned how to think on my toes and to merchandise in unique ways to sell product to customers. The management team is diverse, with a specific work ethic that all follow. The hardest part of the job is to complete shipment on time. The most enjoyable part is having control of all inventory, knowing what's in and what's out for the store, and talking directly to management about all the exciting things that will happen for the company.I worked for this company at the height of its popularity and found it to be a great place to work.  I would definitely go back to work for them if I wanted to get into retail management again.It was very exciting and fun job. I learned a lot about the retail business and had the ability to apply those skills in my future jobs. Management was poor and there was a lack of communication, but your coworkers were your family and the atmosphere was usually positive.Management gives you the opportunity to grow and get involved in other areas that make up company. I've had the opportunity to do so and I have to say it pays off.good place to work great benefits, peak season are long and tiring with long days and multiple days worked without a day off. Would recommend for hourly employmentGap was a short seasonal job. I absolutely love the atmosphere because it is so lively, but the pay was very low and there was literally only 4 to 8 hour weeks.A typical day at work requires us to sell and know about the products we are selling.You have to learn about the items and know what is best for each customer. Management was organized and wanted to achieve goals as a team. Co worker, were all lovely, fun, energetic and goal oriented. The job was not that hard its just frustrating working on holidays.the people are great very fun for a first job very outgoing people, gets busy during holidays so expect to be always moving, loved where it was located because at lunch or after work you have the court yard or can go shopping in the outlet, and the discount you get is great.I love this place, I love the people. The job is so easy and fun and I enjoy working here. A typical day at work can vary from shipment to fitting room to cashier and its always different and fun. I love my coworkers most of them are very nice and fun to be around. The hardest part is dealing with messy costumers and being on my feet all day.Great place to work with the people that is around you as they help you develop skills. Be prepare to work hard and always greet the customers no matter.Gap is a great place to work. The employees are like a second family and it doesn't even feel like work. I would have stayed for a long time but I moved. Forever missing Gap.Great place to work! Love the company that I have returned to work there again.Everyone there is friendly, and the atmosphere is great. They are willing to work with me on my schedule.The location, I worked at specifically, had an amazing management team and sales associates were just as great. Fast-paced, especially during the holidays, but great environment to be in.Black Friday crazy as always, but things are always better when they are organized. Well staffed and everyone was nice and respectful, even when it got late.I worked at Gap for about a year. I gained a lot of experience in customer service and sales skills. Management was great and they worked with my high school schedule.Orderfilling is great easy and fun, fast pace good school hours for working and if you are going to school. Health insurance is great!Fast paced work for large corporation. If you like big box stores, give them a try. Hard to adjust to the crazy holiday hours.It is a stable work environment with many opportunities. A great first job for anyone new to the workforce. Lots of hours and room for internal advancement."
313,Gartner,"The company is headquartered in Stamford, CT, with many domestic and international office locations.Gartner specializes in research, advice, and consulting for CIOs, IT leaders, and technical professionals.The work environment is rigorous and challenging.There are work opportunities in research, sales, and events, among others.The culture is relaxed and friendly, lots of flexibility, some people come in really early and leave early, some come in late and leave later. This div. is run by the EVP of Marketing and she has created a working environment based on the belief that we will get our work done without being controlled or lorded over. In the end it makes for happier employees who achieve big results, accomplishing more than some of the…Culture of a frat house. Lots of favoritism shown towards certain employees. Great learning experience, as you are taught and provided with extremely beneficial feedback. Very forward-looking company.Gartner provides an excellent work life balance.  If you are driven to move up you control your own destiny.  Hard work is acknowledged.Great waterside location. Bad traffic in Stamford, CT.A bit hard to advance as they bring in talent from outside. Very smart people everywhere, hard working, but short hours. At 5:30 everyone is gone except for a few who don't want to leave.Excellent corporate culture and benefits. Challenging environment but opportunities to meet with the brightest IT experts and with interesting and important customers.There is a chance for great camaraderie if you're in the right group. The company is respected in its field and looks great on paper. The team I was in was a well oiled machine until a new manager came in and changed everything, now they are just limping along and all looking to get out (or for the older ones, make it to retirement under the radar). Nice cafeteria. Train shuttle. Nice campus on the water.Great company to start your sales career, they have an amazing training program. This is not your traditional sales job, you will be required to stay up to date to the changes in IT and the industries you cover. You will notice the organization will provide you will a lot of training and resources to be successful in your role. If you're not able to get the flow within the 1st 90 days you will be re-trained and given up to a year to perform or at least have the right mindset. The typical sales cycle last about 2 months if you're doing the right things, you have to be really consultative in selling a username and password. Aligning the problem your're trying to solve to the resources that Gartner provides it's clients. The most enjoyable part of working at Gartner are the smart and responsbile people you work with, everyone seems to be excited to work there. Especially at the End of a Quarter and the EOY. Great company, but a lot of growing pain like weak territories. you are strongly at the will of the accounts you're put into - mainly Healthcare and Financial Verticals make the most money at Gartner! so fight for that or a High Tech role! in SMBField Sales - everything is the same - you are at the will of the economyDepending on the office you work at, freedom around time management and creativity serving business activities can be really pleasant.Fair work-life balance, many truly amazing co-workerThe company has been turning more and more into a corporate ""execute only"" place over timeGartner is a wonderful company to work for.  There is a good work/life balance and the people are wonderful!  My manager was wonderful.  The team was great and super collaborative.  The deadlines are tight but the work gets done.The company is great to work for. Some amazing caliber folks, some not. The work life balance if you have the right manager is great. Mobile work force but depending on your manager, can be micromanaged. Policies aren't set across the board and there's a lot of room for manager's discretion. I had a great manager for a number of years and then another one that I struggled with.This company has so much potential.  The business units are good with the Great Managers, but are a horrible place to work if you have a bad Manager.  Expected to take work home, they do not value Life/Work Balance.You are fresh out of college and have no idea of what professionalism looks like. The recruiters at this company are the best sales people. The career advancement opportunities are minimal at best and picked purely off of popularity and not performace. It is only an inside sales company, there are not any outside sales positions available in the SMB market.Gartner is a fun company that is very youth driven. You will get to work with exciting technology companies and your opportunity for advancement can be realized rather quickly if you are close to the right people. That being said, several people who are not necessarily qualified to be in management get promoted. Having a good manager will make or break your career at Gartner. The only other major drawback is having to move to Fort Myers, Florida.Gartner is one of those companies that people strive for, everyone seems to want to work there. However, they are not very employee friendly. I saw multiple friends get fired without warning and without reason, especially on the sales side. Very little room for growth or advancement if you want to do anything other than sales.Gartner hires people slowly and promotes quickly putting less than best people into management.  However, they have a great environment for people right out of college.Great place for a new grad to learn sales and corp culture.  Lots of great leaders and opportunities to grow.  They have a cafeteria, gym, and other attractive perks for their employees.  Call center sales atmosphere.surrounded by smart and fun people.coworkers are supportive.salary and benefits are ok.tough to grow up in the organization unless you have good contacts.Great brand name and respected company among customers and competitors.  Good work/life balance in most cases, there is a lot to do but freedom in scheduling the work.If you are looking to begin a career in sales or technology, go for it. Just know the environment can be a bit overwhelming if you are a loner or independently driven. They have a heavy ""everyone in"" collaborative work environment which is good for some not for all. Finally, Fort Myers is a city best suitable for my grandma to retire from teaching. Very slow town so be cautious.A typical day at work would consist of me going into the office at 8am. I would unpack my company laptop at my desk and the start working on projects that I have been assigned for the associates that our team of Computer Financial Consultants manages. That includes getting information on clients, putting in data to salesforce, Excel spreadsheets, emials, and personal projects for the associates, ect. I also manage all the associates expenses . Which I make a report and find receipts which they send and send it to FL where the main headquarters is . I make travel arrangements for the associates daily. Car service arrangements too. Keep a filing system. Also a inventory system for the office. I fax and copy all important documents. I pick up most important phone calls from clients and associates as well."

736,GE Power,"As being in a US company, ive seen through out the years how they establish a working space and culture that helps you interact with other people and everyone is willing to help no matter where they are or what they do, also it is so amazing how well structured the company is and how that simplify a lot of thingsToo many layers of management. Challenging to make changes. Great people to work with. A caring group that is very supportive.There was a corporate take over of Alstom Power by GE. As with all take overs, it adversely affected moral. Everyone had to re-apply for their own jobs, or an alternate job. Many were required to relocate. Some were laid off with benefits packages, and some were just fired.GE Power is a typical large company.  There is a large corporate culture that must be assimilated, and then you must learn to navigate the corporate politics.Typical day involves engagement on global projects and working with multi-cultural teams to achieve project milestones for shipment, installation, commissioning and handover to customer.It's a great place to work. You learn to deal and work as a team with Manufacturing, Planning and Engineering. There is a great environment to work. And you would need to do a lot of cross-functional activities to get the job done.productive, team work, interesting projects, benefits, supportive management and co-workers, learning culture, good tools and design methods, continues process improvement.Company is constantly going through changes,not impactful changes, with each regime of managers is the worst as before.Challenging work with a unique culture.  Solid teamwork with solid work-life balance. Going through some significant organizational changes due to a major acquiition.Good people to work with, executive team lacking vision.  Closing the GE Power Conversion Pittsburgh facility.  Jobs moving to Berlin, Germany.G.E. is a fast paced company .  They make important decisions quickly instead of holding multiple meetings and countless power points.I enjoy coming to work everyday and working on engines. management is on your back pushing to meet needs making you feel uncomfortable. co- workers are great, very flexable work schedule.I don't have much negative to say, I love to work here. The people are kind and like any place there are bad days but the job security is good and the company is making many good changes.My schedule was a bit unknown at times as I had to respond to emergency calls. I am nuclear certified, and take pride in my work. The Job description classified me as a Field Service Representative but I was considered a Hybrid. The position that I applied for was a Field Service Representative for Mobile site operations and data analysis. I was transitioned into the Beverage side and spent several weeks away from home. I have a Wife and 3 young kids so time away from home can be difficult on the home front. The up side to travel is that I'm use to it and can easily adapt if needed.I loved working there unfortunately they are closing boss where good benefits are great people are great just cant move to CanadaGE invested in our company and then later bought the company.  Our initial team was assimilated into the GE system which was, at times, challenging.  GE has a lot of rules, procedures, and GE speak that took some time to get used to.  I appreciated the challenges, however in running such a huge corporation.  Do you teach all of your employees Six Sigma, or only a certain group?The GE management team was tough but always fair.Since 11/02/2015, Alstom Power became part of GE.  With this alliance, the new GE power segment is now GE Power.   Overall, I think that it has been a good transition.  Now I'm just learning about this new company.There is always work, and the co-workers are friendly. The hardest part of the job is getting used to moving the heavy tanks from one place to another without a hand truck. Once you're used to it, it becomes really easy. The place is very safety oriented, and the workers are very helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you reach the end of the shift, and realize how much you were able to accomplish within 8 hours.Was allowed to work with great people from home.  There was a lot of different day to day task.  Customer and sales reps were very good to work with.Big company operating in nich market areas, with overall good market share, and stable balance sheet. Eight layers of management with 300000+ , however it still keeps buying out its competitors. Values experience but does not have a good system to measure it. Dominated by few groups like Aviation, Pratt Whitney, Rolls Royce, university alumni and other groups. Offers a good starting salary but later average 1-2% yearly increase. Healthcare benefits require 3000$ out of pocket before they start. Monthly health insurance payments are high. One has to carry a long list of approved prescription list to their doctor or risk paying the unauthorized prescription .Has 401K but it is limited to company stock and investment options.May be a good place for starters but not very good for mid career professionals.Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
380,GE Transportation,"The main project of this contract position was to upgrade the main fuel pump and after-burner system of the J85 Turbo Engine.Typical day was re-design and testing different prototypes. Some calculations verified strength and stress of the new parts still could meet the specifications or meet higher specifications.I learned from applying, installing the actual systems, making changes and advancing the system. All these actions were informative to me. Management was friendly and professional.The same with co-workers.The job culture was professional.The typical work day for an employee is 10-11 hours. If you put in your 8 hours and then leave, you're a ""lazy"" employee. It's a high-stress environment every day. Managers are very good at committing to unreasonable goals and tasks - especially because all they have to do is commit and not actually follow through with them. There is no work-life balance - no matter what they try to tell you when they hire you on. They do invest a lot of time and money to train employees and teach them all they need to know. To me, this doesn't compensate for all of the other negatives of this company.Many opportunities in a wide range of fields.  Good work life balance.  Job security is average to low.  Most of the people are good to work with. Mangement focus can be a little bit short term. Compensation is good. Vacation policy is good.This reviewer worked as a temp and due to a labor depute was not retained. I was however offered a position later that due to health issues at the time i was not able to take. Management seemed very open to work with me when I had a family emergency arise even though I was just a temp. I loved the work and the guys i worked with were more than willing to help with training of new skills or fine tuning of existing skills, even offering to skip breaks just to help out. If a position becomes available again i would be more than happy to go back.Review our daily work schedule and began the work that has to be done. I work 10 hours shifts and over time if need. I follow all the safety sheets for what ever project we are working on at the time. The most enjoyable time of the day is when we get new contracts for Train parts.I enjoyed my job for most of my career. Maintenance on the machines could be a lot better. Management personnel being hired regardless of experience in a manufacturing environment.the staff was great to work with, the employees were very helpful in teachingI learned a lot about locomotivesmanager was wonderful, very knowledgeablemost enjoyable was the people I worked withi gave my job everything i had, and I was still laid off. Not much else to say. this company only cares about its CEOs and forgets about the employees that made it what it is todayFlexible Work hoursGood Work cultureFriendly environmentNew Challenges everydayEngaging environmentToo many meetings thoughvery poor management, harassment that the H.R. dept could not do anything about for 10 years after numerous complaints.challenging function to be a part of but you will learn a lot. managers set a fast pace and expect stretch goals to be met on timeGe has a reputation for the past 100 years building the best locomotives in the world.  The company offers good pay and benefitsGE Transportation holds value in diversity, teamwork, efficiency, timeliness, and productivity. As this is my first career opportunity, I have proven to fit well within GE's standards.was a growing business so l didn't really expect the best. things weren't moving in most of the time. was just there to built skills and resumeNice people to work with, safe work areas, job was not too hard, was a good job to have overall, proper equipment was supplied to get job doneGood work life balance. Great family based company that takes care of their employees.Was a pleasure working at this company.This is a large company but individuals have high visibility and ownership. Work life balance is pretty good but can depend on the manager. It's important to be able to be able to sell your opinion because every organization is very metric driven and they do not always line up with each other. There is a lot of potential for moving around the company and work in various teams. If yo do well at your job you will be rewarded and move up through the ranks.Productive and fun place to work. Not much of learning opportunities.Work life balance is good. Management is supportive.I only had a shadowing experience here, so I am unsure of the payroll or the benefits that the job requires. But the employees here were extremely friendly and helpful. I liked seeing different people, and interacting with new faces.Your standard large company, where employees are just numbers and are thrown out like the trash at a moments notice. Only to be called back later to repeat the process again.nothing to say much about my current company because i am looking for a change to design and implement something new to make some wonders."
546,"GeneDx, Inc","Wired department, middle management stuffs have less responsibility. Push employees into a corner then tell them I only want you success. Great training though. Lower paid and overtime no compensation."
24,Genentech,"Like any big company there are pros and cons, compensation is great, management is not, micromanaging from RocheI have dearly enjoyed every day at Genentech, and I would do it all over again. I have learned so much and it has really helped me to grow personally and professionally in ways that wouldn't have been possible anywhere else. There is a lot of hard work and tough problems, but working here has given the the confidence to plow through what looks impossible, and take my cues from other people that I respect and admire.  The most enjoyable part is the high quality of people; the education, experiences and skills.The company has phenomenal culture, cares for employees overall  and an outstanding benefits as long as you have a good manager, sometimes, you might get a bad one, but those are very few.A typical at day work supporting the manufacturing floor and providing support to upper management. Coworker’s very friendly and hard working. Most of the management team was friendly and easy to work with. The hardest part of my job was supporting two manufacturing buildings.  The enjoyable part of my job was traveling with some of my colleagues.Genentech is an example of effective entrepreneurial initiative to create a wonderful company.  The pipeline is ample within the oncology marketplace, but limited on other therapeutic categories.Genentech has a rich culture that inspires workers to achieve their career goals and give back to the community.There is great support to grow your career and receive feedback for positive growth.Everyday is a new learning challenge.  No day is alike.  I've learned to utilize applications and systems and also becoming for technical.The employees are amazing.  Everyone is willing to assist in any way.  The resources provided are very helpful and they thrive for career growth.make rounds with partner to other buildings to check levels of supplies and glassware as well as labware.  bring soiled labware and glassware back to our lab to clean/ sterilize and bake before delivering it back out.> Roche/Genentech is a heavy data driven culture.> Focus on results through collaboration (team heavy).  > Management focus on not just the results by how we achieve them (process definition).I worked for GNE for a total of 3 years as a Case Manager and later as a Foundation Specialist. I worked in the Access Solutions department doing reimbursment services as a case manager. This  consisited of relaying insurance benefits to patients and doctor's offices and referring patient's organizations that can provide co-pay assistance for particular specialty medications. As a foundation specialist, I provided free medication for those who met our criteria. Management there are very flexible and do not micro manage. These roles are very team oreinted, everyone I worked with were very friendly.I love working in genentech however the lack of growing or room for growth I shall say isn't as easy. It is very competitive and within some departments there are favoritism. Once one is a contractor its hard to get out of the contractor poll. The company does this because they would like to save as far as FTE count.Acumed has some really skilled machinist and they make some of the best orthopedic implant parts I have ever seen. The machinery is great and the operations are nice.Genentech is a great place to work! There are always opportunities to move up or move on within the company. They do a great job of training up their employees and giving them all the information necessary to do the job.A great place to work and offers a wide variety to opportunities for full time employees. Since Genentech is a brand name of Roche Inc, there a frequent need for domestic and international travel.High level of work load with short deadlines, with that being said , it is difficult to get a hold of people. Typical day is on the run from start to finish. People are nice and work is interesting, but workload is over whelming.Great place to work at. Benefits are great. Management needs work. They offer many incentives. You will move up fast in the company as long as you know the right people.This is a fun environment. We are all team players. I have learned many programs. It is great job security. The hardest part of my job is billing and having so many days to complete it.Genentech is a GMP environment so it is very important that while at work we do everything correctly and to standards, it is also important because we make medicine for extremely important patients.  The company also takes care of its employees they believe in a work life balance and make sure we have fun when we can while at work as well as have team building events, family is also very important.  Managers help out in any way possible and will also sit down and have lunch with you, they treat you as equals.  Everyone I work with are encouraging and helpful.  The benefits are amazing and the scheudle is also a great schedule.With this job, you need to be really flexible.  The work hours are in shifts.  You rotate with your Co-Teachers.  At times, you may need to switch shifts with another Co-Teacher.  This is something that everyone should be aware of when they apply for a job here.An excellent work life balance culture. The compensation and benefits are great. Genentech takes care of its own and as a company, strives to put out the best in putting patients first.Great place to work.  Work life balance is felt.   It feels good knowing what you do makes a difference.  I think the company puts it's people first and this is a good feeling as well."
785,General Atomics,"The biggest issue was co-workers.  They spent a great deal of time talking about their perspective on politics and religion.  The F-bombs fell like rain.  I believe that this is because nearly all of them came from the shipyards.It is a great work place with challenging project and scientific work. Staff members and coworkers  are well qualified and do exemplary work. We solve and advance new technologies and top management encourage employees to advance their career. I learnt a lot about advanced engineering concepts for next generation application and project management activities dealing with technology, finances and cost distribution. coworkers work in small teams and share their knowledge and skills with others. Seminars and training sessions greatly helped me to be more productive. The hardest part of the job is to keep marching forward and apply technologies to commonplace use.The most enjoyable part of the job is the blend of  challenging and unique technical work and the ""Country Club"" ambience to remain stress free, physically fit and be pleasant always.It depends on which department, but the leadership is so lacking, it is sometimes non existent. The great thing is that it is true: you will find a lot of people who share your thoughts and they make the job fun, and will also become great friends. This is a company with cutting edge technology for the marketplace, but the systems, leadership, compensation, benefits, and advancement, are something from the 1960's.This job required a rotation schedule from stateside to overseas, while stateside a typical day was focused on research, development, and testing, staying proficient on current systems and any updates and staying deployment ready. While deployed we had an alternating schedule where every other day we either worked, managed, or produce products at the ground station or while flying. Co-workers had great camaraderie and pulled together to accomplish tasks. Hardest part was being away from family during deployments but understood the nature of the job and mission objectives and what was needed to accomplish those tasks. Best part was working with great like minded individuals.Patrolled facility and parameters to ensure doors, gates were secure. Responded to any security based inquiries and all alarms and emergencies Monitor access to the facility by means of screening personnel and  visitors. Issued ID badges. Monitor and enforce parking regulations. Maintained  security logs  and wrote reports on unusual events.Was available to work all 3 different shifts and have worked all security posts.  I have worked with all kinds of people from different ethnic backgrounds and worked independently and also in a team setting.This company had been amazing since I've started there they have a great schedule, offer the best benefits I've had and the company is still growing so there is a lot of room to grow within the company they also offer great training opportunities.Typical start of a job with much that wasn't explained during the interview process.  Style was to be put before the vice president with results without direction for those results from middle management.However well you negotiate entry salary will make or break your stay, don't ever give salary raises. They only way to advance is to leave and come packCompensation is ok but has changed a lot from when i first started working for the company back in 2008. The percent boost for deployment went down from 95% to 80% when i was let go due to our military contract ending.I loved working at GA, although contract employees are only allowed to work 1 year as a contractor (management will not hire an additional FTE recruiter, so my contract is ending after 1 year).GA / EMS is a decent place to work. Takes a while to get access to everything you need, but once you get going, you'll be pushed to the limit. Stress is high here. Pay is good and you'll use the top technical equipment.Lot of really smart people.  Some interesting work.  At the forefront of UAVs.  Management cannot get out of each others way though.The EMS organization is extremely fractured, does not follow process, poor training, promote unqualified individuals to become leads.  There is a lot of sabotage from leads, do not take responsibility for their mistakes.  Emotionally managed, not strategically managed.I learned a lot here. I did two software engineering internships over the later two summers at GA ASI. I would recommend this company to anybody looking to learn and grow their skills.* Like to work here at G.A. specially with Fusion group. live and work balance, not too pressure. * Great working environment with friendly and support co-worker * Like the campus here with Tennis, Swimming Pool, Volleyball, basketball, gym, ect...I enjoyed my job when everything was flowing pretty good, and everyone got along. My Supervisor relocated to another area, and then another Supervisor took his place. Everything was fine until an extreme change was made with yet another Supervisor which said from the very beginning that, ""she"" was not going to change anything because it looked like everything was flowing nicely already....Well, that was not something promised and from that point forward, everything in our department was being changed and turned upside down. Nothing was ever the same as before ""she"" took over and completely uprooted our happy free flowing work routine. Nobody in our department was happy or accepting of the chaos that ""she"" created and things went downhill from there.Great people and I learned a great deal there. A lack of fun equipment to work with. I got to work in Iraq with a great people. I had a blast there.Working hours can vary, especially if you are sent to a work site for a certain period of time (usually 3-4 Months).This is a great place to work if you are single and want to travel. The traveling can be challenging if you want to stop and take a breath. Management is quite understanding, and they rarely fire anyone, which is a good thing, for the most part. They also listen to requests, if you need a break from traveling.My Co-workers were the best part of the job. You meet people from all over the world and work together. This job really makes you a part of a team, and through that, I've formed strong bonds with people that I still keep in touch with.The hardest part of the job is being away from family, missing holidays, and not actually enjoying life. The pay makes up for a lot of this but it does affect you mentally over time.The most enjoyable part of my job was traveling with co-workers that I had previously worked with. It made my job much more enjoyable and even on off-time, we had a great time.Maintaining a comfortable atmosphere for the customers, with various types of building controls, maintaining many different types of units, package units, heat pumps, split systems, chillers , vav's, boilers, pumps, motors, ice machines, kitchen equipment etc.My typical day was being the first Engineering Tech. there to help out at 5:00am (all other Engineers didn't' start till 8:00am) help set up  test fixtures and run production testing by setting up data acquisition equipment. After helping break down test fixtures i would extract data and take it to my office to make graphs and spread sheets using Microsoft excel for DCMA (Defense Contract Management agency) My favorite part of my job was having down time. i utilized that time to learn new jobs and experience in other departments. I am always looking forward to learning new things! All co-workers are all fun and easy to get along with.Good people to work around; Challenging work environment. Company expanding very rapidly. I enjoyed coming to work daily because we never knew what was going to take place. As the addenda changed daily, my staff reacted without complaining and shifted priorities with fluidity. Being in a manufacturing / engineering environment, the processes required quick decisions and implementation."
599,General Dynamics IT,"* Typical day is extremely busy.* What I learned is that there are good people that want to do a good job.  * The hardest part of the job is there is not enough time in the day to do everything you want to do.* There are good people that really care and want to help you; then there are others.I liked it. Ovetime is offered. You have good benefits, pay raise when you work the weekends and nights. it is fulltime Employment. And im diabetic and i go som a room to take my medication.contract job only, well ran stayed busy.  good management and good benefits. couldn't keep enough contracts to stay busy though.  ended up letting staff go with no work.Present Pilot Workforce/ Insurance Specialist 	• Answer phone calls relating to state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Marketplace • Enter caller information into application database for processing• Research any issues that may arise and escalate or transfer to appropriate group as neededOverall, this is not a forever type of job. It is more of a job that you take to pay the bills untill something better comes along or you actually start you ideal career. I enjoy working with different people daily ranging from young to old, disabled, etc. I just love the fact I can help at least one person everyday at work; even if that means being the bearer of bad news. I liked the challenges the work brought. I'm up for changes as long as it is delivered in a manner that doesn't cause chaos in the workplace and it seemed like GDIT did a terrible job of presenting changes...very unorganized. The good employees are overshadowed by the bad ones.I enjoyed having my breaks there. very relaxingnice environment to work at as well. everyone is very friendly especially my supervisor sheila.. very professional as wellFun, positive environment, Always ways to learn new things. The company always provide coaching to help employees improve and that's what I loved about being a customer service representative at general dynamicsGreat work place to work, great pay, warm environment, very easy to get the work, wonderful hours, I love helping customers, to know I'm doing something great for the communityAdvancement with GD is difficult in the contracting arena because you are billable to the customer the company often doesn't want you to change positions.I loved the job and pay. And it has a set work schedule. Offers loads of overtime. If you choose to work here you can pick part time or full time and you will get exactly those hours. Training was very easy as well.The lack of professionalism throughout this particular site can be witnessed on a daily basis. There are limitations to the amount help agents can offer the callers. The company promoted from within, witch is a good policy.I loved being able to make a difference in a person day, especially the elderly and children who really depended on me!! i learned a great deal about patience with this employer!!Laid back usually.I learned a lot from older workers. Management was good. The hardest part was waiting for all safety to be checked to start work. The most enjoyable part was getting off work.A great place to grow and expand your knowledge. You can go far in the company and you're always learning new skills. They care about their employees and are very professional. Extremely kind managers that are willing to help.i recieved phone calls with angry and happy consumers i also leared learned how to use diffrent programs and be patient with calls i recieved despite the attitudes given.I stayed stressed out the whole time I was employed with the company most people there was friendly its just you had to deal with a lot of stressful things with the consumersjob started out with a two week training course which went way too fast but ended up being ok. the real stress started when i was thrown on the phones without any real training of a very confusing software database for healthcare consumers.Hi stress and confusing scripts, poorly designed software and hard to navigate. if you like to work in a challenging environment, where all my supervisor was concerned about was her numbers and ranking for her team. you stay on a call too long, its counted against you, clock out late, counted against you, only 2 short breaks and a 30 minute lunch. i felt too confined to my desk, felt bad for going to bathroom because it would be counted against adherence. the benefits are good although i never got a chance to use them. i got sick and missed three days and went over my allowed days. i would still be there had i not got ill. i miss the money but not the job.i enjoyed this helping people with their healthcare needs but also had many calls from frustrated consumers who were unhappy with there health insuranceAll we did in this job was answer calls of costumers asking us for more information about helots insurance we help them apply for insurances and fin the one that next fits their income I really liked how we had to socialize with people I live helping people so I think that's why I liked my jobGreat people and nice policies. I had very good experiences at GD. The military people are great to work with and appreciate things you do! Very good place to work!Positive environment, learning place, and wonderful co-workers. There is a lot of flexibility and everyone is very understanding. If you want to exceed expectations you need to ask and out in the effort to get there.Great entry level company for beginners looking for IT positions or supply chain warehouse jobs. Excellent healthcare benefits and flexible work hours."
560,General Dynamics Mission Systems,"Learned a lot while employed with GDMS. Was able to cross train in all departments. No room for advancement At this time in a different department that I haven't already worked in.In the beginning, this was a great place to work. Personal growth and advancement were encouraged. Pay was a little lower than the competition, but security was better than the competition, so it worked out. Today, pay is still a little low, and there have been several cuts in the benefits. Work hours vary greatly from position to position. I honestly enjoy my job, but work hours as a salaried employee can be ridiculous. Middle management seems to normally care about what is happening with the employee and will help you to grow. Senior management within Mission Systems varies, but is usually appears to understand the project and includes several technical people. It will be interesting to see how the upcoming election changes the workplace. Overall, I still recommend this company as a workplace.General Dynamics is like any other major defense contractor when it comes to employees and cutting the profits. Employees rank last middle management a little higher and Corporate taking the biggest cut of the pie. GD was the first large defense contractor that I worked for and in order to substantiate their bloated corporate profit the employees were offered expensive substandard insurance options. The stress to produce was constantly in motion and the stress level was out of this world. I saw literally a 100 percent turn over in the year that I worked for them. Prior to being laid off the stress got so bad that I came within an inch of walking away and forgetting that I ever worked for them. If the employee didn't kiss butt to the customer they were gone in a heartbeat.The company went down hill much in five years. Management likes to pretend that they are still in the military, ignore rules, lie to workers, hire friends, blame others for bad decisions.Many middle age workers have a GD pension, a military pension, a 401k and soon will draw Social Security, and often like to talk about how much they have saved and the great plans they have. The younger workers get a 401k and have to listen to how much better the others have it, and have to accept that they will not be able to afford to retire.Management only looks out for itselfOpen door policy does not workPay is goodBenefits are fairExpense reports get processed quicklySuccessfully ignores all of Colin Powell Leadership GuidanceGreat management and benefits. Flexible work hours, tough objectives and talented personnel made the job an amazing experience.Daily work is good with some long hours as working with the government brings unexpected periods of added work loads. Company is going through a rough period where many employees are leaving due to economic turbulence.From what I hear, this company was a lot better in the past.  However, they have been slowly but steadily reducing benefits to the point where they are barely competitive.Good ol' boy network is firmly established and there is a pretty clear line between the connected few and the rest of the organization.  Management is basically out of touch with the day-to-day operations and generally poor morale of the employees.Decent salary for new hires and well-maintained facilities to work in.However, after a little over 2 yrs here, I realize it's time for me to move on, and I'm finding that my experience here is of no interest to the 3 companies I've actually had the opportunity to interview with.Uggh!The company is well positioned to continue growing but severely lacks a kind of company culture that makes people excited to work there. It's a comfortable job but promotions come slowly and the work gets boring very quickly.We would arrive and open the site, Do preventative maintenance on the vehicles. Get any failed items repaired or replaced from our parts warehouse. shipped bad parts to vendors received parts from vendors. Inventoried and store all equipment and tracked all repairs. compiled spread sheets of repaired items for upper management. when we are all finished we lay out all of the equipment for the military to inventory and sign for the vehicle. The hardest part of the job is having a inventory in excess of 100 million dollars for a standard time frame of 5 months. The most enjoyable part is finishing with no lose of equipment.Flexible work schedule, very supportive of military life, always engaged in some type of project and you are able to chose your career path.The people who work at GD are all very nice, it's a lovely place to work in terms of flexibility and work/life balance. Management does a good job of sticking up for employees.That being said, there is very little control over the direction your career goes. You will get bounced around from one project to the next with little regard for making the best use of your skills or where you want to go with your career in the future.If you are a hard worker, looking for challenges, growth and working in a team environment then this is a good place to work. If you like working on projects that build systems to help protect our troops, our country and our way of life then you can't help but want to work here.This company is ok if you are starting out in the workforce. Definitely not a place to be at if you're seeking growth in logistics. I've been with this company for over 5 years and can't to leaveGood work environment at this location, which is one of the smaller GDMS locations. Management is fine. Had a good boss and peers.The first 4 years were pretty decent other than the fact that I was always traveling and didn't get much in the way of raises, or a promotion.  But I did what I was hired to do and was left alone to get it done for the most part.  I had oversight where I needed it and help to accomplish my goals. The remaining 4 years there were trash, they cut our benefits to the bone, lied to us, harassed us, changed policy every other day, so no one knew what was going on anywhere, I was doing the jobs of 3 people and getting paid less than when I started, and when I was Injured, I was threatened and harassed even more.Great place to work, challenging environment to learn and grow.  Flexible work schedule.  Good pay and benefits.  Great people to work with.If you're under 35, good luck trying to fit in here.  The average age is probably closer to 40-45 or maybe older, with many employees only sticking around because they're waiting to get their pensions.  There's very much an old boys' club atmosphere since a lot of folks have been there for 25 years or more and for many, their tenure at GD spans their entire career. As such, there's very little room for growth while you're expected to just play your part and won't learn much outside the confines of your specific role.  Management largely doesn't care about your career development because they're often not even located in the same office or state.Employees are very passionate about their jobs! They develop excellent product for the government systems part of GD. I worked for this company when they were also part of GTE.Typical government contractor environment. Beige walls and linoleum floors. Minimal training budget, essentials only, plenty of politics and constant reorganizations.The engineering staff and the technical know how made General Dynamics (once Motorola) a leader in the communications industry. Due to the current management style annual earnings has become more important than customer satisfaction. On the positive side there is a lot of diversity in individual assignments. Co-workers are friendly and get together outside of work often."
435,Genesis10,"Genesis 10 is a Staffing Agency located in New York. I found it very difficult to deal with them because they would change their offer each time I spoke to them, I actually turned down the position because of this and three months later they had someone else from the company email me and see if I was still interested in the position. I told them I would take it for a certain salary and no changes.I went to work for Windstream Communication as an Analyst in the Engineering Department. I enjoyed every part of this job. I had to apply for permits for Right of Way Access in several different states. I worked with many different state and government agencies. In this position I worked as part of a team, where we would automatically jump in and help one another get caught up. We had to remain within company regulations of how quick we sent out the permit applications once they were submitted to us. Multitasking was most important, because there was always more than 10 to 15 projects to work on at the same time. Time management was important to meet deadlines. Most important follow-up was required to complete each project. I had very high stats for projects completed, because I was organized and kept my work area neat and organized at all times. The most enjoyable part of this job was working as a team. There was nobody that was trying to out do the next person. We were really a team working to accomplish a goal. The most difficult part of the job was getting the state and government agencies to return the permits in a timely manner. It required developing good relationships with  more... the State and Government Agencies Representatives to ensure the permits moved along  in their system. I highly respected the management, they all practiced what they preached by their actions.  lessTreated like adults and not micro-managed. Every now and then a little fun is thrown in. Overall a good place to work with friendly co-workers.Having worked as a consulting professional for most of my career, I have encountered varying support from the intermediary companies I found work through.  Some have been quite good, some have been so bad, I have refused to work for them and one has been the biggest mistake of my career.  That would be this company..Be warned if you choose to work for these people: the very moment you need them to have your back they will throw you under the bus.  This company is a wonderful company to work for.  They are always out to help their consults grow.  I have been on two assignments for them and can say they are a caring group of people that will do everything they can for their consultants.  They also care about their relationship with their partner/clients and work hard to keep the relationship strong.  I am proud to be a consultant for Genesis10.Working with my fellow group hand in hand and working with computers. Installing and removing old and replacing new computers. Learnt that I have progress in installing and replacing new computers. Management is fine. The co-workers are better workers to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job is removing and installing new computers. Do not have a hardest part of the job, it's just right for me and my school work.A nice place to work in a fast-paced Environment. Day-to-day responsibilities include supporting vendor managed clients, tracking requirements, submitting candidates, coordination and appointment/interview scheduling, placement/term paperwork, process improvement, timesheet and invoice issue resolution and coordinating consultant events and recognitionThis was a very good company to work for. This was a contract job on the weekends to do a PNC Bank refresh. This was a very good learning experience for me. We changed out all of the PC's, Printers, Cisco switches in different banks throughout Monroe County Michigan and Toledo, Ohio. I was second in command due to my experience with being a computer technician.this company taught me a lot about the porting of cell phone numbers worked well with every one. great hours to  work enjoyed not working any overtime that was offeredBeing my first full-time opportunity right out of college it was a great company. I worked with a lot a great people, and learned a lot of information that will be used doing my careerPeer groups were fun and energetic. Management team is flaky on every level. Beware, they have a marketing team out there writing all these great reviews.I have worked for Genesis 10 for 4 years and have always been treated with respect and honesty. Benefits could be better, but in this economy I really can't complain.Good people, fair and productive atmosphere. A youthful atmosphere with a variety of support and energetic people to make things happen.Genesis10 is a good company for individual contributors. Many teams are virtual so that is good in terms of work-life balance. The company has very little management. The people are the most enjoyable part of the job.G10 was my first professional job and the culture and people were both warm and welcoming. I learned so much within just my year there.Productive and non stressful workplace. Managers communicates and interacts well with employees and they do not micromanage.Nice small company environment. Great co-workers, people stay at their jobs for a number of years. Lots of flexibility as far as working remotely.A very comfortable office environment, laid back culture.A typical 40 hour weeks with no over-time. Management makes effort to provide a pleasant environment to work in. They hire good, experienced professional people.Facilitate meetings, capture key outcomes, project plan updates, weekly reports, and maintain System of Record. Analyze, forecast and implemented project closure.Worked on a project that was supposed to last 6 months, but lasted only 4.  Definitely a down side, they do not press their clients to honor contracts (but I guess that is industry standard).Management supported me during a wishy washy transition period, where client kept pushing back the start date.  Gen10 stepped up and bumped my rate slightly for the inconvenience, which I thought was fair.One big downside was mailing checks to 1099 C2C contractors.  If you were to do a survey in this market, most agencies delivered payments via Direct Deposit.  Hopefully, Gen10 will change.One last disappointment was that once it was determined that my last day was moved up two months, Gen10 didn't do anything noticeable to get me placed.  Their advice was to make sure I use other agencies as well.  I believe I performed admirably in my assignment, and this was the best advice they could offer.I hope they will read this critique as constructive criticism.  I thought they behaved in a professional manner through out, just wishing for more.Nothing really bad to say about this place....Managers could have been a bit better....But I would go back....Good company to work for.  Would work for them again.It is centrally located in Troy.Onboarding process is simple and well documented.Awesome co-workers."
616,George Washington University,"While at The George Washington University Hospital I was an intern in the Medical Records Department.  My time there was very well spent.  I went to almost every department in the hospital to see  how it's medical records were handled, scanned into into the main computer, and stored before they made it to the medical records department.Loved working here. It is a university atmosphere and there is always something new to learn. There are many doctors and a ton of work. The management is very strict, however.Very helpful Staff and all middle management worked together in tandem to ensure we got things done. However Upper unnecessary was often disorganized and lead to some disorganized problem that could have been avoided.The typical day at work is supporting fantastic faculties, staff, and students on any Information Technology issues. I have learned more about new tricks in trouble shooting network, printers, computers, and software applications.This was an exciting and interesting place to work, always learning new programs, new methods in medicine and there was never a dull moment.GWU is a good place to work a job. Co-workers are generally friendly and management is (for the most part) competent. It can be hard dealing with entitled students and unfriendly parents. It can be frustrating dealing with bureaucratic red tape. Efficiency does not happen. Budget cuts do happen - and they often hit lowest level employees. If you can get entrenched, your job is secure for life.Leadership focused on stopping the financial bleeding so no focus on employee development. Terrible communication between leadership/management/staff.The managers at George Washington University Hospital are very nice, kind and flexible with staff.The employees are truly team players and support staff are patient with the nurses.It was a college walking  distance from building to building, rode elevators. cleaning, dumping trash I was off on weekend and no holidays. The job was very plain and simple to follow.A very diverse community, great place to work enjoyed the student body as well as employees and staff. Office staff was lots of fun enjoyed every minute, my first Director was a joy.It is a nice location in DC, I have had a lot experiences and peoples working over there friendly, Good place to working, and enjoy my workMy day started at 5am, and I look forward to coming to work everyday. I really enjoyed working with my co-workers, we all were team players and we all work together. As a member of Information Technology server team at George Washington University Hospital, complete overseeing of the VMWare virtual environment, Citrix, and EMC storage area network.GWU is a very organized and communicative work environment. Its faculty and staff are very friendly and welcoming. Everyone is always happy to help each other. Every day working here has been a positive experience.comfortable working environment and satisfied salary.operation manager is kind to help to solve any problems during workrelatively less competitiveflexible working duration**Please note this eval is for the Medical Faculty AssociatesPoorly organized Extremely high volume Antiquated software and computer systems No transparency Poor communication from senior managementUnreasonable expectationsNo employment incentivesMy day starts around 6 am, throughout the day I am on the phones assisting my staff with posting of cases and reviewing the schedule for preparation of the next day schedule.I have worked with GWU for almost 11 years and the first 9 or 10 were challenging but I felt secure and fairly well compensated.  Unfortunately due to recent budget cuts, the security has been diminished significantly and is no longer a great place to work for IT professionals.Could be improved because continueing education should be encouraged. exprienced Excuses not to award student school reimbursment.The IVF department is one of the worst departments of them all at GWU/MFA! They have inexperienced leaders, very unorganized, disrespectful, and too many cliches! Management is very unprofessional, and spends too much time on gossip, personal and intimate relationships with employees, and not focused on daily issues that are important to the growth and success of the department as a whole!If you're honest, and speaks the truth, then management will have a problem with you! You will be considered the problem for your truthfulness!Management is extremely insensitive to the personal needs of their staff, as it relates to having to take off from work! Those intimately involved with management was always authorized to take off at anytime, leaving the department in chaos, due to the lack of adequate staffing in their absence, and management would act as though everything was fine and peachy!!Working with doctors who were very easy to accommodate  Work for the Medical Director who was not demanding.  I did what was asked of me and also helped out in other areas.Self manage position.Learn to work independently, also learn computer programs for reporting needs.Loved working with everyone.To have Managers from from GW come in and dictate what I should be doing, which over rides what my main boss had me doing.Working with staff who respect you, dimensions health staff.

341,Georgia-Pacific,"Learned a lot and became a more well rounded maint. man because the troubleshooting required me to think on my feet and being the only one on shift I didn't have a way to pass the buck.Excellent workplaceGood benefitsGrowthEqual opportunityFast paceFairFair payTeam workerTeam playersSafe workplaceCompetitive benefits package. Supports various skills training for employees. Long term satisfied employees, low turn over rate.It's very easy to use and fun. I think that I will be using this frequently. I'm excited very to find employment thru this app. I will recommend this app to all my friends and family.The typical day of work was constant. Always something to get accomplished and work on. I learned several new trades while helping maintenance department. The hardest part of the job was the work environment. The workers do not work well with others.Plant closed down so not really much I can say. Too many management changed at the end. That was the downfall, employes worked hard and did there best.Good name, great company. Great people to work WITH.Overall this was a great place to work, just needed a better management structure. Alot of favoritism and nepetism in key places.The hardest part of the job was dealing with the management.Certain rules only apply to certain employees at certain times. The most ejoyable part of the job was the job itself.I have enjoyed my work experience there. I always came to work with only the intentions to do my job. I got along with everybody because I mostly stayed to myself. I enjoyed making my own money.Work is not hard at all and compensation is wonderful management from plant manager down to shift leads are the biggest downfall of the job.  They way people are treated here is ridiculously sad.With out a doubt, one of the worst companies I have ever worked for.  A number of times they have forgotten to buy raw materials for the machinery.  They are big on grandiose plans, but in the end, nothing materializes.  They union drags their feet renegotiating the contract, not the company.  The plant is run very lean, but management treats themselves to expensive lunches every Friday.  Run, don't walk away.Could be more generous around holidays for employees too boost moral for more positive production numbers for the following year,incetives for milestones . Safety needs to be of more importance. To keep business thriving safe work plant is great for business.great place to work. it was a very safe and productive place to work. I would recommend this place to others.  I really don't know what else I can say about it.Very Hot summers, Very Cold Winters. Unorganized in management. Company is very strict on safety procedures. Many opportunities for raises. Co-Workers are friendly.Hard To Advance In This Company , Management needs a little work and understand the hard work that the employees put in also it should be more of a flexible scheduleIts were I started in a industrial environment, learned alot from my Co workers and was able to advance in my mechanical career.Dirty, hot, fiberglass everywhere, management doesnt care about you or how many days you work or hours and cry if you ask for a day off if you worked a 6 week day. If you are new theyll make you do everything just because they have seniority issues and think just because they been there for a few year they dont have to do there job. I was maintenance with ATS worst company to work for i would not recommend this either of these companies for a long term career just stepping stones. Oh and also would tell you to hurry up on your 30 min lunch break when ypu had no breaks all day.Management will twist you any way they want then kick you to the curb when they are through with you. The most unhappy workforce i have ever seen in my life, everyone is over worked to the point of numbness. Probation for 90 days, do not be sick or miss even an hour for anything or you are gone.You never know from one day to the next what your schedule is.Very productive and fun to work for.I learned that some of the chemistry that I learned in high school applied to the job.Management was great. They work with you to ensure you,re getting trained for all task being performed. The co-workers were easy to get along with and we enjoy working together. The hardest part of the job gauges, valves, and all the product being made and where they're stored. The most enjoyable part of the job was our product improvement team brainstorming along with R&D to improve our product and reduce batch time. Also the company picnics were great. Everyone bring their family and we get to know each other.You work for your pay check and thats it. they could care less about you. Supervisors only care about being the top dog in production. employees do not get scheduled breaks you ""break when you can"" which sometimes means you just dont get one.Good interaction with peers, limited with upper management.Business development with IT options.Co-workers were mostly very conscientiousExcessive meetingsDifficult to get consensus on decisionsWorking with customers and production facilities was most enjoyable.Union Job but no sick day, have to work all holidays, inclement weather if not you get a point against you after 4 points you get suspended even with doctor's note.  There is so much work that the trainers are really unable to train new people properly."
344,gilbarco veeder-root,"typical work day - 10 - 11 hours a day, depending on the work loadI learn to think on my feet, quick turn around on short notice assignments, time management, versatile, organizedMany coworkers were great, very supportive, others need to learn how to be humansMany short notice assignments were expected to get done on time without any advance notices.  Have to carry coworkers' workload due to their limited skills and slow paceMany assignments were challenging but fun to work with.  Coworkers assigned to the projects were very supportive and respectful people.Every call was something new and different. Attached to a warehouse so the environment was very casual.The company has low moral and management is bad. No room for advancement and managers have a certain clique. Discrimination is a big part of the FMS dept.Typically daily work can be puzzling because there is a lack of focus on certain projects or program targets tend to shift. Co-workers are great, but work may push for long hours.At times schedule can be more than accomodatingly flexible."

669,"Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Its a good company to work. It enhanced all my skills and also the management was very friendly. I love working in this environment. The colleagues were very encouraging.Working at Gilead is an great experience getting to know people through different departments. Sometimes  a day can be very busy to a calm day like on a Friday.  Lastly enjoying the happy hour on Friday and just catch up with your friends at work.  It something good to feel about coming to work everyday.A typical day at work is a mixed bag of  lulls and a deluge of challenging tasks.What I've learned is to expect anything.Management is autocratic; this is unfortunately consistent with the industry, and shows no signs of abating.Co-workers are on edge, most are contractors and are pre-occupied with job security.Hardest/unpleasant part of the job is that communication style from management is uni directional.Most enjoyable part of the job thus far is the cafeteria, If I'm being hones. But I'm fairly new so there is hopefully room for that to change.Great place to learn. Lot of cross-functional exposure. Good management. Great co-workers. very busy place. Can keep you working for ever. More work less fun though.The most discouraging place I ever worked, A company chock full of individuals that are not collaborating, and encourage a trickle down system of information.A telephone game of long hours, on call, and pour treatment.My supervisor once told me that a coworker could not be sleeping on the job, he was "" A good Christian Brother"" and this was just another day on the job! This place is terrible.Company runs very lean and IT management is not mature to operate under lean workload. No employee reward, management is disconnected with individual contributors.I was originally brought on as a Front-End Developer, however after working with management and assessing user needs based on UX analysis methods it was clearly evident that the current UI wasn't addressing the complex user needs. Gradually my position transitioned to redesigning the UI and conducting UX design research to gather data.Overall my experience was great! I had the opportunity to work with and learn from talented and seasoned developers. A typical day would consist of brief in depth meetings to assess daily workloads & how to implement and leverage technologies such as Angular JS, JAVA, javascript libraries, UI design sprints and timelines.The benefits and stock options here are great but the company culture and work life balance are pretty bad. Most employees are doing the work of 3 people and it is impossible to work just a normal 8 hours day. The workload is not only heavy but very demanding as alot of the work is very urgent. The political nature of this company doesn't allow for quick progress unless a manager personally likes you. Promotions aren't based off of what you know or the work you put in, but instead on if that manager wants you to be promoted or likes you enough to do it.Fast paced environment, excellent team and stable product pipeline. Access to the latest recruiting tools and technology and a sense of team support that is positive and geared towards learning.Great company with outstanding product line.  Very ethical.  Outstanding leadership team and winning corporate culture.  I no longer work there, but often wish I still did.Best place to work i loved working over there all employeeres are friendly. management was excellent. The best part of my job is My team. I am so fortunate to be part of a team that, despite everyone’s differences and eccentricities, manages to make every day at work seem like an episode of tosh.0.fast paced environment, high expectations, not enough work life balance, no WFH policy, different rules for different folks, not enough focus on employee development from managers due to pace of organization (managers themselves are swamped, and don't always know or have patience to understand employee's needs),  not always objective, emphasis  how one's image is portrayed to the team rather than collaborative approach of working together towards common goal, significant turn-over within organizationNice very expensive cars all across the campus.Really bad culture that claims "" it all about the science"" when in reality its all about the profit. Need a new CFO ASAP.Oracle EBS Functional and Technical.Good Job Culture.Participated in all Design phases of this project.Learned more anout OPM and had adapted to different project reuirements,We have a team size of 5 with developers and Functional consultants.The harderst part of the job is to meet the complex req's which are solely in OPM .The most enjoyable part of the job is despite stringent deadline we could meet all the req's and development with minor issues during Golive.The people and policies reflect a culture that is toxic to professionals. Asking questions is prohibited and career advancement is at the expense of personal dignityI learned a great deal about clinical research conduct within the US and globally.  I had the opportunity to work with a great individuals who shared their wealth of knowledge and support for my growth and progression.Depending on the division your in makes a difference in the job culture you are subjected to.  IHD is the red headed step child of the organization and is treated poorly.  Minimal support for Managed Care Contracting.Gilead was a great work experience for me, especially as my first major company. Management not only managed, but also did a good portion of the work which made myself and fellow employees feel as though it was a team effort. There were definitely opportunities for advancement and the compensation was good.Not a place to go to develop in a role. You are on your own. There is a very negative company culture that applauds over working until the point of burn out.There is essentially no work-life balance  and they can care less about your well being and your family. All they care about is making money. ""For the love of money is the root of all evil!"" Gilead demands you to work untill they tell you to go home. I'm not joking here, I slept in my car after working back to back 15-20 hour shifts. I have the many time card printouts to prove it! Gilead clams this is the best package you can find. Well these people haven't worked anywhere else in alot of years, they are inexperienced in what is offered out there now a days. What good is having benefits when you cant even take time off to go to the dentist or doctors because if your not at work your missing deadlines which hold up production which equals loss of money. This place is cancerous and I was out of there before that cancer killed my relationship with my family. You can make money anywhere, this place is not the only place in the world to make a great living in. If you care about your family and your well being look for employment elsewhere. If you just care about making money this is a place for you. But let me tell you all the money in the world cant buy happiness.A lot of one-on-one opportunities to really talk about your goals, your future, and also the future and state of the company itself."
464,Gilt,"GIlt is a young company with a lot of great people. My only complaint is the work life balance. There is no work life balance, specifically in merchandising. Due to the nature of the business (ecommerce) there is work to be done in office and at home such a site and sale maintenance. As a merchandising assistant it is not rare to stay in office for 12 hours a day without taking a break for lunch. There is so much to do which keeps you productive but it can become overwhelming.Gilt is an incredible place to work. Co-workers are inspiring, innovative, smart. One of the best professional experiences working among them. Fantastic managers.I loved working for Gilt! I learned so many new things and have strengthened my technical skills. Everyone who I worked with invested a lot of time in me and they were very helpful. Everyone is super friendly. The work environment is awesome! You can dress however you want as long as it is fashionable and presentable. Lots of free food available in the kitchen area! One thing you need to know - everyone works extremely hard. Get ready to put in a lot of hours. You have to be willing to have your hands dipped into various functions. There is a lot of ambiguity at times so get ready to asking a lot of questions and finding answers on your own at the same time.It was always a team effort. GILT would have fun pep rallies to keep us informed and ready to work. I found this job most fun on the Cherry picker.Underpaying, favoritism, little chance for advancement, unless you make friends with someone higher up. It seems the harder you work, the more they want to add to it, but if you come in, and be lazy they wont ask for anything.managers have ""favorites"" and will do anything in their power to get you fired if they dont like you. discrimination against all people. low pay. no fun to work at.Great workplace to learn about all positions from entry all the up the ladder. Hard work always pays off, and is always recognized,fun place to work and i went from having no friends when i started to having over 20 new friends..it was really a fun place to work....The best of Gilt is its people.  Smart, nice, hard workers.  The best job I ever had! There was opportunity to learn, build, train, test, and enjoy the success of the work well done.I really enjoyed working at Gilt. I got converted to the company after four months of working there as a temp. A typical day at Gilt went by fast because there was always work to do but the temperature inside was worst then the temperature outside. I loved all of my co - workers and got along with all of my supervisors and mangers pretty well.I just love this job the people was very friends and i love getting the change to meet new people.I loved working for this company! What a talented group to work with and the pay is great! they treat their staff well, and I have no complaints at all. "
534,Givaudan SA,"to much buddy system for advancement. if your in the 5 oclock club your in. if you disagree with decisions of management you are blackballed and put on watch.highly recommend it as a place to work for. friendly people great benefits, work day works flow very fast. great management team in place for the employees.Put raw materials in racks to be picked for orders, took garbage out. learned about the operating system called SAP. learned difference between flammable and combustible. management was very production oriented. co workers were friendly and helpful. the hardest part of the job was lifting alot of weight frequently. the most enjoyable part of the job was cleaning up.I had taken this job, with the expectation of advancing within the company. Within 9 months, it became clear that this was not going to happen. Daily responsibilities include responding to customer emails and requesting standard FDA documents for flavor production. The atmosphere within my department is pleasant, however I would like to advance.Very wasteful environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you are allowed to come up with ideas independently and be a part of the driving success for the future of the firm. The hardest part of the job is just seeing the waste of product, talent(s) are not being put to good use and waste of resources.On a typical day I work with colleagues in nearly every department on site to understand our needs and any limitations (warehouse space, labor, etc.).  I work with vendors worldwide and colleagues outside the facility to ensure materials arrive in a cost affective way just in time (JIT) for production.  I enjoy the fact that, although I run the same reports on a daily basis, I never know what is going to happen or who I need to work with to reach my daily objectives.  I like that Givaudan is a large international company and that I can work with people from all over the world on a daily basis.  I also enjoy working with SAP, and appreciated the extensive training Givaudan provided.  Givaudan is a very innovative company and they value the input of their employees regardless of their role.  Givaudan also offers a great benefits package for its employees.My on site managers are receptive to my communications with them and work to implement requests that my coworkers and I make.Great organization to work for overall. They really strive to understand how their employees feel and make their work life a positive environment. I enjoyed working for Givaudan as they are a robust and stable organization.Givaudan is a great company to work for. It offers great benefits, job security and stability. Management is friendly and competent and the industry is very fascinating.A very matrixed organization with wonderful benefits. In terms of pace, the organization moved very slowly. However, every day could be spent doing productive work.This was a great place with wonderful medical and dental benefits.  However you will spend many hours due to demand and workloadnot bad enjoy what i do just looking for more pay and better opportunity for growthforklift operation/chemical experienceIn cincnnati they backstab and fight to get to the top only there is no top and florence the management makes so much money they can be on there cell phones texting all of the time and asking their rats hows everything going their safety is terrible and they pay you 14.75 an hour and expects you to do more work than people getting 26.00 an hour yes slavery is not dead its working at givaudan.Great strong firm with  a great reputation in the industry.  Room for creativity, ideas and growth.  Long hours, hard work but, if you are committed to the field, you will love it.It was wonderful working with the residents and getting to spend time with them.  Sad to see some residents had no family or friends as visitors.  Sometimes the staff wasn't the kindest to the patients.Be careful, East Hanover has lab Supervisors and Managers that play favorites. And the Manager keeps nothing confidential.Company is very employee and customer focused.  I learned a lot about the fragrance industry as well as learning development.Prepared orders for shipments , followed purchased orders and pick list , Followed regulations to ship orders by air, ocean and truck freight.Coordinated freight pick up, Inspected all deliveries for completeness ,quality and accuracy. Sampled and inspected goods entering warehouse by logging and scanning into system .Very face-paced, high fashion and high production. Loved working there.Seeking a challenging position in the field of Production in a multinational company with a challenging environment where I can apply my training, studies, interpersonal and communication skills.I created life long friendships with some I worked with. It is a fast pace environment that required hours of overtime.Givaudan, is my first permanent job as a lab tech.. I enjoyed it and learned alot about the products we work with, and the company."
76,Glassdoor,"Glassdoor used to be a great company to work for. Unfortunately, they have made some significant changes within the last 12 months that has created a sour culture in sales. No one is getting paid, no one is happy, and most are looking for other jobs.I hope they can turn it around as I truly believe in their mission and extraordinary executive leadership.Welcome to SD. Prepare to have all your basic labor rights violated.  Sexist, racist and a general scumbag the owner is constantly in court.  After starting work there thats when people laughed at me and told me the nick name Revolving Glass Door since the staff is always changing.I always felt like I was making a difference in the world.The leadership is great, the people are great and the culture is great.Just had to move continents or I would have stayed forever!Glassdoor wants to believe it treats its staff like a family, but it is incredibly dysfuntcional. In the beginning, they seem to treat their employees well, but then arbitrarily eliminate their roles or let them go for no good reason. I have seen it happen many times. Also, their strategy changes so often that is there is no true job security or opportunity for advancement. The management team is inexperienced and immature and often make decisions that lack real thought or analysis.Glassdoor's product team lacks innovation. They merely copy the market leaders - like Indeed and TripAdvisor.Good people are being let go, and a lot of other good people are leaving. Glassdoor is not managing its growth well, and the ""family"" is falling apart.*note: wrote a similar review on Glassdoor, but (surprise) they did not post it.Company had a great opportunity to growth, but lacked in upper management.Amazing place to work with lots to do everyday, I learned a lot during my internship. The con's would be the distance from the city, if you don't have a car its hard to get to the office everyday. But besides the the distance it's a great place to work.Worked as a temp for 2 months and was not hired in perm. even though they were hiring, read reviews on companies and accepted, rejected or escalated the reviews. The employees were great and the job was easy.  You could work from home if you were hired in perm. The hardest part was reading a computer screen for 8 hours a day. Loved the way you were treated there, always willing to help if you could not make it in.I love the company and what I do, being able to be helpful and apply knowledge and learning is a good opportunity  for me, people are very nice and helpful, I enjoy working during the week and I miss being with my friends during the weekendsGood place to start your career. The CEO definitely built a strong company with solid values. Also the B2C component is the best out there and the B2C side is growing too. Awesome culture, people and work. I get to learn a lot of new things every day. What more do you need?Best company I've ever worked for and an awesome product that can't be beat!"
529,Golder Associates,"Golder is a genuinely good place to work. However, the company recently tried to grow too quickly while not maintaining their original ideals. More specifically, they're management structure became more linear and top heavy.The people or friendly, and you can really work toward your professional goals. The location is in an expensive location, so it's hard to live close enough to not have a bad commute.Growing company and a great place to develop technical skills. Golder has a reputation of producing high quality technical consultants spread across the globe. The company is setup in a way that allows all employees to share expertise and advice across the globe, truly making it a world of capabilities delivered locally.Golder Associates is a global Geotechical/Environmental Company. The company's core values has an in depth emphasis on Health and Safety management,Manpower Training and Development to help attain success on employees career and lastly is the Customer Satisfaction through a Total Quality Management of the organization.Working relationship with my peers is an exiting and enjoyable one especially when everybody is doing their job diligently. A full coordination and cooperation by everyone shall be  expected and a quality product can be delivered in due time.Golder Associates was a place that I would work again in an instant, the work environment was busy and always changing.  If you are looking for advancement you must have an engineering degree,Fascinating work. Good collegian atmosphere in some groups and offices. Opportunities to do most anything anywhere in the world. Long leash given to hang yourself or achieve great things. Very pleasant work environment, despite all of the layoffs and turmoil.Work/Life balance working at Golder is very good. The last year has seen a decline is management personal. Junior to mid-level employees will be in a great position moving towards the future.I liked working for this company but the management is way off. They do not promote those who deserver it only those they like and then do very little work. I just left and heard the SW ops manager was let go so it looks like they are heading in the right direction.Company is employee owned and has an excellent culture that can proved a good work/life balance (most of the time) and a very relaxed casual office setting.  However, 2014 was a very poor financial year, and after numerous layoffs and compensation/benefits cuts this company often will not meet the standard for compensation or benefits.  Job security has dwindled and advancement opportunities have shrunk drastically as well.This was a fun company to work for with supportive management that want their employees to grow and develop within. I was the first point of contact for all employees and felt that we all worked well together on a variety of tasks.Unfortunately due to global economic issues my position was eliminated. Would definitely work there again if the opportunity arose.Golders website indicates they are big on training their employees. They believe if you have done it once, you are an expert and can do it on your own. I was constantly promised training and no training ever was done. In addition to that, I felt blacklisted from doing field work due to the older associates biased opinion I wasn't cut out for it. Simply untrue. Management is awful. The PMs do not come by and talk and ever check if you need work. If you have it great, but if not, you will be wasting a lot of time. There is a lot of false promises on incoming work. The company did not turn a profit last year and has really started to decline (How does an environmental company with mining as its' largest group, not see the decline occurring and not plan for it?? Same thing with oil, and yet no one did anything or prepared for the crashes.). I was told by multiple people Golder is not the company it used to be.  I should have seen the trend ahead of time, but was blind. A guy left because of the poor quality of work my first week. 3 months later, they laid off another person for not having work, and an engineer a month after being hired quit. They make promises but do not make good on them. There is major favoritism in the environmental group and some of the people are team players at all. Watch out. Oh and if you are an engineer, you better love landfills as that is all you will do.Good day at work, remediation stuff, managed personnel and projects, had co-workers, work was hardest part of job and technical aspects were the most employable aspectsGreat place to gain experience in materials testing, drafting, reading reports, preparing engineering graphs, preparing quantity takeoffs for landfill liner systems.I have learned so much about geotechnical data and geosynthetics just from working here a year now. There is so much room to grow if this is your field of study. A great environment to work in and great co-workers. The company is international and amazing to work for.Some talented professionals to learn from.    Lacks management direction for business growthGood company but compensation lower than competitors. Work can be interesting but sometimes slow.Golder Associates is a great company to work for.  A typical work day is 8 hours.  The co- workers are great to work with and very knowledgeable.Productive organization coupled with efficient processes to produce a product with quality and accuracy.A typical day at work is 8:00am to 5:00pm, good co-workers, good management.I was able to work on a variety of projects around the U.S. and around the World.Management is severely lacking in knowledge of proper Project Management practices/processes.  Engineers are regularly appointed PMs and have no education on how to do the work, how to make a schedule or do any sort of cost control.  This leads to no one knowing where anyone is on a project, what comes next, or where the budget is...until a month or two down the line.Flat structure is great, but it leads to management by committee.  On any day, the person in charge can change depending on who thinks their work must be done NOW."
29,Google,"Great place to work, unbelievable amenities, great salary and benefits better than ever expected.  Co-workers were for the most part a lot of fun and very bright.  Middle level managers many times were looking up instead of helping to push their employees along to further their careers.  But still a great place to work.Google is a great place to work, hard deadlines but manageable, overall very nice atmosphere. Great people to work with.It is an enjoyable work environment, mainly because of the employees. The day can become tedious but the good company makes time go by quickly. The field (main) operators are also attentive and understanding. As long as the workflow is running smoothly, they are open to suggestions and willing to solve any issues. The least favorite thing about the job are the weather conditions. Being that transport is a vital part of the operation, it is a constant battle with the forces of nature depending on the season.Although my internship is unpaid, I strongly support the mission of the program that I volunteer with on behalf of Google.knowledge high tech and community with co-workers. Google glass.for sample: when I Coat. I just use 2 my fingers in the font of Coating machine, and the machine automatic they Coat the OPTIC themsefl.Fun working environment for young people. Good benefits, compensation and company perks. Encourages creativity and team work although most of daily communication is via computers and chat.Gave opportunity to work with experienced team members, Learned many things from their expertise likehow to meet ETA on timehow to handle multiple projectshow to meet client requirementshow to work with Tools and services like SIS, SSAS, SSRSperformed anomaly and cluster detectionlearned how to find the hidden information from large data sets.A lot of very smart people, with great ideas and the drive to innovate and make an impact.Many top performers advance to manager but often don't have people skills, nor the vocation to manage people. This is a problem management should address.No clear, focused direction from management (on my specific project).  Revolving door of Technical Project Managers...5 TPMs in 12 months.  With such a large and very talented staff on hand, the analogy of the US Marines being lead by the Keystone Cops comes to mind.  In the defense of the TPMs -- there most definitely ARE some great ones -- unfortunately, they're so over-burdened and spread so thin that I can't imagine how they're able to keep much of anything focused and on-track.The job has many great perks and personal development opportunity. The challenge keeps me interested and I love all the people I work with.Great benefits, great place to explore ideas and work with some of the brightest and kind people on earth. Transfers encouraged which creates a lot of opportunities, etc.A regular day for me is mostly busy ... receiving putting accessories into camp and Guts tickets . I'm on my feet 80% of the day due to Inventory as well as prepping task tickets. Management is pretty good no one over your back to micro manage. I have a hard working team . We work together and get the job done. The hardest part of my day i would say would be receiving pallets and putting them into google camp at the same time..Google helps you find any and everything you need that you search up, I use it myself when im looking for books, music, games, jobs, clothes, shoes, electronics, and more.Enjoyable work space. People seems very nice. Good perks.They're take care of their people with respect. Facilities are amazing. It deserve its reputation as one of the best company you could work for.A company with great culture, ability to constantly learn and develop, and add value to the business. World class perks and benefits, and  top rated talent.I have worked there over  a year and the leadership, environment and atmosphere is open, fun, attentive and they treat their people with respect and admiration.Managers have full reign to steer you in one direction, then turn around and criticize you when they change course. Co-workers are competitive and cut throat and will also try to manipulate situations.  HR does not help you.  Managers are able to tell their employees to threaten their staff and HR and Senior managers do nothing. The company hires under work permits so they don't have to pay double tax. This means you're not entitled to unemployment and cobra health care.  Google is the new Microsoft and the technology is dead.Working here is link dream come true. I got many things to learn and the work environment is amazing. If offered a full time I would certainly join it againWish there was no 2 year contract,probably would still be working there. Always kept us busy and had time limits to get things done by the end of the day.Good culture, environment,people, innovation,. And so many things to learn with..Need to give more respect with TVC as same as FTEThe people i worked with were very friendly and informative, especially when i was first starting out. It's not a difficult job, it doesn't require much besides punctuality and care."
602,Grant Thornton LLP,"I've been with the company over a year and everything  was great till company is considering to out source there IT. It is a great place to work for the time being.During my time at GT i was exposed to both public and private company financial statement audits. I was exposed to many different areas of the financial statement auditing process. This is a good place to start a career if you work under the right people.Many years since I left, so don't know what it is like now. At the time it was undergoing significant change and was searching for its identity. My colleagues were generally a smart and dedicated group.Too much travel for me and poor recognition for the non- client facing staff.The management was supportive but in many cases was pushed against the budget which limited learning opportunities. Overall, it is a great place to start your career and gain work experience.The people are great, and GT definitely relies pretty heavily upon your commitment to your coworker.  It's public accounting; you work crazy hours with a solid annual compensation....just never calculate your per hour rate.Grant Thornton is a great place for young professionals to gain experience in a variety of industries.  There is the long hours and heavily workload you would expect from public accounting, but overall a good place.Worked in the Property Tax Department. Helped prepare property tax returns for various states and depreciation calculations. Also helped prepare federal forms 1040 (Individual) and 1041 (Trusts) as well.I will forever be grateful for the opportunities and experiences I gained while working at GT. Working with clients from different industries doing a myriad of work was extremely valuable.Grant Thornton, Cleveland was a great place to work.  Unfortunately, there were changes within the IT department that has resulted in me having leave a great organization and group of people.Management is trying hard to make it a fun place to work. Perhaps they're are trying too hard, as it becomes a distraction with multiple ""feel good"" e-mails.This company works it's employees hard as is typical of public accounting firms (50-60 hours a week).  This company is a larger firm, so employees will be specialized into service areas (Audit, Tax, Services).  Audit will involve regional travel.In general there is high turnover due to the hours and travel.  This provides opportunities to move up in the company.Grant Thornton has been on a journey that focuses on its culture and people over the past fiscal year and it is making a positive difference to the firm overall. If they continue to make strides with this initiative and keep people engaged, GT will be phenomenally successful.Excellent experience,  This was a great experience.  I worked as a federal consultant.  I really enjoyed it.  My clients were highly satisfied with my work.Great place to work.  Employees are like family.  Great work life balance.  Great IT department.  I would highly recommend.I really enjoyed the time working for Grant Thornton. Thanks to Grant Thornton opportunity I have experience and a good knowledge in the cycle of business personal property tax, and business real property.Work/life balance is extremely important to Grant Thornton and they are very flexible with schedules.The company is going through many organizational changes so what is coming remains to be seen.I supported the CIO and his Executive Leaders. I worked side-by-side with his full leadership team. They drove a wonderful culture of collaboration, professionalism and understood well what work/life balance was all about. The atmosphere in the department was positive and I believe that was a huge contributor to their success. Good leadership is key to success.The company was built by a very hard working woman who values her staff and treats them as family.  As in most jobs that I have been given the opportunity to place my foot in the door, the sky was the limit with this company.  They valued my opinion and gave me free reign to submit my ideas for the betterment of the company.Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop.Resolving administrative issues by coordinating, preparation of reports, analyzing data, and identifying solutions.Pros: Lots of exposure to different types of clients, industries and accounting policies; typical to move from client to client every 2-5 weeks in the first year; friendly co-workers; lots of upper management change and company leadership people and culture changeCons: long hours, tedious/monotonous work, if you don't like accounting, it is a struggle; as an auditor, clients don't welcome your presence; high turnover and not enough training or supportOverall, GT was a good company to work for and is where I gained the most valuable experience in my field. Work life balance was sometimes not considered by managers and was often a challenge."
74,Gravity,"Typical Work Day Excellent coworkers Management is good and most enjoyable.Merger is happened in another location in US and do not want want to relocate.All the creative digital marketing projects I produced for G4 went very well.  I had direct communication with the CEO to work out logistics, creative and budget.  Colleagues were very helpful and knowledgable.  Hardest part of the job was working remotely and the most enjoyable was dealing with the CEO because of the autonomy he gave.Aprendí a como trabajar con las personas y servirles de su ayuda.  Tuve y tengo buena comunicación con mis excompañeros de trabajo.  La parte más fuerte e incluso más interesante era atender a más de una persona a la vez, ya que las personas podían notar la motivación en desempeñarme bien en el trabajo y hacer correctamente lo que me pedían.Young company with lots of growth potential; able to write your own career path; come eager to learn and grow with a solid companyat my job I learn how to do a lot greet people in different ways be patient enjoyed meeting new people it was fun and helpfulCo-workers are awesomeVery nice peopleEasy group to work with"
108,"Grifols, Inc.","No place to work if you don't have a family life. Benefits are good, but the extended hours are no what's up. Management is like the blind leading the cripple. The ONLY good part about this job is the benefits, other than that, find something else."
505,"Groundwater & Environmental Services, Inc.","This company has a very high turnover rate. 13 out of approximately 15 positions have been turned over in the last 2 years. I attribute this to poor local management. Also the region has been overlooked at the corporate level and left in the hands of people who lack relevant experience.Its a good job, I have fun at the job. What you get paid when you start your job is pretty much what you're going to get. Don't expect good raises or promotionsGroundwater & Environmental Services, Inc. has no identity of itself. There is no cohesiveness, top to bottom. They would like you to believe that this company is a perfect place to work , with the best minds, and utmost attention to safety. They don't really care about safety...only the numbers associated with safety. Bright minds, yes, but all for themselves, with little upward potential unless you belong to a click.Operations level - good group on local level.Corporate level - Self-preservation oriented.Good work environment with a lot of travel for work. Co-workers are nice people.  Typical day can range from 8-5 to 6-6.  Office hours and field hours range.Laid off after less than 1 year of service due to lack of work... made me wonder why I was hired in the first place.  Too much micro-management, too many managers.  Company feeds off oil companiesMundane and monotonous routine. Management was not interested in training junior employees. Excessive travel for below average compensation was the norm. Mass hiring and subsequent layoffs were commonplace. There was an extremely high turnover rate amongst employees that weren't laid off. Morale was extremely low during the entirety of my tenure with the company. Not a conducive environment for a burgeoning career as a scientist.When I was with GES, there was a very low company morale, and a very high turnover rate of 37%. The salary was low, in comparison to similar positions with other firms. Most people left after one or two years. Additionally, senior management would cater excessively to client demands, and did not hesitate to make personnel changes upon their demands. This created a low morale and a disconnect between local employees and senior management."
486,GroupM,"GroupM is truly a great company and an a awesome place to start off your career in media and learn about the industry as a whole. Laid back and relaxed work atmosphere and very welcoming environment.Overall, GroupM is a great place to work, but bad communication between upper management and employees. Direct supervisors were great in Atlanta office.A typical day here in the office includes checking buys to make sure that correct day-parts are being used, correct spot lengths and approved programming is used. Also to make sure that buyers are spending budgets correctly.A typical day of work one must do many different things and constantly learning on the job. Management worries for the employee health. The hardest time is the last few days of the month where situations occur that are out of one's control. There were different relationships between employees but my favorite thing would have to be the activities.enjoyed meeting and working with great people; clients are respectable; room for growth; great location; demanding work hours.Very big and matrixed organization.  Good opportunity to learn at the biggest player in the media space.  Space is a little outdated, but moving to world trade area in 2018Best people in the industry, job security. Dynamic and fast paced environment. Opportunity to work in smaller divisions of a large holding company which offers the best of both worlds.GroupM is a very large company with many moving parts. It was a very rewarding place to work. There has been a major reorganization worldwide and at the moment there is very little direction and no leadership.Being here I have learned a great deal about office automation development within SharePoint. My coworkers have all been very friendly and helpful and my team of direct reports were very easy to work with. As was my overseas development team The hardest part of the job is also the most enjoyable. The various projects I have either managed or developed myself can be (and most were) very difficult but so rewarding when they are successfully completed.The organization is an excellent place to learn hands on.  Always trying to stay ahead of the curve on cutting edge technologies.Working for the organization I learned a large number of technologies such as Cisco ASA, Checkpoint, 3Par Storage Citrix Netscalers, EMC RSA Atuhenication Manager and VMware.I have been working at GroupM full-timeProsGroupM provides a Great work/life balance with plenty of ""day off"" timeConsIT going through changes, little transparency, very uncertain on futureCan be challenging as depending on your role and which agency, roles and expectations aren't always well defined. You get to work on great brands, however; depending upon your level, salary doesn't always match work responsibilities. You need to be your own advocate. Being such a large agency has its pros and cons.I worked with two exceptional team members and we not only got the job done but had fun while providing IT support to several companies. We worked together for 7 1/2 years together and we were like family.  The work environment was positive and the people we supported were outgoing which made our jobs in IT even more fun.There are some nice people that are good to work with, however you will not move up in this company.  You will be stuck in same spot for years and no one will be helpful.This job was very fast paced and had a high volume of work but it was great working there. The co-workers were amazing we all got along.A good starting point to open to new things and network. Job culture could use some improvement.Very fortunate to work with the leading holding company globallyI've learned so many valuable things. One of them is to work in a team and finish what needs to be done.- Nice team of co-workers- Large international company- Fun to work in Advertisement sphereExcelent co-worker to work. I learned much about diferents accounting in advertising.A typical day consists of any of the following: A/R and A/P, reconciliations, analysis of accounts, variance explanation, etc. My experience at GroupM has taught me to be detailed oriented as well as how to efficiently manage my time. I've gotten the chance to work with great individuals who are very helpful and supportive. The hardest part of the job is resolving problems that occurred prior to my employment with the company. The most enjoyable part of the job is completing difficult projects and getting our month-end and yearly closes.A great place to learn the basics in media.  More often than not, issues or discrepancies are realized in the finance department.  It is our job to resolve these issues by requesting additional information from vendors, planners, analysts and/or reviewing contracts or insertion orders.  I've learned how to meet demanding deadlines and to communicate in a multi-level corporate environment.  In my position, the hardest part of my job is knowing that there is no way to move up without waiting for someone to retire.  My co-workers are the best part of the job."
374,GrubHub,"Grubhub will use you and won't care. They will have you drive all over the city to restaurants 20-30 mins away and won't pay you for those miles but they make sure that the distance between the restaurant and customer is no more then 3 miles away. Your told to accept all orders and just call dispatch and have them redirect the order to someone that's closer. The problem with this is that Grubhub will still count this as a rejected order. If you don't have any other source of income then I guess you can stick with this mistreatment but if you do, stay far away from Grubhub because you will be out of a car very soon and underpaid for your work.Great company to work for. They will prepare you for your future. They give back to their employees and the staff is wonderful. More pay would be nice.GrubHub may have a great concept, delivery direct to your door from the restaurant of your liking, but they have a horrible overall platform for drivers. First, I was with the company just three days before going to, what they call, ""driver care"" for assistance. The representative on the other end of the phone was rude and malicisously didn't help me when I began questioning her reasons for being so rude. It was just a disaster of a call with no assistance for my situation.Despite that issues, I decided to give the company another chance. What a mistake! They claim to pay a minimum hourly wage if your quota is not met. But, the underlining trick to that is that your acceptance rate has to be high enough to qualify. Well, that's really not possible when you're having to reject calls that are over 30 miles away from your current position. It's a trap! This really is not a company, nor a platform I would encourage anyone to invest themselves in.The night dispatchers try sending you everywhere.... you will have like 1 hour or even 5 mins left to your shift and they will try to send you 45 mins away to another city. like really I have a life I have another job. Plus the gas and wear on your car ! If you want to keep your drivers make sure you treat them right!The CEO of GrubHub is an intolerant bigot who only caters to one political persuasion and looks to silence balanced views in the work-place.This is a very unfriendly place to work. You need to keep your head down and not stick out or else management will treat you poorly. Never express your opinion, or wear your hair in a different way, or draw attention to yourself.The office culture here will destroy your life, and stress you out.This is a grotesquely irresponsible and terrible company. The product is extremely poor and it exploits its employees and contractors.The letter from the CEO has highlighted the company culture that bleeds down from the top.It's a democracy - to threaten those who participated in the freedom of democracy is in essence blackmail and inducing fear-mongering tactics.Horrific company culture from the highest level of management. Sub par business model leads to furious customers. The CEO threatens employees saying they have to agree with his political views. I feared for my job and security.Want a low life job that makes 11.5 an hour? Go to Walmart... you won't waste a lot of gas or destroy you car while you work.  Want to waste a lot of time waiting for Restaurants to get the food ready to deliver and NOT get paid for it? If so keep reading. If you want to waste a pile of gas money driving half way across town to have that glorious oppty to wait and get paid a peanut? Well yeap you should sign up today with Grubhub... App is not reliable and minimums are a farce. Do yourself a favor and kill the curiosity about what it will be like before you waste time and money finding out that you are not your own boss and you make about or less than what you could make at Walmart or In Out burgerDay to day at grubhub is very hectic and fast paced, customers and restaurants contacted us frequently for assistance with issues or support, and I was on the phone for most of my day, operating between several systems to assist them. From there I was promoted to the finance department where I assisted in identifying and preventing fraud committed on the website. In this role I was not on phones but did email customers quite a bit to assist in fraud claims and errors with their purchases. I learned empathy and working efficiently in a fast paced and large environment and how to rely on coworkers to assist in day to day and working together to achieve an office goal and provide quality customer service.  The hardest part of the job was not getting frustrated with difficult customers and learning to walk in their shoes when solving a problem. The most enjoyable part was my co workers and satisfying customers with good service.1- App crashes almost everyday. They ask you delete the existing one and download again. 2- They send you 4-5 miles away from your location. You drive but you don't get paid for gas. They only pay for the gas you used between the restaurant and customer.  In other words (because you don't get paid until you reach the restaurant), you pay your gas expenses out of your pocket. No need to mention about car depreciation :)3- Let's say your shift is between 11 AM to 5 PM, and you don't want to accept a delivery which is created 4:57 that shows on your statement as REJECTED. Your acceptance rate goes bad. When acceptance rate is below %75 they don't contribute for min. guaranteed payment .4- New delivery order may pop up when you are on the way for delivery. You either reject or accept it otherwise you can't inform grubhub that you delivered the existing order. It sucks especially when you drive. It is like texting when you drive.Me gusto mucho este empleo muy facil tienes la oportunidad de escoger tu propio horario tienen buen salario y es un trabajo independiente.They want you to go to other side of town for delivery which you won't be compensated for.  When you refuse for too far away,  they' ll still keep sending you the same place in the future.  This wrecks your priority and acceptance rate.Explain this: Thursday you get two orders, same area, about $8-$10 tip. Friday you get three orders, very far apart, tips $13-$15 and guess what? BOTH MADE $21. You tell me if that's fair or not. Both days are same pay!!! OK, $0.86 difference. Really?Miles I drove probably was 10+ mikes, only considered over all is about 4 miles. They also don't pay you for attempting to deliver an order, picked up food, arrived at destination and customer cancels. No pay, plus you need to get permission to click delivered? Not only I wasn't paid twice for a delivery I already picked up, but I drove far for them and NOTHING. Company doesn't value their drivers, pay sucks on top of that they want you to extend your hours, ask why it's not delivered yet? Umm it's rush hour, traffic!!Company makes billions just like Insta Cart and paying their employees $1,lmao. GH makes around that amount, yet we get scrap money while the office people make money off of us. So, if you work for GH, just take it easy and don't worry about the office and their bs needs and rules. Just respect the customer and enjoy the drive till you leave the company. Don't drive your new car for this job, get a second older car to beat.Grubhub is a wonderful company to work for.  Very diverse, very friendly. Great pay, benefits. Triple pay on holidays. Contests & monthly bonuses is a plus.When I started working with GrubHub it was awesome: lots of hours, flexible, fun. Now GOOD LUCK if you can get a shift. There were probably 40 people in my area, now it's probably double or triple that so shifts are hard to get since they are first come first serve. Also, if you're lucky enough to get a shift or two, one may suddenly disappear leaving you with no work or money. If do work a shift, they will most likely short pay you. Don't get two shifts in one day, you wont get paid for the full hours worked. Oh and if you ever have any problems regarding shifts or pay, tough luck. They tell you to email them and when they finally get back to you a week or two later (if at all), they will just have a copied & pasted response for you. Worst, most unorganized & unprofessional company ever!GRUBHUB IS A COMPLETE rip-off. I work with this company for 6-months. The first month, I was paid $10.00 HR. The following month this company sent out emails to everyone in regards to pay decrease to $9.00 hr. The pay is now $9.00 hour for every state. Delivery radius was no more than 3 mile. I delivered a cheeseburger and a diet coke 26-miles from the restaurant. Grub hub is just taking advantage of the drivers. Grub hub is trying to make all the money on the delivery driver expense. Grub hub will call you to pick up a order over 20-miles away. You will not get paid for the miles going to the restaurant. You only get paid from the restaurant to the customers house that maybe 6 blocks away. GRUBHUB is not a dependable company for work. Recently grubhub had over 20 drivers on the clock for the entire week. Lots of drivers drive full time to pay there bills. Grubhub took everyones hours for the week. Lots of people left or didn't trust this company anymore. Every week they want you to fight for blocks for hours. You are a independent contractor 1099 at the end of the year. I got paid $360 for one week. My Gas was $200 for that week. I only made $160 for the week. Lots of wear and tear on your car. Grub Hub has lots of bad reviews! Don't be a victimFun job to work, you choose your own time and you use your own car. shifts consist of three hours per shifts. Shifts start at 11:00 and the latest you can take is 9. Depending on where your located, your area can be busy or slow. The hardest part of the job has to be just finding where people live in apartments, it's like wheres waldo.First of all, understandably, you do not want me to receive this $9/h for doing nothing so you will ensure I receive a delivery once an hour with no regard for my cars mileage.If I do not accept this delivery that can be twenty five to thirty minutes away, my acceptance rate and priority as an employee goes down. It is VERY hard to see even a penny of that promised $9. I have never seen one. Grubhub; if I'm doing nothing, I expect nothing. I also expect to be able to clock in on any day. And as an independent contractor, I should be able to. If the problem is people clocking out at peak times, perhaps you can keep acceptance rate based on reliability.The $9/h if you do not receive a delivery system throws a wrench in everything. I would rather get deliveries that make sense and are relatively close. Also these deliveries make other deliveries late as it pulls me into another drivers usual area.Great place to work very friendly environment and helpful. awesome schedules laid back work environment. Just an amazing place to work and the pay is awesome way better than most jobs."

Lots of reorganization/change of management.Because these managers have no experience, they have unrealistic expectations of their employees. This sets people up for failure and creates a terrible work environment. I (and others) learned the hard way that you can't trust anything management says. I never knew where I stood and I suffered anxiety attacks on a regular basis. HR is not helpful.Excellent place to work with supportive management.  My co-workers are all team players. The most enjoyable part of the job is all the free snack and drinks they provide to all employees.A typical day at work consist of doing a walk-through in the network data center and check all the servers to make sure there are no warning lights or hard drive failures. Then checking the service desk que via Altiris and work on tickets as assigned. The days can range depending on what' going on from various new hires to conference calls or Windows Upgrades.I have learned working at this company for over 5 years various applications and how they all coexist with each other for the overall vision of the company. The hardest part of the job is various departments not communicating making it sometimes difficult to be proactive.The most enjoyable part of the job is always learning something new.Good work environment and great people to work with.Opportunity to grow horizontally as they have multiple different businesses. A little improvement from Higher management would be some level of transparency and understanding and paying attention to employee needs.Great job in my field. I enjoyed working with Guggenheim Partners.Project and Technical lead for migration of 600 computers from Windows XP to Windows 7.

Management is focused, professional, and willing to take risks.Little Opportunity for advancement, management not very good.I was involved in with the account payable invoicing in the IT department processing invoices sent to me from business units all over the world.  I took part in a successful transition of the account payable invoicing from the IT department to the accounting department.My time at Guggenheim was an amazing experience.  The people their are top notch and very gracious to their contractors.  They really go out of their way to make you feel like part of their office family.  Working here was a great chance to learn all about treasury operations. My department was extremely organized and everyone had very specific roles and goals. Because we were highly specialized it was imperative for us to work together as a team to reach our month end goals. The hardest part of this job was meeting month end deadlines. It required some late nights and early mornings but everyone was dedicated to the task at hand. I truly enjoyed working in a team environment. Management was primarily available for any questions you may have but allowed us each to work individually with minimal supervision. High stress, demanding environment. Very smart people but a culture that is not friendly.*lots of phone calls, emails and follow ups on a daily basis*learned about the equity markets and stock valuation*management here is compotent and fair*the hardest part of my job is managing expections and being involved in seemingly, every aspect of a mutual fund sales organization*the most enjoyable part of my day is working with financial advisors and building relationships"

I also quoted benefits and did the open enrollments when members were going to choose their medical plan., I also handled the flexspending accounts and also the hsa accounts too."
118,Haley & Aldrich,"I worked with this company for over a decade.   There are a lot of great people in the organization that are quite bright!  This is a great place to learn as they are progressive when it comes to their computer systems, software and their networks!  There is a lot of talent to learn and grow from, and I think very highly of many people in the organization!  There does tend to be a fair amount of turnover as the company is always trying new and different things.Great benefits!  Everyone has a different experience here depending on your management.  There are some truly talented managers, but they are a rare commodity.  Expect to work a lot of hours with little gratitude.Real understanding of life/work requirement.Non-engineer have very low potential for advancementGood team of dedicated individuals.  Very understanding staff for the most part.I worked 20 to 30 hours a week part-time giving support to a staff of 6 people and sometimes working on projects with other Haley and Aldrich employees in other states. The Columbus staff was a great group of people and I miss working with them. It was a very team environment on all projects.I most enjoyable part of the job was setting up the company conference for over 30 out of town employees and Columbus staff. Worked with hotel staff and transportation companies to arranged and organized the meeting. Worked with other H&A employees on this project to confirm flight and car rental for the people who needed it. The hardest part of the job was they just did not have enough work to keep me busy for the full 30 hours a week I needed. This company lost there funding to keep me at 20 hours.My supervisor/traineer was very informative and let me do quite a bit on my own. It was great experience."
215,Haley Aldrich,"Great contract assignment! Nice corporate work environment, Friendly and helpful colleagues.Leadership is transparent and communicative."
753,Halliburton,"The people are great and work/life balance is good. Job security is very poor. Houston management is very removed from what the company actually does.This was my first offshore job was very interesting and fun to learn new skills. i have many certifications and got to fly in helicopters pretty often best part of the job was the flights for freeGreat benefits and plenty of room for advancement. There are many jobs all over the world. They are fair and willing to train for any job and transfer to any location.Halliburton is a good way to start a career in the oilfield.  They helped me get my CDL with Hazmat and payed for it all.  I would recommend Halliburton if you are wanting to go into the oilfield.The job is challenging and there is a lot to offer. but there is no room for family they are your family, so if one is married like i am it strains ones marriage and  alone kids time. but the money is good. so one must learn to balance work with family.  hard to do!Halliburton as always been a great company to work for.  The people are great and the management is great.  There are several classes Halliburton offers and really help with the changing of the oil and gas industry.I learned the jig plant and how to operate the loader I was a leadman It could have been more better managementworking in the snow was the hardest part of this job100+ hour work weeks. Outdoors. The hardest part of the job was staying awake for so long. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new and interesting people.I really enjoyed working for Halliburton, learned a lot and had many opportunities that I took advantage of.  On the job travel to Africa and Brazil.  I was laid off May, 2016.learned a lot about oilfield procedures and values. grew as a person and learned a lot about myself and how far I could push myself.Job was pretty easy just a lot of time away from my family.  A lot of travel time and never home for the holidays.  Pay rate was one of the lowest in the area but you made a good living due to the fact that the average work week was about 85 hours or moreIs relaxed environment.Most people speak and are kind.I am looking because I need more of a challenge. The campus is beautifulI've learned many things but am looking to learn more.good work place always on the move working and being productive big on safety and always advancing towards safe and productive workOverall a good company to work for. The people where great and helped me transition to civilian life it made it easier for me because I still had a brother hood and we all worked together as one team just like the Marine corps.Erratic work schedule. Never knew when i was leaving or coming back. The actual job was easy just not knowing when i was leaving made it very hardThe work is hard and is a long hours, on land had to stay up 30 hours multiple times, offshore had to stay up 54 hours, and get little sleep at both. The people you work with make it all worth while because they help each other on the crew. Halliburton is mostly about the company and not your life style, what I mean by this is that you hardly have a life while working for this company. The money is good but running and maintaining the multi million dollar equipment makes the job a little better. As with any other job as long as you work and don't hide you can improve your position and move up in the company.They had a very good culture and great learning experience. Made a lot of friends and worked in a good environment. Most of the skills that I know today have come from the hard work that I have done learning and this company.Halliburton is a great place to learn about the oil and gas industry. There are many opportunities available at Halliburton locations around the world.I liked the company goals and culture. A change in pay and facility(management)  prompted me to seek other means of employment. Enjoyed my time at the company and would work there again.Overall the company was good to work at.  It has a very good life center and cafeteria.  They are big on safety at the workplace.The job itself was good u get to work on new and old cars that came through the shop. The pay was not very good but I was a newcomer as well. I had to leave due to the 1hr drive I had to make but good company."
650,Harris Corporation,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Harris Corporation. The management and overall environment are fantastic. My favorite part of the job is the people with which I work.Harris has some of the best technology going. Great for engineers.In my dept the older workers were not considered when applying for positions.Jobs were given to younger candidates and young females. Thought it was a fluke at first but after five positions were slanted to much younger less experienced candidates, contractors and Coops.  Frequently the requisition would be changed to fit the younger candidate.Focus is on education and not on experience.  Only the chosen ones are given opportunities for promotion (pre-selected by management).  Environment is cold and distant.  There is a lack of focus on a team culture.  Job security is non-existent.  Management continues to reduce employee benefits and increase individuals personal expenses for healthcare and other benefits.In a nutshell, that's it - good pay, great people (the best) but absolutely no loyalty or job security. The hiring swells followed by hiring freezes and layoffs, followed by more swells, it's all pretty unnerving and disruptive. It's nice to know my team appreciates the hard work and overtime, if only upper management could do the same - their decisions to outsource key pieces of our product make it sometimes impossible to deliver quality.I enjoyed working for Harris for the time that I did, but I was unfortunately laid off due to a contract being cancelled on the government side. Therefore everyone who was working on that project was let go. This was also during the recession so I feel that contributed to it. I would still work there again if I got the chance, they are very good.A typical day starts with a good cup of coffee, logging in to the system to get to work. I learned that using email to communicate with internal and external customers is a great tool in getting resolutions.   My manager relied on my ability as a fast learner, to work independent. Good friends with co-workers.From my experience, the company seems to care about keeping their employees happy. The work culture is very friendly and open, they encourage new hires to contribute from the start. Managements was willing to listen to any suggestions people had on making improvements. Overall, I would recommend working for this companyThe company is very well establish in few market niches such as Weather Satellites, Air-Traffic systems, and moderate IT systems.IT was challenging to innovate due to the long time retention of certain cultured management, who they were set in their own way.Very good place to begin your career. There are numerous opportunities for personal grown and good benefits. Typical work week is a 9/80, 4/10, or 5/40 schedule and usually have the weekends and nights off. Its an engineering company so to get in the door, usually a degree is required.Facilities  does not have a typical day, everything is different  everyday. My managers were awesome and they made you feel like a member of the team.I loved my time working for Harris Corporation.  I was giving the opportunity to succeed through hard work.  In my last role, I managed 20+ government networks security compliance.  I enjoyed interpreting government policies and implementing that guidance to the network configuration.I truly enjoyed my position at Harris.  I enjoyed the interaction and providing immediate support to the quality assurance group, supervisors, mechanical/electrical engineering, procurement, scheduling, product analysis lab, production floor associates, assemblers, testers, and troubleshooters.Overall, the job was perfect except the relocation to New York was not a preferred choice.I met so many good people at Harris corp. different learning opportunities are provided. great team and leadership. I would recommend it to other people.They are the better paying companies in the area, but short lived when they downsize.  They treat managment with high regards and do not respect the lower paying employees.Used to be a decent place to work.  What they lacked in pay scale they made up for in benefits.  Since they switched insurance companies they no long can justify the poor pay scale.This was my first job on the East Coast of the US (which I took a big pay-cut for, but was told it was worth it)... I nearly moved right back out West. I stayed for 8 or 9 months, tried to give it the ""benefit of the doubt"", but management was entirely incompetent. Having been in this field for over ten years, I have picked up a few tips and tricks... Made some suggestions to management that would help the whole of Harris, resolving issues before people even called in, and I was SCOLDED for this. Their reasoning was that ""we need those phone calls""... that's right-- they are more interested in job security than they are resolving issues.Tip for management-- if your entire job can be replaced by a batch file and a spreadsheet, you are IRRELEVANT. Go back to school.ProsMost of the employees are highly talented and dedicated and work to meet the needs of the customer. Harris provides an environment where people can see the impact of the work they do as most projects are small-medium sized programs and each team member plays an important role. For the employees that have not yet lost their 9/80 work week, this provides a nice work/life balance.ConsThe corporate focus has shifted away from the customer and is overwhelmingly fixated on cost cutting. The and the primary means for achieving this objective is reducing labor costs through layoffs of senior personnel, cutting salaries and reducing benefits. Benefits have declined sharply in recent years. There is a great distrust of executive management and morale is very low.Never hire people fully on and the projects never last as expected always trying find work pay is ok this not a job or a careerEven as a full time employee i didn't start with benefit's because i was considered a ""job shopper"" which i was hired and paid by an another company where they were paid say 20 an hour for me and only paid me 15 an hour. once a spot opened in Harris itself i could be accepted or not which normally takes a year.Harris is a great place to work. It re-introduced unlimited paid time off program, which is one of the most coveted employee benefits. The rest is fairly standard with the corporate culture.if you find yourself employed in this company don't let this job go! you can actually support your family with these wages!"
758,Harris County,"I liked working with the public. Never had any problems with management. No problems with coworkers pretty enjoyable job over all.If I could return to work here, I would! The ONLY reason why I did not maintain employment here was out of both my and their hands.I learned a great deal, and it was an incredible experience. Everyone was really knowledgeable and efficient in their day to day. I would recommend anyone work here if given the opportunity.A typical day at work came with long lines, upset customers, screaming babies, and continuously having to explain to customers why their paperwork couldn't be processed. I learned not to buy a vehicle from just any car dealership. The hardest part of the job was the short breaks and even shorter lunches.Every day is something new, and there's no way you can prepare for it. Management has been there for years and they play play favoritism. The pay is not that great .You can do what ever you want at this job. Once you re hired on it is very hard to get fired from here. A lot of people trying to get ahead and will do anything to get aheadThis place is extremely unprofessional! Management is a joke. It's impossible for you to grow here. They have a flexible work schedule but most of my time here has been spent surfing the Internet. NO WORK TO DO. Didn't learn anything here. The pay is ok. Vacation and sick days or comp time must be used for natural disasters or building closure issues. No short or long term disability. THEY DO NOT PAY FOR EMPLOYEE PARKING EVEN THOUGH THEY OWN MOST OF THE PARKING GARAGES IN DOWNTOWN. I've been on a wait list for a parking spot for two years now. You must provide your own forks, knives, spoons, plates, napkins AND water!Filing mail, answering phone calls/emails. Seeing client's, making home visits, and frequent court visits to discuss client's status while on supervision.If you're a multi-tasker, this is a great job for you, which was a great job for me.  I enjoyed being the bookkeeper and also working as retention of volunteers.  The folks in the office are hard working , dedicated people who do not work for the $$ but for the best interest of the volunteers.a typical day at work was to be able to make my customers as comfortable as possible. Being that they were at the tax office bothered a lot of individuals, and was always making sure they left with a smile on their face.i'd rather not comment on management.My co workers were somewhat great, the hardest part of my job was rejecting customers because they didn't have the correct documents for their transactions.Over worked, and made to do double shift at the last minute. Some coworkers think they are the  Captain. People are constantly in your personal life. The pay is not is not good, but you may never have a life outside of the agency. Too many cases. May not get home until 9:00 or ten at night. Run!A typical job as a Forensic Investigator Assistant or Forensic Investigator III would vary from day to shift, now day is the same. Some days you might be in the office answering phones, but 99.9% of the times the job requires you to go either alone or with another coworker to pick up bodies at hospital, scenes like highways, freeways, houses, under bridges, under trains, automobile accidents, bayous, airports, plane crashes, boats, lakes, you name it!! The ones no many people like are decomposing bodies, specially if it is inside a hoarder's house in the summer, children, and floaters or drawing etc... The difficulty of the job is when the deceased is heavy and you have to carry the body down the stairs, from attics, roof, so many weird places. It's difficult to explain everything in a short paragraph. The position for Assistants are pretty much picking bodies, triage calls and other morgue related duties. FI III take photos of certain scenes and have to do what Assistants do. Assistant's make around (14+/HR), Fi III around (16+/HR). Fi II are the ones that go to scenes with Assistants and Fi III, but Fi II only take photos and write the reports and make around ($18+/HR). If you are skinny, you might not want to apply for Assistant or Fi III, they are usually big people that do the job because of the amount of lifting required, like some said: this is a muscle job.Benefits? Aetna provides health insurance and it's free for you, no overtime is paid, instead they accumulate that, and if you ever resign, you receive a big check if you have a lot of comp. Time. Raises are very  more... bad, pretty much pennies a year. PD: make sure before you apply that you will stand seeing dead people in many different ways, decomposing, hanging, dawning, chopped into pieces, and so many unthinkable ways to die. Be prepare to stand odors, the heat, the cold, the rain, etc.. Don't think you're going to be working under the rain with an umbrella. It's a dirty position, but rewarding for some.  lessHarris County is a nice place to work if you are attempting to get your foot in the door with gaining work experience. The culture of the department is very family-oriented. The sense of family makes the fast paced work and deadline driven obligations of the job bearable.Great county, but lacks affordable housing, has good schools and great people. However, county commission reluctant to take on hard issues and pay employees,  Certain commissioners micro manage and harass employees.Work consist of having a good understanding of HUD rules and regulation. Must be able to multi-task and have a good working relationship with grant recipients.Great place to work at while in school. Awesome work environment. It is always fun and time goes by fast. Great food, competitive pay. hardest part is working holidays and too many customers to deal with at the same time.Working have Harris County has been some of the worst experience ever. Management is extremely inconsistent always making up policy as they see fit, they don't care about their employees it's impossible to try to move up or to another department without having the ""politics"" in the way. Working in detention it's like of the employees are the real criminals because they're out they aren't looking at the residents/inmates, they're constantly looking at us to see what type of errors we make and not trying to tell us to rectify it more like trying to find a way to fire us. Morale is completely blow upper management and administration can do stuff like call in or what have you and when lower employees to do the same we get penalized and have consequences to face. Just like when they were recently on the news none of upper adman had consequences to face only lower workers which is completely unfair.This job requires someone who can work in a fast paced environment and able to complete tasks with minimal supervision. Attention to detail and whereabouts. As a Screen Technician you are required to go through training and being on time is a requirement. It requires attention to detail and ability to maintain total security of information obtained. You work alongside law enforcement and other government agencies and officials. Co workers are there to complete the same job you are, therefore don't expect training to be something just taught. All senses will be used in this field.Low morale within office.. Petty arguements cause larger issues. Employee Over sensitivity causes workplace uncomfortableness.First employee to become Lead Clerk 3 months after training. Quick learnerGreat customer serviceGreat way to meet attorneyGreat people and excellent benefits virtually no job growth this place is perfect for people at a latter stage in life that desire no promotions or increase in salary. Just job security"
765,Harris County Flood Control District,"Serviced tickets sent to the help desk and trouble shot software and hardware malfunctions. also reimaged every computer in the department to windows 7.A typical day at work was going into my boss' office and having a review of the previous day's work. Good interpersonal communication skills is a plus.My time at HCFCD has been a terrific experience. The mission of the District is an important one, and management does a great job of keeping us focused on our role in the County. The people are intelligent and professional.Benefits, specifically health and retirement, are generous.Unfortunately for me, there are currently no career advancement opportunities.It's a great place to work and the environment is a very close knit one.  Everyone has a good time.  Travel is required in many of the departments, but it is all within the city.Scan all types of documents (plans, reports, etc). Working schedule is flexible. Relieve switchboard when needed."
580,Hassett Willis & Company,"Company is very young and energetic; management is very focused on personality, politics, socializing and cliques and somewhat cynical, possibly Machiavellian.  Co-workers not professionally diverse but eager to learn.  Company very focused on formula driven growth rather than innovation, although some staffers are inquisitive about learning other disciplines and innovation.  Most enjoyable part of the company is working with an enthusiastic staff, while hardest part is team building - not a team culture.  I really enjoy working here! The Downtown DC office is a fun environment to work in -complete with a foosball table/game room and massage chair. The Partners of the company are really down to Earth, easy to get along with, and you can tell they really care about the employees. HWC does a lot of nice things for its employees like Happy Hours, parties, monthly birthday cakes, and a paid day of community service. The management team really seems to notice and reward hard work in terms on bonuses and promotions.wouldn't work there again... the management sucks and the projects are unpredictable"

289,HealthTap,"Able to easily collaborate often with other talented developers, designers and product managers. Tight space; lots of combustion. High energy, focused, and innovative - it was an academic experience in and of itself.I worked as a contract writer for Healthtap.com nearly one year ago, and though I completed their workload prior to their given deadline, they failed to pay me (even with multiple email and phone call reminders) for over three months past the pay-by date. They were highly disorganized and often changed my writing assignments after I completed them, forcing me to go back and re-write entire articles because they changed the topic at the last minute. They took long periods of time before responding to any emails or queries, and lacked communication about assignments and articles.HealthTap is a great place to work if you wish to solve problems that affect people's lives in a way that matters probably more than any other- by taking care of their health. A great place, with fantastic people you can learn a lot from and have a great time with."

The warehouse employees  are constantly forced to work 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, face sudden and unexplainable schedule changes, NO notice about days off (if any), safely is ignored, worker fatigue is rampant, and inexperienced people are operating equipment in a unsafe manner. Let's see how all office and management do the work for a couple of months, and see how their family/marriage life is. With one day off, they wouldn't last, or change.Worked there for 16 years. I've seen a lot of changes through the years.  You are able to be promoted  with in the company if you are a hard worker, and lead by example.  The changes that are taking place now is for the good of job security for long term. I personally know change is hard, but to compete with other Food manufacturing plants you have to try different programs to cut cost and save money in order to stay competitive in the food manufacturing world.Good job to make money (a lot of hours) but no flexibility on personal time. The work force is pretty much all everyday hard working people just trying to make a living. The worst part of the company is that the HR Dept. runs the plant. they have no consideration for talent and are constantly threatening people with their job. The management are good people that seem to have their hands tied from making improvements due to corporate policies that don't work. The Union is basically none existent when it comes to representation.I miss Heinz in Pocatello.....nine years of a daily battle to meet and exceed expectations.  But in the long run seeing them go has been  extremely  hard on my family.  In other words  if you're  lucky to work  for them appreciate  what they give back. Hard work is rewarding... I felt with them.  I have had to work two jobs just to match what they payed me in Pocatello  Idaho....Company management, not plant management, is too concerned with saving every dollar.  Company shut down 7 plants and relocated production lines with very poor planning.  Money is being cut in the wrong places.  I'm all for saving money and reallocating tasks, however it cannot affect the safety and quality of very profitable products.  Management needs to take a step back and look at the picture as a whole and put the right people in place to get the job done right the first time.Fast paced and multi faceted. Hands on experience - learn as you go - no support from management. Most co-workers great - very supportive and respectful.The hardest part of the job after new management took over is being micromanaged. I've always been a self-starter, who takes ownership of my work but when constantly questioned, it starts to wear on you. I most enjoyed feeling like I was a contributing team member. It was challenging at times but, overall a good experience.I start off by seeing how things are running and complete starting my paper for tracability.. I've learned the importance of team work and working together with other to achieve a common goal. leadership was import in completing difficult task.Getting people that were lazy to work with the team was the most difficult task, but it was achieve. seeing how production numbers at the end of the day.Within my first 5 months of working, the plant manager, production manager, quality manager, a production supervisor, a quality supervisor, and a finance supervisor all left the plant. The production supervisor and quality supervisor positions were not up for replacement. There's no sense of team work. 3G has insane cost cutting methodology that takes away from any experience and is not rewarding at all.My day begins with a shift meeting then I go to my line and check my labels and do my quality suites and maintence the machine if needed. Then I prepare my line to begin running. Since working my job I've learn to be patient and never rush because you may make a mistake. I learned to work safe and keep my machine clean at all time so that it functions better. Management lets you know that you are doing a good job and my co-workers always willing to help out if needed. the hardest part of my job is doing changeovers where you change the parts out for different bottle size. the most enjoyable part of my job is coming to work everday and just smiling knowing that I love my job and interacting with my co-workers.This company pays well but that's where the pros stop. Management is a joke and a lot are straight out of college with no knowledge of the processes but still think they know it all. High turnover and no regard for family life, nearly impossible to schedule family events without the fear of schedule changes.like every normal job you punch in and put on your apron and go to your destination line ...if your first time there working you'll be train to all lines in order to find out were your abilities are need the most....when ever your having a problem with whatever it is they are always there to help you out..as for your fellow peers is like feeling home always there to help you out...the only part that the floor are concrete and your standing more than 9 hours and your feet tent to hurt so have some good shoes or boots...the good think about is that you can sometimes get some product on holiday to take to your familyI enjoyed my employment with Kraft. It was my first job in the warehouse industry and I maximized my potential while employed, from trainee to management within a years time.Kraft was very good to work for and many had 30+ years experience.  Opportunities abound and it was a great company to grow with.  I learned to organize a large group of people at off-site locations to interact with other departments.  I worked with a great team who have remained friends.  I was treated with respect in an office of mostly males and was shown all the appropriate thanks for a job well done.Everyday before you start work you have a meet on what your team did on the day before. Also have to warm up. One a year they doing something for there employees and their families.  You could always go to your team leader if you have a problem with anything or you just don't understand.Kraft was a fast paced , never boring place of employment.  I started out on an entry level position and advance to operator position within a satisfactory time period. The management was excellent at my time of hiring, and my co-workers were team players and willing to help in any way. The hardest part of the job was getting product out on a scheduled time when we had maintenance issues or machine failure, but we had a good maintenance crew that worked hard to ensure we kept on schedule.  The most enjoyable part of the job was taking pride in the work one accomplished at the end of the day.Kraft was my second home. I had the pleasure of working with some of the best managers from the beginning of my career with Kraft to the very end. Kraft gives their employees many opportunities in the work field. Including training, seminars, hands-on, etc.The typical job at Heinz was moving around, taking care of the product, and fixing boxes. I learned a lot of new things making sure there was enough product in the boxes, were do they keep the product, how the be able to handle fast machinery, what kind off chemicals are used to clean and disinfect the machines. Management were really nice. I enjoyed being around my coworkers they were really friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was how to fix the fast machinery but I was willing to learn. The most enjoyable part the job being at work.the sad story behind Kraft, many people don't know Kraft started about 100 years ago in Allentown. Sadly it became the worst managed facility, the waste was beyond belief, while people in charge ( plant manager, HR manager and the like ) made one stupid decision after another , allowed bigotry and nepotism in running the place, while pretending to put on a good front.The maintenance supervisor was a wonderful guy, but had a weak personality so he was overworked, the lead technician, had no idea whatsoever about leadership.I could see the inefficiencies from day one, I wasn't surprised about  the decision from those who acquired the company to close the plant.Since the KraftHeinz merger, the cutbacks began and all the maintenance supervisors were the first to go,  Then people off the floor were promoted to Lead positions and was still expected to perform there duties as a floor mechanic.  All this for just a $1.00 more an hour while production Leads were given $4.05 an hour more.  This is at the Granite City plant where this job opening is located.  If you like working with young inexperienced mechanics and like to be stabbed in the back at every turn then this job is for you.  I worked there for almost 8 years and it was a great place to work once upon a time.  But now management condones an adversarial (stab you in the back and smile in your face) atmosphere and is always looking for any reason to write a mechanic up."

294,Hewlett-Packard Company,"Overall, I had a great experience with a lot of multi-faceted functions and diverse groups. It was fun to see how everything meshed into a giant enterprise that we tried to keep afloat. I was part of various SWAT teams dispatched to either plug leaks or develop new processes to improve the overall lethargy that develops with any large organization, as it tends to entropy, per natural law. Frequent change and renewal were the keys to continued success.work with advancement but never a pay raise; worked as a family where everyone was able to help each other; hardest part of job when someone expected to get a complete refund for shipments that they received 1-2 years ago; most enjoyable when able to help someone when the computer messed up and to make them extra happy!Awesome job.  Great pay, very fun people to work with. I was an inside account rep, worked closely with our partners in helping our clients solve their technical needs.  Terrible CEO.  Would fly in and promise there is nothing going on and then lay off 20 people for no reason the next day.

Management respects individual contributors, and places a high value on employee recognition.  I would recommend HP to anyone as a great place to work.  There is opportunity for training and advancement.  The HP way is still alive an well with many managers, which means work life balance and flexible work schedules.Working at HP/HPE has provided me the opportunity to expand my knowledge and skills and adapt them to different environments and scenarios.  The working environment has changed dramatically due to a profound reorganization, however, HP/HPE has been very good to me.  The groups I have worked with have been staffed by great people, my direct management has always been open and supportive, and the hardest part is leaving the company at this point.

The HP Way.  The essence that the employees' brainpower was the company's most important resource.  This once magnificent company is a shell of it's former self through 236+ acquisitions and over 50 spinoffs. The people were the most intelligent, focused, hysterical team players I've ever had the privilege of working with.Typical day consisted of attempting to help customers on the contract via remote connection. Most customers were expecting a technician to come onsite. Metrics for the job went up while the number of tickets that were able to be pulled from the queue went down. Customers generally did not know their own company's internal policy and would want to argue, thus most tickets from the queue would be sent to a field technician to explain to them first hand. The workload and policies became even more frustrating as time progressed as the red tape involved became more cumbersome to work with, our closure numbers needed to increase and our number of tickets that were received decreased. It became a lose-lose situation rapidly.Moving away from work at home flexibility even in the technology space, only in strategic locations like Plano, TX; Pontiac, MI; Colorado Springs, CO; Atlanta, GA; etc.Work life balance is a challenge given layoffs and additional workload inline with strategy to resource labor cost by switching from highly skilled resources to mid/lower skilled resources.I spend about half of my day using Excel spreadsheets to prepare a route to stop by as many printers that need serviced. I have learned many different things about laser printing since the start of this job. My team lead and my boss were my two biggest motivators in getting my certification. The majority of my co-workers are nice, respectful people. There are a few that act rather unprofessional when they become stressed. The most difficult part of my current job, is really not even difficult. Covering 2.8 million square feet on foot 5 days a week is physically tiring, but it is a mental cake-walk. I love working with the many different models of printers and all other platforms of technology in such a large call-center environment.Worked as phone support to schedule a time for the Wal-Mart store and the HP service tech to be on site to change out the main store server.

Management is a joke. Always asking to get a new project done within an impossible time frame. No promotions given no matter how long you work there and how hard you work. What I learned after working here is how not to properly manage people and have good time management. The most enjoyable part of the job was leaving it.Management is losing focus and to many layers of it, not enough workers in the trenches.  I enjoy the work I do and the coworkers that I have, however the open door policy will lead to your demise."

155,Hollister Staffing,"The work culture is a great experience. Everyone is down to earth but yet work extremely hard. The energy and vibe is welcoming and I would recommend anyone to apply. I learned a lot of things in the first two weeks.I would usually come in, put my bag in the locker room, clock in, go to my manager ask them what they want me to do that day and go do that. The managers are really nice and outgoing, I pretty much get along with everybody. The hardest part sometime might be with a customer that won't let you do your job and them arguing with you. The best part I think is just working with my co-workers and helping out a customer that needs help with an item.Stay away from these guys Incompetent never call never get updates.Why do I waste my time with these used car salesman outfitsthis company is fun and it teaches you that you shouldn't be afraid to talk to people. Also that everyday you work that you are never doing the same thing. the people that work there are amazing people they make me work hard.There is never a dull moment and there is always a constant buzz in the atmosphere. The environment is super friendly and smiles all around. There is a lot of team work and encouragement to get the work done. Casual Fridays are great.My time working for Hollister at the Massachusetts Medical Society in Waltham, MA was wonderful. The work environment was great, and the people, and the pay were great as well. I really enjoyed this assignment!They've always found me a place to work when i needed them. They always placed me at places that i loved."
722,Home Depot,"I was thankful to be hired in a speciality department (doors & windows) because it allowed me to sit down with customers and discuss their needs for new doors or windows. I usually worked evening shifts and Saturdays, as well as the occasional Sunday. As a student, it was a decent part-time job that helped pay the bills, and HR was always helpful when I had a scheduling conflict between school and work.Typical day was helping customers and stocking shelves.I learned a lot about all the different departments which are great life skills, also learned how to provide superiors customer service.Management was poor when I was there, but have heard it has improved a lot.Co-workers were great and fun to work with, made the day go by smoother when we had projects together.Hardest part of the job was the high demand of everything that did not involve the customers directly. i.e. big lists of stuff to do during your shift and a limited amount of time to do them.Most enjoyable part of the job was driving forklift.A decent company to work for. After working in over twelve stores on a regular basis, I found most of the associates to be very friendly, upbeat and a generally good morale.However, there are also extreme pro's & con's depending on your position and if you are an actual store employee or a MET employee.The overall culture of the company is good. The hourly rates are in one big bucket as opposed to being determined based on job requirements and responsibilities. The annual raises are honestly a joke at .25 cent being the maximum for non-management staff.A big plus is the option to transfer is you decide to relocate.Over all, in a scale of 1 - 10, I give The Home Depot a 7 and that is primarily because of the benefits. However, because of the low rate of pay, the benefits eat your check away.overall HD is a good company but I can only Speak on my experience with my own store. When I first started there It was very hopeful and i was looking to grow, that idea quickly turned into a headache as I felt my management didn't have a a good grasp on how to maintain morale among staff (little to no recognition for achievements, constant negative critique), they practiced in favoritism (awards and promotions stayed within a particular circle) and it was very apparent to many of the staff. after awhile progression felt non existent no matter how much was put into the work. many times it felt as if our store didn't practice the Core Values that Home Depot preaches, but as I said my experience my particular store.I have loved my time with this company and do find that it is very enjoyable to work in most stores.I do find the pay to be a little low especially for those that take their own time to learn new skills and receive extra training to not receive a pay raise. I will warn you that if you are part time (I am not) that hours for the most part are very limited through most of the year with the exception of holidays (off seasons you can get as low as 6 hours for the week to 18 hours). You also will not receive benefits if you are only part time. The good thing is that they do work with school and child care situations as long as you have the paper work to back up your needs.There are many opportunities to learn new skills, but management at the store level can hinder your progress greatly, even if you are well qualified for a supervisor position.  This is a good job to have while in college, but I would not make this a career, unless you absolutely love this area of business.  Be careful of adding new skills and letting management know, because you will be finding yourself taking on more responsibility without appropriate compensation, such as raises or recognition.Lastly, store managers do not care if you have a college degree.  It seems having an advanced education would benefit those who work in the corporate office.You have little or no career path at Home Depot. They talk a big game and promise a good career path and training to make sure it happens, but does not happen if you are a older person with a great management background. The hours of scheduling are radical at best and you are always under manned and over worked for very little compensation. Although I was rated a 5 out 5 performance for my work evaluation I was never considered for promotion because I was pigeon holed in a certain area and increased their sales by over 20% in the departments I was assigned to work in.  Would I recommend a career path at Home Depot. Only if you want to be a slave to the company if you are a department manager or assistant store manager. They are very much abused.A typical work day depends on what you can do, machine operators are expected to do a majority of the work to maintain and recover departments. Other associates don't always do much and it does sometimes get all dropped on one person later in the day in addition to customers who are occasionally confrontational. Management is usually good on all aspects and help get the job done when possible. Hardest part of the job is doing the parts of the jobs that the other associates have refused to do that gets tacked onto your list.Great benefits and if you do a good job and show you know what you're doing they take care of you anyway possible.I love working for Home Depot.  Great management, upper and in-store.  It really felt like people cared for my career, and were always willing to help me advance.  Recognition was amazing.  Whenever I did well, I heard about it.  Worst part of the job is the work/life balance.  With an unpredictable schedule (As a department supervisor, I did not have a consistent schedule) it was really hard to plan for things outside of work.  Also, pay was barely enough to support myself.  I did well and got raises, but it really wasn't substantial.I learned great customer service skills and commercial contractor skills. A typical work day would be switching between departments throughout the store to assist both the Do-It-Yourself and Commercial Contractor customers. Many of the store management were always very helpful. The hardest part of the job was during inventory count and reorganization where it was very taxing physically. I enjoyed working mostly with the customers and making a difference in their shopping experience.I have worked here ten years and it has only gotten worse as the environment is not one of positivity but of negativity.  Associates are asked to do way more than possible and then asked why customers are upset?  It seems as if quality associates are few and far between because most associates don't know much and their shelf life is a couple of months so experience is severely lacking.  If you are knowledgeable you are taken advantage of by fixing what others mess up but nothing gets done to stop the mistake from happening again which is mind numbing.  The pay raises are laughable as you can hit all your numbers and do it all but your getting what everyone else gets which is not much.  Pay is horrifically bad and most associates are way under the poverty line while working here.  There are no cost of living wages so pay does not match what's going on in society but nothing is ever addressed.I  am currently a supervisor at the Home Depot. The culture is phenomenal, the associates and managers couldn't be better. Compensation is competitive but could be better, especially for skilled individuals. Hours are erratic, but recently full-time employees were given fixed schedules. Lots of advancement opportunities if you are willing to work for them.At Home Depot, the associates and management is almost like family, so almost everyone is pretty friendly. The training is great. You do occasionally have to interact with disgruntled customers, but if you keep a positive outlook and attitude, and irate customer will easily turn into an understanding one. The health benefits are great. You can receive a bonus every 6 months and a raise every year. The vacation time is competitive with other companies, and you often feel like a valued associate.On an average day I could be needed in almost any department. Management is average with some managers going above and beyond and some falling very short. Fellow employees range from very knowledgeable to highly incompetent and there are a few who flat out lie to the customers just to get a sale. The compensation is a joke being that they offer you minimum wage and ""benefits"" and there is no way to advance within the company unless you want to make it a career. It would take at least 20 years to even become a store manager let alone any real management within their corporate side.The Home Depot is a great company that allows opportunity to grow. With this company a worker can advance him/herself as far as they want to. The environment is very friendly, and customers have a lot of respect for the company as well as the workers. Management was great and always available when needed. My co-workers were all very nice and made it fun to come to work everyday. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet the whole shift but you barely notice it. The most enjoyable part of the job is giving good customer service and receiving praise and compliments from customers you've assisted.The management and staff are great but some of the internal politics are a bit unfair. Promotions are slow and rare and there are very few full time opportunities. The benefits they provide are decent (if you can afford them). I struggle as a normal employee to prove my value and earn a promotion. There is some favoritism in upper management, but it still wouldn't hinder me from wanting to advance within this company.Fast paced, heavy customer interactions, need to be able to think on your feet or have the computer skills to search out the products that the customer is wanting.Some heavy lifting is required and scheduling can be difficult to work around at times.Great benefits package for full time and part time jobs.Hard work at times so you really EARN a paycheck.Supervisors do not care. They're just there to fund their hobbies outside of work don't do much but walk around and chit chat. GWA's work hard day in and day out. High turnover, nobody wants to work there and people are constantly being fired because of productivity numbers which are poorly in place and work against you. they are always hiring because no one wants to work there after a few months. Very stressful and constant changes by people who don't do the work. If you have to work there make it temporary and exit before they find a reason to let you go because of their poor management and poorly thought out changes.There's just nothing good to say.I've literally sat in ""Process improvement"" meetings where management would ask employees how they would improve things.  Employees would come up with many many ways things could run better and how to fix processes and each idea was met with; ""That's not necessary, you just need to work harder.""There's also a massive issue with first line managers constantly throwing each other under the bus.Their mantras are ""Hard work and Accountability""The result are beaten down employees and a culture of CYA above all else.I have never seen or heard a company spend so much money on food for the employees. This is supposed to make the employees moral better, but I don't see it. The food they buy is so unhealthy. How do they expect people to work with enthusiasm after they eat potato salad and baked beans? The management at my store is not very proactive, from what I see. They seem to busy to help with anything physical and if you ask for help they say they will get some for you, but you never get any. Management does not promote teamwork well.Learned more at THD about how to manage a business than any business school could ever teach me. They pride themselves on internal promotion and advancement! THD does an outstanding job at training and developing from  one day on the job! Great place to build wealth!"
721,Honeywell,"overseen the field installers of water meters and electrical metersPerformed energy saving tests on homes. Wasn't a bad place to work. Just was funded by state contract and the contract ended and wasn't renewed.Honeywell forced employees to take 1-3 weeks off without pay, reduced pay and outsourced jobs to China, Mexico and India.  If you do something that your manager does not like, it is sure to go into your annual review.  If you do something that your manager likes, it may not show up in your annual review.Of course, the job conditions depend on where you work and the management culture. My department at Honeywell was chaotic because management changed so often. Layoffs always loomed. One was always under the gun and no one seemed to be happy.My typical work day consist of requesting quotes and placing orders.  In addition to regular duties, working on projects and continuously improve the work environment. I have been given the opportunity to learn and gain respect from my capability to learn quickly. I have strengthened my communication skills a great deal. As with any job, getting along with co-workers depends on you as a person and how to deal with certain situations. I get along with my co-workers here at Honeywell very well. As far as the difficulty of my job, I do not find it difficult. I do have a great boss that helps his team understand so we achieve things we want or need to learn. The most enjoyable part of my job is the flexibility and consideration of things that I may need to take care of away from work. As long as things are not continuous, they seem to work with you if something comes up.It is a large Company but keeps close contact with employees. Has been some issues with traveling. company truck taken away and ask to use person trans.Do not work here. They are cutting benefits, cutting vacation and holidays. They took away work from home. Do not consider this job unless you are really needy. There is no assigned seating and you will have no desk as it is open space. No privacy whatsoever. Go elsewhere as they are trying to force people out now.A typical day at work involve solving manufacturing problems and other processes. This site design and build unique RF components and antenna that does not allow for trial and error to solve production problems.I work 2nd shift and the people I work with are very easy to get along with. I really like the Supervisor but not a big fan of upper management. The site Supervisor is a good guy but corporate really keeps his hands tied. At least from what I've seen. I really like the work but a couple of times a year there is a big push. That can lead to a lot, sometimes mandatory overtime. Overall it is not a bad company to work for but don't expect a  lot of opportunity for advancement.I spent 18 years with Honeywell and was very happy with the knowledge given to me and the talent i gave back.  Management was the issue.  Their name was more important to themselves then the growth and employers in the company.Company is not doing well and employees are taking the brunt of it.  Pay reductions, bonus reduction, no merit increases, work from home eliminated, healthcare costs increased and so on while instituting furloughs with no change in expectations.A company that pays very fair their employees with very good compensation and benefits package. Health insurance, life insurance and good work-life balance.New CEO taking over.  Lots of organizational change took place prior to that and lot's of change continuing.  It was a good company in the early days of the Cote era. I wish them the best.set goals & able to express oneself through tasks & like to be able to be innovative be working with fellow employees with like mind sets. upwards & downwards feed bring both upper & lower managers together.Excellent opportunities for professional  growth. Telecommuting is allowed which allow you to provide an excellent service to your accounts.If you cannot say something nice, say nothing at all.  Lots of really good people that help and also are there to make things better.job was good while it lasted, company as a whole is a major international corporation.  that is hard to be in contact with, but the program worked on is greatGood environment to work and very good people to learn from. Management very professional and willing to train and listen and empower to get the job done. It's a nice place to work if you want to begin your career in the aerospace community.The work is interesting and usually fairly rewarding. The pay is pretty average but you're expected to put in more hours/more work and assume more responsibility than comparable positions at similar companies. The company is definitely driven from the top down with concerns for stock price and responsibility to shareholders and executive bonuses at the forefront.OK.  No issues... all good.   Great place to work on all shifts. It's a union house so... Don't know what to say other than this survey is getting on my nerves INDEED.Great Company to work for. Lots of talented people. You will learn lots of new thing with the technical diversity of this company. The only problem is the politics at this location are horrible. Employees seem to come to work in fear. Many of them seem frightened to speak or say hello. lots of rules and regulations, and you are under constant surveillance. Atmosphere is not very friendly."
497,Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield,"Excellent place to work especially for those whom have never been employed in the health insurance industry. I really enjoyed working here and meeting some incredibly intelligent people while contributing to the ongoing success of a 70-plus year old non-profit organization. The Blue Cross Blue Shield brand is well recognized.At Horizon BCBSNJ--similar to other licensees in the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association--there is a large faction of pessimistic individuals in leadership positions, holding on to antiquated business models and perceptons with white-knuckled grips.  As a result, it can be extremely challenging to present business case for, and then receive approvals  for abandoning the status quos--e.g., adopting more progressive, data-driven and primary intelligence-driven approaches to driving sales and marketing instead of relying on ""gut"" instincts and anecdotal stories.Worked in case management for 9 years.  Was micromanaged last 6 months there along with others with 9+ years invested in the company, felt like being picked on and weeded out.  Direct supervisor needed management skills in working with co-workersAnswered benefit questions for future and current customerMy co-workers were friendly and great to work with.Great pay.I learned to work well with everyone even irate customers.Horizon BCBS is an excellent place to work!!! The management team on up cared very much about their employees and work environment.It offer opportunity to learn more about the health insurance industry. My coworkers are very knowledgeable n we work great together as a team.Working within a team to meet a common goal was enjoyable whenever everyone completed their part.  The management only concern was how much money did they save the company by any means necessary.Worked in the call center where the work environment was fast paced, busy, and you had to stay on top of frequent changes in the healthcare market.  Co-workers were extremely helpful, but dealing with management can be challenging.  The hardest part of the job was staying on top of the changes, and the most enjoyable part was the ability to assist people in their time of need.I enjoyed working at Horizon BBSNJ it is a place you can grow if you apply yourself. Unfortunately the management can be more educated and willing to promote educated and well deserved staff.You will be able to advance your career working in this environment. Normal day at work for any employee who is considered work from home will exceed the 8 hour work day (typically 10-12 hours) and there will be weekends where you are playing catch up. Some of the programs do not have enough people working for them which makes your caseload much more difficult to balance with your home life.A typical day at work involves auditing programming and defect resolution consultations with Production Analysts. Verification of business and technical requirements as business liason. Evaluate prospective /new technical design implementation. Weekly inventory status meetings  with management. Provide monthly status reporting to senior level management. Reduce audit inventory by educating coders on best programming practices and identification of new, more efficient programming configurations.Productive environment, processing claims, management knowledgeable.  Co-workers helpful, always willing to help. Hard talking to irate customers.I worked there for over 23 years. The benefits & salary are great. They have a great fitness center, daycare, ATM, beautiful cafeteria, Starbucks, and great places to sit & eat. Oh, not to mention on site medical care (RN Practioner & Labcorp). There are many departments so you can move around.I have worked for this company for 10 years. I received 6 months worth of training and felt very prepared and confident when it was time to perform. The expectations can be a little more stringent than some other insurance companies. But you will be trained properly.Training is notoriously poor. Goals are unrealistic. Supervisors are allowed to bully staff without consequence. Managers do not know how to manage people.Horizon is a wonderful place to work. They are committed to providing superior health insurance, provided by top rate hospitals and physicians at the most affordable cost.Horizon fosters the idea of getting the problems solved and doesn't not believe in the idea of putting a bandage on a problem.  This is one of the many attributes of Horizon that I so appreciate.Great company!! You get to learn the ends and outs of insurance claims. However, I started as a temp employee and I felt that I was being taken advantage of. I was given numerous responsibilities and very low pay.Nice place to work. I enjoyed my time there. People are very friendly. nice work environment. I would recommend the company to anyone looking for a job in the healthcare insurance industry.Since this was my first job, I was able to learn a lot of skills that I think will help in the future. The support from my Team Lead and Manager helped ensure that I learned to do the right process(following process flows).Horizon is and extremely amazing company to work for. but the management isn't organized, they donot prioritize their employees.Prior to my involvement in my crime, I was a top employee with numerous highlights while working at Horizon. Almost all of my reviews were above reproach and with high regard from management and staff.I was supervisor/lead for the staff at wall NJ location and had a great experience while there. was looking forward to retiring from Horizon until my problems away from work happened."
750,Houston Methodist,"I would arrive at work at 8:30 and immediately do send outs for the daily courier to take to another hospital.  I would answer phones for the pathologists and do clerical work as well as some transcription when the full time transcriptionist was not available or needed help.  My co-workers were very supportive and helpful. It felt like we were a family, including management.  The hardest part of the job was learning all the different things I had to do and adapting to the changes in policy that would occasionally happen.Contacting the doctor to inform him of hospital call and checking with interns on stats.Learning all the various aspects of psychological problems that individual could have. Learning that prominent figures were actually being treated for psychological problems.  Actually management is this position was the best hands on experience I had. The doctor was very interested in making sure I understood this aspect of medicine and each client needed special care. I was taught to take every phone call seriously because the clients were very fragile.I appreciated every aspect of this position.I enjoy my job everyday I came to work I wish I still work for this company Great management Good co-workers  Family/friendly place to workVery well organized and handled the best way it wants to be handled. ICARE is the main thing to always think as you are with patients.The benefits and pay are great, but the work/life balance is terrible. Also management is awful and everything done there through them is based on politics and who they like and don't like. They make your life and job difficult if you're not favored by leadership. HR is not to be trusted either nor half the people that work in the radiology department. Typical day is usually always busy with the occasional slow day, hardest part is dealing with management and their expectations. Most enjoyable part is the some of the people that you get to work with and having a starbucks on site.The charge nurse would make sure we got breaks. Floor manager very in tune with what was going on, on the floor. I learned to work on committees in working toward a solution to a specific problem. My co-workers were mostly independent in working by themselves. The hardest part of my job was seeing patients in pain that could not be controlled. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing patients come in debilitated and able to walk out on their own at discharge.Amazing work environment. ON the job training is very effective and employees are considered family. I learned the importance of hand hygiene and patient safety.A typical day for me begins a 6:30a.m. meeting and greeting patients and family members assisting demographic part of their clinic visit. .Over the last 3 years I have learned so much about the transplant process.The hardest part about my job was working under staffed for a fast expending transplant clinic.The most enjoyable part was seeing the faces on patients faces that come out of the transplant process healthy with their new organs.Very different get to know different people.like doctors nurses physical therapists people.Getting to know what they jobs duties are overall great place to work for love the bonus we get every 3 months love the environment friendly people,patients meeting patients family member overall love working for Houston MethodistStart with 4 to 5 acute/chronic patients. Perform full assessment on my assigned patients. Perform all physicians orders for patients. Update daily care plans with patients participation. Work in collaboration with charge nurse to meet patient's needs. Most enjoyable part of my job is when positive results or a life is saved from given out best nursing care and acting promptly to any changes in patients' condition.The hardest part of my job is when i am not able to get immediate response to further provide care for my patientsVery good rate of pay. Can be fast pace but great work helps a lot.Easy to pick up shifts and easy work with call policy only use it very need to call off. Union employeeI enjoyed working at J C Penny in the childrens dept... I was well acquainted with the customers and was always recognized for my amazing customer service skills by the leadership team.* Face to face interaction with patients and family* Handles charts of patients* Schedules appointments* Assistance to nurses, physicians, patients and family, visitors, and otherThis job can be overwhelming at times and frustrating. Little to no team work. The supervisors have no respect and dont really want to work with you unless they like you. Its a lot of drama even with the supervisors.I have a bachelor degree but was stuck in an entry level job. The director of my department seemed paranoid and very accusatory. I was thankful that she didn't come around often.Over the years at Houston Methodist I enjoyed the people that I had a pleasure of working with on a day to day basis. We worked as a ""TEAM"" to get the job done day in and out. Management stayed on top of us to make sure that our job was being done in the best and most safe way possible. The hardest part of my job was leaving. I had no real complaints because I worked with people who knew what there job was and did it as such. If ever a problem we could all talk to each other fix the issue and continue with our daily work with no problems. The most enjoyable part of my job was that we communicated very well with each other and made everyday a fun day.Did not like working there. .no yeam work..system is not fair dealing with co workers and supervisor..i am looking for another job that better suits me.Intense environment. High patient load, Good team, but high turnover. Stressful but it is what you make it. Nice community hospital that typically getting slammed.Good place to work; you can learn a lot working here. Good work life balance. Coworkers are kind. Pretty solid benefits working for a hospital. Ranked the best hospital in Texas.Enjoy working with team.  Assignments to medical or surgical units.Management available for support and assistance, always positive.Co-workers a joy to be with.Hardest part  of job would be coordinating multiple physician groups to accomplish best outcomes for patients.Working with teams on units, nurses, respiratory therapists, social workers, physical and occupational therapyGood culture and they take care of their employees. One issues is if you want to create change it takes a very very long change if it ever happens."
290,Houzz,"Loved the company and and it was great place to work! Everyone is very friendly and the company events are so fun. Good location and very young and hip environment.Glendora High School is full of amazing people and great student athletes. It was such a blessing to be a part of that community.Great Challenging place to work. Extremely smart people.Fast-paced, creative and high potential company.Lots of opportunities.Relaxed work atmosphere with flexible work hours which is great for students or someone looking for a part time job. Work can at times be tedious requiring extended work hours to meet goals without compensation. Management was receptive to employee concerns, but in terms of actual change it was minimal. The company in itself has a bright future ahead, but this position has limited opportunity to grow as an individual.Pay is not based on how many hours you work but based on how much data/leads you find. Sometimes the area we have to look in is exhausted and we can't find anymore leads. Even if we search for hours to find a couple, we do not get paid for those hours but for the couple we have found.Manager is very strict and believes that Houzz matters more than school even during midterms and finals week.Growing company, still a start up so lots of gray areas within jobs. Sometimes interns are asked to do one off jobs due to the start up nature. Very good company morale however.I am a contractor although the company culture is amazing. They thrive on creativity and listen to every ones suggestions. they provide meals and take care of their team members.Houzz is a fast-paced startup that has built it's culture on the amazing people they continue to hire.  As they continue to grow they have maintained that small family feel while promoting the brand worldwide.Started working at Houzz right after I finished my undergrad and was really excited to work with a developing company and brand. However, it was very tele-marketing centered and felt like my 4 year degree wasn't getting used. In talking to management, there didn't seem to be potential to grow, even if you came in early, stayed late, and tried to take on more responsibility. Some people were amazing to work with, others not so much (a lot of people on power trips). "
255,Huawei,"This was my first job as a consultant.  The boss is a straight shooter, told me what was expected, and when my last day was.  Any changes that was to be made, I was informed two weeks in advance.The work was challenging and interestingManagers in Business enterprise department are so helpful and they give the chance to junior engineer to express there opinion ..Co-workers are nice and helpful to each other. The company doesn't respect the employees at all. Once you are not valuable in their eyes, they will terminate you Right Away.Check out chiesebizblog.com if you want to know if you want to work for a non learning organization! I got to watch the Chinese be very Chinese outside of their home land...Eye opening adventures.At hauwei, we are like a family.different cultures, mentalities, and personalities. but when the goal is unified, we, all do our best to achieve targets.team building from time to time let the climate more funny in the company. Outside Training also help the top management to achieve more with their teams2 to 5 years is about the maximum for American employees in key manager positions. For a year prior to being ""laid off in good standing"", I was being told that I could not attend weekly meetings because only mandarin would be spoken. The loud and constant mandarin language was so deafening that sometimes I found it hard to think. I usually could not understand these people as well. It was a stressful and horrific Chinese owned company to work for.Colleagues are very niceGood work lift balance in my teamGreat training for new gradsInteresting workresponsible for the design of different parts of teleco facilitiesCheap company, cheap products, young management that's inexperienced and they expect you to work long hours. I'll give this company another year until they fold and out of the US.Controlled by China management. Nice and very hard working employees.Compensation competitive in industry. Travel required to China. Too much security hampers work.Learn new thing about Huawei technology Troubleshooting various issues on the network and resolve issue to make sure no unexpected outage occurs.troubleshooting the issue & Fault rectification done with short timeworking according to customer requirements to achieve cutomer satisfaction. Supporting customer for all the new requirments as wellOverall pretty competitive with compensation and benefits. Great 401k matching program. US top management lacks experience. Job culture is soso, not quite US style yet but definitely improving.Replacing Nortel Equipment with Huawei equipment:•	Testing T1’s with Dax and the Switch. Sweeping outdoor RF jumpers. •	Audit and Quality check for Cricket site.•	Moving T1 and Jumper cables from Pocket and Nortel equipment, making sure that they are ready for the BTS Huawei equipment’s.•	Troubleshooting T1’s and Jumper cables for any alarm related issues.•	Doing various configurations to set the BTS ready for the Cricket network.•	Doing Test calls for 911, 411 and other area codes making sure that calls are coming in and out of the network.An expat wears many hats within Huawei.  A significant component is knowledge transfer, whereby one is rewarded with great patience.  Every day offers new and different challenges.  We won a $1bn project with a large carrier to run their data centers.  However, three-months in the young national sent in to run things (often never having worked outside the country) is behind on KPI's and are to lose millions.  ""Go fly to Lagos, fix things, fall on your sword with the customer and while you are there sell them something"" about sums it up.All in all a rewarding experience, but a much greater challenge on one's family residing there.i have alot of chances of working with seniors engineers. because of them i have very strong base of  RF theory i think.working environment very friendly.it is a amazing experience.Very focused and people worked very hard. Management are details-oriented. Co-workers worked very well as a team.There are so many professionals in the user experience department, such as judge of Reddot, design manager from Moto. And many many international professors from United Kingdom, Northern Europe, America and South Korea, etc. They are so friendly and always open to answer your questions. I learnt a lot from them.Communist. Lack of concern for US government or people. Learned eastern practices in businessHardest part of job: East meets westTough culture, people work very hard.  Good pay and benefits.If you have change to work at this company, it is good, bad the culture is not goodworking with Huawei gives a good knowledge about the security and work professionalism as it is one of the biggest companies in the world.I enjoyed working at Huawei because i had an opportunity to expand my technical and people skills"
479,Hudson's Bay Company,"A typical day at work is interacting with the truck drivers, I've learned to gain more patience than required when dealing with different backgrounds.  My co workers and manager make my day and job less stressful.  I enjoy networking and meeting different kinds of people from different ethnicity.Poor senior leadership and upper management. Lots of waste, due to poor project planning at the senior level. Every day is filled with chaos because internal resources are limited and enterprise projects are not well-planned, let alone executed with any process controls. Our data center is closing in 2017, and it's not a surprise for any of us who are still here. Many of us were looking for other jobs before the facility closure was announced. Some staff bolted as soon as they heard the news. Those of us who have been here for a year or more were offered a reasonable severance and retention bonus; so, I'm staying until my end date. I know I will have a job offer before my end date because the market is so hot....I work at Lord & Taylor.  I have not made a salary this low since just after college.  Granted, I love the line I work for but the pay is abismal.  And to make matters worse, bullying is tolerated at my store, even when reported.  The ""bullyer"" is a high money producer who gets away with murder.  This person has threatened to have other employees fired, makes others cry, and when it was finally reported to management, instead of feel protected by the General Manager, he became buddy buddy with the bullyer and now people are even more afraid to report it.  The one nice thing I can say about my store is that they are somewhat flexible with day off requests.Typical day at work would consist of Loading, Unloading, interacting with vendors, inventory checklist, Staging outbound shipments, daily stockroom activities.No job security, management shifts faster than fashion. They try to build a family like culture, but terminate without warning due to constant reorgs.Constant Management turn over. Four CIO changes in two years. Each CIO replaced all middle managers to match their 'Vision'. When I left had no first line manager to resign to. HR had me reporting to a co-worker. Was stood up for my exit interview by HR. They did not show up for the interview. Had to leave my laptop, keys, and badge on my desk and just leave the building on my own.Horrible place to work. Very hypocritical and lots of drugs in the workplace. Tested their employees badly but favored a couple people. Unfair wages and lots of missing moneyThere's an interesting dynamic between the Lord and Taylor/HBC side and the Saks side of the house.  It's a East Cost thing.Very fast paced environment.  Not many realize how big the company is and how it spans multiple cities and countries.  Not really in a position to say anything good or bad about the company.  A lot of good people work there.most negative place i ever worked everything is broken from the management team to the website. You have 3 or 4 managers who do their best and the rest just kinda wing it.Enjoyed assisting customers with placing orders, receiving wrong merchandise, sales price adjustments, returns, damaged merchandise and defective merchandise.This position has given me many skills as I'm involved throughout the entire SDLC within every release.  I gather and write business requirements; risk assess all requirements with impacted cross-functional teams/vendors, review requirements (business and technical) weekly with the business, write test scripts, conduct SIT and UAT testing, review any all defects with the business and technical teams, provide implementation plans/status and conduct maintenance/key learning's status meetings.  This position has tweaked all skill sets.A typical day at work includes working reported problems from opened tickets.  I've learned how to be calm in pressure situations.  Management allows myself and co-workers to make decisions without being micro-managed.  My co-workers are all a wonderful bunch of guys.  We are all team players.  The hardest part of the job is trying to complete tasks when given strict deadlines beyond our control.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to make our own decisions as to how we're going to get things done.Benefits need improvement and work atmosphere isn't great. On call sucks because they don't have an adequate help desk (yet) to triage calls. They have some nice percs like half day Fridays during summer and ability to work from home. They are laid back and seem to be trying to improve things. Cafe is above average and decently priced.Its a great team to work with, that moved from waterfall model to a fully agile workplace. There is a lot more potential for the company to grow its culture / tech processes. The tech leadership is great (same as GILT leadership), but senior leadership across the company does not understand tech culture, and has difficulty in managing the workload or the processes in software delivery.Good company, flexible schedule, friendly environment, very good and knowledgeable team. I learn a lot about retail business.Resolve production issue in different area such as user interface , business logic, and  data in the database. Enhance application by user request.It's ok but i just got laid off after being on call 24/7 for a year. They have unrealistic expectations for projects and don't seem to care much for the end product, they just want to 'get it done'. They are all about the profits really.I work with great people. That said, the company has created a toxic relationship with it's employees. They are not transparent about the direction of the company. I was offered a promotion, but it required relocating and the compensation was not on par with national averages for that position, so I ultimately opted to move closer to my family instead of remaining with the company.get to learn alot and try out different products.. meet a lot of great people and best of all be the face of a skincare line.. has been a pleasure working for them but unfortunately they do not have any job security whatssoevergood working environment, friendly people, mangement is fine, Job Culture is good, Compensation/Benefits not so good"
636,Human Resources Research Organization,"I've done some freelance writing work for HumRRO for the past couple of years and all of my interactions with them have been professional and positive. They respond to all questions promptly, they handle payments and paperwork quickly and efficiently, and they provide quality feedback. The feedback and suggestions I've received from my editors there have improved the actual writing product and made me a better, more intuitive writer. Though I've never actually met anyone at HumRRO  face to face (all of my work has been done via telecommuting), I still feel a part of their organization and I hope my working relationship with them will continue.Poor managment, little room for advancement, raises not based on performance.Worked for HumRRO for 6 years and really enjoyed the experience. Whether as an intern or full time, HumRRO is a great company with a VERY long history."
573,Humana Inc.,"quite a productive experience, management is superb and very professional atmosphere.  A very fun loving and easy going place to be inI have had some great managers, one's who push you to advance and move up in your professional life.  There is room for advancement dependent on management.  I have also had a not so positive experience with management.  The work at home option is amazing, traveling for the company is also another great experience. I did learn that once I reach the peak of my career, always be willing to teach the person after you.8am to 6 or 7pm - common but it helps knowing you are doing the right thing for our customers.I learned a LOT about claims, Medicare, medical records, grievances, appeals, investigating healthcare providers.The vast majority of management do a great job in communication of goals and how to accomplish a successful career.My last role was difficult since it was ""on the job""/teach yourself type of training.Meeting great friends and mentors. A great understanding of Medicare and passing that knowledge to others.I genuinely like helping people. Working with the elderly population teaches patience, communication skills, and problem solving methods. The hardest part of my job is when i am rarely not able to meet the customer needs. The most enjoyable part of my job is the many members lives I touched over the 8 years I have worked here. Providing members with the health plans they need are of great importance, I educate them so they can enjoy their healthcare experience.They do not care about their employees. It's all about the bottom line. They don't protect their employees. Medical insurance has 1,500 deductible for their employees who are bringing them the customers and the money. Insurance rates are also extremely high. Employees cannot get injured on the job or report anything that happens to them on the job without the fear of losing their their job if they report it to HR.A typical workday involved gathering leads from various sources and contacting businesses (cold calling)I learned how time management and how to be persistent with my goalsManagement was good, however at times if calling on the phone, it may take some time to answer questions due to large number of agents calling in.I was independent contractor. I did not have direct contact with other personnel.The hardest part of this job was working alone... I was not a team environmentThe most enjoyable part of this job is that I was able to set my own hours. Overall I would rate this a great company!!!!Performed audits to ensure Quality and Accuracy of over 200 employees. Coached individuals for peak performance and provided feedback regarding monitoring evaluations to supervisors and employees. Developed and maintained departmental policies, procedures, objectives, and patient care standards. Performed quality control audits to ensure accuracy, completeness, and proper usage of clinical systems data.I work for the medicare-certified area of Humana at home. The state manager is completely inept, rude and hateful. If you go to her manager or HR you are then targeted and harassed until you quit. At that point they don't even know how to work out your notice..sending you home that day. HR does nothing to help you. I actually work with your manager against you. Don't go there you will regret itHumana  provides learning opportunities of strategic paths to improve partnerships between providers and members collectively. There is great collaboration with customers, co-workers, Operating standard contract and providers development and relationships..Process with a goal to make our self and members healthier by 2020The environment is ok but the company really doe not show that they care.  People have gone without raises for the past 4 years.  I would say its a good place for someone who's in school and needs a flexible schedule. Overall not a career job.I enjoyed working at Humana.  I had to navigate through a lot of technical requirements independently as my manager was not very knowledgeable and computer savy.  A typical work day was very busy.  The greatest challenge was related to my lack of wifi coverage due to Humana having a poor service provider.  This was significant because 98% of my job was dependent on access to the internet.A typical day at work consists of providing service to members by directly responding to questions. While delivering value and quality and actively engaging with the members; through every step of their road to wellness. Provided guidance on transactions, inquires, or complaints from consumers. Educated customers, providers and employers about Humana’s products and services; both over the telephone and through face-to-face briefings.Answer inbound calls, and answer any issues for the call Claims information,benefits, except billing,update any new information, and check  payments. How claims were paid, why they may have been denied. Find providers and provide the information to members. I had to go through many different programs to provide information to the members, or provider that were required. Most of all to make sure the clients were happy regardless of the outcomes.job security is based on revenue and departments are  operating in very segregated silos. My department was very laid back and the dress code was lenient most of the time. Working for Humana has a certain positive response from people because it is a large employer in the state of Kentucky, but there is really no corporate loyalty to the the overall well-being and financial security of their staff. You are a cog in a very large machine, no matter your rank.At first things were great then things went south quick.  HR wouldn't protect employees being treated unfairly, bosses were bullies and help personal grudges and bosses showed carelessness by violating an employees protected health information and sending the info out becoming viral.  My career was officially over after that it was just a matter of time.  I only miss helping the patients.i am working in Agile environment with good communication channel and visibility. the are i am working in is core development project where i have roles and responsibilities in all phases of development, right from initial requirement gathering phase to final deployment.Since i have been working in the same area for more then 5 years i am looking forward for more challenges and growth.Humana preaches work/life balance and even allow one hour of ""wellness time"" a week yet your coaches and direct management don't actually allow that. So focused on metrics and meeting numbers and there is no actual caring or helping provided to the members. The coach watches every minute of your day and will notify you accordingly with borderline harassing messages. The focus is all wrong.Working with Humana has opened my eyes up to the real working environment. It allowed me to experience numerous of personalities. My co workers did a great job of making me feel in place when it came down to enhancing my knowledge in certain areas I was not knowledgeable in. I learned how to be a team player in certain situations. The management always had an open door policy when it came to issues and concerns. The hardest part of the job is speaking with members who have had traumatic things happen to them and knowing that there was nothing I could do about it. I really enjoyed how the leaders tried to incorporate fun activities to help understand a new rule that was put in place. I would recommend this job to anyone. It was a stepping stone in my life.Great place to work, great benefits, plenty of overtime. fairness of staff. Learned a lot about office management, Microsoft products.How to research using some of the best systems in the country.  Co workers and management were overall great.hardest part of the job is you are on their schedule and if you have kids that could be hard. But i do not so i did not mind.I enjoyed the learning, the friendships.I just need a change.Contact new and existing customers to discuss their needs, and to explain how these needs could be met by specific services, Seek out new clients and develop clientele by networking to find new customers and generate lists of prospective clients that sometimes get a little hard sometimes but he great team I had is what made it possible.This company is great at the little things that make an employee feel at home.  However, the big things still need some work.  There are a few instances of the ""right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing."" This has occurred as it is a large company and one coast may not keep in mind the factors occurring in certain markets.  Coworkers and direct management is quite good, but the senior leadership is out of touch with certain aspects of roles and responsibilities."
354,IBM,"Great work life balance, however due to IBM being so big, it can be quite challenging to be visible enough to move one's career ahead.Recommendation is to create a summary document each month listing your accomplishments. Review it monthly with your manager and save it for your end of year self review. Have to make yourself known to manager as well as other decision makers throughout the organization.Just getting hired here is not enough. You have to apply to internal projects to work, so your mileage may very depending on your skill set, your competency, and an array of factors. My project is interesting and challenging enough for me, but some of my more able coworkers have gone months without being able to get on a project while the less skilled one are on project by luck. Team structures come with the typical perks and frustrations as one can reasonably expect. Managers are eager to help; shame they help too many people and can be hard to pin down at times.Overall it is your typical office setting. It's decent work for entry level work.Learning and taking on new challenges is something I always looked forward to having in my work day.  Loved learning new software and tools and being able to share my knowledge and skills with co-workers.1) Typical implementation of Google Re-Captcha, UPS monitoring tool for datacenter monitoring was really a challenge. After completion of these task I got appreciation from managers.2) Learned a lot from technical and architecture perspective3) We worked as a team to accomplish these achievement on schedule.4) Maintenance activity to stabilize backend system in job was typical.Good place to work. Worked as substitute teacher. Had a few problems at the start, but overall the experience was enjoyable. No problems at the end, The pay was well.I've never encountered so many talented people in one place. I've enjoyed collaboration with the teams I've worked with.This job required extensive travel and long hours.  Executives will stab you in the back first opportunity they get.  Don't trust them.  Working with customers was rewarding and provided much satisfaction.  Co-workers were awesome and I will miss them.  Constantly changing organization structure and constant expansion of required skills and knowledge made keeping up with job demands difficult.  Never felt appreciated for effort put into this job.Poorly Managed and has little hope of success.  Very large and has a poor character.  Hard to see how they will be successful, as the Senior Management only cares about themselfs.was a great place to work but in recent years they have been moving IT jobs overseas and laying off long time employees. Still some great people thereI didn't learn anything from IBM I was moved from Centurylink to IBM doing the same work with the same pay. I loved the work I did until it was outsourced to India. I was given a chance to find a job within IBM but with my skills was unable to find anything and was then released. The management is not very helpful when they need things it is a hard process to get help with anything most of what I would need I had to figure out on my own.Very nice pace to work and everyone works as a team which is hard to find but it is a family type of enviornment. I think that the company is just gong to be expanding.it was the best shop  to work in, we had all the answers for manfrane capacity, to many meetings also free laptops for emplyees to use, great history at all ibm sitesMy shirt would begin at 8am, i would take calls from mortgage customers and call out to mortgage customers for home mortgage payment.  Every call different due to dealing with new person new personality.  On every call you advise customers importance of maintaining healthy payment habits.Co workers assist if you need assistance on a call. this job has taught me how to manage life expenses and how to prioritize different aspects of life.Working for IBM was like family oriented so being  there was like home away from home everyone I worked there with was like down to earth people they didn't mind pitching in to help when you needed help.- a typical day a work: work on automation process and tooling- what I learned: critical thinking and problem solving- management: flexibility- co-workers: friendly and professionalThis company is pretty bad not going to lie. Contractors do not get hired on unless you can some how manage to make it 10 years as a contractor. I would not suggest applying unless you have a 4 to 8 year degree.I traveled 2 hours to work by the company provided bus. I learned how to proficiently use access, powerpoint and outlook. I had a great boss and my coworkers were nice as well. The hardest part about this job was the 5 hour round trip daily commute.typical day at work is receive  Inbounds /Outbound calls help assisting loan payments escrow question loss mitigation questionsCompany seems to continually Re-Org., shift directions.No job seems secure and most of the (FTE) employees there know it.    There is little value is placed on contractors. It appears management views it is easy to discard the contract labor, based on what direction they (sr. management)  are pursuing.The focus of work or tasks seems to shift based on upper management decisions. The work environment (culture) suffers because of it.  It is not an inspired work environment.   Not a company I would recommend.You get to start your job with peers your age so it's very easy to integrate and feel being part of the company at work. People are generally nice and willing to help out. Work load is light for entry level job but responsibilities will increase as you move up in chain. Since it's a big corporation, the vertical advancement is there but slow. Most of the time you get to rotate to another role between 8 months to 15 months horizontally.In IBM's current desperation to turn around revenue trends, it has become a very hard place to work. Everyone is measure against their ability to directly contribute to that revenue top line and that leaves IBM constantly trying to pivot to the next big thing and leaving other projects and people tossed aside."
429,ICE,"Great Work environment with positive attitude you will succeed and make great pay and enjoy the friendly staff and customers free food and lots of room for growthI worked shift work with a team. I would stock shelves, food items and assist cleaning crew to help out. I was always told that I was a good team player. My most enjoyable was seeing that the work I had done was done right and others benefitted from it.They didn't tell me when they hired me that it was only going to be for three weeks while the manager was visiting family in Chicago. So I came to get my pay check and they told me they no longer needed me.I enjoyed my coworkers, and there was potential to make a good salary through bonus and daily spiffs. I'd recommend it to someone looking for a sales job.Everyday is always busy.  There is always something to do.I learned how to use great plain (another accounting software).I enjoyed working with my coworkers and they are easy to get along with. I live and learn alot during my employment there with Ice.Overall, the established system provides a good sense of job security; allowing for expectation of long term employment. A very dynamic operation with lots of moving parts allowing for significant multitasking and obtaining solid results...more accomplishments than the general public knows or understand.  However, at times not enough time in the day to accomplish all that is desired.Typical day is good .I learned who to trust yourself.Management is good.My co-workers are good persons.No hardest par of the job.My co- workers are the most enjoyable part of the the job.All sales and you are just a number. If you have family issues like a death in the family. They put work first. I would not go back thereEnjoyable work environment with hard-working, reliable coworkers. Management was laid back but dependable. Owners are very good people and are extremely involved in their business. Most enjoyable part of the job was bartending and meeting new people. The hardest part of the job was being short-staffed, sometimes management approved other servers/kitchen staff to leave early.My GM was not a nice person. he was very rude to his employees and never gave any hours to anyone but just one person that he was having a relationship with. I am happy they are no longer a businesswork is routine and atmosphere is very dry. Management fears lawsuits so they keep allowing bad employees to stay around. Hard to promote or get a permanent position due to veterans preference.* Constant ongoing training* Good Management* Talented people to work with.* Cafeteria on site* Public transportation close byThis is a dead end job with no opportunity for growth. It was completely unprofessional. They are not timely with shift bids, coaching's or year end reviews. The job requirements and expectations certainly surpass the pay with new job requirements being added on weekly and your pay staying the same.CONS: Must absorb OT on lunch hour. no sick days. lack of communication between management and employees. no concern for non-sales positions. PTO is not handled in a timely manner and the logic behind it makes no sense.Typical day consitst of managing contracts, initiating case investigations, participating in outreach efforts, participating in operation shield, auiditing, creating presentations for managment meetings, ectI learned both physical and personnel security rules, regulations, and requirementsManagement was awsome, everything was structured and very organizedMy coworkers were very supportive, knowledgeable, team playersThe hardest part about this job was actually leaving, even though it was for a promotion. The people wer the most enjoyable part about the job, being about to do outreach activities with those who were really passionate about the support in the community.This was a home based position. I loved every minute of it. My team was amazing, our management team was always available to help and assist us. The pay structure was great. I learned more than I could of ever thought about the travel industry and got the opportunity to  take advantage of many gifts that were available to the employees.  Worked with a very difficult colleague and the leadership team did nothing to improve the work environment. Legacy mindset company and needs a evolve into the 21st century.A typical workday consisted of me coming in around 10:45 and getting ready to answer calls and then getting on the inbound que.I would selling vacation membership packages for sears vacations or government vacation rewards. Typically customers have a very specific vacation at a specific time and I try to convince them to be flexible to save money and even do it on a payment plan.Job was good, stressful at times and very busy. Management was lax in some areas and too stringent in others.  Co-workers were often unreliable and tried to make others do their work.The most enjoyable part of the job is working with numbers and people.Dealing with human resources and payroll.I loved payroll.Ready to retire from the governmentVery competitive & a lot of favoritism. Difficult to advance do to culture.The typical work day is manageable. However advancement for non-law enforcement employees continues to be a barrier for those who have experience, education and or military status."
716,ICF,"training provided was exceptional, some management very knowledgeable, environment clean and organized, some company morale, pay should increase for the jobWorking for this company one may feel like they are not part of the machine that keeps this company going.

There is no growth opportunity beyond team lead and unfortunately the pay has been cut drastically for any person the management team selects. If you are not a person to go with the flow and give a constant yes your time will be limited.Reading other reviews of this company indicate to me that it depends on what part of the country you work in as to whether it's a good place to work. In Martinsville, VA it was a rotten place to work. Management treated employees with very little respect, there were few advancement opportunities, and pay raises depended on who you knew and not what you knew. (it took me 4 1/2 years to get a pay raise of $1.00).You had to constantly be worried about being fired for insignificant reasons. It was a stressful place to work.There was a different set of rules and regulations for the Martinsville call center compared to the rest of the company. We got no holiday pay and only 1.54 hours of PTO time per month. Your schedule could be changed without notification or concern for how it might affect you. The work enviroment was decidedly hostile. Leaving this company was the best thing that could have happened to me.Have you seen Office Space? It's kind of like that. You better get your billable hours in, but not too many to the same charge code, or you'll be hearing from someone... During the 2013 Government Shutdown, they made their employees use vacation and unpaid leave if they couldn't find work (which was most of us). Pretty much sums it up. Basically, all they care about is how billable you are, so there's absolutely zero office culture (until happy hour when people would bond over how awful it was), and their year-end raises were laughable. DO NOT WORK HERE if you can help it.I began my career at ICF 5 years ago and was an employee referral.  The company has grown by about 1500 employees since I began and has still maintained a strong culture.  I was hired as a senior individual contributor and have been promoted several times in the last 5 years.I worked full time hours for several months and was never offered full time benefits such as health insurance. There is a huge lack of communication between management and employees. I witnessed managers and supervisors disrespect and talk down to their employees and nothing was done about it.The worst place to work for. They do not value there employees at all. The pay is horrible. The do not offer pay raises but give you new titles and expect for you to be content and do it for the low pay. The supervisors are horrible!! There was only one decent sup in there. They don't know what they are doing. When you ask questions they make stuff up and when you show them they are wrong they still expect you to listen and do what they say. They contradict there selves a lot. Very hostile work environment. No benefits of perks of working with them. They constantly put you down. You can be an excellent performer and they will look you in your face and say. Now you need to perform higher. They recently had / training classes of 12 ppl and out of those two training classes there is probably 4 ppl still employed. I've never worked in a office were everyone hates the job and the managers. They don't allow u to speak to fellow colleagues. If they see you are getting close they separate you. You are not allowed to talk. I honestly could keep going on but I would be here for days.I spent 15 years at ICF in total. I left and came back...and left again.  If you are willing to work hard, you produce great results, and you're willing to take some chances, you can go far here. I and many, many people I worked with, built careers here with a lot of advancement over time. I could name 20 people who started out near the bottom and worked their way up to VP. ICF is known for having really smart people, so there is stiff competition to get choice assignments and stand out in the crowd. Salary increases are not always large, but if you stay the course and continue to deliver, you'll get promoted and the money will eventually follow. Plus, there are several focus areas and a ton of projects, so if you don't ask permission too much and just take on as much as you can handle, you can learn a whole lot about your favorite subject and management in general.Working in the accounting department of ICF has been insanely awful. Management seemingly has no idea what they want and care very little for employees under Director level. They continue to lie and let employees go saying that they need to downsize for financial reasons and yet will create new Director positions shortly afterwards. There is no advancement at all. They would rather hire outside the company than promote the people within. Raises are horrible. Fear and intimidation are used to ""encourage"" employees to do their jobs and more by my current manager. Despite eight people leaving because of her, they continue to keep a no nothing manager on board who has no government contracting experience who has managed to overwhelm and anger everyone she encounters.My review is the same as my previous review of the company. Management staff is very non-supportive of lower level employees. There is no room for advancement unless close with upper management (based on friendships).Very low annual pay increases (on average 1.5%). Autonomous work culture. Only great situation if you are at Principal or VP level...everyone else do not get pay raises.This was one of the greatest experiences of my work life. The managers as well as the executives believe in hard work and celebrating the earned success of hard working team. I learned a lot of professional  work culture and how to effectively get things done without supervision but still meeting deadlines.ICF is an industry leader in consulting. ICF provides excellent employee benefits and exciting job opportunities. With offices all over the world, ICF positions itself to be a global leader in consulting.-Provide good training-Nice Supervisors-Nice work environment-Work  load balance is good-Not enough salary -You can ask for work from home after you complete one year at ICF        but you cannot ask for Monday and Friday-No more opportunities to move aheadICF recently went through a rebranding. Their staff is dedicated and hard working. People stay at ICF long term. I was part time and did not seek a full time opportunity there since the commute was too far for me.  I think the management is excellent. Unfortunately my boss was laid off and my position therefore was no longer needed. I enjoyed my time while I was there and think highly of the human resources staff.Senior management attention and leadership is outstanding.  Great benefits, co-workers, working environment.  Terrific opportunities to work on variety of projects and locations.Great place to work with good culture, smart people, strong passion. They also allow me to work from home. Unfortunately, they are too business-oriented and do not adequately support their staff with good benefits and salary increases.A typical day at work involved a good mix of project work and proposal development. I learned a great deal about consulting, project management, and the proposal process.Co-workers were great.Hardest part of the job was working remotely.Most enjoyable part of the job was traveling and working at a work site.This is by far the worst job I have ever had. Training is very poor and when they put you on the phone they change their mind about what you can and can't say every 10 minutes. There is absolutely no consistency and management refuses to help you. One manager spends her time taking personal calls while the other one guesses at the answers. None of the phone numbers they provide as resources work and they are always asking you to do more with no additional benefits. There are no other job titles which means no where to move up . Supervisors refuse to take escalated calls and gossip about employees to other employees. They can't even provide a clear answer about included benefits due to being over budget,most likely from the ridiculous turn over rate. No training class makes it more than a few days,and new class is taught weekly and each time only 2 out of 12 makes it for more than a week. Worst of all management stifles your personality, They claim it's too ""flamboyant"". They don't want you to know your fellow coworkers but expect you to tell them all of your business. You can't even use your cell phone in the break room. They make up reasons to fire people and never provide a legitimate reason. They even broke contract with the temp company that recruited for them without letting them know.Their goal for employees : have no personality and take as many calls as possible without offering real assistance to customers.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!ICF International provided an environment that promoted both professional and personal growth. Through ICF's mentor program, I was able to learn skills outside of my scope of work. This program was a major component in developing skills that resulted in promotions and pay increases.Awesome workplace. Great working. Company culture is good and people are flexible. Lot of work and good no. of hiring. Telecommuting is also there as an option."

I enjoyed the morning meetings every morning. Employees were able to use the gym for a monthly fee. Metro acessible.I enjoyed working with a team in which each member knew their purpose. People were generally helpful when I asked questions that pertained to my role and theirs.This is a great company to work for.  They have a great history and they take care of their employees.  They have a great track record as a reputable contractor in the DMV.The best ran company I've ever worked for and I will privileged to work there full time the moment a position arises.

They provide a shuttle to and from the metro as well.I worked full time hours for several months and was never offered full time benefits such as health insurance.

ICF provides excellent employee benefits and exciting job opportunities. With offices all over the world, ICF positions itself to be a global leader in consulting.Great clients to work for.  However not potential career growth.  Would have like to have taken on more advance skills / duties while employed with the companyWorking for this company one may feel like they are not part of the machine that keeps this company going. The culture within the company is ""do as you're told and do not go against the grain."" Entering work on a daily basis becomes a chore - basically coming to work to earn a paycheck and nothing more. Upper management consist of people who previously served in the military together and their attitude is to say ""yes"" to the site manager no matter what. Even though there is constant descension from the management team the workers on the floor make things better. There is no growth opportunity beyond team lead and unfortunately the pay has been cut drastically for any person the management team selects. If you are not a person to go with the flow and give a constant yes your time will be limited.My review is the same as my previous review of the company. Management staff is very non-supportive of lower level employees. There is no room for advancement unless close with upper management (based on friendships).Consistent, easy work for decent pay. Definitely keep to yourself and work hard and you could be promoted once ample time has passed.In the beginning of my career with ICF I thought it was a wonderful company, there is a a lot of room for advancement and learning of new systems and projects. I have learned so much working for ICF international.Awesome workplace. Great working. Company culture is good and people are flexible. Lot of work and good no. of hiring. Telecommuting is also there as an option.Not a bad job just got laid off and never wanted to go back due to all the shenanigans the work put me through. It wasn't all that bad but personally I don't like working in the heat due to how easily I over heat. I'm not seeking to go back there but its a good company1. Great coworkers2. Demanding schedule3. Managers need to be sensitive to employee needs4. Lack of guidance5. Poor communication from managers"
511,Icon,"My typical day at work included logging into e-mail and data management systems. Every 2 weeks a meeting with your manager would be held. Much of the work was done independently.  It was a good place to learn data management software and use Microsoft office.Love this hotel.  Everyone is so nice and goes far and above the norm of customer service. The hotel is down town and next to the rail for great transportation.Long hours, in all types of weather.  Enjoyed co-workers, would travel for weeks at a time.  Work would vary depending on what job site I was sent to.8-10 hours /day.  Learned a lot about negotiating contracts.  Had to learn on my own, very little training.  Did not enjoy my experience there.The workplace was such that once one is ready to gain knowledge in that field, there was no limitation to progress. This made me enjoy working there.Great day. The environment is very work friendly.  Love seeing and meeting new customers. Hardest part is organization.It is a good place to work but the pay is not good and the management.. if they start to pay employe more than u will see better result and also mangers need to be more trainedwould have loved to continue my work with this company but unfortunately my schedule had too much of a impact at the time. job always kept you on your toes, never did the same thing ever day. would recommend this job to the right people any day!They lay off people every other year. Finally they moved most the work to China. That just goes to show how cheap of a company they are. If they want to pay Chinese $.5/hr of work, what do you think they will think of your wages?Not a secure job place to work at.Great company to work for!! Been there for over two years and have had no major issues. Great job work life balance, compensation, and job security.  The management and job culture is pretty good as well.Work/ life balance is good, the company is diverse and my manager is great! The overall company is good. They are not robots, which is something I can appreciate.Very Productive in all aspects, paper work, management meetings, setting up events with local or big time celebrities. (yo gotti,fetty wap, cast of the empire, ect.)Learned to multitask & meet deadlines,learned a lot about the men fashion industry (urban wear) (brands I associated with Rockstar, True Religion, PRPS, Robin Jean, Bally, Louis Leeman, MCM, ect.Co-workers were amazing, uplifting high spirited, fashion iconist. Would love to work again with such amazing people.The hardest part of the job was meeting deadlines for a total of 46 stores, as far as getting advertisement done, buying merchandise for each individual store. Traveling to each region was starting to take a toll on me but I managed it & did what I was told.The most enjoyable part of my job was, traveling to different states for big time trade show. Working with great people, seeing celebrities. Highlight was picking out the wear everyone enjoyed the most. I'm glad I was apart of this company.I worked in Radiology.  The management at this hospital is excessive.  I would say that they need to cut the fat at the top.  Too much duplicity in the management arena.I like the the great opportunity to make changes if that was for improvement.great schedule to work.In summer time was low that give as opportunity to be with the family and enjoy the summer.I learn a lot about organization and lean Manufacturing and be self motivated.the management was open to new ideas and implementation of them.I like to work with a different people from many culturesMake people to change ways to work and implement lean manufacturing but in the end all the people was into it.The fun part was the opportunity to implement changes and facilitated the job of the people making his job easy and more productive with less effort.Learned to work great with others and run a prodoctive line with a team players. had a great supervisor to lead us. they were willing to help us out always.I currently enjoy my current job. I help transport employees to and from the train station in a timely fashion. My passangers and I have formed a good relationship over the years and really enjoy serving them. The most difficult part of my job is driving in the snow. I am very skilled in this regard, so its not too challenging. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work for and with. We get along very well.Great environment, managed office network, devices, and company website. Learned more about Apple OS and devices. Hardest part of the job was meeting the demand of the staff and customers. Most enjoyable part of the job was editing website.I had a good time at ICON when it started, that being said, it turned at the end. The CEO talks alot about how great the company is doing but they never really want to promote. Some of the managment in the Chicago office is lackluster and can actually be alittle bit of a bully and mentally abusive. i still have PTSD from the blond lady who looks like an orangutang.Very friendly co-workers, they helped me out with using a cash register. The manager made you feel like part of their family.not at this time, I do not feel like this is something I would like to talk about at this time.  If I get hired at this company then I will tell more about my back groundHigh energy workplace with a tight-knit group of co-workers. Management cares about individuals as well as pushing business growth. The majority of my fellow employees are counted as friends after having spent time together at work. The hardest part of the job is balancing life/work balance. Late nights do not always help in having a normal daytime existence. The most satisfying part of my job is seeing new guests returning after a positive experience and continually growing the business."
724,IgnitionOne,"This is a tough one. They no longer sell the tech I was hired to sell (DMP). The other divisions are solid with good support. Again, my whole group has dissolved, so not much to review.Unfortunately, I was let go for punctuality, however, the individual in charge of monitoring my punctuality couldn't accurately do so as he was hardly there on time himself. Other than that the positive feedback I received from literally everyone else was very encouraging and allowed for a positive and productive work environment. I was able to have free reign in investigating and procuring new ways to save money for the company and my opinions and thoughts were valued. The atmosphere was bright and healthy.It was not a good work environment. About 16 of the people I used to work with have all moved on to other jobs because of the management or culture.This is a great company to work at for individuals who are fresh out of college as well as for individuals who are creative.This place has a great environment with food/drink perks all the time and great events, but it is a 6 day a week job on most cases and between the commute and long hours, it usually turns into a 14 hour day.The culture at IgnitionOne is very fun and filled with amazing, hard-working and intelligent people. Management is another story.As an Intern during the summer of 2015, I was able to experience and talk with each department of the company to gain useful insight on the future of the digital marketing industry.The people at IgnitionOne are very nice. They are like a big family. The environment is very comfortable and you won't feel pressure. It is a good place to improve your skills and personality. I LOVE that company."
360,Imerys,"Everyone around here have worked together a long time. Great place to work with family. The only downside is working swing shiftCorporate human resources personnel are nepotistic and show favoritism to their drinking buddies. To succeed at corporate level, you may have to spend time charming with and boozing with corporate HR. Bonus points for being female.great workplace with great co workers and bosses.hardest part of job was the swing shifts.most enjoyable part was learning new things.IMERYS is a good job and I would recommend it to anyone that is starting a career in the accounting field. The people at this company are really nice they are very generous at month end.Fun colleagues, supportive management. Room for growth and improvement. Fantastic team work throughout company and caring towards the environment as well as the community. Able to participate in community services.Typical day was always changing. One day would be creating risk assessments and maintenance schedules the next would be experimenting with the grinding parameters to modify the final product. Management was always supportive, intelligent and easy to get along with. Everyone working with or over you was very intelligent and they all excelled at finding tangible solutions to the multitude of problems associated with a new plant design.The hardest part of the job was creation of safety paperwork as it could be tedious. The most enjoyable part of the job was really everything else- operations, maintenance, experimentation, lab work ect. Really wish this position had not been cut short by the paper mill we were stationed at.I really enjoyed my time with Imerys. Currently work just has gotten slow so i must find another way to provide for my family.I learned how to operate most of the equipment i now know how to operate. The management is satisfactory but the HR department is too slow to fix any issues that come up. My co-workers were a blast to work with. There were never issues to comment on. The hardest part of working there is to try to move up the ladder.Generally it,s a good place to work but not like it was in the past.Management is still good get alone with co-workers well the most enjoyable part of the job is doing my job right.It's a wonderful location, great co-workers and management is tops!A typical day was always based on safety. Safety was very big with this company, they treated there workers well. Co-workers got along very well and I could tell that most of them where very good friends.Imerys was an excellent company to work for especially if you like to be busy. The management is tough but very fair. I learned a lot about IFS and Microsoft AX administration. I also figured out an extremely useful method of deployment through self study which is encouraged at Imerys. I felt that I was a valued member of the team. The hardest part of the job was navigating elements of office politics. The most rewarding part of the job was the respect of your peers when you solved a difficult problem.Imery's is an excellent Company to work for. Great Management and even better employees.There were no days during the course of my employment at IMERYS that were the same as it relates to a typical day.  To clarify my role, I would have to say that I was more of a fireman or EMT.  Constant emergencies, primarily due to lack of accountability and not adhering to the procedures.  The task I was assigned to do was to remedy the kind of environment that I described above.  With a new accounting system, we were going to be able to track cost via the system, as opposed to paper and manual journal entries.The difficulty was not being able to change the culture that was set on doing things the old way and refusing to change.  This was the hardest part of the job.The most enjoyable part would have to be the people I was able to help and teach.  Being able to help others with doing simple spreadsheets, formulas, tables, etc. that would say hours out of their week.  Seeing the relief they felt was worth every difficult day I experienced.Imerys, a minerals company out of France, has operations all over the world including north Georgia. My plant mined for marble rock and processed that rock into dust, used for thousands of applications. With this dust comes well...dust, everywhere. My job was to keep the machines that made all the different products clean and free of dust. An ongoing and dis-heartening struggle was my job. However, my co-workers and my supervisor made it a good place to work. There was always a need for my position and we made sure to fill it. Management could use more communication and oversight with employees, but all in all still a good company and a place I would recommend employment.Reliable workplace great for benefits strong team behind youLarge company with good remuneration and benefits. Learned process control/process discipline. Very customer-focused company. Good, knowledgeable co-workers, always there to help when needed,Long hours, Saturday work mandatory but the excellent work environment made long hours go by.   Typical day at work:  Safe and fun    What you learned:  New system    Management: Very approachable     Your co-workers:  Good people    the hardest part of the job:  NA    the most enjoyable part of the job:  Been part of itThis is the right place for you.  It's a typical office environment.  The company is headquartered in France so many times there are international visitors.  The majority of the staff are age 30 and up.  Some people are very happy here, while others are disappointed by the lack of advancement.  There is definitely job security.  "
642,"IMPAQ International, LLC",Employees work well together in a fast paced environment to fulfill the needs of their valued clients. Friendly and positive work environment.I work with great people and generally love coming to work.  I am not micromanaged and my ideas are welcomed by my supervisor and often put into practice.  The office culture is great with a lot of diversity.
135,Impossible Foods,Great team.Cutting edge technology pushing the frontiers of food science and product development. Large effort on cost effective protein purification.
587,IMTAS,"The best thing about working here is the personnel on my team.  We communicate well and work well as a unit. I have had the opportunity to take on a greater leadership role, which has been very satisfying.A typical day begins with emails about a dozen new policies. God and the favoritism! Hardwork is not valued here and there is constant harassment of one form or another.There is a high staff turnover.Management have favorites. Promotion is non-existent, all moves are lateral. Working harder does not equal compensation. Low compensation.I truly enjoyed my time with IMTAS, it was a team oriented company that tried to make sure their employees where taken care of when working away from the HQ building.  During my time there, I was able to learn and broaden my knowledge of Project and Program Management.  I had the support of IMTAS and my supervisor when stuck with difficult decisions.  If I had an option I would have stayed with IMTAS and continued my career with them.IMTAS was a great company to work for, they always had an open door policy. If ever I had an issue with pay or any HR related topics,all i had to do was place a call and they would address the issue.The company seems alright in the beginning. But seems like words are are stronger than their actions. Compensation is minimal. They will task you with work with no long term benefits. Management has their favorite picks. Promotion seems to be based in who they like more rather than who has done a better job.At IMTAS I did a little bit of everything. Some days I would help receive new equipment in.  I ran Excel sheets on all inventory. Helped organize the warehouse. Once the equipment was in I shadowed engineers as they completed their diagrams. I helped install servers to racks, run wiring back and forth, and install and update firewalls. I also helped test cameras and software.Uncommunicative management and frequent policy upheaval.Great place to work.There were no difficulties with work.Everyday brought new task but it also depends on your job placement.It was a good company to work for but unfortunately my contract ended. My co-workers were very nice and we had a good team work.I also liked my supervisor, he was very nice and helpful.Responsibilities include supporting various project management teams in controlling project cost and schedules, using Microsoft EXCEL to develop project plans, status reports, financial reports, budgets, and data updates for Government and contractor project management personnel to use in the management and control of project activities. In addition, using Microsoft WORD, PowerPoint and Visio to develop documentation and briefings as required. Responsible for a myriad of activities associated with overall project management support. Track and manage inventory of all project equipment, most of which are highly sensitive Communications Security-related items. Submit, track, and manage all requisitions and purchase orders using a variety of agency-specific forms designated for such requests and entering into Government approved requisition database. Provide weekly status reports to Government and contractor program management"
95,IMVU,"My role is one of independence so I work from home as a contractor where I make my own hours. New applications are added all the time an I learn an implement them into my work. I am my own manager so that's great!! other contractors I deal with are mostly pleasant and easy to collaborate with. There are no real hard parts to what I do an I enjoy the people I meet the most.Advertise my html homepages, this can be on the fourms, on other sites, and in person, once I have a task then I ask for advance money, and give them a questionnaire to fill which allows me to build their own homepage or even a special product. I also develop clothes, accessories, etc, which are all wearable on the IMVU chat client, I have to make sure it is cheap for all users, and create something unique that everyone likes.WOuld come into work, make myself some breakfast (bagels, cereal, fruit, oatmeal, donuts…act) go to my desk get to work and had a snack then work some more, then caters lunch , then work some. The people there are wonderful, very helpful and nice. Management is always there for you when needed. Everyone helps each other, no ""I"" in team!A typical day would be helping in the Staff created Help rooms as well as the Welcome rooms.  The help room is a place members can go with client issues, billing, harrassment, hacked accounts or help center issues.  It is our job to direct, explain and guide them through the different process or to escalate issues that need staff's attention.  I learned to be exceptional patience, teamwork and how to research solutions.  Staff are extremely helpful and great mentors.  The other forum Moderators are helpful and wok well as a team.  The hardest part would be the members who only come to cause trouble for the other member and the Moderators.  I have always loved helping people and in this position I am able to do so.  It is also a great creative outlet for me and I feel a huge sense of accomplishment when a project is completed.Very laid back environment with a ping pong table, great snacks and not to mention paid for lunches. Fridays are the best, we get pizza! Love all the people I work for , they are all very nice and are always willing to lend a helping hand.The work culture is great at IMVU, and there is always a lot to learn.A typical day consisted of having daily stand up meetings, developing new features, and pushing code out multiple times a day.You can make money or play, It is up to you if you want to take the time to learn how to become a creator and spend the time making things. Imvu is a home business, a great place to learn how to create graphics, it has homepage and 3D models. :)Imvu is not good, you can often get easily banned, what they called disabled, many have complained of being on there some years, having spent thousands of dollars and suddenly one day they can not access their account.Another worrying thing is the amount of accounts that get hacked, so a lot of them claim on the forums. If you complain to much you get banned and later disabled.Finally you have no realy safety on there, so despite the minimum age being of 13, anyone young can get access to the site. There is often naked graphic p-o-r-n images too, which makes it very unsettling given the fact there are young teens on the site. IMVU removes the naked images of men, but often avoids and leaves those of the women, for whatever reason, who knows.If I had to rate the site over all, give it 1 out of 10, better ringing them for someone decent to answer you, but then having said that, just given the run around as you are told to take out a ticket on the site, thus one can wait days or weeks, if they respond to you at all.As for the offers to get credits, most are a con, surveys all about getting your details off you, to bug you constantly, a serious privacy risk, especially for kids, which it appeals a lot to. And not only that, when you gone through them, often then say sorry at this time not qualified etc. We then have those free things one downloads, and these are often full of spyware or virus.For a company making so called millions of dollars now, to not be accountable to even paying customers is truly shocking to say the least."

181,Infor,"I interned as a student consultant for Infor while doing my graduate studies. The internship was challenging and was one of the best experiences as a graduate student. As part of the internship, I was fortunate to work with the chief medical information officer.Was contracted for an assignment in the AR department.  At the time, the department was not very organized but the staff are pleasant to work with.At Infor Manila, they try their best to keep their employees from leaving by keeping them engaged and interested while at work. Every month, there are activities that you can join, from sportsfests to hackathons.Depending on which team hires you, it could either be a blessing or a curse. In my case, I was part of a team with twenty members. During my tenure at Infor, people have come and go from the team but all left without burning bridges. My team loved to have fun and is the loudest of all the teams in the department but when it comes to work, we delivered. And I am proud to have been part of that team.specialize in enterprise software ranging from financial systems and resource planning (ERP) to supply chain and customer relationships Work pace changes from day to day, can be fast paced at times. Large company means resources and there are plenty. Opportunity for growth and advancement. Professional atmosphere.The ability to work with teams both from inshore and offshore with a variety of backgrounds and experiences is very rewarding. The company’s culture is based on  best practice processes thus providing the prefect ground to continue individual learning, improvement and growthThere were both negatives and positives of working at Infor.  I do miss some of my coworkers and enjoyed the work that was involved in the requirements gathering.  I feel that the BAs need to really be development / IT folks.Infor Manufacturing is a purpose-built solution suite that manages the complete manufacturing operation, from financials and scheduling to shop floor management, quality control, and analytics.It is a fun place to work. People are very collaborative here and work/life balance is the key component here for resources retentionNot micro managed, always work to do.  Wide variety of projects to get involved in.  Team effort atmosphere.  Lots of longevity with current employees, so it is hard to get promotions etc.Fun workplace with supportive management. High learning curve and honor to work with some distinguished experience team members.I worked for this company for 3 years.  Averaged 60 hours a week and never received a raise, extra time off or pay for over time.  At the annual Christmas parties we heard how well the company was doing but that never turned into anything for the employees.  Management is very disconnected from the workers.I was very satisfied.working here as a Technical Consultant.  Great benefits and great management.  Drawbacks included over 80% travel and international engagements.Infor has very good products, but management is not in alignment with projects and the PMO office does nothing to support project teams, only look for weaknesses and then does nothing about them when reported to senior managementI worked for Lawson Software that was acquired by Infor.  The 2 companies are night and day.  Lawson was a great company to work for, work and life balance.  Infor is  only interested in achieving results.  You are on 24 X 7Typical day at work includes gathering requirements from the project manager to evaluate scope. We then have meetings with the development and quailty team to dish out the requirements. At times these requirements are very easy, but hard ones are also there. We have a release party every year which is good.Acquisition is their middle name.  Not a people company.  Only true positive was ability to work from home.  Little to no change of advancement.Team building was a big part of my role. Infor was a great company to work at for three years. My colleagues and I made great team membersVery pleased to show up here each day.  Excellent environ, pleasant atmosphere, knowledgeable staff, courtesy abounds, primary aim is to ensure the clientele is satisfied beyond expectations.They had a huge translation department but have decided to not to have in house translators.Fun people to work with, great manager, sorry that they decided to extinguish the translation department.It was also a wonderful experience. That's were I learned everything about localization and translation, that's where I started my career. Have great memories of that place.Corporate environment setting. Not a lot of socializing although after work events are provide every so often. You are at your cube all day and simply focused on completing your tasks."

Best company to work with for any New college graduate. Highly motivated and skilled employees and companies polices are very employee freindlyNice and Good place to work.Met great people and a great time.Managers are approachable and tend to employees.Works can be repetitive on most normal days.The HR team gave me the flexibility to work form home and complete my assignment within the given time. Was fun working with the team in Banglaore and Pune.The overall work culture of the company has changed in recent times. The company is no more driven by values. Most of the times you will get good managers but with laterals joining the company values have gone for a toss. Now culture is moving towards keep your boss happy and company has stopped addressing employees concerns.Infosys has got the best campuses among IT organizations in India. You would love Infosys campuses and facilities in India but you won't be able to utilize them due to stringent project timelines or longs waiting.Infosys used to be a great workplace but the size has caught up and too much of politics between teams/managers make it not desirable for top talent any more.Very high visibility to various technologies and exposure to try and learn new technologies.  Good support and guidance from seniors.  Exposure and opportunity to work at various accounts and COE process.I enjoy working in IT filed, especially in the field of full stack web development. I have faced very friendly co workers in all the work places I worked till now. Especially my team leads and managers very friendly and they were my mentors too. My hardest part of the job!?I never figured it out but working on week ends was little difficult, though I enjoyed it.Its a great place which grooms you and provides you with a solid foundation that enables you to achieve higher goals in the life.Great launching pad.Infosys is a good company to work for. Great professional people to work with. The training it provides is world class. Company has the best in class infrastructures aswell.Good company to work with. More number of customers.

83,InsideSales.com,"I really liked the people I worked with. Everybody there is really smart. Lack of operational communication could sometimes cause confusion.I worked there in Provo as an Intern. Amazing company and amazing people. I went there last summer. Good place to be for internship.All of the employees are dedicated and ingrained into the objective of he company.I Hired people and managed the Human Resources.Do not accept a sales job at ISDC unless you are willing to be under thumb 24/7.The last couple of days of each month you will be the used car sales man issuing fire sales on anything and everything to get half baked deals in the door. Average sale is 4.7 months but mid-market sales is still run on a monthly cadence. Expect only a 90-day ramp and extreme pressure to close BEFORE the ramp is completed. Expect to self source 90% of your opportunities as Business Development is non-functional. In a year or two this might be a decent place to work but right now literally EVERYTHING is broken from sales on down to implementation and support. Customer retention is at an all time low. Do not believe the hype generated by the CEO. The predictive analytics they preach as the next big thing in sales is vaporware still. While the base they offer is decent, most everyone in mid market is starving to death and only 4-5 reps (out of 20-25) are actually hitting quota. Proceed at your own risk!Typical Day:Designs test suites Writes and executes test cases Automates test suites Responds/executes emergency ClientHotfixes. Utilized Html 5, Css3, JavaScript,Selenium, Selenium IDE, Jira, qTestManagement and Coworkers: easy to work withHardest: working through the night to meet deadlineExciting company to work for, fun, always changing. Great management team, experienced senior management team. Nice facilities.InsideSales.com is a rapidly growing company located in Provo, UT. The development team comprised about 20% of the company workforce. I gained valuable experience in programming in Apex/VIsualForce, Salesforce.com's proprietary language.Just like has been said in other reviews (and look at how many people found helpful rather than the fake reviews marketing and HR posted), the recruiters bait you with promises of ""opportunity"" and ""advancement"". This is only partially true, it only creates ""opportunity"" for you to advance within the company and get a few promotions to make your resume look good. Then you get out as soon as you can find a better job. Turn over at Insidesales.com is unbelievably high. If you perform, you will get promoted, and quickly. But these promotions come with very meager increases in salary. They are starting MBAs off in customer service at $12.00 and hour. After sIx months of that you get a big promotion to $14.00 an hour! The advancement and opportunity advertisement they hit you with is misleading. Although you can work your way up, when you finally get there the almighty CEO holds all the decision making to himself. You can't even get him to buy chairs for his employees without begging him for a year (still no chairs). People bring their own pens and chairs, and office supplies to work. This is a company with over 250 employees. The wall at the office have exposed studs and we all work in giant rows of IKEA desks. They attribute all this  to having a""scrappy"" culture, but come see for yourself, this place is a dump, it is a joke. The culture is toxic. Management does everything at the last minute and is completely disorganized. All power is held by the micromanaging CEO and his lackeys. Projects, purchases, anything waits on the CEOs desk while he goes on vacation or walks  more... around micromanaging every faucet of the company.I worked for the administration. So I had a lot of contact with these guys. They are all complete egomaniacs, except for perhaps the CMO, he at least has some credentials and he has direction for the company. Never in my life have I felt this way about a company or a job, I love my current position and get paid double. I also have liked or loved working in every other job I've ever had, but not this one.If you can't find a job, you can probably survive here long enough to get a little star on your resume, but then get the heck out.  lessI enjoy working for this company, they see hard workers and reward us for the hard work we put in! Environment is a blast! The CEO throws great parties to show his appreciation as well as regular raises! The president is a brilliant teacher giving continued teaching to all of the staff. If you want a great career, Insidesales is the place to work!The company is all about learning new things. They constantly change and update the product, work space, management, and their employees. This has its ups and downs, but they want to succeed and they want their employees to succeed. It's a good way to enter the sales world with a technology twist and has a lot of potential. I like working here. Sometimes I think management wasn't the best but overall good.I work as BDR as InsideSales.com. A typical day at work included dialing through junk leads that the marketing department provided. Typically they were 2 to 3 years old, and the person did not even work the the company. Aside from the bad pay and subpar benefits sales reps are constantly being screwed out of commissions for any reason management determines fit. Management says no one has been there for very long because they are growing so fast, but it seems most people move onto better paying, less abusive jobs.The CEO is excellent at selling, and sells our product well to new hires and employees alike. This creates a strong sense of cohesion and community in the company.A typical day starts at 8:30 am (and runs till 5:30 pm). Get in, review what I worked on yesterday to reinitialize mental state, prepare for the day's work, and then go to the daily stand up meeting for the team, where we all sit and share our accomplishments of the past day and plans for the day. After that it's headphones on and get your code on until lunch. Feature finished, log it in the bug tracker, commit and push it to git, pat self on back, and move on. Lunch I take in the cafeteria, and it's delicious. After lunch, it's back to headphones on coding until the end of the day.I've learned a lot about software teams, and how we can work together and spread out the work to get things done. I've also learned how to build things quickly when important, and continued to refine my ability to clean up things that were written quickly.On the whole, management tends to be easy to work with and willing to trust employees to do what they were hired for - being awesome. The best advice I've found about management is - if you don't have fun during the interview, you won't have fun working with them. That said, the CEO typically conducts (or did) final interviews for new hires, and he is fun to be around.Coworkers tend to be skilled and competent. There are outliers on both sides, but overall I have been quite satisfied with the competence of my coworkers.The hardest part of the job is dealing with the gobs and piles  more... of software that we've written, interfacing always in interesting ways. The most enjoyable part is pleasing customers - internal or external, making something awesome is a really enjoyable experience, and one that I've had the pleasure of often here.  lessWant to start out making 24,000? Then work here. They say they are about opportunity, not compensation nor benefits. Try retiring, supporting your family, etc off of opportunity. They brag about how ""awesome"" they are and yet they reduced my salary because it was too high.Only place I have worked where I actually heard other employees talk about mutiny. Very high turnover.The company is extremely unorganized. Everything is last minute. And they take pride in it because they are ""scrappy.""Terrible place. Apply if you are desperate, and then don't stop applying to other places."
293,Instart Logic,". My extensive experience in industry and strong background in academics ( please refer to qualifications ) makes my fundamentals solid. I have a strong sense of entrepreneurial spirit and a very strong drive to innovate any aspect of the company.The work time is very flexible, people usually come around 9~10 AM and leave around 5 PM, lunch is provided on Mon/Wed/Thu. The work here is freer, harder, has tighter scheduler than large companies. We don't have much rules about what one can do or cannot do, as long as it's useful for the product it's ok.Also a startup company expects a shorter time for ramp up, also there're no dedicated mentor, if one want to learn new things and if there are no docs about it, you should ask relvant engineers in person."
468,Integral,"Provided guidance on the Integral products, did all QA testingand installed all releases for testing. Worked on many environments, DB2, IDEAL Datacom, IMS.R & R Donnely was a very productive and fun workplace.  Lots of potential to grow here but I was very young when I worked here.  Great management and co workers were easy to work with as well.enjoyed working for myself meeting new people getting material for each job greeting the client setting up to work safe making repairs installs and additions where needed cleaning up preparing bills and giving client the bills explaining the charges and what I didCome in have a daily meeting on production, what has happened and what needs to happen. Great place to work, they teach you your job with a lot of patience. Co-worker for the most part are all about business, come in get the product out and go home. Management keeps you well informed on what's going on with customers. I learned the in and outs of putting windows together.I have just recently worked for these and they treat you as though you are a piece of dirt,  I would not recommend Integral to anyone.Inspection of aerospace Have worked in quality control for over 30 years This company is A Typical of a manufacturing companyI went over and beyond to help put more on the bottom line so I had zero issues working here.Great place to work and learn from a very talented group of engineers and staff."
133,Integrated DNA Technologies,"This company give a great opportunity for getting into biochemistry type of jobs. Work environment is typically friendly. There are great benefits and vacation days.Didn't really interact with anyone outside the department I worked in, but overall people seemed nice.  It appeared at the time they were experiencing a high turnover...As with anything, change is inevitable. The core of the business is changing and so is the culture. The company has done great over the years and grown tremendously.A great place to work. They care about their employees and it is really starting to show. The direction that the company is heading is very exciting.I ship dna and pick orders. my co workers are easy to get along with. management could be better. there is no real hard part about this job.was great place to work-everyone helped everyone-had lunches at meeting every week.when a problem occurred management helped solve them.We column load 96 well synth plates, DNA/RNA synthesize, deprotect the oligos, place them in hot/cold bath for an extended amount of time, dry the plates down, resuspend them in water or hepes depending on if it's DNA/RNA, we test there optical density levels, and if everything passes it goes to the tube room where it each well in the depro plate receives its own tube and label. Solution from depro plate is then transferred to the each individual tube on the rack it's assigned to, dried down again on what we call our IVAPS, capped after their dry and then shipped off to the customer who ordered the oligos. The night crew I work with are overall enjoyable to be around and work alongside. I learned a lot about DNA synthesize, oligos peaks, and so on.My time as an intern helped me see how much the employees enjoyed their jobs. They were always willing to help educate us on new policies and procedures. Everyone was more than willing to be helpful and helped prove that they were trying their hardest ensure our food safety.I have worked at IDT for almost 3 years.  In my particular department there is no opportunity for advancement and the managerial style is bad.  The company overall is fine but there are issues between departments that could easily be dealt with by having better leadership structure.Pros: PTO, Good resume builder if need work history right out of collegeCons: Limited on advancement, quality feels like it is decreasing as the company is getting bigger, i have generally been lucky but raises can be 0%-6%This job was very repeatative but again my co-workers made it a fun work environment.Great place to work.  Very supportive, has great compensation and benefits.  Treats employees with much respect.I enjoyed my time at IDT but they just don't pay enough to stay competitive which is really a disappointment.This company geve me my start in HR and I loved that it was very employee focused.The company is an excellent place to start your career right out of college. You gain valuable skills and have an opportunity for advancement. The compensation is slightly lacking compared to companines with similar oppotunities. The benefits package is amazing."

They do help a lot with my experiences, as far as providing reminders for required information, helped me through training etc....Manager is very friendly and helpful.

305,Intel Corp.,"This is a great company with excellent management. Incredible technology and great leadership. I was part of one of their acquisitions and they are a company that rewards the people that are willing to work like it's their company.Intel probably has the biggest challenge now to find it's purpose in a a world where the PC is become less relevant.  I wish them the best of luck.What can you say? It is Intel!! This company takes care of its employees like none other.  Job training was top of the line. You did not have a supervisor, you had a facilitator .Former employees of Intel of Puerto Rico still consider themselves as one big family. We had such fun doing our jobs making for excellent quality products. Everyone had a sense of pride and responsibility that was greatly compensated with gifts to include extra cash bonuses. Great, great company.I have learned so many new  technical things which i don't know,here management is very good and coorperative,co-workers are very friendly most enjoyable part of the company is work culture.Am working at Intel mostly very busy everyday, The fun part that my Boss and my coworkers are very friendly and team work. we always sit down trying to solve the issue to make thing right.Good place to work if you can stand for long periods of time good to employees clean and respectful Environment. People were nice.Intel as great benefits; flexible work environment. Lots of room for growth and advancement. But it depends on you and your manager as to what you get out of your career.Intel senior management has good intentions but the culture doesn't support the proliferation of their ideas.  Middle and lower management are generally poorly trained and that can impact your career unless you are savvy enough to maneuver around them.  But there are some real gems working at Intel, the benefits are great, and the opportunities can be rather exciting.A productive working environment. You could transfer from within the company. Learned new jobs.  Met new and worked with a diverse working force. Good benefits.My experience at Intel has been a very positive one. This is a company that gives one the opportunity to maintain a great work-life balance and at the same time, exposes you to opportunities for innovation. The management is helpful and always looking for solutions to any problems the employees might have - in some cases even personal ones  in order to create a healthy work atmosphere. The work itself is the most fun part and so is working and ideating with the team.Intel hires a hardworking and dedicated workforce which is the best part of working there. What learned there will certainly help me be successful in my next job.Intel really did provide training and growth opportunities within their organization. They cared about the companies success. They had cubicles that had large windows so you didn't feel so confined, opportunities to support local charity events and tuition reimbursement. Great company!Intel was a great company to work for 10 years ago but in recent times the quality of the systems were significantly degraded due to poor management and prioritizing move to low paid and unskilled work force outside of USA at the high cost to USA workers forced out of our jobs after training non USA workers.In Intel I have learned how to manage the issues and the way to interact with employees to get things to get it done, intel is the safety nil work place and management the hardest part was vendor managing, the more enjoyable part of my work was event setups.Intel is not a steady place to work if you are looking for a life time career. Employment depends on the economical and political environment of the times.The company has huge potential, but engineering organizations lack ability to create good leaders.Numbers are valued more than people within development and HVM engineering organizations.Intense, fun, leading edge of technology, always pushing the envelope. Free coffee/soft drinks, fruits, gym on site and many great benefits. Constant work/life balance issues.It is a good place for hardware development or mid-managment level. more challenging for software development because the culture is so different and behind.Depending upon which group you report into, if you want to be challenged, Intel's the place to be. Some days will require long hours. In many ways, the manufacturing world continues to be like the 1970s.Intel provides a very competitive working environment and good opportunities for challenging assignments and advanced opportunities.  People work hard and are compensated accordingly.An excellent company to work for. A great culture within the company. Being able to take pride in working for the no 1 semiconductor chip manufacturer in the world."
553,Intelligent automation inc,"Good environment, friendly people. Flexible schedule. Work for me was independent but I could consult other people in an informal way, or the internet. I learned a lot about computer networks. The management was very understanding.fun workplace, family oriented, multicultural environment"
627,Intergraph,"Great place to work. Fun environment with lots of learning and daily challenges. The work experience i have ever worked for. Paid vacation and Holidays. Very responsive to my requests and answers in a timely fashion. Work is very easy and challenging at the same time. Very stress free environment. Great co-workers and overall teamWent through several lean years only to watch the company pour millions into a new building in order to attract younger, cheaper employees.  Existing employees get little to no advancement opportunities and about the only thing to look forward to is a cost of living raise. There is little upward or even lateral mobility in the company.There is little real long term direction in the company with not much to look forward to except meetings, meetings and more meetings.The benefits package has also consistently gotten worse year over year.Intergraph is not custom to change and new challenges.  The tier 1 analyst are use to custom ways of operations, and management allows it.  No one is held accountable for his/her actions, and management does not step up to manage responsibility or change.  The most enjoyable part of the job is building rapport with the analyst and enforcing change and better business practices however, it takes a team to accomplish these actions and not just one person.  I learned if everyone is not on the same page of new challenges/change, it can be a hostile environment which turns into  what is and not capable of accomplishing its goals.Sales driven culture.  Project Managers have limited chances of success.  Work from home is a positive.  The professional services organization is immature.  Cumbersome back office processes.Enjoyed my last position at Intergraph because it provided exposure to a number of customers each with their own challenges.have was very hard during my inception of my job career and it was also much knowledge growing process and I got time to learn new technology like salesforce, HTML .Interesting place to work. New building is nice and very open. There's not much room for lateral movement/advancement. Company is willing to pay for you to complete you masters program (with some restrictions). People overall are quite friendly. Upper management are personable for the most part and easy to talk to. Has a cafeteria and barista on the terrace level along with a pool table, ping pong tables and foosball tables.Great place to work and a supportive management.I enjoyed the environment and had a fantastic boss who was supportive cared for her team. I would recommend working for Intergraph.I am glad that I am a part of Intergraph. Friendly environment with supportive management . A good place to start career with.Decent Company to work for. Not much room for advancement. Great for entry level positions. You will wear several hats.I enjoy working here for the most part, but there is a lot of politics and bad management decisions based on politics. The pay is also much lower than most companies.Good place to work.  Management needs to do better in keeping moral up at job.  More classes are needed to keep you abreast on ever changing work structure.Shift started worked on collecting and entry the data from my part of a nautical chart. I learned how to read nautical charts. The management was hard to approach the cartographer where easy to talk to if you had a problem with the chart you where working or could not identify something. My fella co-workers where easy to talk to and helpfully if they had a section of the same chart you where working on to see if you could read off there's.The hardest part is you have no access to help from the cartographer at night then getting trained for the next step of the job and begin dropped in to it with no help.learning how read nautical charts was fun.This was a great company to work for. I had several opportunities to grow early on in my career. I learned alot about Professional Services Management and working with external customers.Shipping and receiving, check in material, duplicate discs, assembled material for kits, labeled and boxed material for shipping, received material for computers.Great people, frequent food days and activities. Good location in Madison is easy drive from Huntsville. Management goes above and beyond for those in need, and keeping employees happy.  Insurance premiums are keep low.Very good place to learn when new things come up, Helpful team when an issue you struggle with. Nice people in office complex.I take inbound calls from hospitals, care centers or rehab centers and i assist them with our program if they have issues with working in it. I learn that everyone is different. The hardest part of my job is trying to figure out what the issue is that they are having if I can't fix the issue I escalate it to my Tier 2's. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I speak with all kinds of people and I get to help them in assisting them with their issues.Really enjoyed working with a great team of people.  I worked in the DC area with strong support from the software developers located in Huntsville, AL.  Great people in both DC area and Huntsville area.I only worked at intergraph as a temporary employee on a temporary assignment. It was an excellent experience.I used Intergraph for several years I find it to be a very user friendly"
506,International AIDS Vaccine Initiative,A typical day for me can be stress free simply because everyone does their work and shows respect for one another.  I have my routine of daily tasks and always leave room for the unexpected.  What I've learned from working here is that there are good companies out there with co-workers who are always willing to help out and offers advice.  Management here seems to treat people fairly and gives you some sort of directive.  The hardest part of my job would be learning the names of of global employees when they come to visit periodically.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working with good people.
562,International Development Group,A typical busy day with manpower shortage. basically the standard of care is not followed. (like nurse patient ratio-1: 10) which compromises patient safety. Staff compensation is not competitive with other hospitals.
120,Intrexon,"A rebellious teenager who is trying to find its way in the world of Biotechs. Things change on a regular basis without knowledge or communication to the worker.  It is a place that you can thrive if you put in the work.  There is no sense of confidence in the employees.

Management and co workers are all so friendly and there are very strong core values that allow you to advance and learn from your weaknesses to better yourself as an employee.Intuit has good work culture and an egaged employee force. It is trying to become fast paced and more technology focused. There is focus on developing the products the right way.I drove one of the largest programs at Intuit over a year that I was a consultant there. I had a chance to work with really smart people. The downside of working atIntuit was that the management system over there is very inefficient. A lot of time wasted in meeting rooms and directors really don't know wich direction to move forward.A typical day at work will include helping customers place their orders for their small businesses. Working at Intuit is a very rewarding career.Great company to work for, benefits are great when you are a full time agent. Even seasonal's were treated with the same respect. The management was not the best within training, and you were led on about advancement opportunities. Training was not enough for the type of job you were doing But overall the company is great and so are the managers, just needs to learn to manage time better and to be more direct with advancement opportunities instead of lying just to keep people on board,Great job, Great co-workers, Great Management.

The company and culture is one of the best I have ever worked at.  No only does your direct team have the ability to work with each other to work on a requirement, team members from other divisions are also willing if called upon.  I love the social part of Intuit. They have a few company parties throughout the year that really gets teams mingling.  The CEO and others are visible and talk with everyone.  It's like I said, unlike any other company I have worked with!Intuit is great work place and very good culture.They build great products and good work life balance.Compensation is very competitive as well.Not very much political Red tape.Intuit has good work culture and an egaged employee force. It is trying to become fast paced and more technology focused. There is focus on developing the products the right way.Most incompetent team members got a promotion this year. The smart, hard working ones leave regularly. Top-bottom culture, where managers like to micromanage and engineers obey the hierarchy more than anything.Intuit was a great place to work. However things re very slow and management is poor. Too many middle managers with constant change seem to distort company objectives and goals. Not so concerned about employees as they portray themselves to be. Benefits are great! Some of the best that I have ever had. It seems like people who work there enjoy it and want to work there. I wish there was more of a unique and distinct culture that would set it apart in a better way - a livelier way.It's a great place to work. It's a good fit for me and the skill sets I have.  The culture/environment of this company is a good one. I  have learned much while working here, and have applied myself and taken the initiative to improve processes, efficiency and accuracy of what we do by developing QuickBase apps for inventory management of the Data Centers, creating Data Center and Rack Planning Diagrams, Temperature Maps and various other advanced spreadsheet/graph reports for the company.  I've installed UCS/bare metal, Hadoop, NetApp and EMC systems, etc.  Besides server installs & decomms I acquired more experience in the Facilities side with PDU""s, CRACs, Cooling Towers, Sensaphone Alerts, Leak Detection, Alarm systems, etc.I've provided information and documentation for the auditors in regards to asset management, drive erase compliance, e-waste, etc. And I've got to work with Sys Engineers, Networking, DevOps and Hosting Operations staff along the way.  The only reason I'm seeking new opportunities is because I am a contractor here with no benefits.7 year employee, moved out of state, would still be there if I could! Awesome benefits & high base $$ plus commission, great people, in depth training, good support from trainers & supervisors.Management ignores many things that occur. Supervisors lack knowledge and only promote friends. Knowledge is ignored. Managers ignore employees that want to expand their knowledge for the benefit of the company.benefits and people mak ethe job such a good place to work as well as managements willingness to help you succeed at your goalsGood new college graduate job, good people, and decent work life balance.

Many opportunities to do individual and group.A typical day included working with many customers with their payroll and any related questions or issues. Helping others and others helping you when needed. A great conferring of knowledge.When the location where I worked closed Intuit was very helpful with job assistance and making sure the transition was easy as it could be.Truly a work hard and play hard place to work. The employees were energized and goal oriented. It was not just get the job done, but get it down right.I wish I still worked there, great culture, very smart and professional people, great compensation and benefits. Publicly traded and locations nation-wideThere were good benefits and a good salary. But when Intuit acquired Demandforce, there was micromanagement. Overall, I would recommend the company to somebody else.Typical day at work, answer phones. Some calls last several hours. While I did learn a lot independently, the management support was taken away after restructure, and I was told I asked too many questions. The coworkers are nice, and probably the best part of the job. The hardest part of this job is the expectation to be perfect, outgoing at all times, and to maintain good scores when there is not enough support to satisfy the client. The most enjoyable part is definitely your coworkers.Call center location with multiple business units allows flexibility to move around and work on different projects. Good work life balance and benefits.The culture here is awesome. A lot is expected of you, with out management being overly aggressive. Great amenities, the site in san diego is real nice. Gym onsite open 24/7.  Great cafe."
741,Intuitive Surgical,"Great company to work for if you are on day shift, by the time you are out it is still bright enough to enjoy the rest of your day. Ultimately, as long you have something to do on a daily basis you should be good to go. They have a low tolerance for being late, so assure you are well grounded with your work ethic. Free coffee in every corner of the building.Would recommend this company of many different levels. Job security, health benefits were above average, and company would show appreciation of it's employees with events and incentives.The company tends to overwork its employees, provides very little opportunity for promotion, misleads employees regarding job promotions, and the political management gets old working under.The work environment is driven hard by high demand of the product of a very fast growing company. The constant rush, demands, and near-emergency situations can be stressful if you don't enjoy that kind of pressure.Management practices are very well honed and modern, though advancement can be slow as new positions are often filled from outside the company. The company is full of highly dedicated, skilled, and hard working people generally providing a great work environment.The hardest part of the job is most likely the stress. It can be brutal at times.The most enjoyable part of the job is the people. Generally people that end up employed there want to be there and contribute and it makes for a great place to work, especially when the pressure is on.ISI pays well and offers attractive benefits, while producing a great product. The folks here are very accountable for their jobs and it's a fast-paced and fluid environment that always keeps the work interesting.The main weakness is that you can wind up in a bad group with a terrible manager... which when paired with the fast pace and high expectations, gets people to their pain thresh hold quickly. Despite the attractive pay and benefits, I haven't seen as many good employees running for the door when things go bad because it simply isn't worth putting up with the trouble anymore.indecent management could use replacement. long work hours but on the brighter side every 6 months you get evaluated for a raise.I love working for Intuitive Surgical!... and I don't want to leave, but on the same token, I miss being home & I miss being with my fur babies.Innovative company with great work life balance. Significant responsibilities given to junior employees makes Intuitive a great place to grow your career. Very laid back work environment.There really is not a typical day in the life of a da Vinci sales professional.  However, a day in the life of a sales manager could involve, a two to three day field ride with a rep, followed by conference calls and one:one performance calls with my team.  In the field ride day, starting off with a robotics committee meeting with the OR leadership and C-suite executives, discussing high level performance metrics and the strategy to guide improved economic and clinical outcomes.  Following, 3 cases with surgeons and staff at different points in the learning curve, using high direction, backed by clinical and technical expertise to, create successful outcomes not achievable with robotic technology.What I learned?  More than all of my work experience combined.  I learned to changing the standard of care requires building trust, delivering high value, create equal business stature with your customer base, be excellent in managing operations, highly clinical with the ability to sell in a compelling and provocative manner, be proactive in communication and leadership, and highly collaborative.  Collaborating with multiple internal sources even on a 5 minute call, can generate enough feedback to create the best plan to execute from.My peers and our leaders are the sharpest individuals in the medical device segment.  All driven to succeed while being accountable for helping everyone achieve success.The hardest part of the job is staying focused on the vital few action items that will create the desired results and any given stage of the selling process.  There are so many  more... things that we can act on, and picking the most important one that will compel behavior changing results.The most enjoyable part is leading my team and our customers to achieve results not thought possible.  Working with highly skilled and tenured clinical reps and finding a way to improve through every customer interaction is amazing.  Creating a collaborative work environment for our surgical customers to formulate higher efficiency in the OR, resulting in better patient care.  Coaching a surgeon to adopt a minimally invasive technique that will take a guaranteed open procedure and create a minimally invasive approach that will forever change the lives of the patients treated.  lessReceiving in defective materials from the field and working with OEM vendors to get these pieces of equipment repaired or replace to replenish inventory needs. The Inventory is for the Field Service Engineers that is our main priority to make sure they have the parts needed when visiting a site location.You may get what you want in pay but you will get twice the work. They ask people to work 10 hour days but really want you to work 12 hour days. Upper management is stiff and disconcerted form real people. The stock is no longer preforming as it did in its heyday but they still think they are at the top of the food chain. If you like to get chewed out in meetings this is the place for you.Hours are really long the management is good but they don't give opportunity for advancement. It can be stressful at times with lack of information to provide customers. Again expected hours during quarter end were 6 to 6I received some really great training here on lean mfg. 5S, commwip and they have a good quality management system  but my cell as they call the work groups had it own click and I didn't really fit in. Surprised that they did not find another job or cell for me to work in. I was never late and always did what they asked me to do. They wasted a weeks worth of training and I ended up at another company making more money. So glad I saved myself a years worth of time. I would go just for the training though. I think they really just hired me to get them through their quarter end but they were not honest about that from the get go.Everyday is never the same.  We are presented with challenges on meeting company and customer expectations.  This is to be expected in a fast paced environment.  Great place to work and grow.  Highly recommend.Very political and low pay, also they discourage overtime even after being told by recruiter that 10 percent of my pay would be overtime and was given a higher pay scenario.i work for this company about 2 years.i was assembler about 1 year and get promote to lead.i have learn form engineer and manager.my co-worker is fun, i just want all my guy do a good and quality job.my hard part is my guy is make to many mistake on the job.A positive work enviroment with friendly people. Heavy workload with a lot of pressure of building a quality product. Opportunity for promotions very limited1*	Provide customer service, training, and support of the Concur online booking and expense management reimbursement tool2*	Ensured compliance with policies by training employees on federal and company reporting requirements3*	Monitored key metrics for reporting expense processing goals, including resolving expense report aging4*	Produced Ad-hoc Concur and AMEX reporting5*	Conducted monthly compliance audits, working with AMEX and employees to reconcile Concur accountsLeadership is not there. You are expected to take on many task without direction. I learned so much about FDA standards and documentation. Management moves around so much. Co-workers are very tired and stressed. FDA requirements are constantly changing. The pay was very good.I have nothing good or bad to say about Intuitive can not comment due to legal issues and the agreement have signedThis was 1 of the best jobs i have ever worked for.i had a early shift when i worked there ,which was great.at this company it did not matter what,the job was,the job was done at ease with a steady work flow.also at break or lunch they have coach truck on wheels come to provide meals."
359,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc","The company is fast-paced and action oriented, with most levels set on tactical execution in support of the sales team.  Management is smart and frugal.  Co-workers speak about it being a grinding environment without the sense of being appreciated. Most enjoyable aspect is hearing the positive impact da Vinci surgery has on the lives of so many patients.I learned a plethora of knowledge about inventory management and how to deal with inventory discrepancies. Great benefits and stock options.Great place to work, manufacturing would not be ideal for anyone trying to achieve work life balance or advancement.,Intuitive is a great compant to work for and I have 12 years of yenure"

As a control room operator I was able to see the company from various sides and was happy with the time I spent working there.Enjoyed working at STEC, had an awesome working environment, great co-workers, and an easy going learning environment. Loved being pretty autonomous and having a laid back work schedule. Never once was asked to do anything I had never done or wasn't willing to do myself. Had a great mentorship program and enjoyed being paired up with the two most senior Techs on site. Pay and benefits were great. The promotion system was very easy and straightforward, potential for growth within the company was exceptional. Overall an awesome experience and one I will hold all my future employers in comparision to.The plant I worked at could have been a great place to work.  The culture is not conducive to a functional work place.  There are a handful of employees that carry the majority of the load on a consistent basis.  Those who do not perform also complain to management consistently and to eachother.  Mangement has done very little to rectify this situation and as a result many of the talented employees have moved on.There is no training and many times others are too busy to help you learn. The work load varies, sometimes you have far too much to do others you are desperate for work. Management doesn't care about their employees, you are defiantly disposable. You'll also be asked to do some work during your holidays and vacations, I've seen some work full days while on vacation. The work can be interesting and many of the people are nice.Great new modern office with great location. Very smart and talented people. Decent benefits. Management cares about their employees.A typical day of work includes opening mail, sending back packages, running errands around Chicago, researching activities for the family.My direct manager is ""too busy"" to train me and as a result I feel neglected and not a part of the team.The hardest part of my job is constantly looking for specific projects to work on from my direct manager. I like to keep busy and use my time effectively, but it is hard when I have to ask for things to do every day.The most enjoyable part of my job is the work/life balance and the consistent pay checks.Great place to work in Operations of a Wind Farm.

781,Ionis Pharmaceuticals,"Started off great but the culture changed and the fun part was taken out of the equation. Very business like with no time for fun.most people are super stressed out.  lots of managers and directors.  good scientist but the environment is super stressful.Poor & under qualified management, not helpful in helping you succeed. Poor culture: members of the group do not get along, vicious and unproductive work environment, HR and management do not handle it in an effective way. Work long hours every week, not good work-life balance, not worth the money.Management expects you to know how to solve every problem dependently with little mentor-ship, will fire you if you do not meet there expectations.Management was ill prepared for many meetings, reviews, and general interactions.Every person in a senior position or with direct reports, with the exception of a very VERY small handful of employees, did not belong in that position because of lack of qualifications and inability to communicate to direct reports. Most of the people in higher positions were put there due to advanced degrees and have absolutely no training or knowledge of how to be a manager, work with direct reports, or run a group. Promotions into ""director/associate director"" were not uncommon for someone with less than 5 years of industrial experience due to their ability to help the softball team do well. Favoritism was a very common occurrence in meetings, if your manager or director did not like you they did their best to make you out to be a scapegoat in weekly meetings. Any disagreement with your direct manager automatically assumed you were in the wrong. Logic and data to back up factual points were overlooked due to ""buddy buddy"" of directors and managers.  The environment was vicious at the research associate/scientist level as well. Due to the hostile feeling at the higher levels the junior staff was more than willing to push someone else under the bus if it had the slightest change of making them look good. The hardest part of this job was walking in the door every morning, with the dread of what was to come. The routine testings that were performed were repetitive and required only a basic understanding so the actual lab work was easy enough. It was the politics and the very negative  more... environment that made this job absolutely toxic.If offered a position I would suggest turning and walking away, no amount of stock options/RSU's/health benefits are worth the stress and unhappiness that this company instills in its employees.This company always seems to like it's turnover percentages. When I started working there every new employee seemed to be so excited that less than 3% turnover meant that this company was a great company and would treat you like family and you'd have a career forever. Currently it's around 6.6% turnover, the average in biotech is actually lower than 8.5% (which is the average in life sciences) so congratulations, our company is bragging about how we are at the industry standard for employee turnover. If that's not a huge red flag as to how this company is run nothing is. The only reason this number isn't much higher is because the people that are still around and not leaving is because of the ""golden handcuffs"" Due to the stock options being worth so much money, if you were to leave you would lose a lot of money in stocks that haven't yet vested. If I didn't have several mouths to feed that were depending on my salary, I would have left years ago  lessIsis' policy was to teach/train/promote each employee to her/his highest capability. My position was created from the need to claim the next corporate step of submitting an NDA for Isis' first drug. We all were on a steep learning curve learning exactly what the FDA required to permit a drug to go market. I was generally updating SOPs, managing required elements for the CMC (Chapter 7 - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls.

723,iSymmetry,"Was guaranteed job 400 miles from my home. Arrived the day before the promised job was to begin. It never began. Recruiter kept lying to me and kept demanding that I stay in that area with no salary and no expense money to pay the hotel bill (the hotel bill was to have been paid out of my salary but I could not earn anything as the job never began). After two weeks during which I caught the recruiter telling me 5 lies, I had to come home. I could not afford expenses of over $1000 with no assurance that the job was ever going to start.N/A I currently work here and it is a great company and enjoy at AT&T.  I have had a great experience at my job and I am able to telecommute which improves my quality of life."
544,IT America,The company takes their time and makes sure people fully understand each subject thoroughly. The company helps people prep for interviews once that individual is on the market. That normally happens when each person has completed the exams needed to continue in the hiring process.Had a good experience working for this company. Had a great team to work with.
71,Jawbone,"Spent two years watching management run the company into the ground while I enjoyed working alongside some very talented people. I would not advise signing on to work for this company today, no matter what the offer.Great idea company with great products just too bad that they did not get a better management team in place sooner.Great group of employees, very talented and determined. If they were given better direction that would have been much more productive and less frustrated.Fun and relaxed place to work. Supportive management ( professional and personal growth). Feeling comfortable with the people you work with, getting to know them knowing they are good people and good at what they do.Company lost focus on product development and establishing needed processes to follow.  Executive team does not communicate with employees and the direction of the company.  Lack of funding and no future for bringing company to IPO.I like working for this company the Management Team is very friendly and understanding and great with assisting your with any issue you may have .Work environment is great, many great and talented people.  Product ID is unbeatable with museum type of design.  Free lunch, drinks, snacks, + birthdays and work anniversaries celebration is fun.A normal day includes checking in, the computer, as well as the store manager on duty. Being the field operation specialist you don't have no other co-workers, but you do teach the other employees in the store on the products you sell. Everything has it's challenges, like a day when there isn't anybody interested in hearing about your product, which happens, but to overcome that I tend to relocate in other areas to find more customers. The most enjoyable part of working is interacting with people, and selling products.Jawbone benefits from their great talent but has a serious lack of Management. Jawbone suffers most from the lack of direction.Own product structure and delivery into manufacturing.Work one-on-one with engineers and product managers to create BOMs and required support documentation.Bit chaotic. Executive Management are a bit scattershot.Fun products to work on but the development process needs a lot of help.Good food and health coverage.View of the river and baseball field. casual work environment"
524,Jet,"a typical day at work was grabbing a scanner and a cart full of boxes, scan each box and find the items through out the warehouse to pack into the orders. once all order were filled you returned the cart to be packaged properly and shipped. the hardest part of the job was walking for 10 hours a day but the fixed hours and pay were well worth it. all of my coworkers were very friendly and would help you with any questions you had. the company was very fun and very relaxed when all your hard work was done.Hard work pays off. Good things happen to good people and bad people go to work too work be a positive person at all times .Why complain about your job or doing it when its easy as a light exercise. I myself was the top preformer.Day at Jet Starts off first with getting to work you come in and you immediately get started. Employees are great people. One of the most enjoyable aspects is the atmosphere.It's a great place to work ...has a good family work ethic.they make it a fun environment to work in. Alot of fun.anyone would enjoy working for jet. Apply to them.Work was great at first. They are a new company that doesn't have it together yet. My coworkers were amazing, but the management was iffy to say the least. The hardest part of the job, was how much I didn't like it. I wanted to advance faster than they would allow me. I had all the qualifications to be a lead, but wasn't given the position.A typical day at work is entering work with a positive, going to either pick up the money for my cash register or the folder for inventory or either both. Also, i set my stand up in a timely matter and stating that means counting for inventory, putting money in the register, making lemonade and popcorn...etc, I also greet my customers and begin the day for the came, when its time to leave just recount for inventory clean up my stand and count the money i have made for today and turn everything in,really nice place to work but they pay was not good enough to keep me working there, i had to move on to a better paying companypretty good and easy joblots and lots of walking. very hard on the body after 2 days of working. pay is pretty decent and theres room for growth. all types of people and races working thereWorking for Jet has been a very enjoyable experience. You get to meet and work with different people from different backgrounds.The scheduling is extremely flexible and the job is only hard if you make it hard.Good place to gain experience and further your skills in Welding/Fabricating. Can further skills in laser/water jet cutting and machining.Pros:Great people, easy to move up and to different places. They definitely show their appreciation by catering, and offering advancements to other positions. Cons: A lot of management is clueless. They have strict time policies which make you think they are trying to push people out. They are such a new company that they are still finding their way so there is constant changes.New company just starting up and they're not organized yet. Communication was sporatic & didn't get paid for a month. Hopefully they'll get this worked out over time.Taking phone calls, managing a queue, problem solving, placing orders for clients. I have learned many new systems, procedures, company is constantly changing.Management doesn't communicate with employees or supervisors, there is a big lack.I have some very great coworkers that I work with on my team.The hardest part is how drastic and frequent changes are with no communication.I love working with and being apart of a growing and developing teamHe went out of  business due too lack of funds.. I did like the experience and working with client and the warranty companiesShifts were PRNAttended to medical injuries for young athletesSolo medic for football, soccer, volleyball games and trackAssisted management with sport physicalsI was able to get hands on work where I learned a lot coming out of school.  They let you explore new ideas to help improve products and expand markets.Good work environment with friendly employees but it is a small company with limited resource so you may not be able to implement your project even if there is a good opportunitynot a bad place to work, however, it seems that not everyone is treated fairly based upon the work completed.Great job for extra income. This job has proved to be a great part time job that i have been grateful to have three different cities to work in. It is a great experience because i get to work sporting events, concerts, and other cool events.i would usually be in avert buggy welding the verist all day intill it was time to add another ring. i learned pulse welding is way better and easier to weld with.hardest part was jumping the scaffold boards. easiest part was welding the floor. most enjoyable part was finishing the tank.Wonderful room for advancement and career growth. Phenomenal work environment."
525,JetBlue Airways,"A company that takes care of both inside and outside customers and has a lot of values caring safety passion intrgrity It is a 13 times in row a JD power winner Adding more flights and growing fastI absolutely love the company and management. It's the super low hourly wages that has me disappointed with the company. Yes you get the perks of flying for free but that means little to nothing if you aren't making enough to take care of your family. The company is growing wildly so for big stations (JFK, MCO, BOS, FLL) hours are plentiful HOWEVER if you are in a small station like BNA with only 3 flights you are only going to get 20 hours a week MAX is you work mornings and 25 hours if you work afternoons.This is a very flexible work environment once you are able to work from homeFor the first few months one needs to travel to the facility, but once one is over the initial training working from home is a great experienceThe travel benefits are alright, but trying to get a flight could be stressful when one has to fly standbyAt work on a daily basis you were met with challenges due to the lack of support because of staffing.  To be a supervisor you had to know how to multi-task. My colleagues were very supportive at all times team work was a day to day practice with our team of leaders.  However there were times that upper management could have been more supportive. Hardest part of the job was when you couldn't get support from your upper Management. So I learned  to be confident in my decisions based on my knowledge and experience.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the flight benefits, the crewmembers and profit sharing.One of the best jobs I've ever held. I enjoyed my 13 years at JetBlue and although I never try to look back, I must admit I miss this one tremendously. Management at all levels always made sure that all crewmembers were empowered by ensuring constant training and support was always available. Opportunities to grow within the company was supported with mentorship and shadowing programs for those with a vision and the desire to succeed.Excellent place to work, staff is amazing. Travel is available for all qualified staff.  The Pilots are very supportive and helpful to Inflight Crew Members.  Training was grueling but necessary and the Trainers were exceptional.  If you have never experienced anything as it relates to Aviation, you must be prepared for an in depth training curriculum.This is a great company to work for. The culture is relaxed , open, and fun. Innovation and willingness to try new things is the norm here. My only critique would be the lack of a clear career trajectory. It is not consistent across departments. Some departments have very clear paths for career growth, while others have employees that seem to be stuck in some sort of purgatory. Also, the process for reviews has changed several times.Management was horrible, definitely picked and choosed favorites, which made work life very difficult. Management never let you know how you were doing, or how you can improve. Only talked to you when did something wrong. Then wouldnt tell you how you can do it right the next timeJetBlue is a good place to work. However, I am looking to leave the airline industry and pursue a new career in a different customer service field. I have grown tired of all the traveling, living out of a suitcase, staying at hotels and the overall environment of the airline industry. On the upside, I have made many great friends, seen a lot of places and adapted to the fast past lifestyle. The one thing that I really dislike about the job is that I live in Charlotte but I am based out of Boston. My job requires me to commute by plane weekly. My life, family and friends are all here in Charlotte and this is where I want to be. Thank you!Has its moment, it can be really busy and really slow however the most excitement comes when things are busy because it the time everyone meaning customers are angry. I-rate customers are sometimes upset for something that has nothing to do with the airline but its still exciting dealing with themWorking at Jetblue is a wonderful experience and allows an avid traveler or adventurous explorer to be able to explore and see the world while working or enjoying the perks while off work at incredible discounts and rates.The people are great and are very passionate about what they do. Days and people are difficult and challenging. Delays affect not just the airline and passengers but you as well, so making sure you have a good balanced diet and food prepared and brought with you for those times you don't have the option to grab food anywhere really comes in handy and gives you that needed energy boost. However, meeting people from all walks of life and all around the world is wonderful and truly makes you realize the world is so big and there are so many people trying to live their day to day lives as best as possible with what they are given.Jetblue is a great company to work for.  They have a heart of gold in which they show to their employees and customers.  The pay is great and competitive which is a plus.  Some times the hours get to you but thats part of the job.  Senior leadership is great, very supportive of their employees.My typical day at work is very easy because of my past work experience and solid years of experience in Customer service,Management,Sales,Budget control,supervision,Time and Leadership.What I have learn while working at Jet Blue for the past 3 years is multiplying many daily flights, while leading ground crew to have a smooth operation. My co workers are super wonderful and like our company motto "" Caring""The hardest part of my jobs is a delays of flights where sometimes customer have to wait for a while.The most enjoyable and wonderful thing about my is I get to travel the world.I love working for JetBlue. I am trully blessed to be a part of this great company. I enjoy going to work everyday. This is the first job i am happy about and proud to consider myself a part of this growing company. I trully am very grateful for this opportunity.JetBlue was my last job. It was productive and fun work place. I worked from home, that was the best, that was the most enjoyable part of the job. Typical day at work, woke up, had breakfast and work in my PJs sometimes. I have learned a lot, how to deal with customers, learned new systems. Managements are excellent, but supervisor are not typical I like her to be. I liked most of my co workers, but I don't get to see them because we all worked at home. The hardest part about my job is the expectations. We have to stay focus and keep working all the time, no inactivity what so ever and we have to meet the criteria and goals. They monitored us all the time, watched and listen to us work. Worst part is lack of training. I enjoyed the most was my flight benefits and able to stay home and enjoy my family.Outstanding organization to work for. Great Health care  benefits for part time employees as well as full time employees, and free flying privileges.Stock options etc.Great place to work, caring management, options to learn more, educated and move on!JetBlue has a proud tradition of supporting dedicated community organizations through partnerships, donations and crew member volunteering.Very exciting company to work for. Not only does it take care of it's customers and openly takes excellent care of it employees. Upper leadership is very in tune with employees and also very willing and able to help when needed. Excellent choice to work for.I have been with the organization for over 6 years and at times it has been great at other times very challenging.  Direction can be unclear and lacking. Work life balance is a challenge, expectations are you should be available all day every day.  But if you enjoy being in a team environment and working hard than it is a magical placeIt was a stay at home job.  It was difficult because you were constantly on the phone, call after call.  We had Co-workers who were above us and helped us with any questions or concerns.  The hardest part of the job was when customers would get upset with you when you had no control over it.  I loved being a part of JetBlue but had a hard time using the benefits because of the schedule.Jetful is an amazing place to work. CEO and higher management really care about employees and are always finding ways to compensate for hard work and effort. Everyone is friendly and always willing to help. Growth options are achievable and promotions are always encouraged."

Current:  internally competitive, leaders figuring how to make themselves look good, ""what have you done for me lately"" mentality, very little loyalty,  have no problem cutting jobs or letting people go to bring in cheaper resources or obtain skills needed rather than development.Perhaps this is the way of the world everywhere.>Called on various departments within hospital accounts as well as clinics.

What can be problematic is management's direction, view, or process in place that is sometimes challenging to revisit for improvements or enhancements.Productive environment, onsite benefits such as cafeteria, gym and store. And flexible hours but management tends to care only for themselves. Great co-workers. The hardest part of the job is there was not permanent seating; seating must be reserve via PC every couple days.It is a company led by a CREDO. Very dynamic.  The Leaders have an exceptional sense of management.  I enjoy my days giving my best to our customers.  My co-workers are very different, but we trust in the Diversity.  The company is very committed with the employees.  I had the opportunity to develop my professional and personal skills participating in many initiatives and activities."
454,JP Morgan,"JPMC is a great company but the opportunities outside of fund services operations in Boston are limited. Within Ops, there are plenty of opportunities for advancement/role change, and the pay is good compared to similar roles at other firms.My job is a great, I get to work at 7:45am everyday and leave at 3pm-6pm some days. It is a convenient location, and is a helpful job to have. However, moving up in the company is a lot more difficult than it should be. I am also a over qualified part time worker.The employees at Chase like most large companies are what make you stay for as long as you do. That and for me knowing that you could make a positive impact on not only a customers life but potentially a manager, employee, or peers life.Great Company. Been a teller for 5yrs just looking for a change & a better future. Willing to make more money & aim higher than ever.-Maintain a cash drawer within set limits and services atms.-Identify and submit product referral opportunities to appropriate sources.-Maintain a foreign currency cash box.-Provide exceptional customer service.-Balance vaults daily.The hardest part of the job was cooperation from the owner of the home to get completed documents and financial information into get an approval for a new mortgage.This company is an amazing place to be employed they really take care of their customers. The company makes sure if not all most of the employees needs are met at and away from the work place.I enjoy working at Chase lots of different opportunities here. Another thing i like about Chase the diversity in ths workplace.The atmosphere is laid back.I truly enjoyed my time with Chase bank and met great people.  I learned so much about leadership and associate development.This job is so laid back. I enjoyed working there and meeting the people that work there.... It's really hard to get on permanently there and their benefits suck before hired on.Typical day consisted of logging in to all systems and phone lines.Taking multiple calls from customers and directing them on needed documents missing to complete underwriter review.  Perfecting documents and submitting file to underwriter.Calling customers and going over additional documents needed and getting commitment as to return of documents.Calling and going over underwriter decision with customers.Maintaining 200 plus pipeline.Skills learned on job was how to show compassion for customers who were in a very dark place.  Motivate them into providing needed information in order to complete review to determine if home could be modified or if Foreclosure was unavoidable.Co workers were amazing.  Management was productive and fair.  Unable to provide career path.Hardest part of this job was getting customers who had lost all hope to put faith in program.Most enjoyable part of my job was opening a customers mind on what truly was in there best interest.A typical day at work is doing 5-6 alerts per day.  I've learned to take my time with cases and eventually the production will go up as time goes on.  The team leads and co-workers were very helpful and always provided help and information when needed.  The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with co-workers and their production.  The most enjoyable part of the job was was working in a group and fun people.I worked in different chase branches. The managers are the one who either suck the life out of you, or help you advance. I was lucky to have 2 great managers! Some busy locations can be stressful for tellers, but bankers can really profit from sales. Slower branches are better for tellers, and bad for bankers, due to sales.Great place for career minded people, room for mobility and advancement.  Great team atmosphere and partnership across functions and businessesEveryone is very helpful put they do not have the best mgmt in place. they have to many layers and things get stuck in the system.need to become more streamline.A great company to work and have met some good people working there including the CEO, who is one of the most down to earth guy you can meet because his head is not in the clouds and he knows how to use the power.However, the subculture of poor managers needs to be better!A typical day at work consisted of compiling numbers for various reports due to numerous legal entities across the globe. This was challenging work but rewarding.If you like a fast pace environment, this is it. I liked the culture, the people, the activities and the most important, I was really happy with my day to day duties and my team.Great atmosphere at work, professional and friendly co-workers, fast paced environment with lot of networking and customer service.I love working for Chase they have great benefits I just want to do something different. Will love to experience something different been in the banking business for 16 years.JP Morgan Chase was a great company and I would recommend anyone that is thinking about getting into the banking profession to consider this company as a perfect place to start.You meet a new person everyday at Chase. I've learned so much from cash handling to dealing with fraudulent customers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with irate customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know your customers and building lasting relationships with them."

Total chaos but it was worth it, I met a lot of good people there from all walks of life.Learning new things about the tools and architect. Getting data from database guys is very tuff they dont give us on time.unless you really need the money stay away. this place is about as mismanaged as they come. they actually expect you to give a formal written reason as to why you will not work on your regular days off.One fine day i didn't do my work on time,i learned how to write the java scripts. my co-workers and mangement very friendly manner.good working culture. discuss about  the scope of the project, having a meeting with management  regarding implementation  and conduct defect meeting with all the scrum teams.Fun work place with very supportive team.

449,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"JPMC is a great company but the opportunities outside of fund services operations in Boston are limited. Within Ops, there are plenty of opportunities for advancement/role change, and the pay is good compared to similar roles at other firms.Be it management, leadership development, sales, recruiting, negotiation, training and/or providing an incredible client experience, I am driven to succeed. Whether I am working by myself, with others, or leading a group of people, I am highly motivated to complete every challenge with excellence. Professional, yet personable, I have a strong reputation for being a dynamic leader with the ability to influence teams, colleagues and entire enterprises to succeed and achieve high levels of performance. I am a motivator, encourager, moral builder, success driver through my personal approach of Servant Leadership to the people I support.I liked my job as loan specialist working with titles daily. Learned a lot about the Auto Finance Industry that I didn't know prior. No micro-management will you work, able to listen to music, fun and family atmosphere celebrating all occasions, flexible family life. Able to earn funds toward your MRA account for medical expenses. Enjoyed that occasionally we received breakfast and lunch served an employee appreciation and many more Perks!A typical day at work for me is interacting with my team of 18 specialists. I coach on call opportunities, after listening to live calls. Review performance metrics and discuss opportunities for improvement. I am available to assist with escalated calls from clients. I approve payroll and enter information in employee personnel files. I review emails to determine information to pass down to my specialists so that they are always in the know.Very stressful environment.  The customers don't stress you out; the management does.  You get monitored on every call and if you don't use the right phrase, you get a policy and procedure error.  One error gets you a performance improvement plan.  Two errors gets you a written warning,  Three errors in a 2 month period and you're out.  It would be easy to avoid if they didn't keep changing policy consistently.  And there's no easy way to look up policy.  They don't have it in a nice neat little book that you can reference.  It's every where on the intranet and connected to several links.  If you don't memorize it, you're out.  Good luck.  Everyone is always on a PIP!Started great but moved to the numbers game of 12 minute resolution times and extreme micromanaging.You were questioned why you were not on call if 1 minute has passed between calls. Bathroom breaks were refused until the managers decided it was ok and then gripes if it lasted over 10 minutes. Much hidden politics and cut-throat environment where unless your work can directly benefit a higher-up, you were just a replaceable.i dont want to rant about a company but i will say this ! i will never advise anyone to work for this company. Under paid and over worked. Also no appreciation of your hard work . I was a bank teller with many many rolls.  I did the work of a full time employee  but would never get full time pay. My manager was very very fake ! She lied to me on countless occasions . I really hated working here and i think that is job is only good for a temporary moment (2 months) and thats it.Hands down most horrible job I've ever had.  Kiss the work life balance goodbye.  You will work way more than 40 hours and you will work 6 days a week.  There are always a few nice customers, but depending on if you are in a bad part of town, most customers are awful.  I got screamed at, spit on, had stuff thrown at me, and called every name in the book.  It is personally your fault when their account is overdrawn and they can't qualify for a loan.  The pressure that upper management places on the employees to ""provide a great customer experience"" is ridiculous.  Customers know they can walk all over you and there is nothing anyone will do about it. The ability to prioritize and make on-the-spot decisions regarding customer transactions, weighing customer satisfaction issues with bank exposure to loss or fraud.  Excellent customer service skills and mathematical skills  In-depth knowledge of all bank deposit products and policies Ability to work in a fast-paced environment  Ability to work well under pressure  High degree of accuracy  Strong communication skillsMy typical work day consist of focuses on Chase internal relationships with individual people – whether those are customers, service users, colleagues or suppliers, different lines of business while sorted and filed loan documentation for multiple Chase business departments. Monitored workflow, including dates of work received, incoming types and relative volumes of work.Followed departmental procedures necessary to intake, decision and process customer inquiries. .I have grown a lot in Chase and I love this company. I have worked my way up to being the best banker in my district 2 years in a row and a top 100 banker in all of chase, 2 years running. However the bank is making cuts and they have chased away all walk in business with new eatms. My job recently has become a have cold calling job.•	Responsible for the administration and daily operation of the bank.•	Mainly responsible for assisting the branch manager and providing reports and statements of the daily work to the manager.•	Maintained good relationship with the staff and clients.•	Helped in preparing annual budget and strategies for meeting the goals and objectives.•	Responsible for solving all the queries and problems of the staff and clients.•	Prepared loan titles for closing process (purchase and refinance) under various loan programs in accordance with policies and procedures. •	Reviewed loan file with loan origination system to ensure data accuracy.  Prepared loan closing document package including closing instructions and dual wiring of funds request. •	. Prepared loan for wire funding. Submitted closed loan file for shipment to National Post Closing.•	Trained and coached all new hires. Managed non preforming employees with weekly performance managementWorking in marketing was amazing and I enjoyed most of it.  My position was stressful because I was trained for 2 weeks and then my support went out on maternity leave.  In her absence I was doing the job of 4 people and doing it really well.  I had great support from the other departments.  There was one hiccup that the copy editor was not good and only got worse after being promoted.  Ultimately she went on a power trip and Chase merged with Bank One.  Right after that our department was downsized and she was laid off.  Eventually we were all let go.Working for JPMorgan and Chase was an eye opening experience. During my time there I realized how society viewed banks. While working there, often times Occupy Atlanta came by to protest during the end of our shift leaving us hostage in the bank until enforcers came to break it up. This was during the time families were losing there houses to Chase because of mortgages not being paid. It was definitely a learning experience but I still found ways to enjoy the job by making connections with my daily customers.Banks are all pretty much the same.  I don't really have anything good or bad to say.  You are either interested in working at a bank or you are not.  You learn the rules of the game or you will lose. Politics are everywhere.  The difference with Chase is this - they get what they want and will pay you for it.  Don't be afraid to ask for an out of range salary.  You may be surprised depending on the line of business. Otherwise a bank is a bank is a bank.Dealing with inbound technical calls, billing statement inquires, deposit information, general account inquiries.Couldn't ask to have met better people in the time I was there.Management wasn't the greatest. There was a lot of favoritism and unfairness.The hardest part of the job was dealing with the occasional irate customer.The most enjoyable part was the gratitude of the merchants when getting their needs / issues resolved.very busy typical daylearned a lot of legal terms, to be independent, multi tasking and how to deal with the attorneys and how to manage timevery knowledgeable and understanding managementresponsible and very efficient co-workersto download documents because it was a repetitive task using copy and paste with hundreds and hundreds of documents or more for each loanflexible time of work, going to have fun with the whole department like having a group trip to the movies, watching dodger games and have fun bowling as an incentive of the company to the employees and the free good food.Overall the benefits and pay are in line with company standards.The culture is very competitive. It's a great place to challenge one self and develop strong leadership skills. If you are proactive there are tons of groups and company supported community events that you can become involved with. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping clients reach their goals and helping employees grow.DEVOPS Lead role was challenging as I had to analyse all manual work and come up with a scope for automation. Define automation roadmap to team. We as a team had spent many hours in fixing things right for Development and Testing team. work used to be interesting and challenging. We also used to have fun at work. We had a very supportive manager who gave us complete freedom to explore automation options and gave design liberty. He used to review and understand the process better and was a good mentorManagement is supportive and provides allows staff to work in an environment in which is positive and allows for growth.Work from home employee for 4 years work independently meeting requirements and deadlines.Organizational changes happening so often do present challenges in processes at times.Making new relationships with other parts of the organization when working new projects and learning new skill sets when processes change are always an exciting part of the job."

165,Justice Resource Institute,"This company does a lot of good for many people.  As a non profit company there are not many pay raises but the benefits are decent.  My coworkers are dedicated to helping the youth.  Management at the program level are considerate of their employees.Co-workers are great and the individuals cared for. Management expects way too much for the money they pay with little or no incentives to stay working hard and not much room for advancement. Pay raises are not guaranteed unless company profits and everyone gets one. They keep pushing more and more responsibility unless you stick up for yourself.great kids, great staff, good hours, good place, good money, wonderful management, friendly people and atmosphere, only reason i left was to stay home w kids otherwise i would still be thereI like working there been there for a while. They only thing is they don't pay enough money that's all. They really help they kids and want the best fro them. A typical day at work is a restraint if they kids don't act up. I've learn many things from working in these field, i believe people can over come anything and change and function normal. I like some and some like me, I don't like when people are doing the kids wrong so i don't like some people because of that. The hardest part is restraint. The most enjoyable tings are is the outing and when the kids are happy.Management isn't that great. The residents have more voice then you do. If you don't have seniority and you have an issue you will be heard but, they take it like a grain of salt. The benefits are great. The pay could be a little better for what the job entails.The supervision at this company sucks.  They are unethical in their practices.  Require workers to drive almost 2,000 miles a month for client care.  They force overtime but refuse to pay for it.  They expect one person to do the work of five different people.  The morale around the office is that everyone wants a new job.  I would strongly suggest not working here.I fully enjoy working with JRI, their leadership is incredible. I've learned many new skills over my decade working in the agency.I love the environment in which I work, I love the people I work for. I enjoy that changes are being made for the better within the program. The pay is not great, but that of any human service worker is not.JRI is an ok place to work, have very good benefits. The workers have a very good sense of unity. I like the fact that I'm busy all the time, if you are not afraid to work hard then, it's perfect. Flexible hours.There is no room to expand or grow within the agencies. Salary increase is non existent.The average lifespan of a JRI employee, to my knowledge, is 2 years... and this is why.  It's a job where people come to get entry level experience, may move up, but only meekly because the options are few and far between, and the ceiling is pretty low.  There are no incentives to stay.  Vacation time does accrue quickly but it maxes out at 4 weeks.  No performance reviews, no contact with management to give feedback or voice concerns, no raises based on merit or length of employment, no maternity benefits (other than those legally mandated), and the expectations are high.  Work holidays, nights, and weekends.  Be available by phone always.  If it takes over 40 hours you are expected to do it- with no compensation.  The clientele is great, most of the colleagues are too.  There are some pretty excellent training opportunities but JRI won't ask if you want them, you have to seek them out and then ask for funding.  The overhead is so much and the 8-10 VP's of JRI get paid BIG BUCKS, but where are they???Working for Justice Resource Institute has been great in the sense that it feels like coming home. It's a great supportive environment.The peer support is great and fun, energetic group of mixed age people . We share our ups and downs and collaborate to find solutions to pressing matter as a team....that's the most enjoyable part of the job. The down side of the job is lack of advancement. within the company.Worked at one of the residential schools (live and attend school on site) with adolescent females. There is room to advance, camaraderie amongst direct care staff, immense training and education given weekly, and the chance to work in both the residential and educational capacity.The pay was too low for the amount of responsibilities. They did have rather good benefits.  It was hard to move around and move up.Great team of individuals both co-workers and management. Very caring and dedicated to it's clients and staff.Lots of support.Company cared about it employees. Offered many incentives as well to make people want to work there. HR is great and management is the best ive seen in a while.I was hired as part of a management team who were tasked to develop three new group homes and behavioral programs, policies and procedures for the rehabilitation of adolescents with a variety of behavioral, cognitive, and psychological disorders.  A month into the job the funding that had been projected as forthcoming from DDS fell through.  Consequently, so did the planned management and staffing structures.  I elected to move from group home management to the position of clinical case manager so that the Assistant Group Home manager whom we had already hired was promoted to Group Home Manager without a raise in pay, but did not suffer a pay cut.  Once opened, a typical work day saw me traveling to one of the three group homes where I provided individual, family and group therapy.  My work day included case management, ensuring that all providers to include DDS and DCF were on the same page with progress and delivery of services.   I worked closely with direct care staff to ensure best practices toward building therapeutic alliances with the residents.  The most difficult part of the job was the extended travel.  The group homes were located between Chesterfield (Norwich area) and Thompson.  Often I would be called on to be at Thompson for staff training and then travel to two or more group homes for unexpected meetings mostly having to do with one of the children requiring crisis intervention.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being part of a like-minded team who practiced a gentle and consistent approach to behavioral change, and who refrained from shaming, blaming  more... or judging in order to manipulate behavioral compliance.  lessA nurturing atmosphere with a supportive administration. If you are positive and a hard worker looking to support families, then this is the place to be.I enjoyed working at JRI. They have a wonderful benefit package.The hardest part of the job was having a supervisor that was unavailable. The staff that I worked with became like family. Amazing group of men and women.The individuals that we worked with, helped create that bond.This was an entry level position as a Residential Counselor. I soon became a Supervisor. I have found this to have been the best Company that I have ever worked for. I would not hesitate to take a part time position with them anytime. Great Administrative Residential DirectorGood team work. Learned from supervisor and other coworkers through wonderful communication skills and trainings. Great support systems set in place and a community you can trust. Flexible work schedule.Good place to work, Hardest part of the job was the always schedule and transport. I moved up to management fast. Co workers are ok, I learned a lot about human services and developmental disabilities. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the clients everyday and knowing that I helped them get a job."
59,Kaiser Permanente,"Nice job culture with the kaiser team. The team is very small and they are very helpful. Nice team co-ordination. Management always give good support to the developer, which helped every developerI worked for Kaiser for many years. From college through my early professional career. A lot of politics among administrators at times but they treated me well. Kaiser compensation was far below what other hospitals in the community were paying back when I worked for them.  Eventually what  prompted me to leave. Not sure how they compare now. Very manageable workday. Teamwork among co workers. Hardest part of my job was the egos of certain physicians. Enjoyable part of my job was working with my co workers.We were and still are like family.After working at Kaiser for 10 years, I saw two different types of leadership. The initial CEO had a heart for the nurses, and Kaiser did very well in patient satisfaction surveys as well as staff satisfaction surveys. The current CEO has less interest in the staff from what I could see, the nurses' weren't being listened to. I was saddened to see this happen, the work culture felt much more tense.KP is a great place to extend your career. Employees are friendly, professional and willing to help. The culture promoted is one of togetherness with the patients first. There are some snags in management, primarily in Georgia. A typical day of greeting and serving some of the best people in the world and helping to make their health the best it can be. Overall I would recommend it as a stepping stone for the medical field. The providers are overall a great group, eager to listen and respond to their patients and internal employees. The hardest part of the job would be going home at the end of the day with so many people to help.My typical work day start at 6 and end at 2:30. I've learned how to process claims and to problem solve.  Also I've learned how to work with outside vendors in recouping overpayments on claims.  Our management team is very knowledgeable and willing to go beyond to help you achieve your goals.  The hardest part of the job is that what I do as a Claims Recovery Specialist is it's always busy, but I like the challenge of my job, it keeps you on your toes at all time, because day and day out you must know how to mulit-task and problem solve.  My job is a problem solving job.  The best part I enjoy is that I never get bored and there is a challenge everyday and you can come to work 5 days a week and not do the same job duty everyday.  We were many hats as a Claims Recovery Specialist.I enjoyed my internship experience at Kaiser Hospital because I was able to network with several Kaiser employees, and learned more in-depth about the culture of Kaiser.  In addition, I attained more knowledge and experience in Microsoft Excel and data entry.  It was truly an enjoyable experience and I look forward to any potential job openings/availabilities in the Kaiser Permanente Network.Excellent organization with excellent emphasis on preventive care. Great opportunity for improvement in career growthInvolve in staff development to ensure partnership and provide safety  and affordable care for patient To be able to work in partnership in a union environmentGreat coworkers who works coperatively with each other to ensure succesHardest part of the job is long hours to ensure efficiency and maintain the organization statusMost enjoyable to note the great and continued succes of the organizationThis Review is Solely on The EVS Department-The Pay is Good But It's Like a Secret Society.  Communication us HORRIBLE Between Management and Staffing. Alot of Favoritism Occurs, Unfortunately. Extremely Gossipy Co Workers. Get In, Do Your Work and Go Home.  Not Sure Why EVS Department Lacks So Much Comradery and Organization.  Plenty of O.T. if Wanted.  Benefits Good After 90 Days. Areas are Extremely  Large to Finish in an 8 Hour Shift. In Proper Training. I Would Rather Have The Work Culture Be Much More Professional and Unified in Another Department. Not Enough Pay for the Stress. Manager and Both Supervisors Left/ Quit/Transferred/ Got Terminated All Within Months of One Another.I worked for this company for over 10 years in the Sacramento Call Center. When I got sick I was let go. The work culture in the Call Center was abysmal and the management was unsympathetic to life needs. I started there to ""get my foot in the door"" and found that it was impossible to transfer out of the call center once I was there. There was no room for advancement. The job is highly stressful and the management made that stress worse. I loved being a Kaiser Employee but would never work in the call center again. I would love a chance to work in a different department however because the benefits and pay were excellentKaiser was a great company to work for if all i cared about was salary and benefits. I learned many things in my place of employment and grew a lot as a nurse. I learned to supervise different modules in our department as well as work with different specialties within pediatrics. However management was not kind to their employees at all and were only ever worried about numbers and not patients well being. My co-workers were overall kind and I got along with them well. The hardest party of my job was being able to talk to or communicate with management about any issues there were within work. The overall best part of my job was working with kids and being to help others in their time of need. Not only the patient was grateful at the end of the visit but the family members as well which was very rewarding.Kaiser is a great place for a steady career. Being a big company there are many reorganizations, especially in the IT space. The workforce is a talented pool of people who enjoy their work. The concern appears when new executives are hired which can has the potential to change the work/life balance.Most jobs were 4 10 hour days, which worked great for me.  My direct manager was in general very fair and knowledgeable.  I did feel like some of the upper level management made decisions that directly affected us without really understanding the consequences.  I felt valued and appreciated as an employee.  They do an outstanding job of communicating pertinent information such as policies, job expectations, and work systems to employees.  The care given to patients is in general very high quality, evidence-based, comprehensive care.  The dentists I worked with were humble, down-to-earth, and happy to work with staff as a team.  They seemed to check their egos at the door.There is not enough money in the world to get me to work here ever again. The work culture is lazy, people work here only for the money which is top pay because the place is horrible to work for. Top people leave, or are counting their days until retirement.Kaiser Permanente set the standard for providing top notch healthcare benefits to their employees.  As such, they expect and believe in each employee showing empathy while providing great customer care to all Kaiser customers; whether it's a vendor or patient.  Kaiser stays busy.  We consistently provide care to patients.  We work hard on a daily basis to make sure each & every patient is treated with respect, dignity and great customer care.  When working at Kaiser you run across employees who have been there 30 yrs or more.  So it goes without saying, Kaiser is great place to work!  Yes, it's not peaches and cream everyday but overall, you'll feel good about the care provided to patients here.A typical day at work is consumed by coordination of employees, providers, and patients, to provide a seamless experience. The hardest part of the job is maintaining a positive team spirit, and providing the best care for our patients. I find this challenging and enjoyable.This is the healthcare company you work for if you want to sell your nursing soul to the devil. Management beds the various Unions there & vice versa. Do not believe the union hype. The concepts of respect & trust are non-existent, and both administration, nursing leadership, and union leadership are tainted from the top down. Don't expect much from the physicians either. In my 20 years of nursing work experience, I would go so far as to say that the employment environment at Kaiser Fresno is the most hostile, uncultured and unrefined of its kind in the healthcare industry. Quality and safe patient care take a backseat to the ""great pay and benefits,"" and these are the only reasons why nurses stay. If you value your integrity, morals &  principles, and are willing to make a little less money to preserve them, take your priceless experience and skills elsewhere.Program executives are committed to Kaiser Permanente's mission to serve the community.  The three departments that I have worked in, and the dozens more whom I have collaborated with, are talented and interested in thinking about the impact of their work.KP is a great company to work for. The culture is one focused on patient care and over community  care. I would recommend Kaiser to potential employees. The benefits and work life balance are a plus.I can not say enough about the great place to work like KP. The employees are great and very friendly. Days are what you make them. Most co-workers are hard working and like their jobs.If you are non-union, you are treated like a third class citizen.  You work harder, pay more for insurance and prescriptions.  Receive lower wages, no salary increases, and held to a higher standard, due to KP ""honoring"" union contracts.  Union workers receive automatic non-merit raises annually and have a ""not my job"" attitude, which non-union EE must pick up the workload.  Middle management who run large departments with big union environments are corrupt. They will bend laws and contract to pacify Union and Upper Management.  Not all Kaisers are like this - but Roseville, CA is extremely offensive.Kaiser is a really good employer in that they want to see their employees succeed in Career and Home Life.  They do work tirelessly at ensuring that you are happy in your workplace and feel you have a positive work/life balance."
376,Kaplan Test Prep,"Kaplan as a for-profit university, has the right idea. As an educator they are above reproach. With a little reorganization and rethinking culture, I have no doubt Kaplan will become a top educator.I have been teaching for Kaplan for 3 years and my experience has been gradually getting worse. I have never gotten a raise or even qualified for a review despite having very good experiences with my students who seemed to like me a lot and whose scores improved. It seems to me that the company is not as concerned as it should be with keeping experienced and valuable instructors on board. In addition to the pay issue, management has been less helpful and responsive than they were when I began teaching 3 years ago.  I have also had to spend more time than necessary dealing with IT issues just to access platforms necessary to do my job. Overall, it was a good experience and I enjoyed teaching very much, but I found that the company does not adequately support its instructors and they did not reasonably review me so that I might qualify for a raise.Kaplan had great pay, good benefits, but they worked you to death!  I loved the free education that I received. Loved working with the students.The management left something to be desired, they wanted you to do your job, and anything else that you could do.  I taught 2 classes a day with approximately 24 students in each class, any assignment you gave you had 48 papers to grade!  So not just a 9-5 job!  But I loved it and still hear from my former students. Hours are long, I was usually gone from home about 12-14 hours a day.I enjoy working for Kaplan University.  I am looking to make a career change and leave the sales industry.  The management team is excellent and they do a great job creating a positive culture.  The hardest part of my job is being held accountable to meet goals, but there are some factors to meeting goal that are out of my control. The most enjoyable part of my job is the interaction I have every day with students and prospective students.Kaplan University is a great place to work. A typical day involves guiding students in their decisions with attaining a better future through education. I have learned that even though some roadblocks may seem insurmountable, nothing is unattainable with patience and persistence. Management is very supportive of assisting advisors with difficulties they may experience with students. Co-workers are family oriented and supportive. Everyone feels like one big family.The hardest part of my job will be when I leave to go elsewhere. I truly hate to go but I need to keep growing in my professional life and that involves relocating back to North Carolina. The most enjoyable part of the job has been working with the Difference Makers, United Way, and Browared ARC.Kaplan has been one of my best jobs! Secure, benefits start on the first day of employment, salary was above competitive and allowed for growth after the first 90 days depending on your production.Lead generation, lead outreach and interviewing prospective students. Could have provided better opportunities for advancement with more qualified management individuals.Good company but of course - no benefits, classes are hit or miss and no growth opportunities.  Worked at the company 10 years and no ability for full time or advancement.I'm not too sure why there are complaints. One, if you don't like working on phones, don't get a job working on phones; it's laughable really. Two, yes, you are required to work hard. I can't understand why that is a negative. Three, there are soooo many positives, that it would take too long to list them here, but, a few include nice break rooms, numerous company/department gatherings and events, excellent benefits, free education through the Gift of Knowledge program, and, believe it or not, there is definitely room for advancement---as long as you push for it. Kaplan is a giant company and it's easy for mediocre people to do mediocre things there for 20 years; don't be that person. My co-workers are the best I've ever worked with. My manager is the best manager I've ever had in my 22+ year career. I think, the most enjoyable part of my job is...it's very challenging. Yes, I work hard, but I love every minute of it. Upper management do their best to disseminate information, but remember, the company is enormous; it has many moving parts. Kaplan is the type of place you could go far if you really want to; but, you could also get caught in a rut. I would definitely recommend Kaplan to other people.I was hired as a classroom instructor for Kaplan after having had experience as only a substitute teacher, and I LOVED my starting pay rate. I also really liked that I could spend as much time as needed answering emails from students, and I could log it on my timecard without being interrogated by my manager. In fact, any type of enrichment studying that I wanted to complete towards the tests I taught was always approved for pay. I liked that I could set my own schedule every month by choosing which courses to teach. Unfortunately, bad management and weird advancement standards make this company worthless for me in the long run. Though my faculty manager never actively caused issues for me, she was almost completely absent and unresponsive to any need or question I ever had. She refused to answer her phone under any circumstance, and would often take weeks to reply to my emails. Also, it was impossible for me to advance within the company, because all advancement opportunities are based entirely on student reviews -- specifically in answer to the question, ""How likely would you be to recommend Kaplan to a friend or colleague?"" A teacher's composite ""score"" for this answer from students must be astronomically high before he or she can even help grade essays. I found this not just unfair, but crippling. Overall, Kaplan is a GREAT starting point if you want to continue a career in education. Just be sure you don't stick around too long.I love this company, there is a culture of support and embracing of change.  I work from home, with a flexible schedule where I can take 2 hours for lunch or to go to a doctor appointment and my manager doesn't even want to know, as long as I've addressed issues and taken care of my day to day responsibilities.I've learned that I am an awesome employee.  Through the care and appreciation of management, I have gained confidence in my skills and I am ready to move on to greater things.I thought the best part of my job was being at home an not being around people in an office, and I truly miss it, it has become a very hard part of my job not seeing my wonderful co-workers in person.My co-workers are the best I've ever worked with.The satisfaction of helping students and knowing at the end of the day I've made a difference.Its a good company to work with, Its a great work environment and learning opportunity in the academic field. This is a great starting point for anyone who wants to pursue teaching as their full time career in the future. Great quality of students and satisfactory compensation.The organization grew too fast and too much for the infrastructure and management to handle resulting in many missed opportunities, high turn-over rate, and fragile job security.My job duties consist of redundancy and can be boring at times, however because of my fabulous coworkers, and my manager at times, we provide each other with ""commercial breaks"" by sharing an experience or a joke during different parts of the day. The best part of my job is not being responsible for anything extra when I am out of the office. It seems when you are off or on vacation, work piles up and nobody does anything for you, but with the job duties that I have, productivity is based on when you are present at work.Admissions at Kaplan University provides little to no job security. Even worse, management plays favorites according to who is liked/disliked by them.Great ManagementBright Office SpaceSolid Team CamaraderieCreative Co-WorkersFostering of New IdeasExcellent Atmosphere with a Fun Work/Life Balancenot good with work life balance, they used to be really good about schedule accommodations, then they stopped that and made it impossible to get a good scheduleTwo things that are great about the job: 1) working alongside talented & driven professionals who truly take pride in their work, 2) interacting with the vast diversity of students. Everything else falls short. Teacher salaries are almost comically disproportional to the amount of time and effort put into the work. Success metrics are based purely on student reviews, which are unreliable and often biased by popularity or student temperaments. Double standards and deceptive practices pop up time to time but usually quietly dealt with. Poor to moderate benefits with little chance of career advancement -- most teachers are kept part-time due to ""budget constraints"". Keeping appearance is often more important than substance.I would like to say that I was able to assist with many roles but only because the management group in place at the time were not well equipped with HR abilities and assistance.  The Associate Directors and Directors were allowing their managers to write and rewrite Job Descriptions as well as make changes to the benefit only of that Director.  When we were required to meet new demands without proper notification or training to do the job, management would not support the employeeKaplan offers employees the opportunity to gain valuable experience within their specialized field. My employment at Kaplan allowed me to gain experience in digital and social media marketing as well as, video content development and editing. Top-level management was knowledgable and well-respected within the organization. I also had the good fortune to work with an outstanding group of individuals that help support our marketing efforts.The most difficult aspect of my job at Kaplan is working through projects that are delayed by multiple layers of approval. This often results is missed opportunities and revenue.The best part of my experience at Kaplan has been the opportunity to work with talented, dedicated individuals and the opportunity to gain new experience and learn, perfect new skills.In a typical day I greet the student, make sure she has breakfast food she can prepare for herself.I learn a lot about different cultures and customs from the students.The management has turned over so much I don't know any of them very well.I have no co-workers.The hardest part of the job is living on display.The most enjoyable part of this job is building the relationship."

792,Kaztronix LLC,"I like to be busy.I typically am accountable (and hands on) for:*Systems Analysis*Specification Collection*Project Management*QA Management and*Training to targeted audiences.""You do crazy really well!""I agree.   I like to know what is going on with every aspect of the project I'm working.I've been exposed to dysfunctional teams and have worked hard to rebuild trust and create a combined, open relationship were contention previously existed.I've learned that individual team members have unique preferences which I try to respect to ensure I, in turn, get the information or work completed as required.I enjoy working on fast-paced assignments and meeting all the persons who contribute to the success of the initiative.The hardest part of the job is knowing that most of the employees on a project team already have full-time, day jobs.Anything I request related to a new initiative/project is above and beyond their daily workload.    I try to mitigate stress on these employees by negotiating deadlines that work for everyone.These employees do not report to me, so there is no other incentive to 'play nice' together other than to respect the team and deliver what I promise, earning their respect.The Company was Great. The contract job they had was not what I was initially told. Thats how the military works for you. They contract you for network engineer but the position doesn't do any networking period. Its a sit and monitoring position No fault to kaztronix at all great company they just need accurate descriptions of their contracts so they know exactly what they are sending their people to do.Kaztronix is an intermediary that places contractors with clients.  I was contracted through Kaztronix as a project manager.  The account manager was fine in terms of setting up the interview with the client and occasionally following up once the gig started.  Other than onboarding and separation, I had virtually no contact with Kaztronix.  I did get paid on time.Here's the warning: Beware all aspects of the HR department, which is terrible -- all slots seemed to be staffed by first-job employees, none of whom seem to know their business.  There were delays in the start date, due to HR's inability to get a background check done on time.  There were multiple requests from them for the same information and once it got booted to someone else in the chain, it had to be resubmitted again.Upon separation, I received no customary HR separation package of paperwork -- just a one page COBRA notice.  They did not process my 401(k) transfer request in a timely fashion, which literally cost me some money.There are a lot better contractor firms out there.  Take my advice and look for one.I was fortunate enough to experience this company only through the interview process. I have two masters degrees from a tier one school, and they contacted me about possible placement in the NYC JNJ office. The first impression I had was awful. It sounded like someone from Mumbai was calling me. I could hardly understand them. The contract rate that was our agreement was dropped by 30 percent post interview. It made the possibility of even working for them impossible. They're just another greedy contract recruiter to leach off educated people in pharma. Stay far away.I worked for Kaztronix LLC. out of  McLean VA. for 2 1/2 years. I worked in the Dallas Texas area. (several hundred miles away)They where great to work for. Any time I had a problem, it was handled Very promptly. The pay was good.The people where friendly.I could not ask for better people to work for.I have been a contractor for 2 years at Kaztronix.. They have been fantastic because not only did they find me a job, they communicated how/ what I needed to accomplish and improve upon while on the job. In two months I'm projected to be converted to an FTE.. I would never had this opportunity if wasn't for Kaztronix. Other Agencies don't communicate with their contract employees..The overall atmosphere is  lively and fun! The opportunity for advancement is super attainable and can happen based on performance . My coworkers are helpful and constantly provide guidance and assistanceRun as fast as you can with this miss leading company. I work for them and what a big mistake on my part. There health ins.is way to costly and there is a contractor  by the name of crossfire that has a way better health ins and they get  you more money to work for them.Kraztronix does not care about you or me all they want is there money. I refer people to crossfire because Kaztronix does not want to pay you the referral money. They come up with a lame excuse to why they don't have to pay you.They tell you what you want to hear and they never back it up .Get every thing in writing from this company.I WELL NEVER REFERR ANY ONE TO THIS COMPANY.I REFERR THEM TO OTHER CONTRACTORS LIKE CROSSFIRE.Stay away. Seek an alternative recruiter if they contact you about a position.Unprofessional, lack of details and will not answer basic questions when you push for details of how the company makes their money. I don't know if they're outright dishonest, but when they tried to get my rate of pay level down, stating it was unmarketable, and I asked if that was because their cut would be less - they wouldn't answer- when I asked how they make their money, they wouldn't answer and told me I was welcome to go to another recruiter.Juvenile and unprofessional at best.I would typically be making phone calls and sending e-mails to potential job seekers in order to discuss with them the job opportunities I had available. This position improved my conversational and listening skills and allowed me to handle multiple tasks at a time successfully.They will say anything to get you onboard. I was sold on taking a contract position with the company at a lower pay than I would normally have accepted because I was told that they had ""excellent benefits"", including medical, dental, a 401(k) and paid Personal Time Off (PTO) even for contract employees. They never sent me any details until after I started. That is when I found that the benefits were prohibitively expensive and Kaztronix did not share in any of the costs. Also, the waiting period was so long that by the time I became eligible for benefits, my three month contract was up. They do have a 401(k) but there is no match. During my contract I did not use any PTO. I had been told that any unused PTO would be paid out when my contract was up. That was a lie. When I called to check on where my PTO check was, I was told that they don't pay accrued leave to contract employees. Stay away, far away from this place.I worked for  this company which is a temp service and they were a good temp. Service to work for . I had to call in my work hours and number of days workedI have nothing but excellent things to report about KAZTRONIX, management identifies with their employees!Kaztronix is a fun environment. I was hired as a recruiter supporting It. The compensation can be excellent if you produce numbers.I love working for Kaztronix.  Co-workers are awesome; they are very helpful, attentive, competitive, creative, hardworking, and just people one would want to hangout with.  Managers, directors, and executives are also awesome; they love to acknowledge people's hard work, they truly appreciate people, they are flexible with one's work life balance, they are understanding, motivating, inspirational, and just good people who promote integrity and honesty.  Never would I have thought I would be thanked for doing my job but that is the type of people they are.  It feels so good to be at the bottom of the chain and hear the words ""thank you"" from the owner of a company.  Management does push one to do their very best, they let one know to be successful one needs to put in extra hours and they are always sure to keep that in mind when one asks for time off or to take care of a personal issue on company time.  They treat you like adults and they know you will make up the time.  Kaztronix is my home and of course things aren't perfect but because of the people I work with and the mentorship they provide, I could never see myself leaving or not giving 100%.  I would say it's a family atmosphere.no paid time off, expensive benefits, poor salary, job description had nothing to do with the actual job.temp assignment, hardest part of the job to know that was only temporaryBusy staffing agency for Government, IT and Pharmaceuticals."

By doing this their employees are more willing to go the extra mile in whatever their  position may be.  This job keeps you on your toes because you are dealing with multiple people to ensure that the job is completed appropriately.It was a good place to work prior to Knights trading error and takeover by Getco. 2 different cultures needed to be merged and a sell off of all Knights subsidiaries has been the roughest ride ever. The biggest secret is what the future holds for its employees.It is very enjoyable to work with like-minded professionals.  It is a small company and very personable in their dealings with their employees.I enjoyed the short time I got to work with people all around the world there. I left for pregnancy reasons and when I decided to return back to work they were in mind of shutting the doors and would not hire anyone.

791,"Kelly Services, Inc.","great company to work with I have no complains they are there when need to seek a opportunity down of it just short terms. excellent staff member there i would recommend it to any one out there with the experience I had.The typical workday with this agency was quite regular as a 9 to 5..  Working for different companies afforded the ability to experience company cultures, different businesses, and different locations to work,  The management changed a bit more than other companies, however,  the company kept their protocols in place.  Co-workers were diverse, skilled, and non-skilled labor, corporate, retail, and service workers, of every level, in many different companies.  The hardest part of the job was that you could be called to go work in a very short time span, as well as, the pay was average.  The flexibility of making the decision to work when you decided, along with experiencing different companies and different people was by far the absolutely best part of the jobs with this company.A productive work place with repetitive work.Good friendly people but alot of workplace drama. Good work schedule with a constant flow and adequate lunch breaks.Horrible temp company. They do not care about there employees. You will not advance being a temp employee at any job being through this company. All they do is look to make money off of having you as an employeeGreat company overall not many flaws. Great coworkers and good work atmosphere. Employers are very kind and help out with all your needs. Can improve on hiring process though.Its a fantastic way to find temporary work. lower ratings in some areas are to be expected as that of a temp service. Typically Kelly's agents act with a high amount of professionalism and kindness.I have always been a factory, warehouse worker type person and the transition to an office environment answering phone calls is very different.  I have worked as a cashier and have customer experience but taking phone calls of upset customers every so often is overwhelming at first. I have learned that I cannot take it personal which is not easy on some calls, however, there it is a joy in talking to new people everyday. You met some really unique people of all ages.My co-workers are great, we talk a little when there is no calls and it is nice to just relax and talk about the job or what is going on around us. A typical day in the call center is taking almost 60 to 80 calls a day. Helping customers with their recalled item. Most of the time is rather relaxing until an irate customer calls and complains about how they are being treated and how unfair their situation is. I understand their frustration and try to fix their problem quick and easy if at all possible. Not all callers get the answer they are looking for and I do the best I can until I have run out of options to get their problem the solution it needs. All in all it is okay but some days it is very difficult.I enjoyed my time with Kelly Services. The recruiters were very friendly and helpful. They always tried to match a job to my skill level and encouraged me to try new things. They were always available to help with answers to questions I might have about a position or driving distance to an assignment.Kelly services has many jobs. It is like indeed. They get back with you. The facility is nice and so are the people. I believe they maybe under a new company.While my contact with them is minimal, they are the access to the project work I am doing and it's pretty seamless. I have been impressed with the level of communication I receive from them.Co-workers were great, however when it came to Kelly Services and how their reaction was to the people they hired - they seem to want the extreme out of them.The job was wonderful, I met new people and my peers were excellent. but when it came down to getting a hold of Kelly Services to explain what was going on I didn't know really who to report to.Need better Management team in there New Mexico location.  Little to no benefits during my last two year contract. There were no jobs available after my contract Expired. The position itself was a great experience.The workers are good and kind. They provide excellent customer service and know how to take care of issues when they occur. The people in the office were well respective and always remembered to treat you as a member of the team.Co-workers are amazing but the management is poor which provides for a very negative work environment. The work itself provides for quick burn out and little reward especially as far as receiving competitive wages and recognition.Check in with front office at the school, get keys to the classroom. Got to classroom find instructions and roll call sheets. Make sure all classes are accounted for. Assign work and follow schedule for the day. at the end of the day return keys sign out and go home.If you need to make extra money with the overtime you do at this place you will help you.  a lot of safety consciousness, like to keep people away from danger.I got ripped off numerous times from my paycheck and they don't take your work experience into account plus not finding full-time work I would not recommend this place to anyoneThis was a temp agency for staffing various jobs for those of us who needed a temp job before landing FT employment.  Not something to do as a career.Just don't.  Money flow issues, management issues.  Unable to order parts, unable to get quotes. Boss left to work in a different city, and rarely returns to check on things.They really helped me get started and gave me a clear job description.

Also, importance on credentials is given to much emphases--many times overlooking more qualified experienced members.Keysight is filled with great people who are dedicated to their roles and to the company. The work-life balance is great, and the opportunity for advancement is available.I have enjoyed working at Keysight. Great work environment. Encourage innovations. Access to the state of the art research articlesvery good environment.  everyone works together as a team and it make for a fun place to work.  keysight is a very employee oriented company and they are always looking out for the employee .Come into work, setting up machines and prepare for work. I've learned about photo chemical milling processes. Management was the biggest issue for production in the company. Management by people who are untrained, unprofessional, and have absolutely no idea of production and manufacturing. Not a open door policy. If you have any issues or concerns to bring up, their reply is basically, ""you are replaceable, just like everyone else."" People we setup for failure everyday by management. We are production workers who come into work everyday when a targets on our back's. We are setup for failure everyday for no apparent reason. Employees are like family, we work as a team and support each other as a team. Hardest part of the day was to know you have not failed work and you still have your job. Most enjoyable were spending time working with your team.It's a great workplace for employee, because it has flexiable working time, and also has conerns on the employees' health. And the management team has good communication with engineers when they make decision on projects.Job Work/Life Balance: goodCompensation/Benefits: goodJob Security/Advancement: badManagement: badJob Culture: goodR&D, Engineering and Production driven to create and produce high quality products for the world. Personnel achievements rewarded in kind and expanded upon to improve the positive work environment.The people are friendly, the work is somewhat challenging, and there isnt much drama. The managers are nice and were promoted from within. Very competent folks. Nice place to live and work.Wonderful culture; employees are genuinely considerate and respectful."
681,Kforce,"They kept me busy with contract work and the pay was pretty good.Great employer and co-workers that create a true team atmosphere. Management not only lead, but helped broaden my experience and develop my pricing analysis skills.Management doesn't care if you fail or succeed they will allow you to continue to fail without any proper training and then blame it all on you. people get fired left and right so your job security it shaky. you won't advance unless you completely suck up, which isn't my style. your coworkers are pretty chill and laid back but its all sales and competitive so watch out for the snakes. in the sales role they tell you to be out of the office and bringing in new business 3/5 days of the week and then complain you weren't in the office at all. commission ladder is completely whack. all this place wants to do is have a million meetings verses letting you actually work.Not the company it once was. Over the last few years Kforce has undergone a lot of change to make the company more profitable but not organically. The company is not able to obtain organic growth so they tweak comp plans, set new rules around splits that benefit the house, and focus to much on taking from instead of investing in. When you start to do things like this, you have issues with keeping talent. Kforce loses a LOT of talent to competitors and larger tech companies because they simply pay better. These tactics to push stock prices up help no one in the long run. Recent restructuring was an attempt to shake things up as the company was not achieving growth and has been quite flat over the last 3 years. It was also an attempted to thin the herd and pay less salaries at middle and upper management. Pockets of the company find success but it's counter balanced by other markets. They are starting to talk about reinvesting back into their company and employees, finally, but it was a shaky promise. Time will tell if they deliver.Kforce is a great place to START your staffing career. You can get great training and some of the local management is outstanding. But this is not where you will stay long term. New upper management across the markets has a ""my way or the highway"" approach. You may have the chance to work with great people, but it will be short lived.I gave Compensation 4 out of 5 starts ONLY because I was on a plan they no longer offered. Their new comp plan would have paid about 15% less. Culture for where I worked locally was great until about the last  more... 3 months of employment with them.  lessI had zero training for the actual job that I was doing. It was your basic boiler room. I would basically build call logs and call people for jobs all day.There is a cliquish environment.  The hours and work expectations are unrealistic.  Very numbers driven.  Not a great place to work if you are looking for a real team environment.A very tough environment. Management was tough to adjust to. Attrition occurred every month. It was tough but I ended up pulling through and found myself successful.Kforce is a good place to work.  The people are very friendly and look out for you.  They are a contracting company though so you will work for another company.The company is big enough that they will give you enough time to ramp up.  The company does not provide enough training if new but they do give you enough time to be able to succeed.My account manager was very good and helped me with the job transition. it was a short contract. this was the end of a data center move and they decided to close down the data center and end the contract.kforce is a staffing agency. great one at that.where they placed me for an assignment was not. the name of the company is Related Management. the manager in that facility is horrible!!! working with hitler every day.Working with banks to collect invoices.  Nice company, friendly co-workers.  Busy work environment. Clean office cubicle work space.  Area was a bit noisy.Management was engaged and cared about how the employee was doing. Management was frequently in contact to ensure everything was up to standards and needs were being met.awesome company, but its a big grind. Get ready to work 55 hours a week.Learned a lot- from my managers, typical day 8am- 630pm... but you always have to answer emails at all hours. LOVE my coworkersThe culture at Kforce was great- our team got along very well, and often went out for drinks together after work.  That being said, some work could be done to improve the commission structure and management.  As someone who had limited experience coming in, I did not find management particularly helpful, and training was limited to online workshops that covered only the bare minimum.  Because of this, it was difficult to develop the skills necessary to climb the commission ladder.Too many managers that micro-manage.  You have 5 different bosses who all have a different objective.  Make sure to produce numbers quickly or you wont be here long/Kforce is a fantastic place to start in recruitment. The headquarters in Tampa, FL is an amazing organization. The environment forces you to work hard, but they are great at injecting breaks with activities where the whole team participates. The training and education is a continuously evolving and ongoing. Internal promotions are constantly happening in the organization which is nice to see firsthand.Kforce is a great environment when you work with the right people. There is potential to make tons of money, but you have to be ready to devote 60 hrs a week.Management is very clueless. Support and training is none existence. Enjoyed most of my co-workers. The work was easy but required better training to complete. correctly. Management on site was nonexistence, did not come in or only for part of the day.I would report to the store that was on schedule . Than I would clock in and go find the manager of the department that I was going to work in. I would let them know that I was there to Help their associate in this department.  This job was taking care of flowers and setting them up for display.  Than making sure all plants were watered. Taking plants down if they needed to be tossed or marked down.I enjoyed my position in this job. Enjoyed the people I worked with. I  enjoyed interacting with the customers.KForce was my contract company that contracted me to General Motors (GM). Typical work day: - very busy working with the Technicians on vehicle issues. Or testing Electronic Control Units (ECU) on the bench.- learn much about General motors vehicle operating systems.- the Management was Ok- most co-workers were knowledgeable and great to work with- the hardest part of the job – in the beginning learning GM’s acronyms - the most enjoyable part was testing and troubleshooting ECU's on the vehicle benches"
705,King County Sheriff's Office,"Overall the King County Sheriff's Office (KCSO) is a good place to work with many benefits and job security. However, working as a 9-1-1 operator the culture was entirely different with more time spent at work than at home. There is no room for advancement once one becomes a dispatcher. Periodically a supervisor job will come up and that is rare and not available to those that just take calls. Management is under a lot of pressure and trickles down to dispatchers and call receivers and adds to an already stressful environment. The Records department is entirely different with a laid back atmosphere in a high paced environment that allows a balance between home and work. All the co-workers in 9-1-1 are A personalities and such many clashes occur. There culture here will not be found anywhere else and is a very negative environment.Coworkers are great.  Working for the Sheriff's office makes you feel like you are part of something meaningful.It is not an easy process to get any internship including lie detector test but I had great co-workers willing to teach me and help me with any issues that I did not know how to handle.We are the first person people in crisis speak to.  Developing rapport and keeping the caller calm is essential to get all of the pertinent information that the officer needs, starting with location.  Once a call is entered it is sent to the radio dispatcher who assigns officers who are available to provide public safety.  We work as individuals yet are one.  This is a very rewarding, yet thankless job.  The public doesn't realize the amount of stress we deal with on a daily basis to ensure that we are providing them with the correct medical, fire, or police response needed.  At the end of the day, the I leave my stresses of my job at the office doors feeling a sense of rewarding accomplishment for my days service.King County is a great place to work but the Sheriff side was not for me or my family. I was switching between to many trainers for the short time that I was with them.Police work has many levels, and working for the King County Sheriff's Office has been the best experience I have ever had.I had great sgts. to work for they were all very supportive in the cases I handled."

426,Knowledgent,"Good folks to work with / for. Too bad they didn't have more of the kind of work I do. I finished my project and they had no place for me to go, though I'd have liked to continue with them. However, I do staff augmentation contracting and this is not unusual.Went on an approved vacation only to find out when I came back that they can no longer have me on active payroll. Dysfunctional senior management; nepotism throughout the company; never worked anywhere with worse upper management than this. Zero job security.Advice to ManagementThey need a clean sweep of upper management and some middle management. Respect your hard working employeesGreat Place to work. I learned Great Plains accounting Software.The management is very nice and flexible. my co-workers were very friendly and helpful, The hardest part of the job was when the work load would slow down.The most enjoyable part was learning knew accounting techniques.Was told travel was 20% to 40% and it ended up being 100%.  I had to deal with a lot of red tape and HR forms when I was unexpectedly admitted to the hospital for 3 days."
482,"Koch Industries, Inc","A place where you can control your own destiny.  Employees are encouraged to be critical thinkers and challenge the status quo.Long hours required to work but the pay is above industry standard. The advancement is there if you take the challenge. You must know  the guiding principles and follow the MBM framework or you will not last.love working for the company learn new job techniques that i used  for other places i have work. at time my job duties required that i babysit and the next day i would be doing housekeeping.Challenging and rewarding environmentStrong corporate cultureTalented and diverse workforceExcellent development and advancement opportunitiesExciting place to work.  A variety of work projects all with different challenges.The department I was in did not provide enough opportunities for advancement.  The management was mostly concerned on what you could do for them to further their career.Koch Industries values employees highly- training them in new skills and enabling them to suceed.I started working for Koch at one of their manufacturing plants in Salt Lake City in 1998 and worked at the location for 2 1/2 years. I was immediatedly treated like family. I enjoyed my job and co-workers very much. If I needed extra help, I could hire temp workers whenever needed. I learned a great deal from this position, especially about teamwork and recognizing and appreciating hard work. When my husband's job moved us to Houston, Koch was very accommodating in helping me find another job with Koch in Houston in their natual gas trading division. This was a corporate environment and quite different from my previous position but I was welcomed warmly by management and was made to feel very comfortable in my new role. I remained there for 2 years before accepting a job closer to home.Strong corporate culture/values, normal working hours, overtime paid if worked, excellent medical and 401K benefits, generous paid vacation and sick time, Fair and considerate treatment of all employees."
481,Koch Nitrogen Company,"Not a bad place to work. There are a lot of smart people who work for Koch. Management was good. Would work for them again if I had the chance.Koch's core values are undeniably the right path for an employee base.  Integrity and compliance have always aligned with my common sense.  Market Based Management is also a mental model that is very natural to me, and provides an exceptional common vocabulary and mental model.  For the most part, there are a lot of great people and a lot of great managers at Koch Industries.  I cherished my time there.On the opportunities side, Koch Business Solutions unit needs an overhaul.  Their Applications Group is not competitive with external providers in cost, quality, nor competency, and their arrogance and cronyism are against MBM core principles.I worked with many talented people here, and generally the work was gratifying.  The Market Based philosophy was great as a way to run a business, however there were occasions where it did not seem to be applied consistently.Koch Industries was the best employer I ever worked for... The people and co-workers were nice enough. The management was good and the benefits were good. I learned a lot on this job because I was working with some knowledgeable contractors. Just a great company.Take care of long term employees, strong retirement benefits, entrepreneurial.  Work hard and you will be rewarded.  Follow the MBM if implemented in your department, really helps stretch your ability to be a team player.Koch Industries is a great place to work. They live out the guiding principals day by day. They are very professional and respectful and full of vision.I have loved working here for the better part of a decade, the company really knows how to take care of it's employees. If you are looking for stability I highly recommend this company.I worked at OSU during my time at school there. It is a great job because you get to study and be close to your teachers when you have any questions. I recommend.Professional environment with nice people to work with.  Sometimes fast paced, which I like.  Great hours 7:00 to 3:00.  Receiving invoices from vendors.Not a bad place to work just needs to full fill  promises made to people. I worked as a NH3 tech in the refrigeration department . My bosses were very good to me If it wasnt for the trouble maker on third shift I would still be there. Guy had allnight to install new water pump in the boiler i took it out on first shift and had it set to go back in well 16hrs later when i came back in it still wasnt installed, made me so mad i had to install it took me about an hour, just lazy tail people that had know clue of the work they claimed they knew.Koch Ind. was a wonderful place to work.  Huge company, broken into small companies run by wonderful management.  Positive daily feedback and stress free environment.During my temporary work at Koch industries I felt like I was part of the team and contributed to its success. It was a highly rewarding job. the co-workers were all very loyal, supportive and positive. The hardest part part of the job was to challenge myself daily and to always strive to be the best I can, and that is a great work ethic.Koch Industries utilize a management methodology called MBM.  In theroy this methodology fosters a healthy culture, however after working with two separate companies with in Koch industries I have found that the methodology is not practiced.  Upper management does not promote free thinking nor do they allow alignment with industry standards.6:00am tour facility. 7:30am review production results with staff covering all safety and quality concerns. Set goalls with team. 8:00am send out daily production email to president and vice president. 8:30am daily conference call with corporate. 9:00am safety walk through with an on shift hourly team member. 10:00am reviewed on hand raw materials.10:30am meet with the purchasing department to discuss materials. 11:00 am conference call with marketing team to discuss material sales and shipments.12:00pm meet with maintence team to discuss maintenance plan. 1:00pm avaliable to meet with vendors or outside personal. 1:00 pm to 3:00pm 1 to 1's with team members to cover growth oppportunities. 3:00pm conference call with corporate compliance team. 4:00pm conference call with Operations Manager to discuss days results. 5:00pm safety walk through with an on shift hourly team member.6:00pm review days acitivities.Great Culture to work at. Market Based Management. Value creation promoted. Ability to grow within the company is promoted and encouragedworked as a network and desktop support engineer for multiple companies within the Koch umbrella.Original manager was great, then got a new one when mine was promoted to a new role.  The new manager and I did not get along as I was not a suck up and just did my job.shortly after that change he hired two new engineers right out of college, had me train them both and then laid me off as both of them did the same job I did for less money as they were brand new and no experience.Since KS is a right to work state they can let you go without any reason, excuse or explanation.  Koch does this ALL the time.  They do not value their employee's or the experience they bring just the bottom line and where you fit in on that value.I currently work for KBS service desk.  I am very happy with my job, I love what I do, and the people that I work with are great.  Management at times seems lost though, and it almost seems to be a black hole working here.  I have been here for 1 year and still have not met the requirements that they have set to move forward in the company.Management at this company speak out of both sides of their mouth and they definitely don't know how to lead by example. They place strong emphasis on results and forget about caring for their employees. It is not a nurturing working environment.Management spend a lot of time behind closed door instead of out in the open to lead the team. Email and IM are closely monitored. You can forget about HR. They are there to protect the managers not you. Every thing you say will flow directly back to the managers.Watch for bait and switch.answered calls, re-mote to customer's PC's and fixed whatever issues they had. Every call is timed and some calls are screened and monitored for the scorecard. There were 27 different goals to meet with each call. Every day is a busy day. I learned a lot from working in the IT department.The company has grown tremendously, but it is not the easiest place to work.  So you get the stability, but will not see a level of compensation, management openness (despite the MBM culture), and mobility like in other companies.I learned abundantly oilfield skills. I greatly respected their Safety program; lectures on Hazmat. Gain experience on working with Hazmat resource."
381,KPMG,"This is a great place to work. Has a great work/life balance. Social club plans many activities for all interests. They include all employees at different functions. You truly feel you are part of a team.KPMG was my first job out of college. It was a great job to start my professional career and I enjoyed being a part of an audit team and learning about the ins and outs of different businesses. The hours were very long during busy season which included 10 hour weekdays and weekend hours from the months of December to April, but I learned a great deal in just the first year. I also started with a large group of college graduates which made for fun office events and parties.  The environment was a little too cut-throat for me and I did not see myself working there long-term.I would recommend anyone I know to work for KPMG. It's a wonderful work environment, especially for people just out of college.While there are plenty of opportunities to advance within the company, it should be noted that it can be difficult to actually advance due to the size of the company. I.E. an individual would have to stick out for them to be really noticed.Good to place to refine skills, diverse set of clients, dedicated colleagues. Little direction sometimes from leadership if not on project.Excellent work place to begin your accountant career. Management very professional and co-workers as well. The most enjoyable working is the exposure and knowledge you can encounter and the diversity of industries you work with.If you have an appetite to learn, this is the onea place that can feed it! The info, direction and level of learning is controlled by you, and you can either curb yourself to one area, or broaden your horizons on any area of interest to you...KPMG was a wonderful place to start my career because the firm offered a lot of training for Audit and Forensic. Also, KPMG had wonderful senior associates, managers, etc. who wanted me to succeed and helped me to succeed along the way.The culture in KPMG is like that of a family. Everyone works hard and tries to help build each other up. Their intern training program is very comprehensive. In addition to performing associate-level work, I was also assigned special tax research and presentation skills to supplement my professional education. My only problem is the lack of work life balance. Outside of work, I found that I didn't have the energy to do anything other than lounge around the house.Overall job culture is demeaning, demoralizing, and discriminates against individuals over 30 years of age unless entering the firm as a manager or higher.I really enjoyed externing at KPMG.  The accounting team I worked with were wonderful and gave great insight for my future career in accountancyGood accommodating culture. All depends on your relationship with Managing Directors and partners. Gentler of the big four.KPMG is one of the big four international accounting firms and staffs around 175,000 people.  I had a great working experience at KPMG.  I have nothing but all great things to say.  Everybody was nice, helpful, friendly, professional, and understanding.  I won't mind working for KPMG again.it was really big company. work there was pretty boring, and people were leaving all the time. the work life balance here was not so good. we worked over time all the time without the right pay.New management brought in.  Entire office went down hill.  Moral was very low.  No team spirit, no fun, no respect.  Felt like I was in the military under a drill sergeants command.Working for KPMG was a great experience. Long hours are a given and the work is interesting. KPMG has a great summer internship program.KPMG is like most audit firms: client focused with some busy deadline periods. I like the culture and the people that this company attracts are what makes it pleasant to work here.KPMG Nigeria was an amazing company to intern with over the summer, the organizational culture of the company is well structured and makes one feel at home right away. I interned for three months, and I wish I could have interned for a longer amount of time, but I had to get back to school. My co-workers were very friendly and treated me with the same respect that they would treat full-time employees. The way the offices were structured allowed for the smooth interaction between supervisors and subordinates. They had an open door policy which allowed easy accessibility to all individuals throughout the company. They also advocated to avoid saying ""sir/madam"" and just refer to people by their first name. This was a huge problem for me, cause everyone was older. But I eventually got used to it. KPMG Nigeria is a very flexible, yet time filing, occupying company. I'm glad I had the privilege to  intern with them.Great firm, training is excellent. Clients are the best in their industry groups. Teams work well together and the skills learned o the job are the best part about the day.I serve as assistant to multiple members of the firm's senior management.  I have the ability to manage multiple priorities, highly organized and provide exceptional customer service.As a KPMG consultant, there is not ""typical"" day at work. You can be heavily involved with clients one day and just work from home on another day. It varies depending on your work style. From KPMG, I learned how to communicate effectively with clients. KPMG management is very hierarchical - started with associate to senior associate to manager to partner. The hierarchy varies depending on your department. My coworkers were wonderful. They were friendly and respectful, very easy to work with. Co workers above me were very eager to help push me to the next level. Hardest part of the job was getting to the next level. To get there, you must prove yourself to internal team members such as director and partners. To do so, you must work under a very challenging environment which requires a lot of traveling and face time with clients and coworkers. If you have a family, you will have very little time seeing them... Most enjoyable part of the job (if you are young and do not have a family) is the travel. You get to see may different places and many different people around the world. I also enjoyed the opportunities and education my company offered me.It is a high performance culture company.  Employees and Partners are of high integrity and professionalism. It is a great Audit, Tax and Advisory firm."
424,Kraft Foods Group,"A typical day at work would be reviewing customer orders, checking inventory or when product would be produced, verified transportation had been planned, confirmed to customer.  Had many friends over the past 40 years working there.  The most enjoyable part of the job was having my own office, could have the radio on, and still do my job without any pressure from management.  The hardest part of the job was leaving because I took an early retirement package and now looking for another job.I worked for Kraft Foods Group for almost 25 years, I started in dispatch and worked hard to become the manager of this very fine group of people.Being Kraft is a Corporate environment there are a lot of management decisions that a person may not agree with, but they provided a nice environment for us to work in and were very generous with their compensation and benefits.  The Work Life balance was also something you don't find all that often but it worked out to be a huge benefit.Consistently challenged with new category management opportunities.  Excellent leadership support, organizational culture, and advancement opportunities.I now fully appreciate the culture of innovation at Kraft. The ever present current of ""expecting the best"" in everyone's work provided a strong foundation for teamwork and creating success. Management always brought waves of information on new ideas/resources to help us develop innovative plans to meet business goals. It was a great place to nurture a career.Kraft foods was a challenging work environment.  I gained a lot of experience with customers and SAP erp systems.  Our management team was hands off and allowed the employees to manage their customers and issues.  We worked in teams and there was a lot of cooperation with coworkers.  The hardes part of the job was the long hours that were required to meet the demands with the lower head count demanded by the company.  I will miss the people I worked with.  We were able to get along outside of work as well as in work.The current culture at Kraft is that they want to bring in new talent and get rid of people who have been there awhile.  So it's good if you are new to Kraft but be wary that you don't stay too long.  Management is so-so.  It depends largely on your immediate boss - some are good and some are really bad.Overall, Kraft Foods group has been a great company to work for and has offered many opportunities for advancement.  With the current Heinz merger, I wish them luck obtaining growth and sustaining brandstypical corporate environment.  Employees are very nice and professional.  Overall work is interesting and is a good learning experience.  But with the 3G takeover and merger with Heinz, the environment is poor and the company does not treat you well.A great place to work with lots of opportunities for growth and upwards mobility, as well as opportunities for cross-functional moves.Worked in Office environment with 250 plus employees.  Great atmosphere.  Job concentrated on Mailroom/Warehouse, and office needs of site employees.Kraft is a great place to learn classic, consumer marketing.  I was groomed by a some of the best managers to be a blue chip marketer and learned key general management skillsGood leadership and good products.  Kraft spends a lot on quality and assurance for quality products.  The leaders tend to allow people to develop and grow and don't necessarily do a lot of micro managing.Kraft Foods work atmosphere was great and our team was a tight nit family. We shared best practices and assisted team members during critical annual planning periods.Excellent company.  Diverse experiences within Supply Chain. Change management, SAP, Lean, Collaborative, Customer Engagement and Focus, Financially driven.The company is open and inclusive to ideas from its employees and encourages collaboration acorss different teams.People are very friendly.A typical day involved packaging cheese, or operating a fill room. I learned a lot while working at Kraft. I learned how to operate a fill-room and I was one of the only temps to have learned one. Operation required a lot of attentiveness, attention to detail, and responsibility. Management was very strict but never seemed to have any idea what was going on for the next week. The schedule was never up on time, they where always adding people to work days and then taking them off. They never let anyone know when they had added them for a specific day. They would schedule people to stay after but would always have enough people to cover the shift so you'd end up standing around trying to keep busy with nothing to do. My co-workers made my experience at Kraft worthwhile. I loved the people I worked with and created a lot of great friendships through work. The hardest part of my job was training to learn the fill-room because all of the responsibility, dedication and hard work required to do the job. The most enjoyable experience I had was operating the fill-room. This was because I had put so much time and effort into learning the job, that the satisfaction I got from finally operating made me feel achieved and like I'd accomplished something worthwhile.-Moving towards IL6S culture and investing a lot in the employees including the floor representation.Free hand.  Self motivated post.  Many instances to shine and work on my own and with my team.  Managed the office, efficiently.  Training on a continuum.  Duties were easily grasped and conducted.   Positive feedback from team and manager.  Bolstering and orienting from Chicago headquarters.  A climate of support and continued learning.  Exponential growth potential.Great general management training, iconic brands, a lot of responsibility early onIts a great place to work.  Culture is important. People are nice.process several purchase order  taking calls from vendor who has not received payment. the co workers are great to work with."

89,Lattice Engines,"Roll out of bed and get to work. Then work through breakfast, lunch and most of the time through dinner and late into the night. Occasionally, you get a weekend off. Good thing the work is stimulating, innovative and keeps the interest going.I've worked here for nearly 5 years, there is no shortage of amazing projects to work on, and brillant people to rub elbows with as you challenge yourselves together. You'll have so much fun you won't notice that it's long past ""business hours"" until your irate family calls your cell.Lattice Engines is a start-up that is full of smart, ambitious and dedicated employees."
84,Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,"The work at LBNL was very organized and well managed. The collaboration is one key point of my experience. The time schedule is flexible. Offices quite small.it's hard to have a developed career if you don't have a PhD at national lab. Stable but salary can't be high. You will have good health insurance and pension plan which is rare now.Good place to work.  Good benefits, and a great view.  Opportunities depend on the Division you work for.  Culture is improving daily.I moved to the Bay Area for a postdoc position at LBNL. I love working there and have good colleagues, but the culture of LBNL is different from most other national labs in that there isn't a well-defined track for advancement. You either get one of the rare staff scientist positions, or your out looking for jobs in 2-5 years. Overall, it was a positive experience, but I would have liked more stability.I worked on the Administration side of LBNL and unless you're a scientist, they don't really value you as an employee.  After being employed for a administrator position, I was relegated to a storeroom issued parts for 90% of my time.  My manager did a poor job of training me for the duties listed in the job description, pawning me off on other employees from time to time.  While this may sound normal, during the interview process I was told that I would be working closely with my supervisor, attending meetings and shadowing him to learn both his position and mine.Although there as a contract employee, this company is a great place to work. The company is diversified and everyone you work with is pleasant. Each of the persons in different departments supported HR and worked together as a team to ensure each Department at the lab were supported and each employee and student received the information needed to be a success.The Berkeley Lab is managed more like a university than other national laboratories, likely because of its proximity to UC Berkeley. This has some of the benefits of a university-like feel, but sometimes makes it difficult to execute large/ambitious projects that (a) require coordination between different departments/divisions, and (b) require some legwork before being able to publish results.If you're interested in building new capabilities instead of making slides about all that cool stuff you're going to do with your grant money, you might want to look elsewhere.I have been working with the scientists who work real hard to advance the current knowledge state of science to the next level. I am really inspired and motivated by seeing their motivation for the good cause of humanity. Typical job day includes a lot of computational work including scientific programming, simulation, data analysis, visualization, and above all sharing these information with the fellow scientists and colleagues. Also, there are a lots of enlightening seminars almost every day where we can learn the new knowledge of a research area. The work culture here is excellent and the people are very helpful and supportive. The most enjoyable part is how knowledgeable the people working here yet so humble. Hardest part is to keep publishing of cutting edge research papers which sometime takes years.Great place to learnGreat place to workGreat place to cryGreat place to laughGreat place to support leaders in scienceMulti cultural environment with top-notch research in various fields of science. Large opportunity to learn, collaborate and perform every step of the experimental process.love working as a Research Assistant at the Center for Research and Education on Aging Lab (CREA) in the Lawrence Berkeley NationalLaboratory division of Physical Biosciences. I'm part of a very interesting research were we are Investigating the causes and processes of aging through caloric restrictionwith the objective of improving and extending the human health span. Helped create an interactive map of the agingprocess based on thousands of published primary academic research.LBNL is a fantastic place to work. The people there are the most intelligent and creative in the scientific world. I am only an intern right now but it's obviously a great work environment.LBL is a fine place to work.  Pay scale is good.  The location and campus is nice.  LBL does a lot of important work that it is fun to be a part of.Tons of available resources, nice work environment and location. The work/life balance is pretty good. The research setting is very nice, and the environment I worked in is collaborative, and interactions are generally constructive.Excellent and productive research environment, dynamic and truly international atmosphere. It is a good place to do science with exceptional research facilities. LBNL is a world-class institution,  I would strongly recommend this place to anyone who like to carry out top notch science.Excellent research environment, dynamic and diverse international atmosphere.Berkley National Laboratory an excellent platform to develop fundamental scientific and engineering skills. Exciting projects at the forefront of new technologies.friendly environment, talented co-workers, good work-life balance, and a superb place to learn new things,beautiful and convenient office locationThe work environment is great. Lots of opportunities to collaborate with people from different backgrounds. I like the management. Everyone encourages out of the box ideas.The best part about working at LBNL is the beautiful location. The lab is located in the Berkeley hills surrounded by nature with a beautiful view of the San Francisco Bay. The most enjoyable part of the job was serving new employees, taking their  photos for their badges and interacting with them. The hardest  part of the job was dealing with bureaucracy. Overall working at the lab was enjoyable.It is a good place to do science. Sometimes can be very bucrocratic. As a postdoc you can't apply to have independent funding which makes the transition to staff quite harsh.  Very relaxed environment but the salary is to low for the area.A typical day at work for me was pushing paperwork. I worked in the proposals department where I had to obtain signatures of scientist and then submit the proposal for funding. I learned the structure of a proposal and how to submit it for funding for different projects. Management and co-workers were very helpful and always worked together. The hardest part of the job was making sure I paid attention to detail because if one thing was incomplete or wrong on the proposal you would have to start all over because the proposal would get rejected. The most enjoyable part of the job was when our proposal were granted."
569,Leidos,"I have mixed feelings. The job was good, but they were always trying to call me in on my off time. The pay was good, but that was negated by the seemingly yearly reduction in benefits. Management turned over in one form or another once every few months in the office I worked in. There wasn't much of a pay increase over time and fewer opportunities for advancement in the company. People seemed to muddle through the day with discontent in the office. It seemed to suck the joy out of some of our coworkers just to be in the office.Leidos is a great place to work. Management is engaged and fellow workers are eager to assist each other. Salary was highly satisfactory. The fact that it was a contract job has inherent risks.Hired and then let go 6 weeks later because of funding. Lied about the contract being good for a full year.Not happy with this company currently.Leidos is a young very diverse company that has difficulty figuring out how to organize itself. Needs more mature SR management and  leadership.Leidos offers a great work life balance. Leidos offers a competitive 401K plan and insurance plans. Leidos also offers annual performance reviews ensuring that you have a way to move up the ladder.Excellent position to help train first responders and help protect the nation from disaster. This is a rewarding position and excellent working conditions.I was my own boss and made my own schedule to the needs of the mission. I learned a great deal about turning in old and no longer useful equioment. Management always ensured you had the proper training to complete your mission. Co-Workers were always there to help with moving any equipment that needed to be loaded into a truck or van. The hardest part of the job was not having enough time to get everything completed. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I had complete control over everything I did.Leidos is not a bad company to work for, they just aren't great either. Leadership is out of touch, but compensation is competitive and the benefits package rivals other companies. Not a lot of room for advancement.Leidos is a pretty standard large size company. I feel the training/mentorship could use some work. I wish there was a stronger connection between middle management and the workers. I don't know if that is the case for most of the contracts that Leidos holds though.Over all I feel like it's a fine company to work for.Normal working place, five days a week 9-5 Monday to Friday. Friendly atmosphere, easy going no pressure, you have to be willing to work hard and help other when they need help.There are lots of potential to move elsewhere within the company.  Benefits provided through work are very generous and easy to take advantage of. Has overall decent job outlook.The company culture is about the employee and the company offers great resources to help with your career and educational goals.There is nothing enjoyable about working for this company. They do nothing to incentivize talented individuals and try to keep them for dirt cheap.I've been working for the company for the last four years and have been enjoying working as a Linguist/Translator with Leidos. It is a great company and provides excellent benefits for employees.A typical day of work includes tracking/monitoring hardware assets from inbound shipments from vendors to de-installation/life cycle replacement.Management is for the most part hands-off of our day to day operations.  High visibility projects will sometimes be monitored by management.I work with a dedicated work force that know their jobs and normally perform tasks in a timely manner.The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that hardware accountability is accurate and complete.Not a good environment to work in.  No support, from your team leader and you are asked to do more than what you hired in for.Working for Leidos has been a great learning experience as I have supported several training courses including hazmat, radiological, and law enforcement courses. Negative aspects include substandard healthcare and also lacks sufficient compensation for everything the job entails.Rewarding whent customer is satisfied and give us kudos.I love to work with this company. If I get opportunity, will love to stay with this company..Poor communication from management and little concern for the employee as long as the company does well.Very little comradery among the team. Everyone is more concerned with trying to stay employed.I enjoy working with LEIDOS, I appreciate the helpful management and work peers. I also enjoy that I was allowed to travel and the internal considerations for job employment.The Management at CACI was awesome, however the opportunities for advancement were very slim.  The benefits were good, and they really do try to place you, however, they do low bids from time to time and does not leave room for greater growth."
223,Life Time Fitness,"The job is very corporate and is all about the company making money and the benefits keep getting worse.  The gym is beautifulManagement is composed of a bunch of children who do not care about their employees.The turnover rate is horrible, which is a reflection of the entire company. They make you feel very undervalued and then expect you to go over the top for minimum wage. It gets too busy to perform the job at the highest satisfaction. They don't offer pay raises. Everyone is indispensable. Expect you to sip the company cool aid 24/7. There is absolutely no training, they hire you and then it's sink or swim till you figure it out. It's not ""the healthy way of life company"", rather it's just another corporate gym trying to gain profits. This job is for high schoolers and entry level persons, unless you are working in some sort of personal training, dietitian, nutritionist role. Other than that, don't waste your time with this company.My lifetime location has great management. They personally make you feel cared about. However, you can tell corporate doesn't really care about you. Minimum wage for everything expected is way too low. Also, there are really no raises and no opportunities for promotion. But you do get a free gym membership.So don't work here full time if you can help it. If you really want to work here just do it as a side job for the membership.People are ultimately promoted to manager positions based on their sales ability and not on their ability to develop or lead a sales team. I have had my best manager of any career at Life Time and 2 of my worst of all time. Movement and change keeps Life Time relatively innovative however there is often change for the sake of change making mastering certain skills difficult. You will also be expected to work weekends and minimum 50 hours a week. Work life balance is quite poor but the overall culture is good.Focus is so much on members that it takes away from day to day function of the club. Team Members are to be retained by management but everyone is replaceable and it shows through behaviours of management.  I don't believe the club should be open on Holidays especially Christmas but it is and it's terrible that people have to take away from their families to come in for the 25 members that will check in that day. The pay is terrible for the type of service we are expected to provide.  The software and hardware that is used for a 21 century club is less than desirable. It shows how much upper management cares when nothing works 100% of the time.Great company if you want to have free gym benefits. However, my department head and gym coordinator we both self centered and showed favoritism to certain employees. Very cliquish company that pretend to have high standards of quality, yea right. Plus, they deduct a $7 product service fee from each massage. It is impossible to use $7 of cream in one massage unless you're spoon feeding it to a client. Products we rarely stocked and management were inferior.I like working for the company however I prefer to work where there are advancement opportunities. This challenges me to work harder and strive for something greater. The kids and the team make it feel like a big family though.This company is great to have the benefits of a free membership and that is all.  Management there is horrible and the children that work there could care less about Lifetime's target market.  I am 46 and have never seen a sh-- show like this.  I think Lifetime needs to stop depending on executive types in their 40s for membership and solely rely on targeting the highschool and college students to meet their revenue quota.  LolThis company is extremely unprofessional with no training for team members.  The best description for Lifetime is Wal-mArt in a pretty suit.  This company is poorly managed and ran by children who have great computer skills like most kids these days.You meet a lot of amazing people working for this company and there's a lot of room for advancement if your willing to work hard. However, the work-life balance is non-existent and the management needs a lot of work. The turn-over rate is very high so a lot of people come and go.Management doesn't respect their employees. They will throw you under the bus in a minute to make themselves look better. They never offer raises even if you worked there for 2 or 3 years. Different departments are disrespectful to one another and the issues are never address by management. There is so much drama that is never properly handled. Policy is only followed when it is convenient for the department head. There are several children dropped off with mental disabilities yet none of the employees or department heads are properly trained/certified to take care of them.Aside from the free membership, the kids and some of the team members you meet are really the only pros of working there.Everything is about customer service and product knowledge.  Selling fitness is not an easy task seeing as everyone wants to join a gym but don't know why.  Our job was to find their nugget and explore the possibility of assistance to help the new members achieve their goals.  We are taught how to explore the question as to ""Why did you come in our doors"".  We learned the value of team work and what it meant to be successful not only as individuals but as a team.  Management was ok, I found my real help and inspiration from my Sales Manager, Roland Commacho.  He showed me how to take my job apart and just concentrate on one membership at a time but to also work towards a goal for the day.  Loved working with my coworkers because everyone was a piece to the puzzle as to why the new member was going to succeed.  The hardest part of my job was the very long hours.  Sometimes I would be there from Bell to Bell, putting God and my family out of the picture.  The most enjoyable part of my job was to connect with all my new members and them thanking me for getting them started today.  I have been selling memberships for a long time and there are still members there when I first started my journey with Life Time.It is impossible to have any work life balance. This isn't a builder job and even though management preaches education, if you ask for help with education chances are they will tell you they don't have time to help you and they will tell you to look it up yourself.It's incrediblyhard to have any stability in your life working at lifetime fitness.  The paychecks are up and down, and the management is constantly changing.  I believe in the products and services that we provide, but it's mentally taxing to work in this place.The role of a personal trainer within Life Time Fitness is not that of an actual trainer but that of a salesperson. Trainers began their fitness career to help people and get compensated for it. However the pressure to gain clients and provide numbers does remove the fun aspect of training. It also does create a variable income as your pay is determined by if your clients show up and sign up. This is a draw against commission job with little to no room for advancement. This is not a position for people with young children as you will always work evenings and weekends because this is the bulk of times that people who can afford your services will be able to utilize the training. The world of PT is a revolving door and I watched many good trainers disappear because of their beliefs and talents wasted.Operations is very fast paced and is not for the feign of heart, you will literally have to clean diarrhea off the ground at times... But if you can get past that it can be somewhat enjoyable. The ops crew at the Palm Valley is amazing, everyone works as a team which is essential for the job. The boss or Ops Manager is the best in the game, he actually cares for his employees and does everything he can to give raises to keep the team happy.Telephone sales, in person sales, and online sales were a major part of my day. I gave tours of our club and explained promotions, membership options, nutrition options, and personal training options with new members. The management was fair, however there was little room for error. I appreciated the structure and speed of the positionI was hired in as a supervisor and really did enjoy working there as well as the members you meet. However, I feel at times management was too laid back, and I took the job more seriously. The pay wasnt all that great being a supervisor, but the free membership was great. The facilities themselves are amazing!Will say this though. High turnover rate. Advancement in the company is hard. I wont complain about being hired in as a supervisor, but I will say there were people that had been there for years before me that probably deserved to be considered for the position.Excellent company to work for. Great benefits and very good pay for what the job requires.Excellent management and organization through the whole company.If you seek to live a healthy way of life, Life Time has great opportunities for this for their team members. If you don't, than many of the benefits will not be benefits to you. They speak often of a healthy work/life balance, however do not in turn offer this easily.The company was amazing with great structure but there was not great management transition. When we got new management it did not help the companyTypically the work environment is very lively and productive, it can potentially be chaotic if there are irritated clients. I learned a lot from this company mostly in dealing with people and my co-workers. The management at lifetime fluctuates and has its ups and downs like any other large company. My co-workers are very positive and active people, along with being helpful and supportive. The hardest part of my job at lifetime would be saying goodbye to families that have been with us for many years as they move out of state or decide to go in another direction. The best part of my job is seeing the excitement on my students face when they accomplish a long time goal or overcome a fear that has help them back long enough."
767,"Limited Brands, Inc.","Working in sales for Limited Brands, Victoria's Secret has had many pro's and cons, unfortunately it is very difficult to soley rely on this job as a source of income, and with the daily pressures applied and goals that are set for each employee, they do not neccisarly give you the pay / oppurtunities / hours you would expect.In the time I worked for the company they pushed there company values on you since day one. These are values the company doesn't really stuck by. There is a lot of favoritism and workplace harassment in Saftey Services and I'm sure other departments. For a supervisor to be able to hit a employee is unacceptable and joking or not do it on two separate occasions. The company then punishes you for reporting the supervisor because they stick with management. When ever is this behavior ever acceptable in corporate america?Managers played favorites which led to high attrition rates; co-workers were great though. Customers were difficult to please and a lot of them, even after recommendations, wouldn't buy anything which reflects negatively on you as an associate(Even if they aren't based on commissions). One manager specifically said I was going to be working register and then decided I would be better at 'loss prevention' and decided to cancel a shift because I didnt have enough cashier experience for it.(I wonder why)I have loved working for Victoria's Secret. They want their associates to be happy where they are at and gives chances to really grow your career with the company. They're always up and changing (while doing so, they're always keeping you up to date and making sure you've done the training that you may need) so you learn so many different skills while working there.The management is great and supportive of their associates. They take opinions and concerns and usually act on them. Everyone that I've worked with has always been positive and caring for one another.A typical day at work is  problem solving, meetings, project management, finance meeting.  I manage projects from beginning phase to material arriving on-site. I have learned so much in position, but the overall arching skill set  that I have obtained is problem solving.  I have learned how to not only recognize problems but how to proactively seek them out!  As well as understand all parties that affected by the problem and bring 3 solutions to assist in resolving these problems.My management is very strong and supportiveThe hardest part of my job,  is that there are not enough hours in the day to get everything completed that I want to get completedThe most enjoyable part of my job is the completion of my projects and seeing actual stores that I have worked on opennice warehouse job, the hardest thing about the job is standing for 10 hours at a time. The other workers stay to their selves allowing you to work and focus on your assigned task.I learned great sales experience while working for the company L Brands in their Victoria's Secret store! Management is very motivating to reach sales goals.I have learned a lot working in a small Ecommerce team at La Senza. I have experienced great leadership, whom has taught me how to grow within my position. I love working on photo shoot sets for the Ecommerce team and help produce great product for our site.management needs to have more interaction with employees instead of having all decisions made by the employees in dc who look to them for guidance not wait until it goes wrong then place blame.A great place to work! As a long time employee, it was a great place to grow as well. A typical day could be non-stop meetings....I learned a lot about ITIL, Disaster Recovery and many more of the skills I consider to be some of my strongest  while at LimitedbrandsEvery employees, co-workers as well as team leaders and supervisors were nice and friendly. I would recommend all to give a try at this company. Pay rate is good, company benefit are also good.A good paying job that has many different roles one may apply for. Sometimes a bit tedious, but you are rewarded for hard work and a willingness to learn.I love being a part of the LBrands family and am proud to work there.  It's an exciting and creative place to work.  Love how involved they are with giving back to the communities.Wish they had a gym though.They mainly hire seasonal but if you get hired on, the pay and benefits are really good. Very clean facility and management takes care of the issues if found.A good Place to work on your people skills. Always work to be done on the floor or in the back. Employees compete to raise there own personal SPA (your sales).In general L Brands is a wonderful and exciting place to work.  Unfortunately leadership varies through out the company, you just have to hope you have good leadership in whichever department you work for.I submitted my resume with a degree and they placed me in a department where my job is to fold dirty laundry to be sold back to the customerJob functions vary from day-to-day, and there is never a dull moment.  Depending on location, managers can be accountable for anywhere from 10-50 employees.I would recommend LBrands to most anyone.  The company values and fundamentals are prevalent.  Leadership development is a focus.Been working with L Brands for a few years, some parts of the business are great, others not so much. Layoffs have now happened 2 times in 3 years.I enjoyed my contract with LB, the culture was very friendly and within a few weeks, I was completely used to the decor of the place (rather non-conservative)"
733,Lockheed Martin,"This was a 40 hour a week job but was only given part time status. this was to replace a leaving officer before the installation of a card access security system. This location needed a government Security Clearance. Security handled certain documentation to be destroyed. At this location we had standard tours.Good working conditions but a lot of responsibility for a small salary.They forget that we live in the NYC area and take advantage of the poor labor market. A take home of 700 per week when you and three others are responsible for 30 million dollar program makes everyone have to have two jobs just to break even. That is if you can find another job. Everyone in the office is financially stressed and over half the office is looking for another job including our whole team. They outsource projects for what can be done internally at four times our rate but underpay us for what we doWorked on a secured program, but you walked into work feeling like you were making a difference in the world. Management was great at book keeping and very knowledgeable when it came to asking questions. Lots of overtime was offered. Working at the place everyone wants to work at is awesome. Awesome co workers who meant business. The only downfall to this place is the rocky road to gain seniority. When there are ups they are up, but when things go down, without out the seniority it get cloudy.The interview process was very stress-free. The interviews were friendly. They didn't ask any useless questions such as ""What is your greatest weakness."" I submitted and application, received an email to schedule an interview in the same week, and after the interview, I heard back from the hiring manager promptly.Working on upward mobility program and be more people oriented.Reasonable place to work with a slant on conservative values, and a cautious venture into new technology.  As an aerospace firm, they are subject to the market and governmental variability in opportunities typical of those companies driven primarily by large government contracts.Helped to provide funding for fixed asset requirements for various divisions and tier construction projects.  Helped to maintain big construction project scheduling compliances.  Expedited and processed funding documents.  Presented formalized reports to senior management documenting expense spending and extrapolating future monetary spending throughout the end of the  year. Comfortable in high level management meetings.  Enjoyed my knowledgeable co-workers.You don't miss it until it's gone...or something to that effect but needless to say when you look back at your career you'll always relate back to the companies that had the most impact on your professional life. That for me would be Lockheed. While we struggled to compete in a federal market that was okay awarding contracts to the 80% solution, 'Technically Acceptable, Lowest Cost,' the company still led key markets serving the federal government like space, aviation, and weapons. Following the market value you'll see how the market aligns with the management and leadership of the company as the stock value has done nothing but grow.As a contractor, I traveled around the U.S., Hawaii and Puerto Rico conducting industrial hygiene and radiation surveys at FAA facilities.  I also enjoyed teaching courses in radiation safety and measurement. The program manager in Washington D.C. was very supportive. I learned a tremendous amount health physics and met many wonderful people in the FAA.This company has a wonderful work life balance with a 9 80 work schedule and flex time.  It's nice to be able to control your own schedule when life happens, and not have to notify god and country of needed time off.With downsizing, being able to do more with less as far as staffing goes isn't unbearable, but the compensation is less than par.This was a typical cubicle workplace, easy to fall into a simple and repetitive routine.  The job had very nice benefits and rarely left me overworked or working overtime.  Management rarely impressed, but the workplace was overall a fairly nice place and there were still plenty of fun and kind coworkers.  It is a large complex, so there are a lot of other people working in the vicinity.Lockheed Martin is BIG, with offices in many states and countries, and many different office cultures. You'll find a suit-and-tie culture around Washington DC, jeans in the western and mountains sates, khakis and button-down shirts throughout.  Production facilities tend to be very deliberate and detail-oriented; as you need to be when your products are those of a major aerospace company. There are also research labs which are more flexible and tolerant of failure, but bring your A-game if you apply.The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to interact with various IT (Contractors) and Federal Civilian professionals. The hardest part of my job was having to deal outdated IT systems and software and find solutions related to problems that arose from that. My coworkers were the best...we had the best IT team.Meetings with top officials, customers, business analysis for website development, serving as liaison between developers and customers, extensive quality testing for web development, helpdesk support, preparing presentations, managing projects using the Agile Methodology, and working independently to solve problems.As the work as a Project Manager was fast paced and sometimes because construction can be unpredictable, esp. if it is outdoors, may be hard to plan any type of vacation, but I really enjoyed the work, the people, including the customer and the site...It was a rewarding and fulfilling experience. I only left Lockheed due to a contract change...wish this never happened...since it was all downhill after Lockheed left.The company provided excellent wages and retirement programs. Incentive programs for employees to benefit their department and weekly meetings with department management for problem solving solutions and clean work environment.I was able to start my days at 530am so I could be done early enough to pick up my children from school. It was work that you could do on your own and were not waiting on someone else to finish so you could start.While I was there for 12 years we did have four different managers. At times there was no manager and when a new one would be hired it was myself that would need to train them. The atmosphere was friendly and fun while also getting your job done.Enjoyed sixteen years of employment working several different programs as an engineer with lots of variety and with lots of new challenges.  Great ethical culture.  In all my years there, there was only ONE time that someone lost their temper and yelled at colleagues.  Great compensation package as well.The best, hard working, dedicated people are the company's biggest plus. Perks? Yes, there are perks (free catered lunch, game room, instruments if you like to jam etc.) But, don't come here for just the perks. This is the San Francisco Bay Area. You can practically go shopping for perks and benefits package. But come here if you want to work with smart, hard working, driven people.LM Sunnyvale was a wreck - unqualified people being promoted and put into positions they were not qualified for.  People were not excited about change.LM Colorado was a different place - things got done, qualified people were hired and we had fun making sure our projects got done and were completed with pride.Currently work at Lockheed Martin as a counselor for consumers. I take an average of 60-70 calls a day giving and submitting accurate information into database. Management and co-workers at my current employer are all team players and they all allow me to do my job daily. It can be challenging mentally but it allows me to challenge myself with each difficult task. I like the fact that I can help people are who struggling with specific issues.I actually worked for Martin Marietta before it merged with Lockheed in 1995. The teamwork among the Executive Secretarial staff was outstanding. The two Assistant Treasurers I supported were good at informing me of what they expected of me and acknowledging me when I performed well. They also handled my errors with understanding and retraining."
682,Logic20/20,"Logic is very strategic about building the practice with candidates that are bright and fit the culture of the company.  With few exceptions, great management who really care and try to do the right thing.This is the place for people who want to work hard and also spend time getting to know their co-workers.Strong leadership, great company culture, great growth opportunities."
597,Logistics Management Institute,"The staff at LMI are a fantastic group of elite minds who provide meaningful and actionable consulting services to federal clients.One of the better service providing companies supporting both the public and private sectors.  Outstanding HR and IT support with excellent managerial oversight that creates a productive and enjoyable environment for its employees.I have had no serious issues with the LMI management but there are small quirks to the company that can make some days frustrating.  I would definitely recommend to anybody that the could find a place here.Great company to work for. Job advancement is not as fast but in my eyes it is fair. Fairly new. CEO is very pleasant. I have nothing bad to say about the company. Nice people. Many have been here for a lifetime.Great company to work for with very good benefits. The best benefit is the ability to take part in a number of learning opportunities to develop professionally. The company also has a great new headquarters, however if you are not part of the few administrative staff or management you will probably have to work in a below satisfactory client facility.Productive workplace.Co-workers are great. Working conditions vary from department to department.From start of the day to the end I stay busy with data entering, invoice reconciliation, verification of client/vendor information.  My supervisors are great and I hate to leave but the company is going through a major change and I do not believe that there is a place for me anymore.  My co-workers are supportive and we like to get together once in a while outside of work.  The hardest part of my job is being able to get the PM's and PD""s to verify the work done and sign off in a timely manner for payment.You are constantly get harassed by your manager and they will harass the client as well-A lot of micromanagement-They don't let you advance in your career and their HR is a joke. Majority of the manager have been here for a long time and same as the HR and they back each others up. If you complaint, they will make sure that you are out the door fast.  The manager don't know how to manage people and they have been here for 20 years or 30 years. They also think that they own the company. If you are looking to retire here, come and join the group and their insanity. Also, there is favoritism. If the manager likes you, regardless of your education or your work experience, then you will become a superhero.LMI is a great company. The leadership from my program director is top notch.Great company, people, and projects. Government is main client. revent funding impcted by sequestration issues.I worked for LMI for nine years, and there are none better!  It has been consistently rated as one of the best companies in the DC area, and they deserve this recognition.  They have Great People - Great Professional Opportunities - Great Culture- Competitive Salaries.  None better!  I was verbally harassed numerous times and when I had gone to the Director, 2 days later was dishcarged.Good place to work. Associates care about their clients and thier misisons.Very challenging and interesting work. LMI is an excellent organization to work for, however, stressful when you are required to deploy to fight terrorism.Incredibly strong comapany with an excellent reputation among the Defense Community."
299,Logitech,"I have been consulting at Logitech for the past 6 months and I can't say enough good things about this company. From the day I started everyone has been pleasant and inviting. As a consultant I have never felt like an outsider.  This company is very good at communicating to it's employees things that are going on within the Company.  Every week they have a get together so that groups can share what is going on in their areas. Communication is something this company does very well.The CEO is very personable and inviting as is all the management I have dealt with. The employees seem happy to be working at Logitech. Keep doing what you are doing Logitech!~Logitech is re-branding itself as a more youthful place and it is working. The company is well-known but small enough to allow for a larger & more impactful role. Compensation packages remain slightly below average for the Bay Area and the location is not prime for those seeking to live in SF. Culture is excellent.Logitech is a great place for a positive and friendly corporate culture that works pretty hard but also allows room for work life balance and provides a lot of opportunity for personal growth and improvement. That being said, as a business they are stuck in the past using old processes and they have a huge issue with working together across departments or fixing organizational issues. Despite being a globally distributed business with over 120 offices worldwide they haven't seemed to figure out how to work efficiently and effectively as a global business and the process keeps tripping everything up. There was a lot of talk constantly in the two years I was there about progress and change and moving forward with new ideals but at the end of the day nothing ever changed.Typical days work includes overall management of processes on behalf of the #PL provider. Monitoring and managing carriers ensure all compliances were adhered to. Creating and providing monthly scorecards to both 3pl and carriers .Liaison between corporate and olive branch.At Logitech I was able to work with many groups throughout my long career with them, from engineering to compliance to executive teams.Great culture to work in Logitech.you feel great to go day by day to your job.They have all the time events for the employers and have a great communication to all the employessThis is a company committed to excellence in every facet of day-to-day life and mission. It was culturally inclusive, and full of design-minded do-ers. Would recommend.Established track record of effective project management and business analyst skillsExpertise with implementing and managing multiple projects at one timeEffective liaison between staff and senior management to accomplish organizational objectivesNavigate projects and timelines to completion in fast-paced, dynamic environmentsStrong work ethic, combined with a commitment to excellence in all projects undertaken Dedicated to exceeding expectations and producing high-quality resultsIt is a good working environment and learnt a lot. Like every place of work it has its own pros and cons. Overall, it is a place to learn new work experience.I just worked as a contractor here.All the people and the environment is great, all the members are nice and friendly. The company has a lot activities to encourage the creativity and the develop of different skills in the resources of the company.Great place to work.The company has a very bricks-and-mortar type feel, however, the new CEO is working hard to change the look & feel and culture of how business is conducted. Going to an open-office setup, committing the company more towards design, and trying to act more like a small company are just a few things he is doing to try to change how the company operatesThis is a company that is now being headed up by a new CEO. It is an exciting time as many chnages will surface. Key decisions will be made about product lines and groups.In the Compensation arena it's exciting because we are always developing areas to motivate and retain employees. One of the key projects I worked on this year was requesting an increase in shares from shareholders. It was quite interesting understanding all the organizations involved in this. We were successful in our request and I also learned and developed another skill of mine.•	Coordinate, support and resolve issues from UAT2 testing for procure to pay track of the R12 upgrade project.•	Worked on preparation of cutover document, preparation of pre cutover, cutover and post cutover activities.•	Resolved critical issues that are preventing the closure of the UAT2 P2P track.•	Managed and coordinated the entire source to settle track (Purchasing,iProcurement,Payable, Payment and Cash management) at the UAT2 with APAC and EMEA business team.•	Resolved many priority issues in a timely manner without delating the UAT2 schedule.Quick moving.

Great benefits and a decent annual review program.The people at logitech are passionate about doing a good job and being best in class. It truly made it a joy to be around. Their top in class product offering never ceased to amaze me.Working there for more 7 years, I enjoy the company culture, and my co-workers are very friendly. Compensation is about industry standard but not attractive. The most enjoyable part of the job is I get to see all the fantastic products launching every year.Friendly managers and employees. Enjoyable working environment. Typical amount of red tape and politics. Free parking. Fantastic cafeteria, serving full breakfasts, hot entrees, burgers, salad bar.Good company for someone to start with, good work life banakc , management care for you- Fun, enjoyable staffs, lots of respect from team member- Everything about packaging design production related- excellent management team, no complain on each member- great team members to work with, shows lots of respect to each other- rounds and rounds of changes on design direction- Best part of this job - peopleLogitech continues to evolve and enter new markets.

523,L'Oreal,"I had many duties at L'OrealI worked in the Homologation and Compatibility labs helping in many aspects.Co-workers were always of immediate assistance and guide.Several extra activities were carried on during the work days which made the place a funny and stimulating second home.L'Oreal was a very family orientated place to work at. It was a great working environment and they were also very friendly.My typical day at work would be face paced, hands on, and cautious. Everyday there was always something new to learn. My coworkers were very friendly and handy. The most enjoyable part of the job was that i got to experience making beauty products for women/men and making them feel better about themselves.A typical day at work is to meet, greet and engage each customer. Ask about their concerns or questions, if any. My Job is to assist each customer with their desired product as well as introduce and market new products to them.Management is fully structured and organized at L'Oréal.  Co-workers are very supportive and act as a collective unit. The best part of the job is, it forces me to challenge myself to be a better employee each day. Another great thing I like about his job is, I get the opportunity to try new products first hand before the public.Was an excellent experience. I saw the world and worked with amazing people. I enjoyed working for L'Oreal until I witnessed hair product technologies being shared between the brands. I felt that brand identity and proprietary technology had been sacrificed for their bigger picture.You work diligently for what you get and what you get is good. No complaints except I had around 30 comp days due me when I left. No time to take them. Lots of work. You would be happy to get a 6 month project off your plate because the plate was over-flowing. No time to celebrate or feel a sense of accomplishment for the amazing work you did. Otherwise...no complaints. Excellent work environment and amazing people in the organization as well as the clients that loved the brand. Had more fun than not...perhaps thats why I didn't take the comp days due me. Just saying'...Very good company with a lot of benefits, and they give away a lot of extra incentives just for working their. The only thing that i did like  was the pay raise was not fair. If the pay raise was better then that would help.My recent experience in Packaging, Replenishment, Stocking, and Full Case has been an opportunity to learn the mission of the distribution center in providing customer products to meet their demands in deadline.Typical day at work involved SAP interaction and excel reporting and macro creation. Most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with, and the biggest challenge was facilitating the necessary answers I needed from co-workersPoor management.Good Benefits and trainingsCan only advance if you are in with higher ups.Promotions happen to fast and under influence of high turnover.Not professional.•	Managed the global project ‘ERGO ATTITUDE’ •	Analyzed the ergonomics of 18 workstations•	Presented the results to the CIO The Active Cosmetics Division brands•	Supervised three working group of 5 employees each•	Coordinated actions' plan for the reduction of the ergonomic risk•	Reduced 25% risk of ergonomic injuriesgood place to work, met a lot of people. big numbers place so very few fun days. good money but they trap you there with the money they start you out at. didn't care for managementhave to work multi taskinglearned a lot about retail, sales and operationlearned how to handle people, adjust and get a long with diff peopleenjoy on learning new thingsAs a Full Time Key Holder I have learned a lot and I am constantly given new material to learn.My boos set me up with great tools and advice so that I am more confident to carry out my job and excel even further.I got to work right below a director of the company. I had one major job and would do other little tasks that my boss asked me to do. The major task was a three month project in which I was designing a new system. Gave me a different experience than I have had before.Typical day at work is starting off with a groupmeeting and finding out what machine you will be working on. You could be working a 8 or 12 hour shift depending on the job. You really won't have any problems with co-workers if you keep to yourself.There is allot of gossiping going around so keep your personal life to yourself. Management is ok but sometimes do not know what goes on around the work place to make it a better enviorment. If your machine is broken down or multiple you could be sent home. Depending on how long the machines are able to be fixed you could be out of a job for weeks with no pay.I've learned the diversity of the company.The most enjoyable part of the job is that they ensure that you have career advancement and flexibility at work.There´s always something new to learn everyday.  The diversity of culture makes the work environment a good place to work.A very fast-paced work environment which requires you to be very flexible and ready to resolve any issues that may arise. Great learning experience.For the most part nice people too work with. Good day off plan. A bit of dislike for short notice; of overtime. Safety was preached not always practiced.Job Culture is great. Everyone is nice and most are willing to help.  Depending on the department pretty good work/life balance.L'Oreal became is one of world's largest beauty company with32 global brands , came we say no more with such name recognition"
69,Luxe,"Great people to work with and I love to drive cars. Overall I had a very pleasant work experience. However, it is not a stable enough job, and room for growth.Great Company Overall. I loved working here and I hope others would to. I worked here for about two years it was the longest job i have had. Its a great first time job.I write this review as working for them as a ""contractor"" but we were treated like employee for the most part. We were able to choose our shifts in blocks such as 9-12 ect. However the Blocks were really inconvenient for all employees, and no wiggle room to fix your scheduled. You really do feel free to do what ever you like, but that might change after the W2 conversion. I have been with the company since they moved to Seattle and my need and openings were meaningless the them when they converted, so now I need to find something better. I will miss the ability to shop and play games while you what for work however.All around great place to work. The CEO is awesome and very understanding. I was able to meet lots of people and learn a lot during my time at Luxe.From meeting corporate brands, influencers, and Celebrities. I have been able create ambiances/events that will allow my brand to grow.loves my job here, i sucked at the being but picked up fast would still be there if not for my health problem of being out in the son for so many hours.full time or part time. was driver valet parking and I stopped by ley off. my company is good."
626,M&J Engineering,Not a good environment to work for.They do not give annual evaluations as promised.There is a lot of favorism in the company.  I believe employees should be appreciated and compensated for their work and this is not so in this company.
44,"Macy's, Inc.","A typical day at Macy's consists of selling women's shoes to customers, while maintaining a positive attitude and openness to questions or concerns, while ringing up customers and making sure that there is a clean and orderly sales floor for people to shop. With this job I have learned to deal with the personalities of others and to be more open to changes and also to aim high in all that I do.  My co workers and I usually work as a team and cover each others shifts when needed. The hardest part of the job is making sure everything is done on time, due to the many steps and the doable responsibilities. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and being able to earn small token s of appreciation, like extra money and discounts. And of course Management; which is great. Management at Macy's understands that there is more to life than just the store. Allowing the needs of its employees to be met as best.Macy's is a company that i do not recommend staying in for more than 3 years. Managers are unprofessional and do not help the growth of their associates. They do work with your schedule to an extent. The managers are only concern with what benefits them as well as their Macy's card statistics. Again I would not recommend anyone staying passed at least 2 years with this company.Macy's is a great place to work as well as shop. I enjoyed being a salesperson. This job prepared me to working in a salesperson type atmosphere and helped with all communication skills.Working in Macys they gives you the option to have a flexible schedule , it may be minimun pay but atmosphere of store its pretty great. I liked working in Macys.Working for Macy's I personally learned and had complete access to the tools needed for success. Working here I received something known as a Macy's Stars which congratulates awesome customer service.The atmosphere is great to work in and the staff is really friendly and outgoing. its easy going and a great experience for retail.I did not like the way my job ended here. There was no notification from my manager in person, just a message on the scheduling thing that my employment would be ending because I was seasonal. With the closing of Cortana Mall's Macy's, their employees transferred, while I was replaced by a fulltime employee from Cortana.Macy's management team as well as the support team all work together to complete the goal for the day. Friendly staff whom all love thier jobs and etc.I liked working with macys, easy work and easy to learn. Poor management in my opinion. Different management would bring me to reapply.A typical day consists of marking down merchandise that has been scheduled by corporate.  Goal is set to have in the 90% completion by Wednesday of each week.Daily frustration is working by the inadequate and uninformative markdown sheets and unorganized stockrooms.Nice company with a lot of great perks. Really enjoyed my time here, it's just too bad it didn't last long because it was a seasonal job. Other then that the job is pretty laid back.I always start my day in the home dept. Working on towels and bed/blanket/pillow, and start off doing recovery work. The most enjoyable part of the job, is learning new things, and trying something new too! Like recovery work with the Christmas ornaments and decorations, recovery work in the Kids, Men, and Women dept. The hardest part is dealing with some customer myself, sometime I try my best to be independent, and try to help them by myself. Sometime I end up asking other co workers for help though. I learned how to tell the different brands of towels, beds/pillows/blankets, and different brands of clothes too!Its a very good company in which to advance but it requires allot of dedication and hard work requiring many hours of overtime.-Provided apparel sales and excellent customer relations.-Answered department phone inquiries.-Kept all merchandise displays in an orderly manner.-Reviewed cash operations for accuracy and restocked inventory.-Market & solicit customers to apply for a macy's card.-Provided detailed information on new products.-Determined a target market & revised a strategy to get customers to purchase different products.Overall Macy's is a wonderful company and they treat their employees well. They are pretty flexibly with your scheldule and are willing to work with you.♣	One of the main responsibilities that I had at my job was to provide excellent customer service. Customer service was a huge deal. Providing good customer service brings clients back to shop at your store. It is all about engaging with customers, making a connection, and bringing sales. ♣	Some of my responsibilities as a sales associate was to help customers, keep the floor nice and clean, stock the floor with new merchandise, inventory, fulfillment, and keep updated with new sales that were going on in the store.I learnt a lot of things like how to use the register for cashier and comfortable in counting cash. The co-workers are very helpful.There is no hardest part because everything is easy and i am a quick learner.I desperately needed a job so I accepted the Macy's job. I worked overnight almost 12 hour shifts for around $8 hr. I did my job a long with my supervisor's for the same pay. I was promised a raise but never got it.This was a holiday part time position. Cannot rate it right now. This is a very long application and I don't have time to spend on this all day.Macy's started as a holiday position in the Christmas department.I got to set up all the holiday displays and trees, I handled  all the ornaments holiday decorations sales. After the holidays they decided to keep me and i worked in the ladies department. I loved working there.I enjoyed the fast pace environment and helping my customers. The people that i worked with were friendly and everyone had a really great attitude.The opportunities for advancement werent numerous but you had the ability to transfer to many of the different departments so you were always learning new and valuable things that made you more efficient.Good working environment can be boring at times.  But very fun to be around and interact with different people. And it can be good cause you can develop your people skills."
535,Mallinckrodt,"I have been working at Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals full-time about one year. Company is old and big, I have lot of to learn.My job is checking form, fit and function. I found those jobs I checked were designed by competent people. When I found an over-site, they were most often agreeable to comply.To many changes that are not beneficial to run a successful operation, they have created a very stressful environment to work in, to far to travel to everydayday started out with changing into your uniform, going to the board to see what blending room you are working in and seeing where they were with the blend. it was a great place to work. the hardest part of the job was the lifting and dumping of drums and other ingredientsA company with poor management and no direction . Like a concentration camp with pay . No job security . You can be fired for the tiniest thing . Management has no grasp of reality , they just want what they want . People leave and whoever is left must take up the slack.I learned to work as a groupThe management and supervisors we're helpfulThe co workers we're like familyThe hardest thing was looking at the tiny pills coming down the lineand being on your feet all dayCompany is changing its focus and moving away from the longer term research to put most resources on product extensions.  If you are not part of that focus update your resume and start looking.I always have had fun at my job and have made great relationships with my clients and co-workers. I have been very successful.- Creative problem solving.- Technical trouble shooting.- Encourage creativity in work environment.- Leading group discussions.I have thoroughly enjoyed my R&D colleagues and the work challenges put forth over the last several years with complex drug product matrices for extended release and abuse deterrence. Some belaboring challenges come with bureaucracy of controlled substance products. Unfortunately, recent upper management is now more focused on short-term high-profit limited market drug products obtained through acquisitions rather than on long-term and sustainable investment in R&D for new internal products.After having had the opportunity to experience Questcor and the feeling that the Specialist in the field that provided the customer facing were of great importance, its been very difficult to understand the direction and the focus of Mallinckrodt.  I'm unsure if they undserstand the value of 1 patient and the impact that Acthar and the role that it plays within the MS Franchise.I'm proud of the fact that for 3 years I never missed a quota and I finished each year within the top 5 of the Neurology Sales (ARD) Team.  The southern Nevada market has grown from a 100,00K market to more than 13 million yearly.Management is still in transition. It's not the same with the new management.  A lot of the original people are jumping ship because the culture is changing.Downsized with 150+ reps and managers on a phone call.  Had been there 7 months.  They made us buy cars one month before terminating  all of us.  Some of the reps had just gotten out of training the week before.hard to review, the company is changing very fast.  I am not sure what a  typical day there is because each lab is different, I think you need to check back in a couple of years to see if it's still here or if maybe it merged with another company.Being a part of the data management group at Mallinckrodt for 13 years was very rewarding.  I had wonderful co-workers within clinical data management as well as other functions in clinical affairs.As a production superintendent I am responsible for overseeing the manufacturing of three main production lines.  Operations require a collaborative and strong work ethic with my staff as well as with internal support groups.  The team is heavily production orientated with a strong understanding of safety and quality.   Along with being production orientated, I lead the team in championing cost savings and process efficiency drivers.I typically have a project to work on.  I develop experiments to conduct and transfer the final process to manufacturing to validate.  I then follow the production data to compare results from the changes made.the pay,benefits, and vacation time is really good. Most of the people where great to work with. I disagreed with the cutbacks so after 23 years I leftI worked for mallkinckrodt for 9years I was laid off on sept 5 2014 I was grateful to work for mallinckrodt for 9 years.Good company and  great people.Good productsGood Tech support.Good benefits.Field service based from home. Did all travel and scheduling arrangements.Did field service on xray equipment in hospitals, too much travel"
527,Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals,"Radioactive pharmaceuticals is a very challenging job and can be very demanding.  There are a lot of good folks working at the site and  a lot of experience with radioactive materials and sterile manufacturing.Mallinckrodt is a decent place to work with collaborative management. Work life balance is good, but future is uncertain since company is changing directions.Working under a contract in IT & enjoy working here.  It's a nice campus & they have plenty of work to keep you busy in IT.I've been trying to take on additional technical work (my level), but have been doing a lot of what I'd previously used summer interns for.  Inventory, Asset Management, Decom, etc.I don't mind easy tedious work to help clear backlog, but would like to put my experience & skills to better use.I have been here for a year and love it! The people are great, very diverse, lots of god perks including tranquility room, concierge, great pay and benefits.My typical day at work involves a continuous flow of projects from Production Floor manufacturing issues to Product/R&D assistance. I typically have a list of priorities as well as being on call for any production floor issues that arise. I do everything from data collection for engineering projects to electrical and mechanical component design. I assist the technicians and quality inspectors to resolve any issue beyond their skill set.           I have learned a great deal about medical device design and verification. My current position enables me to work with a wide variety of employees with varying levels of knowledge and experience and participate in many cross functional team projects.      In most cases, management provides room to work. We are usually empowered to manage our own time and projects with management support or intervention when needed.      The hardest part of my job is the increasing workload. When I was hired into the Engineering Office, we had a nine engineers. The office has been streamlined to three engineers and a technical specialist. Additionally, I am constantly on loan to R&D for technical support and special design projects.      The most enjoyable part of my job is being constantly on the move. I have never went to work and couldn't find something to do.We were acquired by Mallinckrodt and therefore based on the merger it wasn't really enough time to make an accurate assessment however during the short time I worked for them it seemed good.  My manager was responsive and listened.This company has a very dysfunctional corporate culture.  Management does not care about employees and layoffs come at a rapid rate.Company is very knowledgeable of USP standards.  Very well kept.  Quality is very important to company.  Quick turn-around for testing compared to needing shipped,Mediocre management, poor culture and disappointing business results. Reversed all the best things about Questcor since the takeover.The R&D group that i worked with were incredibly knowledgable in their fields.  The group that I was involved with was like a family.  The senior management is currently changing focus and doing away with R&D.I loved my position at this company. However, the company had just recently acquired another pharmaceutical company and there were a lot of issues with the management, i.e. no training, behavioral issues, etc. I trained myself in my position, and I absolutely loved it. I wanted to have a stable, permanent job with benefits and longevity, so I voluntarily resigned.My job duties were as follows:Processing educational grant requests, ensuring that all paper work is submitted by grantee, and coordinating meetings with grant committee for approval or declines of submissions. Processing financial awards for educational grants, fellowship grants, and investigator initiated studies.Processing all expenses and invoices for medical affairs department and following up with checks.Tracking finances and making sure they are paid out in an orderly manner. Coordinating events for MSLs—-booking venues, arranging transportation, food, etc. Ensuring that training certificates for MSLs in certain therapeutic areas are up-to-date.Work assignments were given on a weekly basis.Testing was completed on a day to day basis ending with a notebook write up and final results were entered into a sample management system.  Project work was also included.Learning was a continual process at Mallinckrodt with training updates that where to be completed within 30 days.I also continued to perfect my use of the Chromeleon data acquisition software that was previously updated within the company.The management team I was associated with were extremely supportive and encouraging to their direct reports.My co-workers were very professional and supportive, as well as some of the best people that I have ever worked with.My career with Mallinckrodt was very enjoyable.  I have to say that the best part of my job was the type of work I performed as well as the people I worked with.It was an all around great place to work.Provides good training and fair management.  Advancement opportunities if you work hard.  Has been proactive in buying companies for more opportunities.A great place to work and advance your career.  A pay for performance culture focused on delivering results and increasing shareholder value.I great place to work if you work in pharmaceutical manufacturing and a good stepping stone to larger pharmaceutical companies.  Management is very helpful and supportive if you show initiative to grow within the company.  Unfortunately the imaging division is downsizing and morale is very low with a high stress level among staff not knowing if they will be laid off.  There is a true spirit of team work among workers and will do what needs to be done to get the job done well.It's a fun working place. One of the good pharma companies in Saint Louis area. Management and co-workers are also good. Nice place for someone to start a career.Provided educational environment with the possibility of advancement.  A challenging company that encourages innovative solutions to technical challenges.  Co-workers were fun and interesting and provided support and assistance when needed.Job provided the ability to pursue additional areas of interest such as .net programming and XML and encouraged advanced development techniques and approaches.Questcor Pharmaceuticals was acquired by Mallinckrodt and the chaos began: layoffs, downsizing etc. The base compensation package stayed the same but bonus potential was slashed.The company has terrible management and incredible turnover.  The flagship products: Exalgo and Pennsaid 2% are great.Acquisition intensive, growing company based in st louis with companies spread around the country and a few internationally.Great company with great compensation and benefits.

660,"Mars, Incorporated","It was an easy job just doing home healthcare can be difficult when your inside someones home and they don't really want you there. They start to fight and hit on you.At first i really thought this company was a wonderful company to work for and after being here for a year and learning the ropes of and moving on up i got fired with no evidence for something i did not do. A lawsuit makes sense for this company and the p&o manager at the victorville site has no clue in how to run the hiring and firing department! Terrible place to work forWalked through out the plant hourly checking product to make sure it was in safety and quality specifications. Insured that our product was tested every hour to give the customers and company a log of the product and every test performed on the product. Monitored other associates on safety and quality in the manufacturing process.The management needs a reboot. Yelling at your employees doesn't make them want to work, let alone work for you. They demand to be respected but don't respect their employees.At Mars I was shipping and packing. I liked the job due to its pay. I really want a warehouse Job again. It was a good experience to me and it showed me a lot.Mars is a fast paced business with plenty of opportunities. You can succeed if you need little direction, are a team player, hard worker, welcome the company values.The people and management was very nice and helpful. I learned everything about my tasks and ways to reach the production number in according time within a couple days on the job. I've worked in groups from 2-4 people and we were able to accomplish them as a team every day on the job. The most enjoyable part was getting the production done and getting a head start on the next shifts production. That allowed them to acknowledge how hard we worked the previous shift. There wasn't any hard part of the job, I got exactly what ii signed up for and learned a lot. I was satisfied in every aspect.Working at mars keeps you busy and on your feet never a down time you stand on an assembly line which ever one you are assigned to for that day and you handle all the candy for that lineA work day began by first working the current list of patients with outstanding medical fees. I would call all listed phone numbers associated with the patient and attempt to make contact with them. Once contact was made, I would interview the patient and see if they qualified for any state or federal run assistance programs, such as Medicaid or SSI/SSDA. If they were found eligible and willing to accept my help, I would then either mail or hand-deliver our authorized representative packets to them and have them complete them. I would then take the information gathered and apply that patient for medicaid and/or SSI/SSDA (depending on eligibility). If the patient was approved I would then hand over the account to my supervisor, who would then bill the account to medicaid and the outstanding fees, or at least a portion of them, would be paid. If a patient was found ineligible or was denied coverage, the account would be given back to the hospital and a financial aid application was sent to the patient for completion. In this job I learned excellent customer service skills and developed confidence in talking to new people in a cold call scenario. I also learned how to utilize the hospital documentation program, EPIC. My direct supervisor was a dedicated woman, and was very diligent in her dealings with patients and the hospital alike. Our team was small (only 3 people towards the end of the contract) but she still managed to guide us to the goal of saving the hospital over one million dollars in derelict medical payments over the course of about 4 years. I found the hardest part  more... of the job to be fighting with the state agencies, such as Job and Family Services, for approval for the patient's medicaid cases. Often times the patient would not be able to provide all verification's in time and we would require more to get everything JFS needed to make a decision. I would say the best part of the job was the ability and necessity to  travel to patient's listed address, in order make contact or secure AR packets. This allowed me to meet a diverse mix of people, most of which were very kind and appreciative.  lessThe money is not worth the headache or never having time off, the feeling of being disposable at any time. You are pretty much overworked and under appreciated. Management is despicable. Workers are lazy and if you are a good worker, you are the 1st to be reprimanded. No set schedule because something is always changing. Very inconvenient for anybody to deal with especially if you have a family or other events. Do not waste your time applying. Save yourself the trouble and headache.What I like about Mars, Inc. is that it is a family-owned company and the family is very involved in the growth of the business.A typical day at work is giving your all and management not doing anything, ESPECIALLY TOP MANAGEMENT. No support at all and that's when certain leaders decide to show up! Good employees are looked down upon when pointing out issues with the stores/company and if you reach out to higher ups that are not in your store, you can guarantee your name is at the top of the ""hit list"". Instead of fixing issues management, even P&O, does whatever they can to sweep the problem under the rug, even if that means getting rid of you. Good managers there are afraid to speak up about issues because they fear for their jobs. The retail side of this company is untrustworthy and should NOT be considered for employment. Associates on the floor just get looked at for mistakes.The amount of BS you endure at this job for the amount of pay is NOT WORTH IT. STAY AWAY FROM MARS RETAIL!! For your own health and sanity!After working in the public sector, it has been so REFRESHING to work for Mars where decisions are made driven by the 5 principles: Quality, Responsibility, Efficiency,Mutuality, Freedom.  I honestly didn't believe this when I first joined and thought it was just HR talk but I have seen this come to life on a daily basis.  Our management team is accessible and the broader team respects one another. We make recommendations based on the long term as opposed to short term earnings, and in the Pet division the mantra is ""Dog and Cat first.""  We make great products that improve the pets lives.I love being able to bring my dog to work with me and love being surrounded by others with a passion for their pets.  We also have several therapy puppies that are being trained by colleagues- what is better than having a constant stream of puppies at the office to make you feel good about coming in?If you're an individual looking for a challenge and want to grow within a short period of time and enjoys multitasking, stop looking elsewhere, this is the right place for you!good place to work. long drive for me. good people to work with. good management. great product everyone loves gum. recommended place to work.Help desk environment with responsibilities ranging from hardware resets, to maintaining an inbound call queue, while also supporting walk-up assistance.Management full of BS and need more training, disappointing and Georgia laws sucks, the job easy, not hard, pay very good. Enjoy my coworkers!Mar's as a company may be a good place to work on the whole,But the Retail division is totally disfunctional and a horrible place to work.Management is primarily through intimidation and dictation. The Bosses are Bullies!   People are treated as drones and not appreciated.  Talent is ignored and not rewardedThe management, from the Corporate Office in New Jersey all the way down to the store level gives lip service to the principals of the company but do not uphold or live those principals.There is no opportunity for advancement.  Mar's prefers to recruit from outside the company rather than promote valuable talented people from the inside.Mar's is a private company and thereby writes their own rules.I would NOT recommend Mar's Retail as a place to work at ANY level.Overall they are a good company with good work life balance.  Excellent work facilities and collaborative.  fast paced environmentOverall it is a great place to work. Sometimes it can get demanding, but I suppose that can occur anywhere you work. I would recommend anyone to go and work for Mars. You can bring your dog to work with you. Fitness center in the building.The position was really good I had a great time working for this company. A typical day is going to work mon to fri from 8 to 4."
253,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Its MIT high stressed, demanding atmosphere.  Lots of room for movement through out institute is one plus though salary is commiserate with other higher ed institutions dont expect to break the bankThis is a highly, productive, inspirational and demanding institution. There is a good work and collaborative atmosphere.Learned a lot of new things. Co-workers were great and highly educated. Lots of exposure to scientific techniques, and analysis of data.good place to work with advancements, depending on your position job may be boring. culture is strong and management is effective. Oh and if you are so inclined, take a class or twoDynamic an fun place to work. Learning from the best professionals , the competition is hard.The people here are among the most talent scientist you can find in the world.I have work at the Obgyn the manager and staff are bully and disrespectful to new hired staff. You also have to be there on favorite.I had a good working experience at MIT. It was a fun place to work  i had a great time at MIT The work we did was cleaning mechanical rooms. I hope I can find a similar job.MIT encourages a healthy work/life balance. Great location, great benefits, and great staff. They train you well on your job functions, and encourage you to seek further training on additional skills you may wish to acquire.It was a great experience, I learned a lot about restaurant management. Waffle House is a strong company, the pay can be great. I would go back>The management and staff you work with are some of the best people you will ever work with, hands down.  This was the best job I have ever hadWorked in a great group with a professor I worked with years ago, his team was young and brilliant.  Loved the folks there.  Just no room for advancement.  Each admin basically worked in siloI worked in Koch Institute, A Typical day here is going through emails see if any needs immediate attention. If not, then going through daily financial reviews and filing. Everyone here is friendly. Benefits are pretty good. Especially the tuition reimbursement. Not much room to grow depending on where you work.Years ago, MIT was a great place to work. Over my many years there, I watched it steadily decline as new poorly skilled and either military or corporate minded leadership was brought in. By the time I left, it had become a very dysfunctional place in which bullying, public verbal abuse, misrepresentation of data, lack of communication and transparency, and hiding behind consultant reports and buzzwords had become the norm.There are endless opportunities available. there is opportunity to be creative and innovative to achieve every goal.If you can take working weekends and are motivated to learn its a great job. Complicated plant and not enough training. Co-workers can be hard to break through to.It was good honest work, the people were professional and personable. A typical day at work for me was fast paced, repetitive, yet simple it was enjoyable and an easy learning curve. The management typically left me to my work unless there was a problem which wasn't bad but I didn't get to know my managers very well.MIT has an interesting blend of workers and researchers across its institution. It seems that departments can vary wildly in terms of culture and scope. What happens on one end of campus can be very different in comparison to the other end.At the Office of Digital Learning, I took on a role as one of the first 10 in a fledgling department. This requires me to be a bit of a jack of all trades, and each day entails something new.Worked there for many many years - loved the Institute like family. Amazing research - amazing students. I found however that the work load was a bit crazy at times and management didn't always have the staffs best interest in terms of advancement - work life balance.I was given the opportunity to work at the M.I.T. Museum for a temp position and had a great time. A job similar to this is what i would ultimately like to do fulltime.  Unfortunately i was only guaranteed work for a few months and had to take on a fulltime job elsewhere, otherwise i wouldve loved to work at M.I.T. permanently.Nice place to work. Flexible hours. Good and friendly project managers. Convenient parking locations. lunch n learn sessions. Good co-workers. thats all for now I dont recollect more points.Massachusetts Institute of Technology is a great work environment for researchers and young scientists who wish to start their career."

For the time that I for MB Mortgage, I found the company culture to be fantastic. The employees were very helpful, friendly, and it felt like you were all family. My supervisors were great and they made sure that I was trained well and made me feel like I was part of there team. If I ever get another chance to work for MB Mortgage, I would jump on that opportunity as fast as I can.Nice people to work with.  Treats their employees well with lots of perks.

Process to be hired in takes a long time, probably the biggest negative about the job, but after thats done youre all set.The hardest part of the job is meeting the minimum production standards based on the area I live and work in together with the climate conditions which slow the real estate business community.Maintained incoming calls.• Provided exceptional customer service.• Knowledgeable of all products and services including but not limited to ACH transfers,Savings bonds, Checking and Savings Accounts.• Consulted customers with problem solving solutions.• Assessed needs of clients and suggest /promote alternative products and services.• Confirm sales.• Answered all inquiriesnice place to work if your starting out in the bank. They do not advance you though. if you are looking to grow and advance, this is not the place for you.Overall, a typical day for me was bringing in new business as a personal banker.  Processing transactions, cross selling products, maintaining account, etc.During my time there they wanted me to work outside of normal business hours without pay. I enjoyed my co-workers whole-heartedly. The management at the s wacker location was very very terrible. They had favoritism and only the ones the new management liked got promoted even though they didn't deserve it.I have never been where there was such lack of training. You were given a book and looked at it for two hours and then thrown on the phone and expected to know mortgages like a pro. You were not allowed to say ""yes mam or no sir"" to show respect as it was OLD SCHOOL. You were not allowed to give answers that could actually help someone who needed to know what programs were out there that they may qualify for like HARP. Because if they did not qualify the bank could be sued. REALLY. What a crock. You were to answer and talk on the phone no more than three minutes. If you went over that time you were talked to about the fact that someone stayed on hold. You can not always resolve someones problem in three minutes. They treated one girl horribly and then fired her because the supervisor who also got fired decided to tell stories on her and to lie to the VP to save her self from what was really happening. So no this place is not some where to be proud to say you work. Not any longer.Management needs to be able to offer more assistance and the proper training. Not enough people in each department. When other departments need help you are expected to help them and complete your own work, yet there is no help available when you fall behind.Salary is to low for MLO, the underwriters are the best in the business, everyone is helpful and team players. great group of people to work with I enjoy clearing the files to close so I can see my borrowers face it is like someone gave them a million dollars my customers service is key.I worked at MB Financial and enjoyed my time there. It wasn't the best job I ever had and it wasn't the worst. You asked for 20 words minimum and I had that, so I don't know why it's making me type more, but here I am typing more.People only get ahead by schmoozing the upper management, not by the work they do. Most co-workers are nice but management promotes a cut-throat environment. Management promotes treating customers horribly instead of correcting the many problems with accounts.Interaction with Senior Management and their direct reports has created relationships with one another.  Ability to work on difference projects outside of the scope of the EVP I report to has made a tremendous impact in meeting and learning how to work with different level of individuals.Great place to work, I loved my manager, unfortunately the pay was a lot less than I needed to have a household.. would go back"

However if you're working in Operations, Reconciliations, Card Service, Purchasing, Procurement... you won't have a life, you will be humiliated, yelled at and you will put in more than 50 hours a week. Yes you'll have great benefits and vacations but you'll work during your vacation or expect a call from your manager.  If you leave on vacation, you'll pay the price when you return.  It's a nightmare.  Some that have been there for several years, are use to this type of treatment and think this is normal. Leaving that place was the best thing I've done!!  The only positive thing was to have McKinsey in my resume which it landed me a great job with great people who actually treat me with respect. I want people to know so they won't go through the same nightmare I went through. If you land an interview, please ask the right questions, make sure this place is for you.

235,MCPHS,My director is the best boss I have ever worked with. Training was minimal and needs to be re-structured. I enjoy talking to students everyday and helping them with their financial needs.Working in the graduate laboratory at MCPHS allowed me to become more familiar with all types of machinery linked with analysis of pharmaceutical agents.

I assist current CFO in her duties, processes, policies, compliance overall running of organization.Managers are very good to work for and the benefits are very competitive.  The work environment is always comfortable at the company level.I really like MCR but the one thing that really hurts them is the bad medical plans. Management is great and they support you full bore.MCR is an integrated program management company that provides strategic planning, cost and schedule analysis, acquisition management and program assessment solutions for the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and Army Materiel Command (AMC).A great company, and a great place to work.

775,MD Anderson Cancer Center,"There really isn't a typical day in dining services, each day brings new opportunities to improve and learned new techniques. I really enjoy interacting with my co-workers to find new ways to be more cost effective.Currently working here now for the past 3 and a half years and I hate coming to work. The leadership is terrible, which trickles down to the employees. Its very hard to transfer to other areas, so Im basically stuck. I've been trying to move to other areas for 3 years, and cant even get an interview for positions I'm over qualified for.  Promotion from within is almost impossible...There is extreme favoritism. If your  not one of the ""teachers pets"" your days will be very challenging.  Whatever you do, dont go anywhere near the PBS dept. I really like the purpose and mission behind the work, but I just hate the environment. Unless your a doctor or scientist, I'd choose somewhere else to work.Management really does play favorites,and will go off hearsay, not actual facts.. They will go as far as making up things about you to find a reason to give you a hard time.They will deduct 100-200 dollars from your check for parking every month on top of the retirement they take from your check, that you cannot adjust. On top of that you will still end up walking a couple of blocks to get to work. Alot of backstabbing and untrustworthy people there. I wouldn't want to come back.A relatively fast paced work environment with many opportunities for connection and advancement. I learned much about cancer and the medical field in general. Management was decent but could be frustrating to communicate with at times - sometimes not seeming very receptive or accepting of feedback. Coworkers were good - worked with many caring people. The hardest part of the job was balancing the many many different tasks required at any given time within the constraints of an 8 hour day. Many days it felt like there simply are not enough hours in the day. Most enjoyable was helping patients.Great place to work and advance your career. Several opportunities to learn, gain new skills, and interact with experts in cancer.Managers show favortism and never hire African American  men. They will hire the women but never the men. They also give poor raises and they will barely advance from withinThe experience of working here for the past eight years has been rewarding. But financially I feel that I can do better elsewhere. Advancement wise I think that I can do better elsewhere. Supervisory staff falls a little short of being professional.LOVED THE WORK I DID HERE BUT THE MANAGEMENT WAS HORRIBLE. The most unprofessional group I've ever met. The played favoritism and i wasnt into that tupe of culture. I hated going to work with these people. E.V.E.R.Y.D.A.Y. The one  reason I lasted a year was because I felt the job I did made a difference in people's look lives.MD Anderson is a great company to start a career and retire from there too.  The benefits will make you want to stay with the company.  They have a good reimbursement program and the managers will work with your schedule if you're pursuing higher learning.The company is awesome but it lacked in leadership in some areas and resource skills that would drive the needs of the employee and organization to where it needed to go.The only thing about MD Anderson that is great is the benefits because you are working for the state.  The big issue is that if you are not a member of one of the races that are considered a minority (African American, Hispanic, Asian etc) you cannot get ahead in your career.  To be white at MD Anderson is a bad thing.  Also the management tends to play favorites, not being fair across the board with all employees.my 11 months working at md Anderson was horrible I dreaded coming in for work I would never have a assigned area and that was even after I made my 90 days. they where so unorganized they would have you doing stuff that wasn't even in the job description . I would never recommend anyone for this job nor any job at md Anderson. it was so racist and so divided pcps would get attitudes  as well as the nurse's  with the housekeepersPoor communication and no proper training program for new employees. Very poor management system. Would not listen or help me be successful. Group had terrible manners and did not try to include me. Group conversation was demeaning and negative. Employees made multiple mistakes but they were judged differently because they were already part of the group. No possible thought of ever being promoted.If you apply and get a position at MD Anderson it is a difficult place to get into first of all. Once you are in you would probably wish you hadn't. The co-workers are not very nice and the management plays favorites. I was there for 14 years and they worked hard to get rid of me. Watch your back and don't believe it when someone says they like you.MD Anderson is a great place to learn and grow as a nurse. The benefits and schedule are incomparable. The actual job of caring for cancer patients can be physically and emotionally exhausting, but is worth it if you truly enjoy what you do.MD Anderson was my very first job, that came with benefits, overtime and other career based amenities. It was the first time I was able to get a taste of the ""real world"" and its politics. MD Anderson motivated to return to school and finish my degree.I really enjoyed working here, this to is also very easy, and good money, plus they have really good benefits for you and your loved ones, its a great way to work.A typical day a work is cleaning office and clinic areas after closing time.  While working I learned how to properly clean a clinical facility.  The few months that I worked as a Building Attendant I. The job position and requirement were good I have no complaints. During the short stay on the job I experience 3 supervisors which gave me the notion that there is some unsteadiness in the management area. Why so many new supervisors in less than 3 months.  Co-workers no problems go along well with all co-workers.  The hardest part of the job to many changes of upper management.The most enjoyable part of the job lunch.This company is great to work for. Paid benefits, beautiful facilities including a fitness center, always providing continuing education.I found MD Anderson to be a thriving atmosphere where I was able to learn from coworkers, faculty and management. It's a place that cultivates its employees and encourages them to find their niche within the institution and work toward promotion. If it wasn't for the awful commute from Katy to the Med Center, I'd still be an employee there.The health care benefits are great. They offer tuition reimbursement which is important when trying to further your education. In general, a great place to work."
547,MDA Information Systems LLC,"MDA is a fantastic company to work for. Upper management is very receptive to new ideas from all position levels. It gave me the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects to help develop my professional skills and I ended up leaving with an expanded network of friends and colleagues. The most difficult part of the job was dealing with the constant anxiety of budget-based layoffs, but everything else was enjoyable."
473,MediaMath,"Dynamic working environment, lots of communication. Good work-life balance. Free pantry, table tennis. Good place to get involved in online advertising industry.When I worked at MediaMath the place was going through many changes therefore it was very disorganized to the point it was not clear who I was reporting to.Very relaxed work environment, enjoyable, all colleagues are extremely friendly, one has the ability to work on many interesting projects!I was attracted to work at MediaMath because it had a fantastic reputation in its industry and the unique challenges that the company is taking on. I was pleasantly surprised and thrilled, however, to find that it is also an extremely friendly and fun place to work- your co-workers are brilliant, quirky people who come from all sorts of backgrounds (my colleagues worked previously as fashion designers, animators, non-profit workers...so there is always an interesting story). Most importantly, these brilliant people are excited and happy because they feel trusted by management to try new things and work in the manner in which the will be most successful. All in, I feel at home on my team and valued by everyone I interact with.Management and leadership are not great, they are extremely disorganized and not proactiveMy experience at MediaMath has been good, and I have experienced a good amount of growth from a professional stand-point. As is the case for most start-ups, the environment and structure is constantly changing, which for me has been the hardest part of the job. I have had 4 managers and been a part of 3 teams. That instability has caused me to want to seek out other opportunities that may fit my needs a little better. Dynamic team - Great offering -Fantastic culture - Empowering leaders - Busy working environment; MediaMath is a pioneer in digital media., you can learn a lot of digital advertising industry. People are smart and energetic .Generally speaking good people. Most part work is clear. Management could use some training.co-workers are very helpful. I learned a lot about the complex product that they have and various features of it."
442,Medidata Solutions,"Currently Medidata is a medium sized company that is verging on becoming large.  It feels like managment outnumbers those that have to get the work done and politics is becoming more important than fabulous products.  It's sad to see because you know the culture is just deteriorating and will be to the likes of Oracle and SAS other big software companies that don't care about the most important resources, the staff.Medidata Solutions was a wonderful company to work with, I did enjoy working there and the people were very friendly, the people around my area were helpful to assist me and tell me what needed to be done and said if you need any of assistant don't hesitate to ask as we all work together to benefit the company's goodness.Medidata Solutions is a wonderful place to work. Your fellow employees are kind and very helpful. The most enjoyable part of this job is actually my co-workers.

204,Merck KGaA,"I was part of a 6 month internship for this company and it was enjoyable throughout. The interns would hold weekly get togethers at bars across the city which really facilitates making friends particularly when you come from across the world like I did. The company promotes this behavior by having a Merck sponsored events. My office was very friendly, even though at times there was a language barrier they tried their hardest to include me in everything. The work was flexible, you can arrive as early as 6 am and leave as late as 8 so long as there was another employee in the lab, which there typically was. The work was at times challenging, at times interesting, and a few other times a little dull but typically it was nice. Work is done in a clean room environment, at least with the area I was in, and all the clothes are provided for you. Overall, it was a great experience.I work at Bioreliance, subsidiary of Merck. Low pay but  has a better job security as they always want more people. It has a high turnover rate as people leave for better paying jobs.Fun Family Feel.  Work with different generation all in the Life Science division is great because of the knowledge exchange."
536,Merkle Inc,"Merkle is a place where you can learn a lot in a short time period, so it is a great place for new graduates to build up experience.  However, it is very challenging to find work life balance here.Took this role on when no one else would.  Good company, good co workers but manager was an ego maniac.  Different rules for different folks.  Hiring was at a high while there, mostly young people making good money however long hours.The role wore a lot of hats!  Very fast paced, sometimes not always appreciated the extra mile that was given.  Great location!!  Near Columbus Circle, pay was decent.What makes this job enjoyable is the compassion and fun natured people who worked there. Even though we have set work to do, with information technology, each day presents new challenges. The people I work with at this job were awesome and my direct management was also awesome. What this company is missing is a connection between the people doing the work and the upper management chain. They seem to make decisions without thinking about the ramifications. The company is also offshoring to China, so IT people watch out.Good working environment, close to home, friendly coworkers.  Got along with management extremely well.  Nearly all operational work transferred to offshore.Merkle Inc. is a mail processing plant that deals with monies from around the country. Most deal with donations that have to be counted, re-counted, then sent to the bank for confirmation. As a Check 21 clerk, I was able to work with some of the hardest clients that Merkle Inc. had to offer. The co-workers were friendly enough, however, there was a lot of drama that went on, and reminded me a lot of high school. Management was horrible, they never told you anything positive. If you messed up, you got told about it. The hardest part of the job was making sure the monies went to the bank at a certain time every day. Honestly, the best thing: they're closed on weekends, which gave me time to spend with family and friends.This is a fast pace company with no training; upper management does not have a clue on what is going on day to day. There is no work life balance in the company. The job expectations are unrealistic.Hectic and busy day working with executives and candidates to schedule phone or onsite interviewsManagement is amazingMerkle is a fine place to work with many good attributes such as hosting team building events, etc. One of its downfalls is its work-life balance. This is because it can be overly demanding at times.Merkle is not a great place to work.  The company is very focused on the bottom line at the expense of their employees.  They do not invest in developing their employees at all.  They understaff every account and expect employees to wear 3 to 4 hats and work more than 50 hours a week.  It is definitely not a family friendly environment.Get into work and start working. I am on  the computer either researching client's names or address for other people in other departments through email or phone.  Print out certain letters or reports which are needed for that day.  Help out other people on your team with their work when you run out. The hardest part of the job is when you have to get certain reports or letters and either the computer is not being cooperative or the printer stops working in the middle of the print job.•	Managed new client on-boardings through Merkle’s eight step process•	Planned and ran meetings dealing with new client on-boardings, existing clients, or solving IT problems •	Developed spreadsheets of company and client data, for easy department analysis•	Assisted in the development of Virtual Machines for clientsThis company has smartest people I've ever worked with - not to mention great culture and blue chip clients - great opp to grow and develop next generation marketing skillsPeople in Merkle are nice to each other. Willing to help and committed to work. Need improvement on work life balance though.They terminate people right to left for unknown policies that were not mentioned in the training. Literally my second week at Merkle my manager was fired. The training was immediately getting pushed into the job field, I am guessing it was meant to be a hands on experience. The only issue with that is errors can also get you terminated which was ridiculous. I learned that factor through training later in my employment for Quality Control analysis. Some employees love the place some had a very hard time with working at Merkle. This review is specifically for the Merkle in Hagerstown Maryland. If you could not stay the mandatory 10 hours you were getting marked up. Some people there had emergencies and children and still were marked up for leaving. They had a system called "" seven occurrences""  you only can get seven mark-ups and you were terminated. the bad thing is they do not tell you when they were giving you occurrences and if they did it was normally when you had two left. The system would have worked out well if occurrences were for reasons that were insubordinate toward the policy. However it was not, you came in a minute late , half a occurrence, came in a minute late from lunch which was only 30 minutes you were eligible to receive a full occurrence. Had to leave early no matter how severe the complications were you would receive an occurrence. You get too many errors when typing in data you got an occurrence, you were not allowed to get errors and if you did it literally could only be one or two mistakes. In that case I did not understand the job of the Quality Control  more... if errors could not be corrected. Merkle literally did not have any empathy for their employees whatsoever. I watched a man who worked for Merkle over 12 years get terminated. I worked there almost a year and was training for a higher position and they still terminated me over occurrences. In my opinion and this is not because I was terminated this place was terrible! and at worst unjust. I pray that the standards and policy has changed for the sake of the employees.  lessProductive company with great employeesA lot of learning possibilitiesHelpful coworkersSome communication issues between departmentsStartup company feel, with ping pong tables, in office gym, dogs at work, no rules vacation policy.

The Company has businesses with origins that date back to the dawn of the broadcasting age as well as new ventures that operate on the leading edge of media. The project is about creating ETL processes to populate summary data structures and development of stored procedure queries to investigate data issues or to create new reports structures for business units.Working independently and with team to monitor timely and proper reviews of all 50 state regulatory and financial quality standards through adherence to policies and protocols.Communicate effectively to management team, associates and other claims units; sharing best practices; support initiatives to ensure expected outcomes.Difficulties involved signing into many different systems to accurately review the entire claim handling process.I enjoyed traveling with my team to several claims offices to deliver results and receive feedback on our observations.A typical day consisted of completing adherence and compliance and other metrics concerning my team. I answered questions and handled escalated calls. I learned from my immediate supervisors how to maintain a work and at home balance. I learned from my co workers that it is ok to have some kind of fun in the workplace instead of it always being a serious workplace. The hardest part of my job was talking to people that just received the news that there illness was terminal. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I changed the work atmosphere for the better.Not a great place to work. Company seems to be going through many changes. There is excessive work, bad software and tedious processes... not a good combination.  They will work you like a slave picking cotton.  The company is sacrificing their employees with too many cuts. This is the only place that I know of that hires so many temps and they stay hoping to get a full time position.  Very deceitful, immature and messy management.  They are threaten by real professionals. Over aggressive men.They replaced all of the worker bees and kept all the Chiefs who play Machiavellian politics. The company is in serious financial turmoil due to its high expenses compared to its peers and low profits. It is difficult to drive change and get things done in this highly political environment that is more focused on manipulation, perception and self interest vs. getting the work done and doing what is best for the company. The GTO leadership is out of touch with what is going on as none of them physically work in Cary NC. However, they require all of their minions to physically go in the office each day.I liked the job, I just wished it would've last longer. I wanted a permanent position but I was led to believe there were none available and found out later that there were. I was contacted for an interview and a couple days later was told the position had been filled. I thought that was a bit unprofessional to mislead me into thinking the position was available and contact me for an interview and then cancel the interview.Was brought in as a temp to enroll Washington State employees; Letter that was sent to customers had wrong information.  Customer was told that they will have a smooth transition and keep the same coverage, which was true but they were not told that the monthly cost would change.  I asked for help with issue multiple times and management seem like they did not want to helpThe culture and technology stack were both in disarray.It's not possible to review the current state of Metlife since things have changed dramatically since I left. Staff have been removed, the operations center relocated and many functions outsourced.During my tenure, there wasn't a clear direction leaving technical staff with the task of discerning what needed to be done.The company overall is very friendly, and the environment is very welcoming and relaxed. The open space allows for visibility of all employees and creates a sense of family and partnership. They also have many company events which allow for individuals to to take a break, share experiences and network.They gave excellent training in both insurance and financial services Good compensation and recognizable name made sales much easier.  Time with family, as single parent, not what I wanted it to be and when I remarried wanted to go back to retailing.5 stars I would definitely recommend Met Life as well as Mercy hospital to a friend or family member looking for employment or a good career choiceI loved working at Metlife. The compensation was just ok. I was working in an entry level position and just felt like I needed to be more challenged. The environment was very relaxed, almost too relaxed. Sometimes I felt that the dress code was too relaxed. Sometimes you felt like you couldn't tell the difference between someone on the street, or someone who worked there.Lots of work to do great oppurtunity for growth in other areas of investments. The people are great lots of fun activities and great oppurtunity to volunteer in the community.Work from 730-430 with an hour lunch, small office and all co-workers work great together.  Casual work environment and flexibility to be able to work from home if needed.  My position requires multi-tasking everyday.  I am in charge of making sure that office supplies are ordered as well as office technology is working including computers, fax machines, printers, ect.  I also work directly with our Sales people in making sure deadlines are met to get Ancillary proposals out to customers as well as prospects.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the relationship that we have in the office.  Everyone really works as a team.  The hardest part of my job is during peak season when RFPs are coming in like crazy and making sure that I due dates on my calendar for me to meet.Paid less than promised, great people in a new building. Blind corruption by upper management. A good place if you are Not White, under 40  and have a sheepish personality. Your helping to offload work to offshore and excessive Vendor costs. Requests for technical training ignored. Great diversity . Give, give and live a short life on this happy campus. Work hard so you are replaced as soon as possible. There is no HR service, mentoring or conflict resolution. Read these reviews, many agree the MetLife workers strive in a leadership dead zone. Smile and remind yourself that the mantra is: Me, Me, Me, what is here for Me today ?Childish, irresponsible management.  The whole environment is a popularity contest.  Treats people like criminals when you have completed your duties and your temporary position has run it's course.  Only positive is that they allowed as much overtime as you could possibly manage.MetLife definitely deserves the high rankings from big name diversity groups. The culture is very inclusive and that makes it easier to do your job. The only bad thing is very little paths for advancement.Worked there for many years, but recent changes are making adverse effects to the business. Managers are hit or miss. There are more bad managers than good managers. Working from home is difficult because managers do not receive any training or guidance on how to manage people who work from home.I began my work at Met Life working as a part time employee while attending college. Once I graduated from college I was offered a position working in their computer department. I worked at Met Life for twenty nine years and ascended to a supervisory postion. I truly enjoyed my time here.Upper level management can be demanding. Met Life just sold all retail operations this year - so things may be completely different now.Wonderful support staff - convenient offices and lots of perks. Top notch for full-time workers."
634,MetroStar Systems,"It was really nice working therepeople there are very friendlyI learned a lot while working thereCo-Workers are pretty freindlyI enjoy each and every moment Management is very goodThere was no typical day at workEveryone at MetroStar are very supportive and energetic. I am not capable to work at the headquarters, but even still it is awesome how they keep in touch with the on-site employees. The company is steady growing!This is a great company with awesome benefits and who cares about there people. They will go out of there way to help you advance in your career and provided you with the training required to do so. There benefits are right up there with the best.This is a very good place to work as they are very focused on working on your skill set and molding you to better skill set."
640,"Microbac Laboratories, Inc.","Laboratory position with faced pace work environment perfect for just out of school hire. Management positions require several years of experience.It is a good job to get your feet wet, I have learned all I can, but there is no room for advancement.  We have a huge turn over rate, I have been there the longest at 5 years.I was employed at Microbac for almost 15 yrs. A typical work day consisted of finding the samples to test that day. Calculate media needed to complete the days samples. Writing up your analysis for the day. I learned a great deal in my time at Microbac such as aseptic technique, method suitability / validation. While I was working in the Food chemistry lab I learned how to work with HPLC and GC. The Managment at Microbac are good smart people but most lack personnel management skills. I had many friends that I enjoyed working with in the Food Chemistry lab as well as the Microbiology lab. The hardest part of the job was the inconsistent hours. Being a contract lab there would be slow times and sometimes we would have more work then the amount of people employed could handle in a reasonable amount of time. The most enjoyable part was always the people I worked with.High speed environment that is detailed oriented. Communication between clients and managers are a must to get work done in a timely manner. Multitasking and time management are important to meet the clients needs.Fun work place with very nick coworker. But lots of time very busywork, need very good organized time schedule. I have been working as a chemist in several companies and have a great chance to get lot of hand-on working experienceThis place is a good place to learn laboratory skills, but is a place that will destroy you if you stay with it to long.  There are some good people and some horrible managementMicrobac is a great place to start fresh out of college when you don't know any better. After gaining experience, I suggest looking to improve yourself. Microbac is a good resume builder, but they don't demonstrate that they care about their employees. Tactics used by management are often demoralizing.Good hours and great group of individuals to work with. The job was not very stressful, management was easy to talk to, I learned how to run the samples and how to mix the solutions for the samples.Must adapt to changing requirement quickly. Gained experience in a wide range of responsibilities.One of the few benefits of working at Microbac is gaining experience to enhance your resume and... get a different job. Another benefit is that you may very well like people you work with, as I met many friendly individuals during my time here. Now on to the drawbacks. You will probably be hired with empty promises of quick advancement, pay raises, reasonable compensation, and steady work hours. Kiss that goodbye. A new hire should expect to be kept at the same pay rate for as long as possible, while amassing more responsibility, and maintaining poor employee benefits. The company in general, and most specific locations are managed poorly. The emphasis throughout the company is profit. Morale be damned. Stay here long enough, and half (or more) of the people you work with will quit or be fired and replaced with someone grossly under-experienced. The work is challenging at first, like any new task, but quickly becomes very monotonous. You will most likely master most of the assigned tasks within a month or two, but will be expected to continually increase efficiency and fidelity. While working there, I did the same set of about 15 tasks every day. Over and over. After working in two divisions over the course of three years, I hated it most of the time from about 1 month onward. I worked with a few great people, but I also dealt with a lot of idiots (from bench level up to President level). If you have another option of employment, TAKE IT. If not, I pity you. Hopefully your hellish existence working here will serve as a catalyst to better yourself.No communication between management and staff.  Staff roles are not properly identified.Microbac is a privately held laboratory services organization where each location has complete autonomy to operate.   The lean nature and independence of the locations creates an environment where the fire-fighting that is normal to a services organization is unsupported by intra-company resources.  This also leaves the organization without the ability to capitalize on operational synergies in an effective manner and struggling to leverage its size to a more profitable and rewarding outcome.  With a relatively young and dynamic workforce the environment is typically upbeat and positive tempered against a high turnover rate.  As a career start, Microbac provides excellent learning to be leveraged to the next career opportunity.On a typical day, I was responsible for testing many dairy samples for customers that regulatory bodies required them to test.  Each day I was also required to test all media that came into the lab that we used for testing to guaranteed sterility, productivity, and selectivity if required.  Probably the hardest part of the job would be remembering all the different tests that the job required us to run.  The best part of the day would probably be when all the analysts in the department would bounce ideas off each other to figure out the best and most efficient way to accomplish something.  My co-workers were all highly educated and fun to work with.  Every one of them were easy to get along with and willing to help you as much as they possibly could every day.This is a good company to start your career however the longer you stay the less appreciated you feel as an employee. I've learned several different test methods however very few of those are utilized. There seems to be a disconnect between management and lab staff often leaving the lab staff in the dark on new projects.It was a great place to work for a while. They are understaffed in some areas and over staffed in others. Gossip central if that is what you like. There is a lot of favoritism that goes on in this company. ""Management"" likes to tell employees that they are all expendable. This brings the moral down. They do not lead from the front and the lab director and assistant manager run from their duties.Very busy everyday. Always had overtime due to constant jobs coming in and very little time to break. Co-workers were great and helped me a lot with the time at work. The best part of the job was having the support of the co-workers. The hardest part was the constant jobs rolling in and no way to finish them all with not enough equipment. The management was fine.When I started at this job it was a great place to work. Everyone worked together for the good of the company and the clients we serviced. As more employees left or where let go and not replaced this made for difficult work environment.If you interview there, look into the eyes of the people who work there and understand that those people were just like just you only about 2-3 years before.You will work 50-60 hours a week just to keep up with what is expected of you. Management is fine with that until they realize the OT is going to kill their bonuses. Then you will only be allowed to work 40 hrs /week causing you to get further and further behind. When you are so far behind that clients call in to complain ( which makes management look bad) you will be back to working 50-60 hours/week.Enjoy.Work starts when I gather all the sample info I need to run for that day. I then gather supplies and start to plug away at data and sample start up. I then repot data by a computer data program and work with my project managers as needed to help keep our customers in the loop. This is a job I enjoy because it is a high pressure environment where customers need results in a fast and timely manor and I feel I do my best work when I now people are counting on me to give a 110%.I really enjoyed working for Microbac Laboratories. The company had at that time GREAT ideas of growth and took care of their employees as well.The Microbac organization has over 20 labs in the US. The Wilson division is a good place to get a job straight out of school to learn a variety of skills."
680,Microsoft Corporation,"Microsoft is a very good place to work.  The company direction with Satya Nadella at the helm has been very good, and many internal changes are improving the culture and environment over time.  Very competitive, and there are some managers who are better than others (as is true with any employer).  Best if you're willing to work in Redmond, WA as remote opportunities are not nearly as extensive.Microsoft is a great place to work- the pay is good, the benefits are good, too.What is difficult is the opportunity for advancement.  If you have any scarce skills and are placed on a team that knows very little, then you're to fend for yourself with little to no help from management.Old way of working of save your skin and compete with each other is going away but very in a very slow pace. lots of flexibility and some work life balance but you will have lot of pressure and sense of not doing it right even when you are doing it right...changes are constant and that's can worn you out.Dynamic but relaxed team environment.  Always challenging and fun, and populated with some of the best professionals from around the world.A lot of learning, very good work culture. Excellent environment. Enjoyed working on the SharePoint team developing and handling TFS administrator part.Greet customers as they walk in the store while asking if there was something specific or pointing out the different sections of the store.  Interacted with several customers and co workers on a daily basis as well as cleaned, organized and restocked product on the floor.You can change careers multiple times without needing to change companies.  The compensation and benefits are outstanding, and the culture rewards delivery and innovation.I have been with Microsoft for almost 4 years. The company treats their employees (myself included) very well. Schedule flexibility is great, hourly wage is manageable, and the overall energy and support that other employees give out makes the retail environment a lot more manageable.Microsoft has an amazing company culture all the way to it's retail sector. Great room for advancement, lots of talented people and awesome culture and work environment.Microsoft benefits and compensation is one of the best, but unfortunately it has a horrible culture of work politics. Hard work is not appreciated, but ability to make relationship with utmost importance. Basically ignore any emails from peers and people below and only spend time to do bare minimum for your job. Focus your time on your skip level and director/VP level. The more face time you have with them the better your review will be regardless of your work. Annual review system is basically a popularity contest with your higher up with the most say. Microsoft is a large company, I am not sure if it was just the department I was in. I would like to work there again one day but not in the same department to see how other parts of the company is like.troubleshoot calls for customers and help them be able to locate products, customer love when I do the first part of my call. I was very upset when the acct was shut-downDespite a great transformation thus far, the company does not do a good job retaining great employees and has lost quite a bit of great talent this year.Very smart and awesome people.  Teams looked after each other and did what needed to be done for the customer.  Very thankful for my time there and always rooting for them.Microsoft is a great place to develop your professional career for full-time employees. Beyond the impact employees get to make on customers is the impact they make on the community. Perhaps the most unique aspect of the workplace is the emphasis we place on social responsibility and giving back to the community.Microsoft treats their employees with great respect. The company provides excellent benefits. Fun people, great atmosphere.Microsoft is a great company to work for.  Very talented people with innovative ideas. complete work life balance. A fun place to work with Talented peopleA typical day at work is surrounded by operational tasks and customer interactions. You have the ability to lead your team through coaching and development and provide recognition in unique ways. The team has a lot of fun together and really is able to serve customers with a great experience.A special place to work when you find the right opportunity and team.  The business is a thought leader (which is not recognized externally) and always looking to advance.A nice productive environmentGood place to work and health atmosphereGood compensationGood benefitsFlexible hoursWork from homeNice colleagues and challenging workI learned a lot as a Data Engineer an learnt about data and did some personal bootcamp training myself and attended meetings. But i wanted to show my skills to start up companies.I learned how to be a leader with this company. I learned the type of leader I want to be with this company. Microsoft takes care of its associates and gives them the tools and resources to grow in their roles and get them to where they want to be. They have a growth mindset culture and promote diversity and inclusion in all aspects of their business."
196,Millennial Media,"The company is great and the environment even better. Surrounded by people who are driven and amazing at their jobs. Given the volatility of the market and industry there is uncertainty on where the company where go and thus career advancement is not the easiest.I worked as a consultant, writer and video producer on a contract basis for six months. This is a vibrant, exploding and dyadic company run by the best technology and creative professionals in the business. People are valued for what they bring to the company and rewarded for excellent work. The culture is collaborative, entrepreneurial and positive. It is one of the most exciting places I have ever worked.I've had the pleasure of working at Millennial Media from the time it was about 50 employees to the joint Millennial/Jumptap company of 650 employees. In all that time I've had fantastic mentors, opportunities to advance quickly and a great work/life balance. The culture at Millennial fostered the relationships that made the employees my second family. The attitude is work hard when you need to but then take time for yourself when your work is finished. I would recommend the company to anyone.Fun workplace, but bigger Data Science focus is needed.  Also, some upper management changes would be nice in some offices outside Baltimore.Millennial Media is a great place to work, the culture is a true start up feel with energetic and intelligent co-workers.Fun atmosphere to work in, company is growing at a rapid rate, good location, causal dress.Locations are great, the industry segment is growing exponentially, and there are opportunities to grow, but it's all second place to the people.This was probably the best job I've ever had or will have. The people there are all concerned about working together, rather than worrying about only their jobs. They are committed to the people around them, and to the job at hand.I loved working at Millennial.  Since I have left, there has been a shift in leadership - this was needed all along and I am optimistic that the changes will help move the company to the next level.I built up the QA Team from 1 to 8 team members.  Went from waterfall to agile in 2 years.  The experience was invaluable and has enlightened me as to how to do it right and be successful.  Millennial Media is taking the mobile industry by storm and will they take no prisoners."
780,MilliporeSigma,"Large company with various opportunities and room to advance.  Flexible hours and good work/life balance.  Good pay and benefits .  Too much change in the pass 5 years.  New Infrastructure and support systems are not in place to support day to day activity.Working in this lab has been an amazing experience so far. I have learned to adapt quickly and take on new assays. Once trained, I still have guidance if needed and can ask questions without worry. I have been able to gain microbial and analytical quality experience, making me a well rounded scientist. The work is consistent, and if organized, there is no reason to be overwhelmed.Great company! Stable and fun company to work for. Work life balance, stable company with good management. Wages could be higher to compete with big pharma.I really enjoy my work with MilliporeSigma, it's a company that's growing but not beyond its capacity. I feel that with the new acquisition by Merck, it will continue to be on the forefront of life science production and R&D.This company has very good benefits.  They have acquired a lot of companies throughout the years to become a stronger company with a huge portfolio.  The company likes to focus on talent development and grow their current teams.Like any other Facilities position it has its challenges. I started when it was just a small locally owned business of 40 employees and now it is part of 50,000 emplyees and revenue of $13,500,000,000.This is a great company to begin your career at especially if you aim at going back to school or earning advanced certificates because the tuition reimbursement is great!Co-workers were friendly but 'clicky.' Training is not very organized. Expectations are not explained. Work is not very difficult but very monotonous.Great place to learn, I love the people. Everyone is willing to help and teach you any side of the business.  Advantage of a big company you can see and understand product development from starting in R&D to on the shelf manufactured. It is great to be able to witness projects like that.Great company to work for, with supportive teams and lots of opportunity to grow, good benefits, and outstanding training courses."
32,Mindlance,"Good company, but no job securityOnboarding team disorganizedHR very professionalPays bi-weekly as apposed to weeklyHardest part of onboarding process was lack of communication between onboarding team.Working with staff was a bit challenging at first due to language differences. As soon as I presented my difficulties to my main point of contact they intervened and helped to complete my onboarding. Overall the expereince has been pleasant and I have thoroughly enjoyed the work I've done as a Multimedia Specialist.Mindlance is a horrible agency to work for!!  I was employed for 2months was in a bad car accident reported it that night to my boss and due to my injuries I wasn't able to work and 7 days later they fired me because I was in a car accident. Now trying to get them to sign a wage loss form for a lawyer is impossible they claim they don't know if I was suppose to work. Won't returns emails, hang up on me.Mindlance found my resume online and contacted me for a temp position.I loved working for the client, but would have wanted a long term commitment. I had no interaction with the management of Mindlance.My co-workers were of that of the client, so I had no Mindlance co-workers.The hardest part was the interview possessor with Mindlance, everything was communicated via e-mail.Friendly,family-like,very productive working environment and I have enjoyed working with them. It is very good management,respectable and helpful working environment.Company assigns employees to contract work with other organizations. Low pay with benefits, based on contracting business. Little contact with company after employment.It depends on the company you work for or assigned to.  For the most part working for Mindlance is great.I have learned new software contracting for Anthem Healthcare.Management has been wonderful and helpful.I have yet to work with other Mindlance employees.The hardest part of the job has been working for a company I cannot locally visit.The most enjoyable part of the job is working for the contractors I am assigned to.Great work environment. Co-workers were friendly, helpful, and collaborative. The most enjoyable part of my job was the research and development.Effective and complaint bridge to the client company.  They are a temporary agency.  That's all that counts.  They are compliant and communicate well.assembled pc boards for 8 hours. learned how to work with small hand tools  .also to use a soldering iron. management  was nice. co-worker nice. nothing hard about the job. i have working and staying busy.Communicating with the staffers in the location at Morristown, NJ i believe. Offered very low pay. Came off as very insincere in my communication with theses staffers. I was not comfortable doing business with themIts was a laid back job I learned so much from Dr.Bowden she is willing to help you be successful at whatever you trying to accomplish she will take the extra mile as longs she see you trying to help yourselfGreat people and company make contracting a little easier. Alwasy quick to get the things I need or answer questions I haveContract worker for them for a year. Terrible; no benefits, no support, nothing. Didn't even make contact as my contract came to an end. Only spoke to them about twice.Mindlance located my resume online and hired me over the phone.  It was one of the most thorough and professional opportunities of my work life.Co-workers and team leaders are easy to work with but company benefits are pretty poor.  HR manager is easy to contact and responsive to concerns.worked with company in Tulsa and home office in Houston did not have a enough time to train.  Had to train one self and work through computer issues on your own.loved the atmosphere and the workers were nice and friendly. the managers in the training class did not monitor the class room activity very well.I enjoyed working on the assignment Mindlance sent me out on. I worked at Cigna Healthspring. There you work all the overtime you want as long it is available.I corrected pharmacy claims. The assignment was easy but tedious, the hardest part of the job was the lack of supervision.A typical day on this assignment was setting up depositions, medical appointments, updating attys calendars with hearings and depositions, opening mail and filing documents into EAMS as appropriate.I learned that I am productive and needed by the attys I assisted and loved working with them.Minimum supervision which was lovely because it allowed me to do my work without distraction.Co-workers were helpful and kindThere were no ""hardest"" parts of the job just tedious tasks which were essential to the job.I enjoyed preparing letters, pleadings and notices and gathering documents for medical appointments."
515,Mitchell Martin,"they are good reliable company very professional, give your chance to grow. I am able to communicate with staff and very good customer service  and very helpfulOverall, it is usually, fun, challenging, pleasant and busy.  The management was very informational, the staff was a pleasure to work with and the company always provided employment with companies that I was able to learn from yet provided what was needed to the team.They offered good compensation for contract work and good benefits, but were of little assistance with finding a position when this contract was finished.I worked for them just over a month and from day one of my assignment everything was a mess! My original start date got delayed 2 days because of my cubicle and computer not being ready, and when I do finally start it still wasn't ready because of a ""mix-up"". I also had to meet with security to get an additional background check and drug test completed for the client I was working for and they didn't even have any idea that I was coming! Training was horrible and inconsistent and didn't even have any work to do for weeks when I started! Then finally I was let go with a few other people with no reason given at all! The only thing that was good was the hourly rate. I would never work for this company or their client again!Mitchell/Martin was a great contract company to work for!!  I had difficulty securing employment when I was moving to NYC.  MMI was recommended by an Occupational Therapist who had positive experiences with them.  MMI placed me at a great hospital in the Bronx with a full time position that started as soon as I moved.  In addition, my contact at MMI was always quick to respond to questions and I always got paid on time!!The best Health Recruiting Company in New YorkI learn good experience to work many different nationality!My co-workers like me and we like to work together without any gapsA typical day at work would be checking patients in & out of the health center via EMR, Performing 20-80 phlebotomy procedures.By working with MItchell Martin I learned that patience is in fact a virtue when dealing / working with others. Management in my opinion from a scale of 1-10(10 being the highest) will be a 7, As far as my co-workers I would have to give them a 5. I honestly can not pin point a ""hard part"" of the job I would say that every part of the job was just a learning experience. The most enjoyable part of the job for me would have to be actually working with the patients hands on I really enjoyed that part. Overall I would consider MItchell Martin to be a well organized & productive environment!Good place to work.Friendly people.    a typical day at work    what you learned    management    your co-workers    the hardest part of the job    the most enjoyable part of the jobI like working with therm .. they have upscale clients ,and the keeps me busy. the pay on time, good communications. their pay rate is average.Unprofessional people. I was told about the placement and resigned from my job. I have submitted all the requirements and forms needed, even the physical exam that I have to shoulder. Suddenly, they became so quiet and didn't bother to follow up on what's going on. Until such time that I didn't hear from them completely.MMI is making the attempt at starting a new office in Dallas. There is a lot of opportunity with the organization as they are an up an coming IT staffing firm. There is a lot of growing pains that are going to come with this process. I have nothing bad to say about the organization. I feel that I would be better suited in a different environment.Formatted resumes for recruiters. Entered jobs into inhouse database. Prepared contracts for new consultants. Handled all paperwork for background checks and drug testing. In charge of all new hire packages.good place for new grad to add to their resume, friendly reliable recruiters....great work experience, everyone is well organized and effective in their task. dealing with people from all ethnic background all with one common goal patient care that is effective and within your scope.Like working for this company its really nice  been to different locations and I honestly love working with themthe delay of ICD-10 has resulted in the client not having enough work for me.Friendly and supportive staff, driven to help their clients. Fantastic work environment if you live in the NYC metro area. Their branches are not as reliable.A typical day at work consist of project meetings sponsor updates on high profile projects.Over all good relationship. 8:30-5:30 pm weekdays. Co-workers all got along."
513,Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma America,"I prefer not to review a company that I am working form, they are very nice people.  The commute from where I live to Jersey city is horrible and the expenses are a killer and breaking the bank so much so that I can't pay most of my bills and must go into my 401k to make ends meet.  The company was in Warren NJ and moved to Jersey City in January.  "
261,Momenta Pharmaceuticals,"Momenta Pharmaceutical has a great work environment. Every one is very friendly. It is a mid size company and a great platform to start ones career.Generally the best place to learn and utilize science ,the company is structured in away that each individual stand out as a unique piece that contributes to its successLot of favoritism involved, people from MIT get higher positions without any knowledge & experience.People with real expertism never get to reach to higher levels and treated always in gound levelDomination of analytical chemistsBiologist are not treated well and no career advancement for themFavoritsm involed for specific people, who don't need to work much and get to the have many reports to support them without their own ability.No support for professional development for non MIT background employeeLess pay and benefitsGreat work place.. Everyone to help around and teach  you new things. Great culture and management.Colleagues and are very approachable at any level and helpful.  I enjoy every bit of my time working here, innovative work and research boost up my morale."
540,Mondelez International,"Great place to work.  I love my job.  Little chance for advancement.  Co-workers treat you like famly, along with management.Open and inclusive company culture.Benefits and compensation for jobs are better than average for the local area.20 PTO days to start plus company holidays.Work/life balance is very good depending on department and immediate manager.Opportunities to learn via inter-company site as well as tuition reimbursement is available.Even though Mondelez is a better than average company to work for they are constantly changing by shifting jobs from one place to another. Cost cutting measures have resulted in jobs being shifted off shore and lots of layoffs or strict job cuts here in the US.Job roles and department responsibilities have changed as well. So if you get hired, don't plan on staying in one spot for too long.I've worked for this Co. for over 36 long years and I've seen many changes which I was able to adapt. The Co.has enjoyed many year of profitable success products that sold to the consumer good products. But then the formula changed and the consumers became aware of it. Management has changed there was a lack of communication between the labor force and management.  What was once a family affair it became just business. Overall the Co has endured so many obstacles and it's in business and making huge profits.Do a quick store review to check current display activity, sell in opportunities are competitive information.  Meet with decision makers to see if they have anything to cover are anything that i should be aware of.Discuss and sell against objectives,Merchandise delivery and write a shelf /display order.I learned how to build relations, listen and sell to the customers needs/and how to be a valued sales representative.Management was knowledgeable, informative ,and understanding.Co-workers were them players,Positive, and fun to be around.Hardest part of the job building  huge displays and merchandising large orders.The most enjoyable part of the job is selling and making your objective.Overall, Mondelez is a fair place to work.   The Sales and Marketing Organization is World Class.There is huge Financial pressures to deliver Quarterly Earnings Results which is consistent with a Publicly Traded CPG Company.  Senior Management is obsessed with cost cutting facilitated by broad workforce reductions.  Invariably, these Organizational Reductions come with promises of working simpler and more streamlined.  The Company is great at delivering cost reductions but has a very poor track record in alleviating what are at times unbearable workloads.  They have consistently reduced employee benefits cutting Pension, Health Benefits, Travel Expenses, downgraded salaries and have outsourced many positions overseas.  In the HQ Location in East Hanover, NJ, Sales, Marketing and Operations Management is top notch.  The Finance Leadership Team  are not very good at motivating their employees and collaborating with cross functional business partners. Finally, due to ongoing headcount reductions, there is very limited career opportunities for motivated professionals particularly in Finance, Marketing and Sales.A typical day as a Sales Rep for Mondelez International starts at around 7am. The rep goes from store to store to stock the shelves with Nabisco products and ensure the product is executed properly, then the rep writes an order for the next delivery and communicates any changes in the ad with store management. Sales Reps for Mondelez do not usually get to work with other employees, they are out on their own in the field on a daily basis. All company communication is made through emails and phone conferences.As with any large corporation there isn't any room for advancement if you do not have a 4 year college degree AND agree to re-locating.  This company is under going many changes especially within the DSD business.  Making many lay-offs and management changes.As long as you do your work ,they do not bother you. They respect your views and your work. My co-workers were fine. Management was great, Some of the work was back breaking but for the most part it was fine. The most enjoyable part of my work was knowing my job responsibilities and doing it well.A typical day at work is putting out fires caused by a culture afraid of change. I learned that most people want to just go with the flow. Management wasn't consistent in enforcement of change and discipline. Most of my co-workers wanted to do a good job, but didn't feel they had proper support. The hardest part of the job was getting the support need to make change. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning the process.Some of the best brands on the market that almost sell themselves. Still a lot of good people even though many good leaders and employees have left the organization through all the mergers, acquisitions, restructures and downsizes during recent years.  Top leaders are very focused on international growth and are implementing a lot of cost cutting measures in the US to get the business model more in-line with other countries.  The DSD sales force will continue to be be challenged as resources are increasingly leaned and it becomes more difficult to make the customers needs a top priority.  Company is a huge promoter of diversity.Great brands, good people, safe and clean work environment, great benefits, very strong senior management team, co workers distributed across the globe, work varies, based upon assignment.  Impressive commitment from the employees and a very innovative company with product lines, e-commerce and otherTerrible management,long hours,equals about 7 dollars an hours,customers only citizens and yell. no real schedule to plan things w/ family.The company really only cares about sales,do yourself a favor and look else where.Not your typical micro managed company if your self motivated, like fast paced work, and being around people.    My management is great to work with and for.  Nice being able to work and use your organizational skills.Mondelez International is a place of employment where an individual can provide a life for their family because of the great pay and benefit package. It is the type of employer that a person can retire from. The environment is helpful and management seems to be willing to listen to hourly input.Stable company, work independently, good benefits, dental,medicalvision and time off, short and long term disabilities, paid holidays. Minimum supervision, good management.MDLZ has a great corporate reputation and is an extremely ethical and responsible company. Like others in its industry, it's been under constant pressure to cut costs and streamline operations, and the ongoing restructuring over the past several years has taken a toll on people--but company has been delivering better performance in the past few years as a result, and it's clear there's some culture change happening.I enjoy my job and working for Mondelez International, but I need to have a more secure full time job with benefits.  Working independently and with stores and their managers is a rewarding experience.  The company is well established and growing and I wish I could receive full time employment only it is not being offered at this time.A typical day at work is going into big box retailers and grocery stores, doing deliveries, re-stocking, displays, etc.  Since Mondelez took over after they split, has not been that favorable.  Part time employees are treated like they do not matter, the hours are often cut without warning. We do not get bonuses like the full time merchandisers too.  You can be the best part time merchandiser with the best reviews from the company and stores and not move up the ladder.  It is a sad reality.  The raises are minimal at best. And the corporate culture needs to be overhauled.  There really is no hard part about this job, it is a no brainer. But one thing I would change is letting part time merchandisers know about products coming out.  Give us the same respect that the full time merchandisers get. We work just as hard, we deserve that too.The work  assignment are given, such as what line to work , what  job you are to perform at that line.  And how long to work there before going to another position on that line. I've learn to operate industrial machine / equipment. Stock machine with supplies, inspect product for defects  and verify code dates and labels are correct.Management did their job controlling the company, and making decision that they felt  was best for the company.The workers was great and we worked together as a team, helping out were needed and assisting. The most difficult part was remembering the loading ordering for each different cookies after learning that the and increase your speed for feeding the job became less complicated.The enjoyable  part of the job was working manually, and at your own speed or when working on the, line  every hour you switch to another job on that line  .This is a great company to work and grow with. They really care about their employee's. You can advance your position with the company based on skills not seniority. Their sales department train program is very detailed.As with any large corporation, there are many positives and negatives that go with a job in their Sales force.Positives include great benefits, opportunity to grow and advance within the company and bonuses and financial awards that compete with any company in its specialization area.One negative is that a work day is never done in Sales, depending on the region you work in the workload can be very heavy at times. Since I was in a densely populated area, I would spend all my time in the field dealing with shelf conditions and selling to managers. This would leave me having to do most of my extensive computer work at home after work which was not fully paid for. While these sacrifices are normal with any job, they were a little bit excessive."
795,Monsanto,"Long work daysGet people to work withGet to work outsideAt the end of pollination there is a pizza partyget to listen to your own musicHardest part is being out in the heat of summerget to work with your friendsPay was good and benefits and Bonuses were exemplary.  profit sharing and stock options also good.  Long hours were sometimes hard, but they were mostly seasonal and got better with management adjustments.You have to like working outside in the heat and dust much of the year, but it IS farming, even if its research.  I enjoyed the active lifestyle.  There was a lot of pressure due to tight deadlines, but it was exciting and seldom got boring.Corporate restructuring has led to a large number of layoffs (Mine included) and I 'm sure the recent Buy-out by BAYER will shake things up even more.  But, the Ag industry in general is in a period of fluxI worked for the company for 10 years and was recently laid off ahead of the Bayer acquisition announcement. It used to be a really great place to work and I enjoyed the people I was working for and with for the most part. Over the past 3 years, the morale has declined significantly, particularly in the Vegetables Division. People weren't being treated with respect and I saw many great assets to the company leave because of it.I learned a lot during my time there, they have awesome benefits in terms of retirement, insurance, paid time off/holidays and such but in the end it doesn't make up for how the organization as a whole treats its employee base. Hopefully the acquisition brings some improvements to the culture.Monsanto is a great place to work if you're seeking to define your career.  The benefits are good and seemingly tailored for families.  The recent flux by restructuring is unfortunate, and it leaves a lot to be desired with job security.  It seems to happen on an annual basis, too.  However, you're free to pursue self-education during your career development and complete your goals by the means you see fit.  You also must excel performing in ambiguous situations and reading conversations.Management is hit-or-miss.  Some managers are excellent while others are less than excellent.  It really depends on who you get.Monsanto is a great place to work, great benefits and safety on and off the job. The only thing is that management will change very often and setting goals was stressfull besides your work you need to do presentations and be involved in committees within the company, they do many trainings in different topics sometimes it's overwhelming.A hands-on working environment offering great experience with quality plant management skills.  Always safety focused with a deep concern for pest management as well as we managed workflows from various growth chambers and greenhouses.Built on observational skills pertaining to plant health.  Time management and communication were a must in managing daily, weekly, and monthly tasks for complex work flows concerning regulated transgenic material.It was a slow day most days, but a good employee will find the job very rewarding regarding benefits and people. There was not alot of work to do in my particular position, but the work I did do, kept the business running. A typical day was just paying any bills that came in the mail and greeting people that came in. Most of the time I was alone due to the other employees working outside of the facility, but most of the time it didn't bother me. I was able to get my work done without much interruption. The environment was very friendly and welcoming. The bosses were very lenient and allowed a lot of leeway when it came to needs outside the office.lots of reorganization and downsizing in progress, lack of consistency between team leads, mgmt has no idea of the reality going on down in the trenches, a lot of good people have left - own their own or with all the layoffs.Evergreen industry requiring constant changes in processes. Role changes every 2-4 years. Diverse environment. Great benefits and holiday calendar. Corporate discounts with various organizations/businesses.Coworkers are in the older crowedYou get exposed to several areas and learnYou have the chance to work in different areas of the companyManagers help you grow professionallyLocation is not greatGreat benefitsGreat vacation timeYou get the chance to interact with several locations around the worldNot all Monsanto plants are the same or do the same work. However, the benefits package & insurance are a definite plus.It is better to work for them in a management or internship rather than basic blue collar. My experience with Monsanto for the first 16 plus years was pretty good. The changes in staff, management, & arrangements with the technology with & for security for the area I am specifically located has hindered more than helped.Great culture and people are passionate about what they do. Benefits are great and great work life balance. People are friendly and very welcomingMonsanto is very active in creating a work culture that is inclusive and progressive. Compensations and work benefits are excellentGood benefits and experience.  Seems to have taken a recent down turn.  Company is managed by Dilbert like people and can be hard to get anything done.Left a great company cause of all the great things ive heard about culture at monsanto, since ive arrived ive seen massive layoffs because of not meeting eps guidance.  IT transformation has been a joke, layoff all competent americans and outsource everything to india so if you rely on IT to succeed youre already set up to fail, IT there is a joke.  Tons of budget cuts cant even get lunches for meetings anymore.  But by far the biggest disappointment is the lousy CEO hugh grant, he passed up the acquisition of syngenta cause hes gutless and then that started a massive industry consolidation.  Syngenta was then bought by chem china and dow and dupont merged and now monsantos getting acquired by foreign german co bayer.  Itll be like inbev all over again, already seeing tons of people leaving and retiring because of it, only reason to stay anymore is if youve worked here too long and have to wait for the package.  I feel bad for new workers coming here now, do your research people.Monsanto is a vibrant facility with a knowledgeable core group of employees who work together to achieve overall satisfaction for the company and business end users. I enjoy the relaxed environment and learning different application functions that help customer's business thrive. The hardest parts of my day are the meetings, but knowing I have a core group I can depend on, I get through my days with a breeze.As an contractor you do not get all the Full time employee benefits, but the day to day life is great. Management mostly treats you as an employee not just a temp. Some of the most compassionate individual I have ever met.Encourage personal development, which is good. Good at innovationChange fastSome management is poorHardworking employeeThe Senior Chemist position at Monsanto consisted of primarily short term problems and mini-projects closely associated with various aspects of dicamba process development and some marketed product support for other products.  Because of the short term nature of the assignments the opportunity for significant contributions, meaningful work experience, learning,  and professional growth was quite limited. This may have more to do with the position being a temporary contract assignment than anything else, but even so for the type of work Monsanto wanted and the manner in which they managed it they would have done just as well to engage a junior chemist.  Lower level management was talented and easy to work with, but they lacked the necessary experience in chemical process development to make sound assessments and correctly management development and manufacturing risk.  Higher level management had little or no commitment to chemistry and inadequate understanding of the company's risk exposure.  Although Monsanto's management and cultural shortcomings were a source of continuing frustration, the culture was very congenial and the work itself--laboratory chemical process development--was enjoyable.Work long 10+ hour days, in which i was in charge of making managerial decisions in a high work flow environment.  Large part of my shift was spent ""putting out fires"" from the previous work group.  Lots of young people to work with (20-35 age group), high demand for workers because of the high turnover rate from 2nd and 3rd shift employees.  The best part about working in this company was the ability to work with cutting edge genetic technology, the worst part was the office politics.Worked there in research for Monsanto for 12 years until it closed in 1992 making chemotherapy drugs military contracts for the navy and air force. Plastics, herbicides."
441,Morgan Stanley,"First big job out of college.  Thought is was my dream job, however, found out it is pretty cut throat within the office and very high stress.  Was a good learning experience for me, just wasn't for me as a career.Work consumed your personal life. Constant pressure from management teams to push products that weren't right for the client. You're salary would decrease as your production increased unless you were apart of a ""larger team"". The Management teams were only willing to support advisors when it benefited them for their quarterly bonus. Management was very political in regards to helping certain individuals succeed in the organization. They promote and sell a training program with coaches that had little to no experience whatsoever. In my opinion was a waste of time and money. Can not stress the negative taste I received from the local management team.Typical Day of Work is quite intense. Requires you to use your intellectual abilities and most roles require you to work in collaboration with others. I've learned many different things but due to the focused nature of each role at such a large firm it is probably less than you would encounter at a smaller financial firm.Management is very focused and goal oriented. Generally a good amount of focus is placed on leadership.Coworkers are intelligent and personable. Occasionally, some make it into the firm due to relations with management, however those are fewer now then before.Pay was reasonable, however for such a large firm that has had continued success due to it's people, not enough is paid in comparison to other firms.Working here all depends on your manager and your department. It can vastly vary from one team to the next. You can have a manager that's flexible with work/life and others that are very rigid. I personally think the compensation is not aligned across the board properly and hasn't recovered since the 2008 crash. It claims to be a total reward company yet above base compensation can vary greatly from one year to the next leaving you to be under compensated. Base salaries need an adjustment. How can new associates make the same as veteran officers at the firm.I typically worked eight or nine hours a day.  I learned many things about prime brokerage, and the financial services industry as a whole.  I also learned a lot about operations in general.  Morgan Stanley is a great company because it gives you many opportunities that other firms do not, such as being able to interact freely with upper management (VPs and above).  Middle managers are not that great.  It appears that they may be sandwiched, or pulled in too many directions, and therefore lack focus.  The hardest part of the job is the turnover / attrition.  The most enjoyable part of the job is processing / production, as it does not carry over into the next day.MS has good points and bad points. In the last couple of years they haven't really compensated their employees well. A good point is MS is all about community involvement and volunteering. They dedicated 2 months to giving back and encourages every employee to participate.The CAC is where I work and have worked from day one. The culture /moral is poor. Management is unwilling to listen or support anyone but their own. They will even block anyone from moving to another dept. The pay is reasonable until you want a pay increase. They will say no raises department wide and then give them to management.A typical day  at work can be starting off with a case load of 4 patients and  having to discharge 2-4 and  ending up with all new patient. Management can be helpful at times on a floor level. MY coworkers are my second family. we work together as a team to get the work done in a timely and effective manner. The hardest part of this job at time is working under short staff. The most rewarding part of this job is having to go home  and knowing that i gave it all my best and i actually made a difference in my patient's lives.The business culture did not meet my high standard of work ethics.  Lack of transparency.  There was an extreme lack of communication between staff and management.  When tax reporting issues came up that would result in clients being audited, my concern were left ignored.The work life balance is the best out of any company I've ever worked for! MS really cares that you're able to have a life outside of work. The compensation was okay, but the benefits were great. Management has an open door policy and they take great pride in that. The job culture was wonderful and diverse...leaving so many people to learn from.review daily mismatch report, training offshore team in Guadalajarareporting of CMO securitized items to FINRA.  Daily communication makes work easier and productiveManagement allowed me to work independentlyNothing too hard with proper training.Enjoying my co-workers and being able to help each otherGreat place to work.  Salary and Benefits were also Great. I got alone with my co-workers and helped to meet Company goals and objectives. Enjoyable part of the job was, I never did the same thing everyday. Many assigned tasks were different everyday and a great challenge to meet them. I was disappointed and sad when the Company got out of the Defined Contribution Business.Very supportive management however compensation could be better and ever since they went to the branch complex model, opportunities for advancement are limited.Management has total lack of regard for leadership staff development and recognition. No true track of productivity or path for advancement.Speaking from a Registered Associate (CSA) role, the firm and the branch I worked in valued the employees.  The managers, compliance, operations and reception staff were very respectful and trusted you until you couldn't be trusted. The hardest part of the job was getting accustomed to constant changes in operations and things beyond one's control (i.e. market fluctuation, handling multiple client requests) and the most enjoyable is fulfilling a client's request with ease, having assistance from the managers when you really need it. It's vital that the CSA has a good working ""chemistry"" with their FA's, it makes all the difference especially during stressful times as in any relationship.The management needed to be changed.  They hire you as a temp with no benefits such as holiday pay, sick leave or vacation.  There is no given time frame as to how long you will be on temp status.Very easy to get stuck within a team. Bonuses and raises are becoming less frequent. It is a good place to get some good experience to put on your resume as a young person.The firm is acutely focused on keeping headcount low and budgets thin. The firm provides some nice benefits that come with a big company, but is not competitive with non-bank financial institutions.Compensation is great how ever leadership and management needs to be more diverse. and FAA could use more guidance.. instead of just throwing you out there to fend for your selfNice and friendly staffRight in the middle of midtown Manhattanfast paced work environment Great work ethicsGreat management staff great compensationPeople are nice and understanding and accommodating of any personal issues. Good infrastructure and nice place to work"
406,MWH,"Very good co-workers and all worked as a team. Management would always keep us informed about how the company was doing. Each day was fun and wanted to come to work.Professional and exciting work environment! Recommend this company for all career levels. This company does not disappoint.good overall atmosphere friendly work environment allot of good people and great leadership. Its a little hard adjusting at first but once you work here for a while is all good.Exposure to world renowned projects, but career growth and compensation is very slow for the bottom level. Company wants top talent but does not want to pay for it.  Promotional raises are the equivalent of a standard annual review raise.Razor thin business margins, no strategic vision and investment in future direction of company.  Business limited to a handful of clients.Enjoyable work place and co-workers. Hardest part of the job was when projects are slow. I am used to working multiple jobs at once.Enjoyed working with my co-workers, and worked well as a team.Hardest part is when the job comes to a close. The days went by quickly. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing it completed.Since this position was a contract the company was required to comply with evaluations of their client. MWH was cooperative with client when a personality conflict arose between client employees and MWH employee. Not at all helpful to work towards resolution of issue.Boys club with not a lot of room to move around. Company only cares about bottom line and people who directly work with clients.Company would re-organize every couple of years. Management did not share a clear view of the future.  Not very innovative.I had a great work experience at MWH where I used my knowledge as an Engineer and applied it to Projects. Great team efforts and it was enjoyable experience...Overall a good company. There is a lack of management at times and the older folks don't give the new folks to rise. You need to know the right people to move up.One of the most influential and meaningful job experiences of my life. My colleagues were competent professionals, always seeking to complete projects to their fullest capabilities.Interesting company with good employees and international diversity.In the document service department at MWH, it was a fast paced work environment that I enjoyed working in. I enjoyed the day to day interaction with the clients. What I learned most from MWH was that not only providing quality work was important, but having and displaying excellent customer service skills are a must and the backbone to a successful company.I got an opportunity to learn quite a bit about Compliance.  I also got experience Recruiting Engineers which was very interesting.A typical day at MWH for me was walking around the entire building asking my co-workers if they need any help weather it be scanning, copying, or filing. I learned to be more open to responsibility and meeting new people. The people I worked with were fantastic! I could ask questions without the fear of looking silly. Everyone could be fun when they wanted to be but they are also very dedicated to their job. The hardest part of the job was trying to juggle all the tasks I was given in one day, but throughout the day I could get it done. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able not only to talk with my co-workers but being able to connect with them. Also being able to have a regular conversation not always being about work, but sports, news and media, at appropriate times, of course.Strong safety culture. A typical day was composed of interaction with the subcontractors, safety walks and reports, toolbox talks, various other safety related paperwork.Great Company but after I fulfilled my contract I returned home for required surgery.Worked your solid 8, sometimes had to work more than 40hrs a week, great people, but always layoff people once a year after reorg. Some engineers are overworked, meaning that they charge their 40hrs to a project then have to work on business pursuits after.Best company to work for wages. people etc.The Management is excellent, the pay and benefits are in range"
521,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,"Working at NASA GSFC has allowed me to fully understand STEAM learning in the United States working alongside some of the most innovative and hard working individuals. As a team, we've recently started to break the glass ceiling of implementing arts within the STEM work environment, learning every step of the way. Combined, the arts and STEM can help to engage more US learners and help our economy grow.Good workplace environment for longterm employment. Good place for internal organizational job changes. Management varies depending on the organization you support. Co-workers can either be team players or non-team players. It depends on your organization. Hardest part of the job is figuring out what management's expectations from day to day. Working for the federal government was an enjoyable employment opportunity.Coming to work everyday at NASA is never a stressfull day. People are very professional and work oriented. Working with people of high caliber made me do my best at all time. We have a saying at our work place,"" Failure is not an option"".and I always keep that in my mind. Management is great. Supports EOE,treat everybody with great respect. We have a diverst co-workers that is fun to work with. It is a mix of people of different backgrounds and cultures that made NASA what is now.I interned in the Finance Department at NASA Ames Research Center the summer before my senior year of high school. Having been my first internship and exposure to a real work environment, NASA taught me a lot and influenced the career path I have taken. A typical day at work began around 9 AM, ending at 3 PM. I learned Ames' internal control procedures for accounting and analyzed financial statements for accordance with NASA's Continuous Monitoring Program. My co-workers were friendly and were happy to assist me with whatever issue I encountered. The hardest part of the job was familiarizing myself with government accounting protocols, as it was my first exposure to the field. The most enjoyable part of the job was having access to recreational facilities during my break times, such as the basketball court and the gym.A typical day at NASA was very relaxing and hard working. During my time at NASA I learned how to create a phasing plan, communicate with others from different departments, and lastly I learned how to manage multiple financial accounts. My co-workers were very patient and straight forward with the task at hand, they were friendly and very hard working. The toughest part of my job that I had to overcome was having to complete a full financial report before a given deadline. The best part of my job was that I had the opportunity to work for NASA and the fact that I got the chance to work and live in Florida for three months.NASA is in the news every day for absolutely awesome accomplishments.  As Senior Organization Development Consultant and executive coach at Headquarters, I get to guide leaders as they build environments that foster such success.Typical days may include working on space hardware, research aircraft, exact models, to testing in wind tunnels, You learn to accept additional responsibliities, work to completion deadlines, deal with scientists, reseqrchers, contractors, vemdors and researchers as well as management and other technical staff. hardest days mat require to climd 28 flights of stairs outside in all weather condtions to complete testing of experiments The most rewarding is watching test complete sucessful, models so exact they become standards for future projectsFirst Rated place to work with unlimited benefits and opportunities.  Excellent working environment.  This is all for nonw.A typical day at work would range from watching the Shuttle land to stocking office supplies. Working with a wide range of people...astronauts to NASA nerds. Hardest part of the jobs was ensuring & training new or changing procedures to staff. Change management was a constantI was given the opportunity to learn cutting edge technology before it was introduced to the public. The staff and management were always there to help.NASA once was a place to work where brilliant ideas met hard work in order to achieve the impossible.  Those days are long gone.  Mostly due to budget cuts over the decades.One of the more disappointing aspects of working for NASA is the lack of job security  Due to repeating term hires, you can be let go after investing too many of your earning / research years.  The only individuals who are protected, are managers.  If I could go back in time, personally I would have not accepted a position at NASA, and instead pursued a career with DoD or DoE.Working for NASA was a rewarding experience in that I got a chance to see what the environment was like there, as well as a look into the levels of government security, types of technology, and main objectives of the Armstrong team.  The most enjoyable part was interacting with quite a few very pleasant individuals at various levels of command.  The hardest part of the job was meeting the ever present increasing demands for productivity while facing obstacles such as customer availability, and seriously corrupted systems.  Overall we managed to meet the overall goals of the contract.I really loved this job.  Management was wonderful and the staff was wonderful as well.  My co workers were wonderful.  They really cared about each other and they helped one another any way they could.Great place to work. Family Orientated environment. My day was busy, learned something new each day in regards to customer relations and support of my group. Management was understand a not difficult to work with.  I supported a great group of guys and we worked together as a team. I can not say that I remember any hard times unless it was trying to meet a deadline that was short.Planning events and helping all of the wonderful groups in the building. I truly enjoyed working at NASA, plus it is only 5 minutes from home.Excellent work/life balance, average pay and benefits, no bonus, no profit sharing, management seems not appreciate your hard and quality work.The project was not that easy to build, wire, test and rebuild. There was 15 member to work in the project and found/solve the problem. The management of the team was not really good because some people want to work in their own which is not a team work idea. People lame each other about not doing anything or do work in their own without referring to the design drawn. The hardest part of the work was when we have to rebuild and rewire the whole robot because of some mistake people did. Rewiring was because some of the electrical component was old and did destroyed.The daily work changed from day to day, keeping things from getting tedious. People were friendly and interested in their work, and willing to listen to ideas no matter who had them. This feeling of inclusion and importance, combined with a air of mutual respect regardless of position, helped keep even the hardest work from being frustrating and boring. I learned new things every day I was there, and even the worst day there was better than the best day at some places I've been.NSSC in Bay St Louis is a great place to work.  Friendly people and helpful Management.  Lot of training opportunities and the NSSC promotes from within first which is a plus.Amenities such as Post Office, Day Care, Cafeteria, and Mini Mart.I felt very welcomed. Being an intern at NASA helped me obtain great technical and soft skills. A typical work day is coming in to work saying good morning to everyone I see. While also meeting with my managers and supervisors and completing the worked that has been assigned to me for the day. While working I'm learning and experience what the do's and dont's are in a professional environment. I'm learning so much in so many different fields of work at NASA. NASA has helped me to become very proficient with the Microsoft office. The hardest part about the job was learning how to use Microsoft Excel. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to be in a flexible position to where i can work with many departments and deal with more than one type of work duties.I enjoyed my work its variety and for the most part the folks I worked with and the challenges they regularly place before me. I was encouraged by my NASA management to mentor younger individuals and was actively involved with our documentation deliverable s.pros:plenty of tech fairs and talks by leading scientists and researchersairshows and daily fighter jets roaring over youlunch yummost sites open to visitknowledgeable technical managers and employeescons:takes too long to get equipment (legal and HR department bureaucracy and power dynamics)restricting budget makes many projects fall short, especially for interns"

Management was fair and worked towards continuous development of their employees.Given plenty of empowerment within the company, thought the performance appraisal process is flawed.  Also not enough involvement from upper managementnever seem to get to what you planned on, daily challenges to find answers and better processes, fun people to work with, plenty of coffee, on site cafeteriaA great place to work and wonderful working conditions. I learned a lot about security and obtained a number of certificates. The hardest part of job was the hours worked.very little interaction with senior mgmt., uncertain of job or career path. Do best to make co worker feel positive and they are serving a purposeLike most large organizations, National Grid balances their business needs (keeping the power on) with their need to prepare for the future.  As a company, they have many of the same challenges that every other organization has - not enough resources to get everything accomplished but the commitment of the employees is outstanding for the majority.  In crisis - storms, power outages, there is none better.This is a company where you can excel at many career paths as long as you take the ownership to improve your skills attitudes and beliefs.Expect the Best!An okay atmosphere for work, great people, but little compensation for workers. Involves long hours of receiving calls from customers. Job is great as you interact with customers of all types, some very angry, others just need help. A good and calm temperament is requiredExcellent place to work. Safety and reliability are alway number one. Spent 26 years with this great company where I learned so much about the electrical industry.Taking incoming calls, setting up dates for service to be turned on or off depending. Assisting customers explaining the breakdown of their account. Coworkers were alright. Training was very informative. Hardest part was reading the meter cards.National Grid is a good company to work for that provides employees with a good work to life balance. The compensation and benefits are on par with other large organization and management staff is easy to work with.Managers are really helpful and informative. Plenty of technical training and the benefits are very good. Plenty of on the job experience and an outstanding opportunity for growth.Wonderful environment. Call center and employee services and benefits resolution. Many levels of human resources.  Corporate support and training.  Would have loved to have stayed in the TDC.Decent company to work for. Reorganization reduced management workforce by 20%. Corporate politics can be frustrating at times but overall good company."
371,National Opinion Research Center (NORC),"Its a good job but it can be very boring at times. You have to complete a lot of things to basically complete your task. You repeat yourself ALOT!! NOT ENOUGH HRS OR ENOUGH PAY FOT WHAT WE GO THROUGH ON THE PHONES.In the trainings they concentrate on telling you what you should not do and punishments if you do.Regional supervisors have a reputation for being mean and most of the team managers micromanage and nickel and dime every single expense, mileage and production time.You can tell that's the way they have been trained.If you complain they just fire you and blacklist you.I love my job but this company is HORRIBLE. They condone workplace harassment and do nothing to rid the place of it. Stuff gets stolen left and right- food, cell phones, personal belongings. Most of the supervisors don't know nothing and buttkiss and blame the ti's always!! They DONT COMMUNICATE AT ALL and everyday there's a problem with something because the lack of communication!! Raises are hilarious and they only promote those who they can take advantage of or if they like you and dont speak up against wrong doings. They outkast you if you have a brain and know your rights. They love to fire pregnant women and threaten your job even if you have written notice from a doctor. The morality and ethical treatment is hilarious and because they have NONE!!!!!! And I'm pretty sure if the contractors that hire them knew how they treat their employees they would DEFINITELY FIND SOMEONE ELSE!!!!!!! The job itself awesome!! Sit down and talk and the phone all day! Easy! I've made a few good friend in thankful for (only reason they got the 3 stars) But this company DEFINITELY NEEDS to reevaluate the way they treat you!!!!!!!! Ex. They recently promoted a perverted man who makes A LOT of women uncomfortable and NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE!!!!!!!! Even with NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS!!!!! And supervisors telling this man to stop...... Lawsuit waiting to happen..... And since they are relocating now they are downsizing yet still hiring!!?????? See???? No one knows nothing and they're not letting anyone know what's going on.... No consideration at all for the employees. People have kids, bills.One of thet largest research firm in the Country.  This company is known for providing the best care for its employees.company requirements-very attractive-require employees to  treat respondents with dignity and respect-something that is certainly lacking in the work force today.The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the respondents-always learned something while in their presence.  The hardest part was when I had to leave many of the respondents  and move on to another assignment.I have no comment about the CEO of the company, considering I don't know him to state an approval or disapproval-I have selected No only because I want to exit this page.I usually come in at 9:00 am speak to several different households through out the country to determine whether they are eligible for the National Immunization Survey.  Its take about 20 to 25 minutes to complete a single interview. I collect important data from respondants so that the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, state and local health bureaus can allocate funding in areas where they are needed. Hardest part of job is building a rapport with a respondant within the first 30 seconds of the call. The management and coworkers at NORC are very nice, polite, and helpful. The most enjoyable part of the day is quitting time.They tell us we are not doing telemarketing, but however you look at it, it is telemarketing.  We are trying to make people conduct a survey against their will and no matter how many times they tell us ""no"" we continue to call them back. I try not to complain because a job is a job, but they are ridiculous.great company pays well! Management is very supportive. Best company I've ever worked forThis is a great atmosphere to work in but very strict policies on attendance and in job decorum.I worked in the TSSO department. It is essentially a big call center to collect information on behalf of government agencies. It is run like a sweat shop. There is an incredible amount of micromanagement. You have to clock to break when you step away from your station even to use the bathroom. You cannot talk to the person next to you. You cannot eat while working. You are expected to work as fast as humanly possible all the time, and statistics are taken to measure your ""production"" There is no job security and HIGH job turnover. About the bottom %10 is fired and replaced monthly. They don't want you to think. They want robots.For me this place thee pits!! I took it as a means to generate some income after being unemployed for some time but after being there for a short time I knew my time there was coming to an end. I worked as a professional telephone interviewer for minimum wage, most people you call don't want to be bothered and others can be nasty and mean. There are production goals so you have to do somewhat well and also reading verbatim is crucial. Attendance is what can get you axed but they have a system where you create your schedule and trade hours, so it is possible to pick up more hours. Some people from management are nice, but the rest seem to be angry about life! Team leads walk the call center floor to watch you which made me feel uncomfortable - you can't read anything besides your own notes and no phones are allowed on the floor-of course people do. You get 6 minutes for every hour worked and there is 4 hour shift requirement. Minimum of 16 hours for each work week is required. Not much time to do anything considering it is on the 14th and 16th floor, and it takes like 3 minutes to get to the lower level in the elevator to get food/drink.Bottom line, if you are a student and need a flexible work schedule, then this is it. If you are looking for second job, this could work.There are other opportunities for you to do other things within the company, most still require for you to be on the phone.The promises in the ads NORC puts out sure knows how to reel you in. The big problem though is that this company falls very short on the delivery. I wouldn't take their ad for face value, if you know what I mean.Don't expect much in the salary department. Their ""competitive pay"" is merely fancy wording for minimum wage. The environment is very controlled indeed, they put all of their energy in the wrong place. It seems as if management goes out of their way to see if you're committing any office crime, such as forgetting to punch time, barely overshooting on breaks or working a little too loudly(whatever that means.)Speaking of management, they are a most conflicting bunch. It seems as though the different levels of management don't communicate with each other as well as they probably should. They do not make their guidelines for call production crystal clear. In fact, it sometimes seems as if their guidelines change on any given day. As a clerk, that makes it pretty difficult to know how to do your job, know when you're on top and when you're falling flat. They do offer the chance to have a 1-on-1 sit down to go over your stats. Unfortunately that turns out to be quite unproductive, as the person you meet with usually has no idea about the role of a production clerk, meaning they can't offer much in the way of advice or answer most questions you might have.As for the actual work itself, in my opinion things can get a little tedious. There is little variety in regard to the kinds of tasks you perform; you're either on the phone, on the computer, or both. On the off-chance  more... that there is another type of task available, you can pretty much forget about being considered for it if they already have you working the phones. Plus, I really didn't see many chances for true advancement during my time there. They only seemed to offer a handful of temporary projects, and once completed, it's right back to square one.On the upside, alot of the other employees there are pretty pleasant, scheduling is quite flexible, and NORC really does have a great, easily accessible location. Just wanted to say that this was not intended as a bashing rant, so I hope it wasn't taken as such. I just wanted to try to paint a very honest picture about what kind of company this is so people would really know what they were walking into if considering employment here.  lessI worked as a field interviewer. My main duties included planning and making trips into the field and/or telephoning respondents from my home office. Initial contact with respondents was with a cold visit or cold phone call; then explaining the study, persuading respondents to participate, and conducting the interview according to protocol. Also had to follow up (either in person or by phone) with respondents who had made appointments to be interviewed, or prompt and persuade resistant respondents to participate.My direct supervisor (field manager) was very easy to work with and very helpful and supportive.Being a field interviewer in not difficult, but one must be very organized and a self-starter, since you are working independently out of your home office. You also must not be shy about making a cold call or visit; and must be articulate enough to explain the study and why a respondent should participate in it.For me, the least enjoyable part of the job--which I didn't have to do too often--was doing occasional in-person visits with another field interviewer. I'd rather work independently than to have to put up with another field interviewer's quirks.Most enjoyable aspects: working out of my home independently, being able to by and large set my own schedule, doing a variety of tasks, and doing in-person interviewing in different areas of the region where I live.For one thing these are temporary jobs not permanent. They dock you for any bathroom time over 6 minutes. I never heard of such a thing the wages are minumum and you are expected to reach a quota this is more like a sweatshop than a job. Run away from this place it not worth it.Like the office setting, not loud and friendly coworkers. I like the ability of working for different government agencies and handling different tasks like data entry and telephone interviewing and clerical tasks.Sat at a computer cold calling individuals to complete the National Immunization Survey on behalf of the CDC."
707,NAVTEQ,"Pleasant group of developers to work with.Management was kind and considerate.Leads were eager to teach what they knew.Leads sometimes were open to new ideas. CEO transitioned from founder to lawyer - uh oh!Navteq provides an individual the opportunity to experience and learn in an ever increasing demand for up to date maps pertaining to GPS systems. It affords people the chance to work in a IT driven, multicultural environment. Navteq offers the chance to work within databases, learn brand new software, while maintaining a work friendly environment. The best part of the job, the experience you will learn from working with new technology and the training offered. The pros and cons like many organizations are the people you work with. Navteq has a great number of amazing individuals who make working for this company a pleasure most of the time. The negative benefits being: the lack of advancement and communication with the management teams which is the significant factor one should consider before looking for work with such a company.Healthy working environment, Good compensation compare to market, very helpful peers. Management has no idea of technical ground but helpful. I worked as consultant but received friendly treatment. No complainsThe company became more disorganized and poorly managed as it grew and got sold back and forth. The people I worked with directly were amazing. The job itself was a good job. It was fun and served an important purpose. Without working here I would not have been able to gain valuable experience to help me in my career path.Good corporate culture and work amenities. C Level Management are top notch. Great advancement within but parent company's market share erosion depleted the moraleit is very good company to workAll cutting edge technologies are used here Management is okaygood peopleHardest part of job is production supportmost enjoyable part of the job is every day Work hard and play hard type of culture.  This was the first job out of undergrad and it was a perfect fit for me.  I moved to a field office in Little Rock, Arkansas to work with one other colleague.  Lots of travel opportunities within the state, country, and international as well.Following all new construction across western Illinois and northern Missouri is a task in itself, followed by field data collection to implement quarterly database upgrades. Creating new products in the navigation industry was a challenge, as our company continued to grow and lead in many navigational aspects across the globe. Travel could be long in duration at times, but I remain readily available to complete all company goals and objectives. I value all contributions and relationships from co-workers across the US, Mexico and Europe during the creation of project specific builds.A typical day working at Navteq/Nokia requires extensive communication between internal and external departments involving database closure windows, project management, planning with project managers, field teams, vendors, and Overseas Production Centers (OPC's). Navteq affords a laid back approach from the traditional standards of 8-5 by allowing employee's to dictate their own work schedule with some exceptions. If I've learned anything through my experience within this company. It is the chance to have been given responsibility over managing multiple projects/teams and how to handle ever changing situations. I was fortunate in working with many fine men and women throughout my years at this company. If I have any negative things to say about this company, it is simply to state that those that truly strive to make this company the best in the market, often times are overshadowed, or tasked with too much responsibility and low wages for the work involved.my typical day consist of making route preparations and all travel arrangements for upcoming trips for our dept.  Travel to different parts of the world collect GPS data for traffic dept. We mostly work by ourselves from home when not traveling.

519,NBTY,"The employees didn't help as often. Some of the employers were self motivated in getting a group effort job done. But overall I enjoyed working for the company I'm a self starter so even though I didn't get as much help as I was suppose to there were other individuals on different lines that did come help outGreat place to work,learned very quick most of the jobs on the packaging floor.Only problem is the hiring process.I literally have 2 supervisors pushing to get me hired because i already know almost every position and am just a great worker overall but still nothing.Not to mention alot of perm employees limit themselves to one position.This is a company with a lot of potential but due to unfit senior Mgt the company has gone downhill for some time. Unlikely that the brands will get back to their old glory anytime soon with current leadership team.NBTY has not only been a place of work it has been my second home. The experienced and knowledge acquired in in the years working for NBTY is incredible. Definitely a great place to work!Management plays a huge role in an associate not being able to balance work and home.  Very stressful and demanding.  Limited resources for the associates to do the task at hand.  Outdated equipment with difficulty retaining parts.  Limited amount of staff to complete projects as scheduled.I really never knew what I was going into on any day.  I've learned various differences between pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals which were very interesting to me.The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the associates and getting to know them on a more personal level.  I've always had a hands on in all that I do.  I can personally relate to the typical associate because I started my career the same way.Is a nice place to work, good enviroment and clean. People are friendly. The job is easy and the management care about associates. Its a safety place to work.NBTY was a great company to work for a few years ago. It was full of optimism, creativity and growth. Typical day was productive and efficient. It is best suited for recent graduates or entry level positions looking to get your feet wet. It now has become top heavy by made up CO positions and they keep trying to reinvent the wheel making all parts of the company work less efficiently and productively. I truly did love this company and was happy to go there. Now myself and coworkers dread each day that goes by and the company continues to drag us down. There is so much speculation that the company is going to be sold and slowly the brands are breaking down. Who knows what the future holds for this company but as of right now it is incredibly unstable. I wish there was better outlook but I have yet to see a positive change.I have worked for this company for 8 years. I have done lots of things. It is a bit crazy at  times where you do not know what is going ot hit you from one day to the nextin  my years at nbty I learned a lot I can run a line set up the line and also take lead of that line. my co workers respected  me when I was lead.. shift change over was very hard had to get ready for my own shiftvery unhealthy working enviorment the job status is not very secure constantly switching departments not to many workers in each departmentA typical day at work consist of me going into a morning meeting, then going into the office and releasing products or evaluating products.Good company good hours, my coworkers show a lot of teamwork . I learned how to run the machine, how to read work orders  I think is a great company  good benefits  and  and I'm looking for something to match itbest company to work, professional management, international acclaimed company,diversity of products - vitamins, minerals, herbs,supplements.good working environment. moderated benefitsManagement can try to keep a better eye on the supervisors for those of who are not favored cause the threats are getting a little old.I've been trained in sop's, Gmp's, and  Oshawa certified for sit down, stand up, and PE lifts, nice environment to work good coworkers and great management teamWas a great job 10 years agoHas gotten worse after new investment firm came in and took over Every building was different on how good it was or wasn't to work inAfter the sale of one of their main buildings there is no sure thing there. people are giving added responsablities without any promotion or pay raise. Not so bad except some of them are forced into managemnet roles, but kept as regular workers. Mandatory can be called at the end of shift the day before, giving you very little notice to change plans. There is a lot of internal fighting going on.Good place to work; recommended, you ll have a lot of fun there, I think is a good experience that will help you to develop new skills.Hard working, enjoyableCommunicate well with public & employeeesI was very punctual & always willing to work on call. Employee of the monthEnjoyed working as a three man team. The hardest part of the job is continuously monitoring equipment throughout day with minimal downtime. Enjoyable part of the job was making improvments.Not a good place to work. Management is very poor. They tell you lies and false promises. They have a lot of temp people. They tell temp people they going to make them permanent and they don't. They like to use people. Many people have quit. Management has bad communication with its employees. They have had many great people work there but they end up leaving for better jobs. If you have experience this is not the place for you. There is much better out there."
731,NCR Corporation,"Worked with banking, insurance and retail major accounts located in northeast USA. Responsible for ensuring that contracted technical services and support were being delivered efficiently and profitability.Worldwide vendor support experience.  A nice place to work and learn about technology.  Limited benefits and a bonus program if the company/division/group makes the revenue numbers.Great team, very independent.  I was given a cell phone and access to applications I could learn to plan out each an every day from early morning and throughout the day.  Open and Close each call before going to and from site.  Access to tutorials and parts ordering.Great job. You apply  and incorporate  vast amount of skills and knowledge learned from training and experience on the job that can be applied in various occupations.Local Employees were great. Worked well with each other to solve problems in a trying job.Local. management did all possible to assist employeesthis is a very nice job. I've learned a lot working from this establishment. I've learned what it takes to build a register and more. it's a lot to it but its very simple.Very bad medical insurance. The salaries are less at least 30% less than in industry. Management doesn't keep its word.Responsible for cross-selling solution offerings to current NCR customers and driving new Managed Serviced opportunities.Recognized the customer’s key challengers in their business operations and identify products and solutions to the customer’s area of needWork for NCR is a very intense experience. The job is very cool, fixing ATMs is not a common thing that everyone do. The only drawback is that most of the times have to work long hours and is based on rotation which means that you will loose a lot of nights, weekends and most of holidays.Always putting out fires....  Lots of travel .  The BS to money ratio is Disproportionate at best . I toughed out three years and can take no more . I want to advance in the company unfortunately there is no chance of that .Fun place to work, friendly clean environment,  good supervisors they would help out most of there employees.  I worked for there temp services.Good place to work with good co-workers, good pay, recognized for work done. Good vacation benefits and health care benefits. Rewarding to see projects achieved.The management at NCR seem to base advancement more on popularity then on job performance. I base this on the fact that of a 3 year career with the company I received only two job reviews both were outstanding but when I tried to seek advancement I was informed that I wasn't up to standard something that wasn't shown in any review or brought to my knowledge previously.A typical day at work could be challenging as a new employee.  Not knowing the protocol or the correct department to contact for assistance.  I learned how to be persistent and not give up.  The hardest part of the job was learning the cross functional teams I needed to interact with.  Co-workers were great. The most enjoyable part was the global interaction with various teams and getting a project completed for our customers.NCR was a great place to work in the beginning; we had lots of social activities, community involvements, and morel building activities.  Also, opportunities to advance and available educational web site to assist with furthering your career.  Then once a new CEO was named, everything began to change, which 80 percent of the office staff was laid off and the work was out sourced.your going to work hard and clean and have to be able to manage time wisely and will have to bust your butt to be seen by the higher ups for recognition for a promotion or moving up in the companyI worked for NCR from 2006-2008.My job is repairing the ATM for banks in Memphis and surround area. I gain a lot of experience from this job. I had to mange all the calls from the customers and arrange the time to have the job done in effective manner. This job gives me a opportunity to see many people.Horrible work life,  balance, no compensation, work every weekend and nights, total disregard or respect for family and health, no appreciationNo advancement, unless you are part of the click or related, if you are not, there is no place for you at this company. Overloaded with work and under paid for the amount of work.Technology is always changing, and as it changes there is always something new to learn. In this company, I am always learning something new, and becoming more proficient at troubleshooting anything I come in contact with. This company, and the experience that it provides me on a daily basis has given me the confidence to troubleshoot things that I have never even seen before with accuracy. This is a fast paced career, with a teamwork we provide service to more retail and financial institutions than any other company in the United States. The hardest part of this job is the amount of time that you spend at work on a regular basis, although it pays off through time as you build a name for yourself in the company. The most enjoyable part of this job is coming up to any NCR machine/unit figuring out what is going wrong, and being able to fix it on the spot to keep our customers up and running at all times.Use to be a fun place to work, such a somber environment, use to care about the employees, now want to line their pockets with the knowledge that we have provided."
378,NCSA Athletic Recruiting,"But for many it can be a great place to start. I wouldnt go there from another job though. The pay is low but the job is pleasant and the culture is goodMisleading job. I learned that it is a call center to recruit kids into using tools with little to no direction. Monitored through a microscope with Talk time counter, number of calls, and meetings set. Hardest part of the job was getting 3k cut from my salary in the first month in exchange for the *opportunity* to work 5 extra hours a week for a 45 hour work week.It wasn't mandatory, according to management, but if you didn't work a weekend you would have to meet with your supervisor Monday on why you didn't come in. I learned to really explore and ask current employees feedback on the job. It was a very sugar coated interview that I was blinded in coming out of college. They recruit you with the fun enjoyable laid back lifestyle of talking sports all day but its far from it.Awesome company that has a fantastic culture. Great Co-workers who truly care about helping Student Athletes not only get to College but help them understand the recruitment process.NCSA is a great place to work! At times your day can be repetitive, but its an overall great job to talk sports all day and being around a great culture of coworkers that have the same competitive nature as you. The Managers are always there to help and get you better as well as NCSA's VP'sFun place to work great experience in sales and lead generating. Pursued other opportunities that were more long term.HIgh energy, fast pace and good people. You will enjoy working here if you like working with sports minded people. one of the coolest work environments.8 hour day, sometimes weekends, they stress goals. great people. fun environment to work in, potential to make good money, this was a great stepping stone.Company was just bought out by a larger corporation and has totally changed the direction of the company and the way it's run.A typical day at work was making roughly 60 phone calls to parents of high school student-athletes.  I would find out if they're son or daughter it interested in playing their sport at the collegiate level and if so, needed to find out if they were qualified. I needed to sell them on using our network of college coaches to help their student-athlete to make that jump to the next level.  I improved immensely with speaking on the phone and learned what it takes to make sales calls.  Management was very nice and pushed us to get the job done.  My co-workers were great people to talk to and hang out with.  The hardest part of the job when talking with parents who were very skeptical about the network.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting that parent to agree to use the network and moving them forward.Very competitive culture and opportunity to make a lot of money as a top performerI gained a lot of customer service experience working at NCSA. I was on the phone with clients answering questions all day and that was very good to get experience in. It was a very laid-back atmosphere and the co-workers were great. The most enjoyable part of the job was that you got to talk sports all day.Too focused on sales and not other needed functions to build a career aroundManagement is not focused on growth of employeesVery comfortable environment to work in. Most people are around mid twenties. Very laid back people who all played sports in college. Start the day off by reviewing meeting that were set up the night before, responding to e-mails and voicemails, confirm meetings for the upcoming night. After doing morning duties, start reaching out to families and evaluating student athletes. My co-workers are very easy to get a long with and come from the same background as myself. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping out families and giving student athletes the opportunity to play sports at the collegiate level."

734,NESCO Resource,"Jobs assignments with Nesco were nicebakance of work and travelno assignments were avail after NH contractIve have some tough times here and if you cant lift heavy objects tgen this isnt a job for you at all. My title is gp12 and i enjoy doing my job everydayCall office to see if they have a position open or available, typical learn entry level position jobs. Management is very caring and tries to find a job that best fits you. Co workers are great people to be around, hardest part getting the job that you want. Enjoy working with people that want to help youManaged poorly.  would not recommend working here based on the relationships upper management has with office staff. Very unprofessionalIts all factory work, line assembly. Nothing special about it, long hours, standing on your feet for long periods of time. Most places they place you have good working teams. Some times you get a lazy team but that all depends on the management.Nesco is a staffing agency that works to help you get and keep a job.  If you lose it for whatever reason they always are there to help you find another job.  I've never had an issue with getting hired at a factory after being hired through nesco.Work is not at all hard, but requires constant standing, pulling, lifting and pushing product from one place to another for a minimum wage to limit amount with no room for growth or promotion.Since its a temporary agengy , you aren't guaranteed work and they pay is low. I enjoyed the company I worked for through them and they pay weekly. Overall not too bad if you can find permanent placement.They were on top of everything. The coworkers were very reasonable and easy to work with. The managers and employees were respectful to everyone. I learned how to prep parts and materials before painting them. I worked long hours when it was needed.This job was through a temp agency only. It was a small call center and very laid back . Anice place to work for younger or retired individuals.Went into agency and had job placement same day. Paperwork and initial skill testing is somewhat lengthy but worth it. Takes your interests and skills and helps them match you with a job of the same skill and interest set you have. Can only work at the job assignment for 6 months, but at the end of that 6 months the company can offer permanent employment to the temp employees they are interested in.This company was ok at first but I worked one job with them then they told me I couldn't work threw them anymore but a few weeks later they offer me another job wich I accept then they were very rude to me about my abilities to workUtilizing an ipad you would receive and complete your work assignments, order parts, print, and a couple of other thingsyou have to be at work at 7:00 am during the morning. I learned how to run a packing line and load a truck. some of the floor management were professional but others weren't. Most of my co-workers were pretty cool to work with. They always gave a helping hand when needed.The hardest part about the job was to meet the some of the high quotes of completing some of the work that we were doing. Most of the work that we didn't consist of any group work. The most enjoyable part of the day was lunch , why because we got 45 minutes and and allowed use to finally talk to each other about what different jobs that we were all working on.Help me understand how to work in a high productivity area. Made sure I learned skills to take me to the next level of employment. great place to work for.Worked for a plastics company in Dundee, Florida. You end up being treated like garbage. You'll find yourself doing most of the production supervisors duties while he gets the pay. Management can be quite intolerable and very unconcerned about you. If you find yourself working here leave your dignity and self esteem at home. Count on being lied to!Was told job started at $13. Turns out it was $10.I worked in the Norwalk location at Pinnacle and that was the WORST mistake for a job. That place is a joke. The boss treats his workers like animals. There is no organization what so ever in the factory. I applied to work and 90% of the time I was cleaning. I worked there for 7 months and finally got a different job cause it wasn't worth the mental stress after the boss called me a b****.  Most of the time there isn't any P.P.E so got chemical burns and have scars now on my arms from getting cut. I would contact NESCO to let the office know of everything that was going on and no changes were ever made except NESCO contacted the boss and I would get the 3rd degree or he would make me work harderThe job was very unprofessional and full of drama. I never worked the schedule I was hired in to work. What they call training is shadowing another employee while they're on the phone with a customer. No for real in the class training. They fire employees without explanation...feels like you're walking on eggshells.Had issues with management putting me in an awkward positions with potential jobs. Loved working for Nesco Resources. Would recommend friends to try out Nesco in the future. Hope to find other temp agencies that compare to Nesco in IL.They lied about everything from where I was working to the position.  Nice co-workers.  Bad Bosses.  You work as long as they want.  You stay till the job is doneI did not work at Nesco, I worked contract position at Pfaudler for Nesco for 6 weeks.  Typical day was processing invoices, check runs, filing , addressing vendor issues,"
630,NETE,"I was given many opportunities at NETE that I otherwise might not have had access to.  Everyone was very friendly, collaborative, and willing to work together (sometimes long hours) to complete projects.  I am lucky to have been exposed and trusted with taking on new projects.- The management is highly unorganized and has no flexibility whatsoever. - They ""ask"" you to come on weekends to help out with work. It is not ""required"" but everyone is worried that it is not a ""good look."" - Stingy and greedy. They only care about making more money as a company and gives no attention to their employees. HR is supposed to be in charge of a lot of these things, but turn-over rate just within HR is crazy. Employees don't know the HR people and HR people don't take the time to know the employees. So, it's very awkward and unproductive.- No structure/philosophy/corporate value. Anything and everything that will bring in money, they will do. They don't care about your values/work-life balance.- No structured performance review system. This may be good for some people, but for those who are rockstars, there is no motivation. Apparently you have to work your butt off to just get CEO's attention and then you will get promoted...after years.DO NOT WORK HERE.I used job as my step stone. Never planed to continue as a carrier. But learn a lot about marketing, sales & met lot of people."
306,"Netflix, Inc.","My typical day at work was pretty simple if all went well. My job was to answer questions, comments, and concerns with the website and the product we were providing as well as assisting with devices customers where using. It was a new challenge for each call and that was what kept it fun for myself. You would have a few bad eggs of course, but that rarely slowed down the pace of the day overall. Management told you how you could improve on your calls, and co-workers would talk to you during breaks about what they do when you run into a sticky situation. The hardest part about the job was having a rush of callers that gave us no breathing room in between to collect ourselves again. This, however, is standard with most jobs involving customer interaction. Also, compared to the number of customers they have, we were only helping a very small percentage of the overall user base. In short, the customers that called were the ones that definitely needed our help.Typical day at work is coworkers greeting me as I walk in the call center and customers eager to speak to me to have their issues resolved. I learned that it's easier to sympathize with a customer than to argue. Hardest part about the job is staying confident in yourself when you have angry customers criticizing you for mistakes that may have been on their part. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people and creating new friendships.Taking on a queue of thousands of calls on a daily basis taught me patience and fast problem solving skills, both are things I carry with me each day. It was a really team player type of environment I had the chance to work closely with management daily which taught me leadership skills. The most enjoyable part of my job here had to be talking to my customers giving them a great experience with each call made my day.NetflixCS claims to be different from any other call center environment in many ways. The problem is that, with every development, there are several setbacks. NetflixCS has outsourced many departments and has shown little interest in promoting or retaining talented employees. As with many other similar customer service jobs, they simply do not care, and are just as happy to replace you as they are to hire you. Simply having acceptable compensation and benefits does not a good work environment make.Love waking up to go to work. Very relaxed work environment with flexible seating arrangements. Teams were very intimate and team leads worked with agents one on one week after week to improve in areas that were lacking. For every holiday and new release there was a celebration including food and games.This was a great job in the fact the the co-workers and the atmosphere were relaxed, and overall friendly. However, they gave little opportunity for in house promotions though originally promised all promotions would be in house. Training provided was proficient, but could have been stronger as the company later changed it's customer care requirements. The benefits at this job were amazing, and overall I would definitely recommend this company to anyone ow that they have fully established the needs of the company and customer care required as well.I enjoyed listening to music while I worked on the machines. When I first started working there it was fun people were tired but for the most part happy. Shortly after I was hired they started laying off and firing most of the employees. They also kept changing and getting rid of supervisors and managers. It was also very difficult to progress even though they said there was room for growth.Autonomy, great compensation and the opportunity to work with the best of the best.  This is an opportunity of a lifetime! Only problem is they spoil you and makes it impossible to find anything else that compares!This is one of THE best places that I have ever had the opportunity working at. The work atmosphere is unlike any other. They are such a welcome, caring, fun, and open group of people. This is a place where you can literally be yourself, not feel judged, and just have an amazing time at work. They teach you, uplift you, and help you reach your goals in all aspects. I have learned so many things, and I am happy that I was able to work their because I think they have made me a better person overall, and I can take the skills that I learned there, and put them into my life.The crew and trainers who I was set to work with were great. I unfortunately had to leave Netflix due to medical problems, but was pleased with the amount of training I received. I never once met or saw my direct boss, but saw my trainers on a constant basis. The work was relatively slow paced, which left a lot of room for no productivity.Typical day at work is answering lots of calls and talking with lots of customers from different locations. Things I have learned is how to help customers around their accounts. Management and co-workers are very awesome. Awesome part of the job are breaks and free lunches.Worse place ever as it was all temporary from the very start.. so they have 3 interviews they make you jump thru after you go thru the hardest hiring process as far as applying and awaiting an interview period?? I think I didn't hear a response for about 6-7 months later?? The management was so poorly picked and orcustrated that I would highly doubt Netflix CS survival here in Utah.. I bet now they hire the lower bracket of individuals with actual experience and knowledge about tech support that their turnover ratio has to be a record high.. the supervisor I had was very demeaning and condescending and passive aggressive like he had an agenda to ruin folks lives, cause nobody on my team is there anymore as I still communicate with all of them!!Worked the shipping and receiving office. Hours 9 am to 5:30. Unloaded daily deliveries of all DVD'S.  Then the second half of the day I shipped out the Netflix swag for all 55 Hubs ( shirts to hats etc)enter all shipment into a excel spreadsheet and sent daily tracking numbers to the managers. Once delivered enter the data and tracking into a spreadsheet that was sent out weekly. Also took care of all the in house mail coming into the hub. We worked as a team always open discussions together. Loved the company.I worked for netflix for almost 2 years. It gave me the chance to help build a company. I was one of the first agents to work for netflixcs. While working there I sawany changes happen over the 2 years. I also had the chance to help build the company's culture and grow larger.The job is not a difficult job, but it is very redundant and the constantly want improvement even when improvement is not easy. It is hard to come in to the same thing every day and it gets to the point you dread hearing the beep in your ear letting you know a call is coming. Most customers calling in are angry about things you cannot control such as being unable to take certain payment methods by phone or content you can't put on for them. you get at least one angry customer a day typically on average and it is difficult on your self esteem and it is an emotionally draining job. THAT is what makes it difficult not the job at hand itself.This is definitely a great and fun place to work. I love video games and tech so working at this call center was really fun. Getting to know new releases and playing with the different devises that you could load the app ontoProvide exceptional customer service and problem solving by responding to all inbound calls, assist customers with new and existing accounts, website navigation, and account billing. Be an active listener who can show empathy and patience. Work in a fast paced, high volume, changing, and non-scripted environment while learning and strives to gain new knowledge about product and service changes.Shifts are unstable and you have to be willing to change your schedule during shift bidding. If you are in college it may be difficult to set a consistent schedule.no standard for advancement processthey bounce you around a lot from team to team, no real stability management wisethey make advancement almost impossibleno understanding of family firstMade recommendations on specific aspects of Build and Deployment and overall release process. Created Environments, Troubleshooted Build and deployments on Windows/Unix. Edited Maven mirror settings in m2/settings.xml to configure Maven to have Nexus as a repository.Knowledge in J2EE/.NET build/packaging, good communication skill, experience of working between offshore/onshore. Integrated Build dependencies and dependency blocking strategy in Bamboo.I was on my way to becoming a supervisor, but I was put in a situation where I needed to move out of the city. The Peets Coffee and Teas in this area did not have any positions available."
764,New Century Software,"Good Place to work. Small teams and lots of work load.Good 401K, Wellness programs, Insurance, work experience.Fantastic company on the leading edge of their market.   A company driven to grow first by quality and only then by size.  The IT department and products are second to none in the industry and always forward looking.   An incredible culture of family and work, guided by hands down one of the best people you could ever hope to meet.   He hasn't lost track of humility and family while still stoking the fires of improvement, growth and competitiveness.   If you want a place that will challenge you in many regards, you are hungry to be a part of team, and desire a really caring and usually focused team look to NCS.The management at this company is horrible. They micro manage and treat people like children. They don't know how to market the company properly and are constantly hiring and laying off people. There are better GIS jobs out there.Updated maps, queried and QCed data. Good office atmosphere.During my tenure working for this company, a typical day consisted of analyzing and capturing information from maps and drawings. At this job, I learned how important it was to accurately capture information to provide a final product to the client. Management was helpful and would answer questions regarding new and unknown features on maps and drawings. Most co-workers were very helpful answering my questions. The hardest part of this job was to continuously capturing data without any other task to break its monotony. The most enjoyable part of this job was to listen to music while capturing data."
208,New England Aquarium,"Overall the New England Aquarium is a great environment to work as a team when commutation is clear and given by all team members. Very educational even for the employees whom dont work interacting with the animals. Very informative regarding current sea life news. Everyone is nice and eager to help each other out.It was a harboring environment that allowed to grow and become a better individual and employee.By far the best management I have ever had. They care and never make you feel inferior.IT was awesome working with the rescue department and learning all about sea turtles. You get to see the rescue and rehab procedure from when they come in to when the turtles are released. You also get to help the Vets examine the turtles as well as feed themThey expect 3 - 4 days a week 9 - 5 completely unpaid work. The only benefits are free access to the aquarium and some discounts on local museums.During my time at the NEAQ I met the best people to work with they trained me and taught me so much about a non profit organization. I learned a lot about different animals. I also felt like I learned how to master public speaking because after the proper training I was talking in front of an attendance as big as 500 people. The hardest part of the job was probably knowing I couldn't go far in the company because i was so young at the time and I already went as far as I could in the company.Different then what you would expect. Strict and hostile environment. Very low pay. Alot of drama that it feels like high school and it doesnt make it stress free to come inFast paced environment and very social place. showing customers and the children a wonderful experience . Excellent place to gain customer service and make bonds with those who comeMy day start at 8:00 am, I do check all my employees that are schedule they are on time. after check all my area , I do go to my office to check email and any request. I do paper work, order, schedule, inventory, Meeting. Also I do check all area are running properly from our expectation.Worked with all around amazing people and could not have asked for a better experience as my first internship.A typical days include taking and recording temperatures, observing the animals, cleaning husbandry tanks, daily feedings, and interacting with the public whenever possible. Hardest part of the job, be willing to constantly be on your feet- running up and down MULTIPLE flights of stairs, carrying heavy things. Don't be afraid to get dirty. Most enjoyable part of the job- all of it. I loved every single part of the job.NEAQ is a wonderful workplace with a great mission and wonderful employees.  Part time jobs pop up occasionally, but if you haven't been volunteering there for the last few (or 20) years, good luck getting an interview.  Very difficult to move up or into higher or full time positions.A typical day would start by taking inventory of all the food for the day, followed by counting and distributing the cash drawers to the cashiers. Once opened for business, I'd go back and forth between the snack bars and make sure everything was running smoothly. I would help the co-workers or cover lunches / breaks when needed. At the end of the day, all the drawers were tallied up again and reports were presented to management. The hardest part of the job was having to ask cashiers to explain unacceptable negative or overage in the cash drawers.I loved working at the NEAQ, it was probably one of the best jobs I have ever had. No matter what your job title is, it's like you're a part of a family. Everyone knows everyone and regardless if you're cleaning toilets or checking PH levels, you will leave knowing a ton more about aquatic life than when you first came in. I met some of the best people while working there and it was unfortunate that I was not able to work there anymore.I loved working at the aquarium the people that you would meet everyday were everyday people. Got to work with children and teach people about what you knew. You were the teacher at the aquarium not the other way around. It was a way for me to share my knowledge with the people around me. The management and the Co-workers were awesome people outgoing and understanding as well as very helpful when you had a question!I served as a Cashier/IMAX theater host for Box Office as well as a Reservationist in Reservations over a span of two years. Daily, I engaged dozens if not hundreds of culturally diverse tourists working at the Aquarium. There is never a dull moment at this place. The Box Office management is a professional team and they make it a fun environment to work in.A wonderful mission and non-profit organization to be apart of. However, through the retirement of key management and a strong will to change overal corporate culture. I am seeking an enviornment that is best suited to match my drive and passion, verses a relaxed and passive approach to important buisness issues and development.Best place to work part time, it's fun, educational and the very interesting. I love that place and i always meet new people from different countries that come here just to study the behaviors of seaa animals.NeaQ is a fun and friendly place where you can be yourself, and with the right management, they are flexible with your hours. LOVE this job because it is flexible with schooling. Just be on time and show up to work, and you will be great!Initial time commitment required, very flexible after that. Excellent staff and friendly volunteers. Very hard to move into a paid position due to interest and a very low turn over on job openings.Telemarketing Supervisor for Spring and Summer Annual Campaign.Recruited, trained and supervised a team of fundraisers in support of the aquarium's environmental, educational and research programs.  The position was fun and challenging.   However, it was clear from the beginning that it was a ""temporary"" position.  I heard from numerous staff that they were converting the position into a data base admin position and would be outsourcing in the future.At the end of the summer campaign they released me and indeed they converted the position and outsourced. (I got calls from them from time to time).One issue is that at the time they used a database for fundraising called RAISER'S EDGE.   They brought in a trainer for a few days and we had a whirlwind tour of the system.   I never truly became proficient in it beyond basics.For 5 years I've worked here and I haven't gotten tired of it yet. There are so many amazing people as well as the beautiful animals. After all, work is a lot more fun when you get to talk about fish!the greatest job a teen or a adult interested in the world of water could ever have. Wonderful co workers amazing guest and lots of things to learn from this job ."
507,New York Genome Center,"The most enjoyable part of the job was working cross departmental and working with the best of the best in Biotechnology. It was an absolute privilege.There was never a typical day at work. My work ranged from working with accounting and finance to improve cost related metrics and budgets. Worked with HR on on boarding new hires. Worked with IT to oversee enterprise computing needs and software. Trouble shoot facility related issues. Worked cross departmentally to implement policies. Worked on Emergency management team. It was my business to have big picture view of 130 employees to ensure all was operating smoothly and create guidelines that would enable that.This was a start up company. When I began there were 20 employees , when I left there were 130."

They'll get what they deserver - you take care of your own or you are worthless. Great people work there management is in need of professional services though.Opportunity to learn about your strengths and weaknesses and develop a business that is flexible.  Unlimited opportunity for growth.  Hardest part is that you are solely responsible for your own destiny.  You must constantly be in front of new people to build your business.  Overall a positive work environment with unlimited support available to you from mentors, trainers and management.  I love that I get to decide who I work with and in what fields.Working here has really opened up doors and helped me become the great sales person I am today. Plus you get to manage your own hours and work times.Team work is a must. Great environment and very busy. Customer service is top priority. Great work/life balance as well.The management at this employer is amazing. They provide step by step , hand held process for new hires. There is no guessing on what to do next, because there is always someone to help you get to the next . It is hard work becoming an agent as it is difficult to build a client listFun place to work, Good team work among colleagues, Very good management and good child care facility for the use of parentsFamily atmosphere and loved going to work.  The management cares for their employees and treats them very well.  A place I wish I could still work for except I don't live in New York anymoreWhen you start working for NYL, if you don't have any experience, you must attend A LOT of training, which is good, but at the same time, that eats a lot of your working hours.NYL is an EXCELLENT company as far as the knowledge that you'll acquire from them. They're actually very famous for the level of training they provide to their agents. Some times it could be a little bit too much.You are recruited by a partner (or manager,) and unfortunately, it depends a lot on whoever recruits you on whether or not you'll like your position over there or not. Some partner are very hands-off and you're on your own, some of them are very hands-on and ask you for #s all the time.The position of an agent is sort of lonely. Yeah, you can do joint work w/ other agents, yet you have to split commissions, so for the most part, people are on their own.The hardest part of the job is prospecting. You have to find your own clients. Every now and then they give you a lead, but for the most part, you're responsible for your own survival.The most enjoyable part is that you manage your own schedule, although that's a double-edged sword if you're not responsible.The Jersey City office is a really good and productive workplace with friendly co-workers and open seating.You get to learn a lot and also explore new technologies.In my 5th year at New York Life.  I have learned how to help people with Tax Free and sound financial planning for Life.  Basically, in the Love and Faith business, because most of the reasons you want life Insurance is you Love someone or owe someone $money.  The hardest part of the job is finding people to talk too.  The most enjoyable part of my job is helping people establish their goals and helping families grieve, emotionally and not financially.Company paid training was a perk, which lead to increased knowledge in the work place.  monitoring the LAN/WAN environment for the corporate network. Rotating shifts was one of the difficulties of the job. My co-workers were knowledgeable, professional and team oriented. Learned a great deal about F5, DNS, DHCP and emerging technologies as well as customer facing applications. IP management experience was greatly enhanced due to use of IPAM and  INFOBLOX tools.You eat what you kill.  If you are self-motivated, and do not require a lot of supervision, then you will be fine.  If you are not comfortable working without a salary then you may want to look elsewhere.I gained countless experience at New York Life Insurance Company.  I obtained my Life and Health License. I was trained in sales, determining financial need, product knowledge, prospecting, and the insurance business as a whole.  I learned the process of obtaining clients all the way through to delivering a policy.I worked here while i was in school it was hard to balance everything out but i managed. It was a great environment to work in and if you worked hard the reward was great.I have watched the company deteriorate over the last 6 years. There doesn't seem to be a clear direction/vision. I am very dissatisfied with the current state of affairs.A strong company with excellent training program and support. If commission sales is your thing then i highly recommend working for the New Jersey General Office.High pace environment that was different each day. I enjoyed the people I worked with while there. The hardest part of the job was really short deadlines and changes mid job. I still made all my deadlines.Had a lot of fun and learned alot from everyone there. Managment staff was great and motivating. The office was very nice and the team meetings were very productive.Great experience, learned a lot in a short amount of time.Staff and agents are very nice and offer help in any way they can. Partners push to get work done ASAP so agents can make their commissions for month and year ends.A good company to work for that does a lot for the surrounding communities and has a great work life balance; if you like a fast paced environment then you should look elsewhere; loved the half day Friday policy in the summer time"

Great for someone who is a bachelor and has alot of time on their hands.This is an awesome place to work. great company.Great people. something new everyday is a rewarding challenge. Awesome MGT team.pay was great for this area.unless you are a full-time employee (not contract) then the benefits are non-existent. no job security. they let me go one day without notice after coming back from vacation. my termination sheet said one reason but the reason to the unemployment office was different. nissan corporate does appreciate their employees, the managers that I worked for only appreciated certain people.Great company to grow and move up in your career.  Employees were great to work with.  Management was fair. The work load was heavy and a lot is put on your plate.My review of Nissan North America is that the company continuously strives to compete with other auto makers to ensure that its customers receive the highest quality vehicles possible.Great place to work no bad reviews. Plenty of hours. Just spend more time there than home. They are a production company so you will be working at a fast pace but always be safe.Typical day here is very easy. i Park cars and greet customers who need their car serviced. From time to time i would give customers shuttle rides to their destination. One of the hardest part of this job for me was saying something silly to the customers while talking lol. Its a very comfortable environment.I work overnight on the truck frame line, and iv'e been there over 2 years. Its a challenge but I am looking to advance and move up to a better position. I have been very appreciative of the opportunity and look forward to playing a bigger role as part of the Nissan community.Very easy to work forSimple work pathsEasy to work with ManagementFamily atmosphereWarranty was hardest part of jobKnowing the Company was growingI usually start my day off around 12:30pm with a 15 minute meeting and then jump into work immediately. In the position I work in, I receive orders, and search for the parts in our warehouse. I have learned through my job, how to process orders and have come to understand the importance of time management. Also, how to properly prioritize my work day.The hardest part of job is just the remedial part of it.The job was pretty descent. It had it pros and it cons. I really think that they need a Union. They are professional but managers will fire people about the points when they had doctors excuse.Nissan provided me with opportunities that I've never experienced in any other work environment. They gave me tools and information to take with me everywhere in life making me overall a better employee.Not to much to say you will have to find out for yourself everybody experience is different. you just might leave without a headache and a car. I hope this info was usefulVery fast paced work environment. Difficult to move upward in management unless part of the Good Ole Boy Nissan club. Upper Management consists lifetime Nissan Employees and are reluctant to promote outsiders regardless of experience or performance. Excellent compensation for Supervisors and Managers. Work/Life balance is non-existent. All work and room/time for family affairs.Do not apply, they rant and rave how the ferman family takes care of their own yet treat their employees like dirt. Nissan expects you to get a rating score minimum of 965 out of 1000 or else you are failing. The surveys are based off the entire process and not just your experience with the guest so any step of the process outside of your control can fail you and potentially put your job in jeopardyManagement is great, but lots of mandatory overtime. Nissan's meaning of mandatory definitely means mandatory. Nissan benefits offer paid sick time off, but they don't expect you to use it.This is the best cilvilan job I ever had. The starting pay is great, and the opportunity to advance within the company is great. during my time there the company thrive and everybody was happy with their job. I really enjoyed the annual bonuses that Nissan provided to all there employees. The bonuses make you really feel appreciated.Great company to work for with excellent benefits 401k and retirement plan. It is very hard to get vacation time due to people having seniority have priority and can take a day at a time killing a week for everyone else.Everyday I went to work I gained knowledge. I learned the difference in ways of assembling a vehicle. The hardest part of my job was trying to make the plant more productive, meaning I might be required to request certain things moved, more hours given to employees, getting rid of unnecessary scrap or defects on the assembly line. I really enjoy the interactions with my fellow co workers.No family life, No  integrity within upper management. Hard to get your vacation time off if more than one other person is off in your zone.  Your family life will suffer from all the overwhelming overtime."

751,"Noble Energy, INC.","Great place, incredible people. It is a true school for anything related to business. Came in as a new employee, learned and left there as a veteran in oil and gas.There are two distinct classes - contractors and employees. It seems that who you know gets you more job recognition and opportunity than what you know. Social connections count more than job skills and experience do, so if you're on the ""inside"" and fit in with the social culture, you'll do ok. If you don't, you'll be discounted, no matter what you do. Hiring and promotions that I saw were based on social connections instead of quality of the person's work. It may be different in other departments, but that was my experience working there.Overall the company is a pleasure to work for. Great company culture and transparent management.Working in the oil and gas industry at this point leads to less stability in the work environment, but if you can make it through to a rebound it'll be worth it.Good place to work if you have job security. Management lacks involvement with your daily activities. Work is delegated and ignored unless you're in a critical position. I received very little to do.Terrible place to work for.  The culture is toxic.  The management goes out of their way to try and get people to quit by excluding people from meetings, making information deliberately concealing information and neglecting to answer emails.I was hired as a temp for basic clerical duties and record keeping for their accounting department while the corporation was in the process of digitizing it's files. Despite my temporary status I was able to work for the company for 2 years and they tried to give me an advancement opportunity by turning me over to data entry.   I enjoyed working for them and they gave holiday bonuses as well as year end bonuses even to a temp.Working for Noble Energy was probably one of the best working experiences I have had. The culture in IT was fantastic, the people I had the opportunity work with were excellent at their jobs. If the price of Oil hadn't plummeted I would have loved an opportunity to work there.Very nice people and environment with many different people, in many different departments. Makes working here very interesting but useful.  Job duties are basic to the needs at hand for what ever project your working on and of course, making that project successful.  And again - my co-workers become family friends that i will maintain these relationships inside and out.It was great starting out, when it was a small company.  As the years went by, they went ""public"" and got a little too ""top-heavy"".  Politics started to come into play.  Started growing a little too fast. Most managers do not know what they are doing.  It's all in who you know.Easy to get lost in the system, hard work is not rewarded at this big company.  Lots of management, too much big corporate culture.A quality organization that works hard to work in an ethical manner.  Great workplace environment.  They take great care of their employees.Good working environment, smart and friendly co-workers. Results oriented, however due to rapid growth of the company, planning of projects suffered.they well train new hires.  make all employees feel appreciated. fair and reasonable compunction. works well with matters of family/children.  Organized clean friendly. wonderful customer serviceOver-staffed land department plagued with overlapping responsibilities and poor management from middle managers. Very political company culture that was strongly evident in April 2015 layoffs. High turnover rate among 20-something's in the land department as a result of how the land department was structured and managed. Nothing more than a pay check and resume builder.good work load balancemanager goodsome lack of communicationgood co workershardest part, getting timely decisionsNoble's culture is built around engineers. Zero professional development is given to administrative employees (non-engineers) while the company is ripe with opportunity for such.Management is lacking in more ways than I can list. There is a very egoistic and secretive approach to all decision making. The most valued employees are the ones who take the least amount of effort to manage.Good environment.Upper management takes too risky decisions that leads towards work force reduction.They are very open to offering training to employeesManagers are very open to hear youThey invest in training and you are always considered as part of the teamThe have community work which was fun there.Excellent place to work. Management very helpful in daily operations. Safety was number one on our daily work schedule. Great locations.All management needs to be more involved with the day to day on-goings of the organization. There also needs to be transparency when the company is not performing to minimum goal requirements.For people working in Engineering this is a great company. They can explore,drill,complete and produce petroleum as well as any. If you work in a supporting role, IT, Fin, SCM, Audit, Etc. the jobs are fairly easy. The performance bar is set pretty low but so are the chances of advancement and pay raises. The company hires externally over internally. Internally HR and IT are seen as the weakest links in the chain because of their upper management and performance. It is a mid-size and growing company that still thinks it is small. They tout tuition reimbursement as a benefit but deny it to most. You can easily spend 10 years in a position as an average performer and if you over-perform you will be assigned more work. A lot of people would leave if it weren't for the easy job and great benefits.This job was different everyday, I loved that challenge it gave the everyday experience. The laid back atmosphere, and how they were flexible with life and job was appreciated."
509,Nomura,"The client location is too good here. the security how they conducted is too good. Good comany to work for any employyee. Definitely we will get great satisfaction working here.Excellent place to work. very supportive people and very good management group.employee benefits also very good. career growth also very good as always more opportunities to explore on different tasks.Nomura had some really great people and overall culture is better than at bulge bracket. However, no development strategy and deteriorating pipeline doesn't make the place very appealingGood Work Life Balance but not many full time positions offered.Management is friendly, coworkers are ok, i learned the investment banking skill sets i wantedProfessional, knowledgeable, and productive staff. It was a pleasure working alongside my colleagues and learning from them on a daily basis. Overall great work environment where everyone truly cares about their jobs.During my externship in the legal department at Nomura, I learned how to effectively communicate with others in an investment bank setting by juggling the various needs of different departments from trading to credit to operations.  Additionally as an extern, I prepared various memos relating to derivatives rules from Title VII of Dodd-Frank, CFTC and SEC.  I also analyzed and summarized Confidential, Disclosure, and Customer Agreements. Lastly drafted operational e-mails based on various No-Action letters issued by regulators so that the banks different departments knew the most up to date regulationsEnjoyed working with Nomura. People are smart and helpful.Work culture is great.Nomura's intern program involves several opportunities for interns to network with fellow interns and senior executives. The firm also uses a junior and senior mentor program to help interns become acclimated with Nomura's culture.people are nice, including the management team, HR and co-workers. It is not always busy so you still have your personal life. not being here for a long time so have no idea about the promotion."
386,NORC,"This was a great place, very easy. If you knew all of your project knowledge and answers to frequently asked questions then that equals to a typical day at work.NORC overall was a nice experience because I had never been a locator before. I did not like the environment, for some reason everyone shared colds there.hard working environment with room to advance within the company. they had very flexible hours and plenty of overtime for employees. staff was committed to helping new hires learn everything there is to know about becoming a telephone interviewerinbound outbound call center part time hours convinenient location in downtown area very flexible work schedule fast pace enviorment,thiers opportunity for growth and developmentHired through an temp agency, we were paid more than some of the workers that came straight through the company. Easy work.basic customer service job call center environment equal opportunity job consisted of sitting for several hours you got to choose your own schedule very flexible scheduling systemA great company to work for and you work independently with your cases, but you have a lot support with Field Manager and Tech Support.  The job assignment is ending for now.Management is bias and constant treats for high production.There's no room to grow or even a transfer to challenge other openings.No sick or vacation benefitsField and Regional Managers projects an attitude of superiority that turns off other employees.Employee morale low - ending on a high turn overI came in and sat at my desk. placed several phone calls to various different people to whom would share information about their child's immunization records to help with the CDC's statistics and studyA typical day working involves me signing into my computer, putting on my headsets, answer calls and also make them. I learned that the company don't care to much for employees . My co-workers are amazing. The hardest part of the job was trying to save break minutes. The most enjoyable part was that I could pick how many hours I wanted to work in a day.No words can describe my typical work day or my experiences at National Opinion Research Center (not for profit). I would like to remain mutual, knowing that I performed my job well.Great place to work just wish we had more hours basically all you do is convince people to participate in different studiesThis particular job I accepted just for the need of money, although I am grateful for the tools I have accumulated here as a telephone interviewer.At this job my duties was to call respondents on various social science studies. I learned about different studies and the management was excellent here. The hardest part was getting the respondents to participate in the study. The most enjoyable part of this job was talking to different respondents.NORC is a supportive environment that has a new department just for employee innovation!  The company is full of lots of smart folks who work very hard to win the next big contract.I believe that the hardest part of this job was the long waits in between calls. I ve learned that if you set goals, no matter what you do ,you will meet them. the most enjoyable part of this job was that i can go on break at anytime i want.I love working at this productive, fast paced place of business.  The people work at a team there. A typical day is getting out current events and making sure the floors are running smoothly.Just don't work here if you aren't a fan of being auto-dialed for something because this place specializes in it. They conduct CDC surveys pertaining to childhood immunizations but the average person isn't looking forward to being on the phone for 20 or more minutes to do an immunization survey, so look elsewhere for employment. They also still pay minimum wage.this is definitely the company to pursue for employment! what a great company to be employed by. this was a great experience for me, I gained so much insight on the company and the city of Chicago. employers were always available to talk to at anytime about anything.Employees conduct high qaulity interviews about the national immunization survey on behalf of the cdc. Our work hours are extremly flexible with a 85 percent attendance requirement for each month. Although supervisors and peer helpers are always present , majority of the work is done alone .working here was ok but the hours were awful but it is ideal for a student because you pretty much set your own schedule. if you didn't get the hours when they were first posted then you miss out"
692,Nordstrom,"Love Working for Nordstrom, I love fashion and customer service, same office politics that hinder progress at any workplace.Great place to work! Nights and weekends are a must and holidays are hard to get time off. Sales goals are high but achievable and has a great environment for customers! I learned how to creat repeat customers, laid back sales techniques, giving five star service and teamwork excercises.Its a great place to work new company just opened new location. management could use work very new. I learned various new things there logistics has more things that i knew. The work staff was great everyone was fun and outgoing.Nordstrom was a wonderful company to work for! The management really cares about growing their associates into leaders if they see you are eager and willing to put in the work. It's a very fast paced work environment so be ready for your feet to hurt at the end of the day.Its very hard to have a set schedule for this type of job(Retail). Great company and great benefits. Hardest part of the job is not having a set schedule. My co-workers were great and overall I love this company.Nordstrom is a great company for EVERYONE. If you're a student looking a for extra money or if you're seeking a career with growth opportunities, Nordstrom has a place and position for you. I am so blessed to be apart of a company that feels like family. They are quick to take care of their employees just as quickly as they take care of their customers. I never feel like I don't have a voice. Also, because they have so many locations including their Rack division, opportunities exist all over the country and now in Canada as well. I've always felt well compensated since day one and the benefits have continued to grow in my almost 4 years with the company. I'm grateful.Everyone is like family and you can count on the staff to be right there with you. Service experience and training was awesome.I am so thankful for the experience I have develop while I have working at Nordstrom.  I have taken and have used alot of what I leaned in all the jobs I have held.  I will always be greatful.Very unorganized, definitely a place to start if you want to move to there corporate side in Seattle. Work is not rewarding and you job security depends on your ability to acquire new rewards members.Definitely a lot of favoritism, kind of like high school, if you suck up you move up not because you are amazing at what you do.  A lot of discrimination based on race.Great college job, minimum wage, competition for commission, nice coworkers, good managers, 20% employee discount, yummy food at the cafe, nice lunch room, good training.I was only a part-time employee and they still set-up a 401k for me. They had a great training program. They went out of their way to work with your schedule.The Nordstrom way is always make your customer feel at ease. Everyone works together to increase sales. Helping people find exactly what they want for that special occasion, and coming back for the nextNordstrom is a great company to work for. The typical work day was between 6am and 3pm. It was a very fast paced environment, you are always going to be on your feet and very busy. The stock support team was almost like family.clock in have fun selling and very competitive environment . fantastic management wants you to be as successful as you can be. great place to start learning retail . many opportunity for growth in company.This is partly due to the particular store I was in and the dreadful environment born due to the worst store manager I've ever experienced in my life. Favourtism, sexism, lack of support and a lack of positive acknowledgement were all prevalent on a day to day basic. Money isn't that great. They think bc they start you more than minimum wage they are better than other companies.I learned a lot in depth on how to give great customer service, they allowed me to express individual ideas when it comes to merchandise. Over all great to learn from in regards to selling and aiding people to have fashion.Large company but runs more like multiple small businesses so work-life balance and environment vary within the company.  My experience has been good. Overall good corporate culture and benefits.Nordstrom is a great corporation because they are committed to promoting talent from within and ensuring career advancement to top performers. Retail commission based sales positions are great for college students who need part time jobs that offer autonomy, flexible schedules, and a competitive and fast paced work environment, and Nordstrom is no exception!A normal day a t Nordstrom's starts with morning meeting, putting out any product from the nights  before truck. servicing the customer is the number one priority at NordstromYou always had the opportunity to grow within the company. Everyone was always very friendly and willing to work together as a team. Management was excellent."
518,North Shore Long Island Jewish,"Great company and environment to work. Has its ups and downs but overall a great company. Management changed during my tenure which is what led to my resignation.Job offers great benefits and gives most employees a great work/life balance. I would highly recommend this company to anyone.NSLIJ made me who I am today, the constant help for co-workers and colleges helping each other, motivating each other, being polite is what molded me to be the employee I am today, Now a days is very hard to find a job environment like that.This company is a fun and productive place to be. I have been working for this agencies for the past four years and have had wonderful experiences.A typical day consisted of meet and greet new hires and candidates.I learned the HR applicant tracking system. My coworkers were very helpful and friendly.The hardest part of the job was the environment.Great place to work but is not offering full time position. Co-workers are hardworking and pleasant and management is very helpful in educating their employees.Clock into work and read emails of the day ,check messages & begin to see patients, either individually therapy sessions or group therapy sessions. I've learned that I enjoyed working inpatient as opposed to an outpatient clinic setting. I've worked inpatient for many years and I am not used to micromanagement. My Social Work colleagues are experienced and experts in the field of Substance Abuse. The hardest part of the job were the hours, 1PM to 9PM 3 days a week & then switching gears into 9 to 5 midweek and on Fridays. Understaffed. Low moral of employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the patients, especially when you realize you've helped them to become well.A typical day at work included of: participating in meetings with interdisciplinary staff team, conducting an intake, conversing with social workers, RN's, MD's, psychologists, psychiatrists, nurse practitioners and MHC's. leading/co-leading or observing group therapy sessions on a variety of topics, conducting a private one-on-one therapy session, writing and formulating session notes from group and personal therapy as well as receiving supervision in a relaxed and no-pressure environment.Vocational Services is a wonderful department.Supervisors and staff are always willing to go above and beyond.Working in vocational services I have learned different skillsVery Busy, productive, under staffed.  My most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help patients.  I am a team player and love to assist Doctors during procedures and examinationsSince working at North Shore I've learned a different methods of talking and working with people. The team-work is amazing this the true meaning of team work. When i ask for help I actually receive it from my fellow co-workers. My patients are the best part of my job. A typical day for me is getting my patients ready for a relax evening after working so hard in therapy, taking temps, giving showers, just making sure my patients are as comfortable as possible.From intake to discharge the patient is given world class service, as the nurses are provided with world class education and leadership from management.During my years of service as a ward clerk I was able to apply and learn new skills.  Which gave me the opportunity to move on into other avenues within the North Shore Facility.Train by excellent teachers. Great thorough demonstration followed by repeat demonstration.some managers are to young and unexperienced  can feel ""less than""  un acknowledge most of the time. some floors are great team players.South Side Hospital is working within a community for a community. My coworkers were like family. Residents are fun, it is always good to learn from them and with them."
238,Northeastern University,"I worked as a graduate research assistant which was unpaid but helped me learn a lot along with other students. I had my mentor guide me and help me answer many inquiries which taught me a lot.I work about 20 hours a week and it has taught me organisational skills. I organize towels in the closet and make sure that appropriate individuals enter the facility and no outsiders cross the gates. The management is very supportive and very understanding. If I have to drop a shift due to some academic work they are very understanding regarding it. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I got meet undergrads from different cultural backgrounds and we have become good friends now.This was a great way to make friends who were students trying to learn more about the Video Production aspect of the Athletics Department at Northeastern. I volunteered for the experience and it gave me the necessary basic skills in order to handle camera equipment appropriately.Northeastern University has a very large campus in Boston, which offers everything students need in the way of bookstores, eateries and a beautiful library.It is very international and has an excellent standard of education. The academic staff is highly qualified and co-workers are generally very helpful. The Global Pathways, College of Professional Studies organizes meetings for instructors, which is a good opportunity for the rather large teaching staff to meet up and exchange ideas.There is little to no possibility of advancement when hired as a part-time adjunct instructor. The workload varies and is unpredictable. No benefits, no job security.1. become a better organized with daily job activities.2. communicate with others effectively.3. Process magnetic materials, including: mechanically milling of     ferrite powders, formation of green bodies, heat treatment         studies   of compacts. 4. Fabricate and test toroids as high frequency permeability and    permittivity inductor cores, mechanically alloyed permanent    magnets, magnetostrictive materials, low power loss MnZn-ferrites    and low magnetic/dielectric loss Z-type ferrite.-I learned a lot about what it means to navigate heavy administrative tasks and politics in the work place-I grew as a supervisor -A love of diversity and inclusion, and helping create environments where this was a safe space for students and staff-I learned how to give feedback to staff including supervisors, peers, and subordinatesI had the great pleasure to work as a Office Assistant,Intern at Northeastern university, for  two months. I had the opportunity to work at the Department of Physical Therapy.My responsibility was to help with administrative tasks including making photo copies of student's files; Developed and maintained positive working relationships with other; Supported staff to reach common goals.Northeastern offers great benefits but the pay is not as great. There are a lot of opportunities to move within the University, but some offices remain stagnant. Overall it is a positive place to work and there is a level of excitement as the University moves up the ranks nationally.Great flexibility and time off policy (can depend on the dept). A week off for christmas and every holiday possible off. The pay is poor in most departments until you reach the director level. Everything moves slowly through northeastern and the systems are not fit to support the growth of the university. Great retirement benefit after two years. If you are going to work here, consider your boss/ dept just as much as the job itself.School is growing fast. As a graduate student, I felt there were not many professors working on a research actively, even young professors doing only services such as department works, teaching..  Only a few professors are working on a research.Meet with professors a few times a week to discuss the field of study/research I was working on. Would be assigned deadlines and goal to accomplish tasks and present to the professor. Fairly independent but professors were open and willing to help as neededGreat teaching university for employees, wonderful team model, excelled at job duties, co-workers approachable and resourceful, great work life balanceShadowing a PhD student during experiments and then carrying out replicates. I learnt time management among other laboratory skills. I've had quite friendly co-workers and mentors.NEU is a fast-growing staple of the Seattle tech scene. The staff is awesome, very attentive and willing to help. It's a great place to work and there are always opportunities to take leadership roles since the campus is growing so quickly.Worked as a teaching assistant. Work of course relies on the professor under whom you work. I have had the privilege to work under some very good professors and the experience has been very good.Review and submit payroll for employees.Make sure all areas are staffed throughout business hoursUpdate Digital signage programsAssist with any customer service needs- i.e phone calls and general questions about the establishment.Reserve and manage west addition window advertisement requestAssist Lost and found programNortheastern University is the perfect place to learn and practice engineering. I gained a lot of academic and research experience through the course of my master's.The two top things about working for Northeastern are the students and great co-workers.  There is a lot of coming and going of students due to co-operative education jobs and studies abroad. This presents challenges but is also exciting.Lucky to be hereHave been here since 6 months.Got opportunity to be here.I was working as an research assistant where treatment with employee is excellent.Good place to work. You do have to listen to directions and do as much as you can even when not asked. Great personnel and really calm place to work!!gooood place to learn everything.  I like the nice weather and water view here.  Green is everywhere.  Nice team and teacher.  Also a lot of fun here."
579,Northrop Grumman Corporation,"I learned a lot about fingerprints, understanding USCIS immigration paperwork and procedures. Worked with a high volume of people in a fast paced environment. Everyone was great to work with and would help each other when possible.Grumman used to be a very good company to work for lately New Management transitioning from California to Florida the management really does show appreciation to the employeesI worked at NG on the VITA/COV project. This project was somewhat negative in that all three major entities (NG, VITA, State agencies) distrusted and disliked one another which made meetings, strategy and planning extremely tedious and painful.The work, however, was strategically challenging and enjoyable, and the staff was mostly great to work with.I would no recommend NG if you are under a contract. As a direct hire, they seemed like quite a nice place to put down roots if you could handle the pace.I enjoyed working at Northrop Grumman. The work was challenging and interesting. Management was helpful and communicated well. My colleagues were friendly and helpful.Working in the B-2 aircraft depot I tested and verified that all systems were functioning before flight. During build process, troubleshot systems that are not working. While working in the depot I learned the B-2 aircraft as a whole. When I worked in engineering, I was responsible for my specific box. now I know the aircraft as a system. I have never worked with such an amazing team of people before. I looked forward to going to work every day. my co-workers contribute to that.The hardest part and the most enjoyable is trying to fix a system that is not working.I already reviewed this company. This program will not allow me to pass up this part of the process of applying for a job. And I already did it once.The work is rewarding overall but the Management leaves quite a bit to be desired in some of the departments. Depending on the person and the Manager is whether you can even get advancement. By this I mean, your work doesn't matter, it's the person themselves that counts and not the work.I learned so many things working for Northrop Grumman. I was able to learn how to do sheet metal work and SMAW welding. Highlt recommend this company. Excellent benefitsThis is the best company I worked for. Great pay. Great work place. Great benefits. Great training. Great lanes for advancements. Great job projects. Many different work locations to select from.The company has good benefits overall.  I was present on a project that replaced the PM with someone barely out of school.  Lack of understanding of Client caused a loss of contract.Excellent for technology education and advancement into shipping, space programs or a military career.  This companies in field hands on training process is the one of the better ways for skilled labors to achieve a certificate of completion while being paid for an honest days work.I enjoyed working there. Wish the company was more involved in the community especially in the Oklahoma City Area. Good job security depending on the program.Management at the office constantly had hands tied in assisting people under them by their managers. The ability for advancement of job or work environment was not there.NGC has made a lot of progress under current leadership. Definitely heading in the right direction as far as sales and technology go. Very talented top management and overall a good place to work.The pay scale is low and layoffs are a part of culture there.  If you take a job here, don't expect longevity.  The production manager's leadership style leaves a lot to be desired.  Seems to be okay with categorizing employees based upon gender.I really liked working there because the job(s) were interesting and the people are great. the hours are good and they have an employee gymcompany was fined for pesticide spraying and never compensated any injured employees. Managers were fined and severely warned for repeated wrong behavior but never terminated or disciplined.I loved working for the company as well as the people.Definitely room for advancement in the company, and diversity is very well important and acknowledged.Management only listens to management.  There are benefits in working for a large company.  There is an atmosphere that it's easier to get ahead because of who you know and not what you know.I support a very small team of technical writers and testers.  We sit together daily and communicate all day discussing work issues.  The atmosphere is extremely present.  I am not only a supervisor but a key contributor.  The hardest part of my job is delivering unpleasant reviews or terminations to staff because of budget cuts.  I enjoy the team and the team atmosphere.  It is a pleasure to come to work with seasoned professionals who love their job.I feel like I lost a family. The site managers looked out for its people, and we did our best to make it work for all of us.  Like all sites, it wasn't perfect, but we all knew what had to be done, and we had a team spirit going on (everybody accomplishing their duties and responsibilities). --- We all got the job done, and help one another to make sure everything got done, and to make sure we kept the Air Force satisfied. --- Yes, a family with some ups and downs, but what I sense today is that we have lost a key thing in business today - friendship & loyalty, but nothing last forever. Some employees I consider good people, which I sought their advise and again friendship. Maybe I will find that again."
398,Northwestern University,"8 hours per daygive me a solid fundamental learning of materials science and engineering, work very happy with people.Northwestern is a good place to go to school; the department is more collaborative than comparable universities. A strong focus on hard/ soft materials rather than biology/ medicine.Nice company to work for. Very please to be a part of the growth of the company. I would recommend working for this company.Northwestern is great university as a whole. The school/department you work for might shift your views a little. Work/life balance was great. Management at SPS needs a lot of improvement. The most enjoyable part was having a lot of opportunities for advancement.My job and the people I work with are very enjoyable.  The management is my department is ideal - they aren't micro managers and lead by example.  We are very team oriented and we get the job done.Responds to customer needs in providing networking suggestions and technology resolutions.Adhering to departmental service level standards and time frames.  Develops and maintains strong relationships with customers. Conducts Enhanced ACD training for departments. Such as volunteering to handle all Enhanced ACD issues and Unified Messaging Callers Menus.The hardest part of my job is working too hard and forgetting to take lunch.  The most enjoyable aspect of my job is interacting with customers and other groups within central IT as well as University departments.Standard stipend, able to live in Chicago area, albeit frugally. Quality of the working environment depends almost entirely upon who is your lab advisor. Beyond the day to day, Northwestern is a huge school that can give you as much HR stuff as you need.A typical day at work would start with a good morning greet from many co-workers, we would come a hr early to have coffee, very nice people no problems from any co-workers, I learned the great culture, met people that have worked that for 25 or more years , they was very helpful showed me all the work. Taught me how to use proper cleaning supplies,proper ways to to use a hand mop, and more. My supervisor was very nice and understand and made sure you knew your job over all i enjoy my time there because i learned new experience.I learned a ton while I was there but since my pay was based off grants it was very insecure. Work can be very satisfying if you end up in a good lab with nice people.Northwestern is an amazing place to work. It fosters a creative environment and freedom of expression. They compensate their employees well and provide good benefits. They give you a lot of latitude so you don't feel stifled. The bonus is that the campus is gorgeous. Apply!Great place to work. Nice co workers. Benefits are great, but pay is lousy. Employees are not paid fairly for their hard work, dedication to the job, or for their contributions. Management needs improving.My former boss was/is my mentor. I learned to find the news and write about it. I developed terrific relationships with the media, faculty and peers in academic medicine.1. The work on that time very busy in the morning  2.  New things, research on Dobutamine stress echo we open3. Research  on nuclear stress test  we open 4.. Signal Average ECG, I learned a lot on this department , well oriented. good training hospital.professional in did.  5 well manage.  6.they all love me because Im the hard working person .smiling,   doing my job ,with no hesitation.  7. For  me there is no hardest part of the job  ,I finished my work       on time.   8. Every day for me is enjoyable I learned a lot and i really mean it.You'd be better off working at Whole Foods than taking the peanuts that Northwestern offers its adjunct faculty. No office, no resources, no possibility of professional advancement.Imagine working along side intelligent creative individuals of the utmost professionalism. That was every day at Northwestern University A&RT. I would donate my left kidney to work there for the rest of my life!NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY allowed their employees to go back to school. A gym membership was allowed to employees, alone with flex time. It was a family oriented work place. You feel close to all of the staff. You are able to purchase at a discount NORTHWETERN UNIVERSITY athletic team tickets for you and your family.Overall work load is high. People are very friendly here. No windows in my office. Tons of talks can be attended. Some courses can be taken for free.A good place to work with great benefits - beautiful area to live on the Northshore.Good people to work withSimilar GoalsCulture of ComplianceLeadership from administration could be enhancedA typical day at work consisted of coming in everyday and sorting the incoming mail into the buildings bins and checked them against rosters  and getting the mail ready for delivery. The management could have been a little bit better. my co workers were okay to work with on a daily basis. The hardest part of my job was ensuring that the mail got delivered in a timely fashion. The enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the students.I would come to work and start setting up my line. putting the food in the right place. making sure everything was clean and I would server the student. I love working there. The hardest part of the job was taking two hours to get to work and two hours to get back. My most enjoyable time  on the job is serving the people. the looks on there face when they see how good my line was and how good the food look.The quality of postdoctoral positions at Northwestern University completely depends on your advisor. Mine was good and I have relatively few complaints."
236,Nova Biomedical,"Nova Biomedical is a big family company. There is a very friendly work environment where everyone talks to each other in the cafeteria. It has nice facilities but its easy to get lost in the day to day cycle as an intern.Nova Biomedical is committed to reinvesting much of its profits back into R&D to continuously push for new advancements with its products.There is no typical day.  Everyday is something different.My day begins with logging into the phone systems, answering up to 6 lines at once.  Directing the calls as requested.I handle data entry of all training documentation, reviewing these documents to assure they have met the prerequisites. Once data entry is complete I file the documents, creating new pendaflex files if needed.I upload resumes into our HRMI create badges for new employees, and reissue lost or worn out badges using our WINPAk badge system.I complete check requests as needed.As I am a team player, I will assist with what ever project needs attention.Very Challenging everyday , fun environment, you have to know to juggle work, management team are great co-workers are very nice. the hardest part of work  is waking up so early other than that I enjoy working. the most enjoyable thing at work is I got to see so many different people at work and I got to have conversation with them, it's like family like company.I have been working with Nova Biomedical for almost ten years and I have no complaints. I have been treated very fair at work.This company is privately own with a great team of people to work for. leader and innovator of the blood analyzer meters.World leader in biosensor technology.  Technology focused while maintaining the look and feel of a privately owned organization.OK. Work varies day to day. Lots of overtime and lots to learn. Management deeds improvement.Lots of traveling which I love; no micro-management; the toughest part of the job was just having to be a work at 5am; but otherwise a great job.Best work place so far,every one is frienly respectfull,profecional,you feel apreciatedManagement makes knee jerk decisions which are not well thought out. Many employees related to each other and most employees are waiting for retirement so many tasks are not completed or even cared about. In my experience customers were frustrated with lack of support from Nova. Management is not  approachable.Excellent place to work.  Very employee-oriented, and provides great benefits and opportunities to employees.I had many different functions from customer service to administrative duties. I learned how to be patient and understanding. A typical day was always very busy. The hardest part was not being able to help customers with there complete orders when there were shipping problems. Which happened maybe once or twice a week.I find my job is very enjoyable.  I get to help implement a great product.  I love educating other nurses on new technology.  I believe technology is what is going to improve patient care.  The hardest part is the traveling.  I have a family with children.  A phone call or face time is not the same as seeing them grow in person.Not a bad company. But found better career opportunity. it was my first mechanical assembler position & learned new skills.People were great to work with.Gained a lot of experience from planning to running a machine shop and medical device manufacturing.A typical day was answering a multi line phone. Customers all around the world calling with technical problems. My hardest part was listening to complaints all day long. The most enjoyable was my co-workers and how much fun we had. I learned a lot from Nova, my patients with listening, my computer skills and how to multi task. The management allowed me to be my own manager and did not micro manage me at all. Overall I had a great 23 years at Nova and would still be there if they the pay was better.In Nova i learned many things from lasering laminating and using other machines. The management is great, awesome understanding supervisors, great teams leaders who can run a great shift. There was nothing hard about the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was almost everything, i enjoyed the work the company gave me and definitly the staff employees and coworkers were good people to work with.Although it was about a year working at this company, it was an overall good experience. Enjoyed working with my colleagues/management as they were very helpful and positive at all times during my assignment there.good place to work. privately held company with a good product lineManagement was right on and efficient. Work place was clean and organized. I was a Formulation Technician and was responsible for building Biological formulations in bulk inspected and tested in Biological Analyzers. I enjoyed my job and the employees I worked with. I used scales of different sizes for measuring and used many different types of chemicals and Deionized water to mix, test and produce clean and approved agents and formulations."
6,Novartis,"Busy from start to end however I enjoy as I like to be busy. The people I work for and my colleagues are so much fun and I appreciate the opportunity to work with each one of them.

Family oriented environment.a good company, friendly work environment, career training opportunities. Decent benefits, work/life balance is OK.Traditional big pharma company which allows for numerous job opportunities to top performers. It also allows for a work environment of steady changes. The bad is generally less pay then the smaller companies as well as the small fish in big ocean feel.Many changes with moving to a BPO offshoring delivery for Fianance Procurement and HR.  Much transition but company trying to keep opportunities available and work life rewardingThis is a great company.  There's a lot of room for growth.  All that I have learned has been beneficial in other jobs I have had in my career in Manufacturing Production Department.As a Senior Lead Administative Assistant to the Group, I was responsible for the group of Administrative Assistant to the Department.  We use to meet once a month to discuss different aspects of their jobs.Depends on what group you are in.  Some understand the current culture and provide opportunities for growth, but others do not.  It can be really slow to get ideas moving forward if at all.I started with Sandoz and continued through to the evolution of Novartis, and truly enjoyed launching a new product every 18 months in the early days. Great training and support structure.Thrive in a collaborative setting and dynamic work environment.  Appreciate having that environment at Novartis, with many development opportunities available.I had a large territory, so there was no work life balance.Had several good managers that were realists.  Understood the territory and would do what they could to help me succeed.Hardest part of the job was overnights.  Home for 2 weeks, on the road for 2 weeks each month.What made the job enjoyable were the success stories from the physicians that I called on when they would tell me that my drug changed somebody's life for the better.High demanding job and still able to maintain a life/ work family balance. Comrade, relationships and ability to work together on projects keeps the workplace interesting.Interesting work; excellent pay and benefits; diverse work; currently tight expense management; diverse suite of products; focused on being an employer of choiceNovartis is a very successful company which is mainly attributed to its emphasis on innovation, research and development, retaining top talent as well as focus on safety and quality. The company is extremely focused on delivering results and the place can be intense sometimes. However if one is comfortable under pressure and is geographically mobile, the opportunities for growth are ample.Good market level compensation. 4 major layoffs over past 6 years. no promotions. Lots of great people.At the end personal experience depends on manager and department. I was lucky one.Micromanagement at its worst.  You can never trust anyone here because they will stab you in the back for personal gain.  Managers are bullies and know how to dictate only."

High integrity , people constantly getting fired, great 41k.I enjoyed the variety in my job, it never got too boring. I learned so many things about manufacturing, packaging and labeling of over the counter pharmaceuticals. I liked working in the Pilot Laboratory with the miniature size equipment compared to the commercial size equipment used in the factory. I especially liked the scale-up process, that is where I learned the most about the robustness of the formula and the process used to manufacture gets challenged.I have worked at Novartis for ten years. Love the culture of work life balance. Generally, the co-workers are nice. However, very surfaced and hard to feel genuine natures. Management is the same. Very lenient and understanding to mistakes but will use it when necessary. Benefits and compensation are great. However, there is no room for advancement if you are in a support role. You have absolutely no support and in fact, I was told to leave the company and come back. Very difficult to move ahead or change positions.a good company, friendly work environment, career training opportunities. Decent benefits, work/life balance is OK.While the company has vast resources and a stellar on boarding, and training process, The Commercial side is riddled with process and micromanagement. There's no connection with the realities that the field faces.Good market level compensation. 4 major layoffs over past 6 years. no promotions.

I came from Alcon marketing and moving to finance there was a lot to learn as it is so different from marketing. But I appreciate the challenges.The struggle comes from so many changes within Novartis. You find something that works leave it alone for awhile. I believe employees become tired due to long hours and no work/life balance. Novartis purchased Alcon so there has been a lot of adjustments within the company to be made in the last few years. Overall Novartis and Alcon are great companies.I began with the company when it was Sandoz and would have given it 5 stars.  Novartis on the other hand, not so much.  The merger certainly took it toll.  I was wearing many different hats and the monetary compensation was not the same for ex-Sandoz employees.  Ciba employs were better compensated and there was resistance in bringing Sandoz employees  to the same level.  With that said, I loved the positions I held and my (Sandoz) co-workers were great. Overall it was a great learning experience for me.  I'm sure situations must be different at this time.  I would probably work there again should the opportunity arise.•	Establish, maintain and develop strong relationships with customers and key decision makers within the practices;•	Implement current marketing strategies and initiatives;•	Manage the territory's assigned operating budget; ensuring timely expense management;•	Ensure all pricing and contracts are in-line and executed pursuant to company policy and procedures;•	Maintain accurate customer profiles and provide new customer data/sales data into company database; and•	Seamlessly communicate with the corporate sales team and account managers.Some groups have good bosses who would put efforts to help you grow your career, some keep you blinded so you won't know much and keep working for the boss cluelessly and not learn anything so you will not out grow him/her. All depends on the personality of your boss.Novartis is a pay for performance company. I have excelled in that work ethic and salesmanship. Novartis is also very team oriented.  With that in mind I have had great experiences with other professional sales reps. We all had our eyes on the prize to get the job done...right.  The hardest part of the job has been the new call number orientation. Goals have been set very high and almost impossible to attain, I have been making sales goals and ranking in the upper 10% of reps.  The most enjoyable part of the jobs has been getting to know my customers and the passion they have to help their patients. My Novartis colleagues have been wonderful through my career with Novartis. We all care about doing the right thing...everyday.Many changes with moving to a BPO offshoring delivery for Fianance Procurement and HR.  Much transition but company trying to keep opportunities available and work life rewardingNorvartis NBS has provided the opportunity to learn about HR Related services and systems.The most enjoyable part of the job is the trainings and job support offered, from Yammer to new program and team meetings/trainings.Great Work Life Balance.

Open Space work environment a plus.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxThe company offers a lot of great opportunities through varied roles for people at all levels of attained education. The company culture is based on a great foundation of ideals. The cafeteria has an amazing selection, with new daily specialties.The company offered great benefits and competitive compensation. Employees were very well taken care of. The overall atmosphere was pleasant and supportive. While encouraging learning and career development, the LAS group, which I worked for, prized efficiency and productivity above all. The upper management admittedly stifled employee aspiration within the group when positions had opened despite claims of opportunity. I enjoyed working alongside my colleagues and supervisors. Some of the skills I acquired are time management and analysis and response to adverse situations."
625,Novavax,"I loved the time I spent working at Novavax, but i got laid off. With that said the environment was great and the people there were amazing and helpful.The market knows about Novavax's unsuccessful phase 3 RSV trial. Novavax is a great place, where there should still be reason to believe in their programs. It is a great place to work, with a very personable culture. I love the company, and the employees and management. However, they are in a bit of a struggle right now due to lost value after the trial. They did just go through layoffs, and are unlikely to be hiring in the immediate future. I would go back to work there, but right now (Nov'16) would not be the time to start a new position with them.Novavax is a good place to work. They provide relatively good work environment  and benefits. In general, employees get good training and job/life balance is just right.It was a good experience to work there, however, due to the failure of phase II trail, the company is in trouble now and laid off more than 1/3 of their work force.one can typically easily finsh tasks with in the work day. There are lots of chances to improve your skill set and knowledge base. everyone is very supportive and friendly. management are open and willing to talk about how progress is going and ways that you can improve yourself. The only downside to working here is that there are some long days and long nights, but it is very fulfilling when you get a final product.I enjoyed the short time I was at Novavax. Everyone was very helpful, I learned a lot, and gained some great experience. I worked at a comfortable pace everyday and was in control of my hours and when I could break for lunch.I saw people fabricate data to please managment.  Backdating and making paperwork disappear is a daily occupance.   This place is so driven to get sponsorship they are willing to bend basic scientific ethics to get there.Like any Business, the lower management culture was very catty.As a seasoned biotech and PM professional, I can honestly say this company was the biggest disappointment of my career. Please beware!This is a public trade company relocated from North Carolina. Working at the company’s Finance department was very challenging due to SEC reporting and SOX compliance deadlines. I have worked at all tasks of SEC reporting, SOX compliance, month end close, FAS123R, Fixed Assets, Audit and etc. which significantly enhanced my professional skills and knowledge.The hardest part of the job was to meet job responsibilities and deadlines with limited resource. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new skills and knowledge.friendly, collaborative colleagues, effective and kind management team, good life and work balanceWork in PD is driven my senior management/VPs, not data collected from actual experiments.The company is currently developing into a wonderful work environment."

Get a long and work well with my co-workers.Greet Customers I enjoyed working around military etcGood managementPersonally I worked at NSA for 2 years and it is not a recommended place of work by myself, due to the very short breaks, un-appreciation and lack of a health safe environment, if you do end up working here, ask for a RESPIRATOR! preserve your health.A very friendly atmosphere where I was able to perform at a high level due to the excellent training I received early on.Fast pace environment, Learned all mode of transportationLegally informed DOT rules and regsI  loved working at NSA, of course there were long days but it was fun and we were busy so that made the day go by fast. A typical work day i would go in pick up my order list and go to my desk separate them and pick the product from the floor then pack and ship the product. Everyday was usually a busy day. Because my father was part owner of the company the manager didn't really like me but i didn't let keep me from doing my job. I got along with most of my coworkers of course you know in every company theres always a trouble maker or someone who don't like you but other then that i got along with everybody. The hardest part of the job i would say some of my coworkers were very lazy and didn't do there job which made it hard for me to do mine. I loved going in everyday Because it was fun and i liked what i did. I i liked the security of the job and knowing that i would always have a job and benefits.I have played softball since I was a little girl so still staying connected with the sport is a dream!  Its only during the summer and only on weekend.  I try my best to umpire all that I can because i love being outside and working with these young ladies!Supervisor's unbearable- Verbally abusive and unprofessional.  A typical day was a major marathon.  Had to literally run to each work station all day and provide all the necessary materials.  However a part of me still loved all the different thing's I did.  Creatively it was stimulating.  I love to sew.We were not allowed to talk.  So getting to know people was hard.Arrive 15 minutes prior to clock in time  . A  brief talk with supervisor and obtain assignment for shift. This can mean quite a variety of assignments and types of machines I could be running for the shift. Report to job site and converse with co-workers/worker about job specifics. Clock in and start job with packet.The hardest part of the job is keeping a machine producing perfect parts with a human at the controls.The most enjoyable part of the job is that I learn something new everydayThere were no typical days, I would just assist with various projects. My mangers were very flexible with my school schedule.NSA is a great organization for those seeking to increase their abilities as a public speaker. Very insightful and valuable information is presented by established speakers from various parts of the United States.Clock in and start scanning finished product on single ship line 2 and 4. When order shipments are complete we build product according to inventory level.Learned how to read blueprints. Use micrometers, calipers, depth gauges, and set up machine's. My co-workers were fine to work with. The hardest part was standing all day with poor air ventilation. The best part was my co-workers.Although the owner was great, his management team lacked education and knowledge to run a once small company effectively in todays world. Therefore there was no room to grow because the management team were all ""friends"".No work dealing with Logistics, only Intel. Had other personnel that handle logistics."
703,Nutanix,"i feel very calm and peace, the flow of work is awesome. As the atmosphere, environment is excellent.               my team was working hard share the knowledge on project during meeting and working on code specially.Communication is lacking in certain departments. Exponential growth of employees. Great benefits for full time employees.Great medical benefits. Company provides employees with various amenities. Start up company. Needs processes and procedures to help organize the company.Best place I have ever seen to work. Best work life balance. supportive environmentFree lunch is best thing they are providing. Management team behave like normal employee, so work together with every single employee.It's a very exciting workplace! In true start-up fashion, there's always a fire put out somewhere, but the culture thrives on the set pace. The culture in general is good and is being maintained fairly well for how fast we've grown and are growing. Change does happen, albeit slowly. There's also free food, massages, beer bashes, and GREAT health benefits!I spent a lot of my day cold calling and prospecting, it was a hard job but very rewarding. My team is very supportive and I enjoy my job.Friendly teams and good life-work balance. Been a pleasure working here and getting to know the product.I learned about the product and how each of contributes to the product and also how it helps other businesses.Love working with Nutanix. Great company, great culture. Drive is a bit much, going from Raleigh to Durham every day is exhausting."
266,Nvidia,"People are friendly.  Really organized.  I learned a lot about the systems and how everything worked at the site.  Management was great.  The only thing I really did not like was the fact that growth opportunities took a while.  I have a lot of experience in security but needed to be patient in order to grow in the company.Working is not clearly directed. Direction is being changed every moment. Management has no enough experience to work on the system product and handing the people who from various cultures previously.Nvidia was a great company to work with. Employees are smart and creative thinker. Company takes care of its employees.You would learn a lot of new technologies here.Nvidia is one of the best company. I learned lot from my team. People are very cooperative. Sometimes, work load was not manageable but over all I rate 5 out of 5.Great co-workers, fun, challenging innovative products.  Upper management tends to have unrealistic schedule expectations that leads to long hours, stress and low morale.Every GPU cycle presents new challenges, features and work. Nvidia constantly pushes the envelopes in all aspects and leads the industry with new technologies.Most of the time, I am working with multiple teams to bring new chips and features to market. I am constantly learning and am supported by capable leaders and peers.Constantly working on new features and different teams across the world means I'm working around the clock. Work/life balance is reasonable but at times can be quite challenging over long periods of time. Management has good vision and direction. CEO is always thinking years in advance and pivots the company when beneficial to the future. Nvidia is constantly pushing gross margins which can be felt at the engineering level. Intent is good but can be overly restrictive at times (e.g.: lab equipment, computer purchases, etc).Was very informative to learn about how conferences work from outside in. Worked from checkin to after party and concluded with take down of the event. Was a great learning experience working along side the Events team at Nvidia.it is good company and really friendly environment to work with. My daily responsibilities are debugging, troubleshoot and fixing all the RMA devices. Sometime i have to work with software engineer in flashing and making sure the devices have a good and functioning image. I have enjoy and love to work for this company.As with many big corporations, there's a big game being played on employees..here it was primarily using West Valley Staffing, the in house staffing agency to lure people in with potential jobs at a growing co/dept but in fact, the department has NO requisition/authority to make this contractor a permanent employee, and NO incentive to, because WV pays below market, with almost no benefits, no sick time, no holiday pay unless you've been there 6 mos, etc. Good luck going through years of being underpaid, below market, for the ""hopes"" of becoming a permanent employee.  (stories of people being contractors for 2-5 years abound)And the other game is people working cross functionally, with reporting/performance/pay managed by one manager, but actual work and projects with multiple managers who don't communicate, so no one really knows everything you're being asked to do, or should be paid to do.One thing to remember before starting a job at NVIDIA that is, you are responsible for your work. Super Cool people and super smart minds. Your every word has weight. So when you say something to management or peers you better get it done because your word stands for your commitment. You will get all the help you need but you gotta ask for it. Nobody is going to do spoon feeding for you. The best part about it is you will learn a lot in the process and you feel confident. That's my best take away from NVIDIA.fair place to work, the culture is not so good in my team, but some team is better, pretty much depend on the style of the managerManagement is off hand which provides personal growth There is a lot of room for creativity. Work here to work in a environment that promotes growth.Nvidia is a great company to work for.   It is well known for GPU products using in gaming and High Performance Computing.  It is growing in Visual Computing  and Virtual RealityThis was a volunteer experience in which I setup monitors, booths, posters, and tables for the GTC conference. In addition I help setup lan cables in each room to provide everyone with a connection to the internet. This is one of the most memorable and enjoyable volunteer work I have ever done. Talking to the executives during the conference and learning about IT and how important it is before a day of a big event opens my eyes about the men and women of the IT industry.The company is run by  business savvy engineers which is quite rare for a company of this size.  The primary focus in the mobile products is always on delivery of a quality product.The CEO has demonstrated the ability to make strategic investments without bending to shareholder fickleness.  Sometimes these investments work out, other times they do not.  This is extremely important for companies long term health.The company focuses hiring on top talent across the industry.  This results in a diverse workforce that may be overwhelmed but is generally quite technically competent.This company has no regard for you or your family.  As long as you perform you will be OK...but if you are not a culture fit.  Good bye.    It is micromanaged by a megalomanic.  And frankly there is not much upside in their product line.  Intel will eventually eat their lunch.highly talented peoplegood managementgood base packageco-workers support is very goodgood work-life balanceCompany always tries to come up with good products and has courage to enter new markets.Nvidia is a great place to work, but it's lacking when it comes to having a conducive environment for younger or start-upy kinds of employees. It's a very classic style of doing business, and many of the middle people (who've been there for less than 10 years) will tell you that you could do worse in many places, but you could also easily do a lot better.Management is pretty hands off, certain ones will micromanage, but in general the structure of power is accessible from the lower rungs. The hardest part of my position was being one of the very few people who represented the target market/audience, and so many of the people making these products wouldn't ever consume them, and that dissonance was aggravating to be around.Learning and Development team at Nvidia is fairly new and still going through growing pains. There is immense potential for great stuff here but the lack of accountability is the crux of the problem. A lot of the times we over promise and under deliver. That doesn't help matters for a young team that is still finding a place of its own. My grouse is that we are still considered a non essential function and pretty much operate like a service organization instead of being strategic!This was my first professional job. I suffered a lot but also learned a lot from my co workers and colleagues! Even though I left that industry but I still miss them!Loved working here.  I probably learned the most about being QA here than anywhere else.  The people are all great and never was left without equipment to test with."

I have a lot of experience in security but needed to be patient in order to grow in the company.Working is not clearly directed. Direction is being changed every moment. Management has no enough experience to work on the system product and handing the people who from various cultures previously.Nvidia was a great company to work with. Employees are smart and creative thinker. Company takes care of its employees.You would learn a lot of new technologies here.Nvidia is one of the best company. I learned lot from my team. People are very cooperative. Sometimes, work load was not manageable but over all I rate 5 out of 5.Great co-workers, fun, challenging innovative products.  Upper management tends to have unrealistic schedule expectations that leads to long hours, stress and low morale.Every GPU cycle presents new challenges, features and work. Nvidia constantly pushes the envelopes in all aspects and leads the industry with new technologies.Most of the time, I am working with multiple teams to bring new chips and features to market. I am constantly learning and am supported by capable leaders and peers.Constantly working on new features and different teams across the world means I'm working around the clock. Work/life balance is reasonable but at times can be quite challenging over long periods of time. Management has good vision and direction. CEO is always thinking years in advance and pivots the company when beneficial to the future. Nvidia is constantly pushing gross margins which can be felt at the engineering level. Intent is good but can be overly restrictive at times (e.g.: lab equipment, computer purchases, etc).Was very informative to learn about how conferences work from outside in. Worked from checkin to after party and concluded with take down of the event. Was a great learning experience working along side the Events team at Nvidia.it is good company and really friendly environment to work with. My daily responsibilities are debugging, troubleshoot and fixing all the RMA devices. Sometime i have to work with software engineer in flashing and making sure the devices have a good and functioning image. I have enjoy and love to work for this company.As with many big corporations, there's a big game being played on employees..here it was primarily using West Valley Staffing, the in house staffing agency to lure people in with potential jobs at a growing co/dept but in fact, the department has NO requisition/authority to make this contractor a permanent employee, and NO incentive to, because WV pays below market, with almost no benefits, no sick time, no holiday pay unless you've been there 6 mos, etc. Good luck going through years of being underpaid, below market, for the ""hopes"" of becoming a permanent employee.  (stories of people being contractors for 2-5 years abound)And the other game is people working cross functionally, with reporting/performance/pay managed by one manager, but actual work and projects with multiple managers who don't communicate, so no one really knows everything you're being asked to do, or should be paid to do.One thing to remember before starting a job at NVIDIA that is, you are responsible for your work. Super Cool people and super smart minds. Your every word has weight. So when you say something to management or peers you better get it done because your word stands for your commitment. You will get all the help you need but you gotta ask for it. Nobody is going to do spoon feeding for you. The best part about it is you will learn a lot in the process and you feel confident. That's my best take away from NVIDIA.fair place to work, the culture is not so good in my team, but some team is better, pretty much depend on the style of the managerManagement is off hand which provides personal growth There is a lot of room for creativity. Work here to work in a environment that promotes growth.Nvidia is a great company to work for.   It is well known for GPU products using in gaming and High Performance Computing.  It is growing in Visual Computing  and Virtual RealityThis was a volunteer experience in which I setup monitors, booths, posters, and tables for the GTC conference. In addition I help setup lan cables in each room to provide everyone with a connection to the internet. This is one of the most memorable and enjoyable volunteer work I have ever done. Talking to the executives during the conference and learning about IT and how important it is before a day of a big event opens my eyes about the men and women of the IT industry.The company is run by  business savvy engineers which is quite rare for a company of this size.  The primary focus in the mobile products is always on delivery of a quality product.The CEO has demonstrated the ability to make strategic investments without bending to shareholder fickleness.  Sometimes these investments work out, other times they do not.  This is extremely important for companies long term health.The company focuses hiring on top talent across the industry.  This results in a diverse workforce that may be overwhelmed but is generally quite technically competent.This company has no regard for you or your family.  As long as you perform you will be OK...but if you are not a culture fit.  Good bye.    It is micromanaged by a megalomanic.  And frankly there is not much upside in their product line.  Intel will eventually eat their lunch.highly talented peoplegood managementgood base packageco-workers support is very goodgood work-life balanceCompany always tries to come up with good products and has courage to enter new markets.Nvidia is a great place to work, but it's lacking when it comes to having a conducive environment for younger or start-upy kinds of employees. It's a very classic style of doing business, and many of the middle people (who've been there for less than 10 years) will tell you that you could do worse in many places, but you could also easily do a lot better.Management is pretty hands off, certain ones will micromanage, but in general the structure of power is accessible from the lower rungs. The hardest part of my position was being one of the very few people who represented the target market/audience, and so many of the people making these products wouldn't ever consume them, and that dissonance was aggravating to be around.Learning and Development team at Nvidia is fairly new and still going through growing pains. There is immense potential for great stuff here but the lack of accountability is the crux of the problem. A lot of the times we over promise and under deliver. That doesn't help matters for a young team that is still finding a place of its own. My grouse is that we are still considered a non essential function and pretty much operate like a service organization instead of being strategic!This was my first professional job. I suffered a lot but also learned a lot from my co workers and colleagues! Even though I left that industry but I still miss them!Loved working here.  I probably learned the most about being QA here than anywhere else.  The people are all great and never was left without equipment to test with."
433,NYC Parks Dept,"My view was great being with the NYC part department , great , respectable, hard working employees, work with people on hours that fit your needs, I wish I was able to stay at this job but it was or for temporary.Not a long term career. Agency does not back up its officers when they try to enforce park rules and laws. Very political and difficult to advance. It is Mandatory to work all weekends as well. Not worth it for the salary they pay.Employers are rude and disrespectful. Mean and degrading. The supervisors treat employees bad. Failing parks make it hard for jtp's to work. Needs new management.cleaned parks by picking up litter, cleaning bathrooms, removing graffiti, changing garbage bags, raking leaves, painting, keeping an eye out for needles and disposing it in a proper manner.  I learned to work with others as a team and  how to communicate in a proper manner. management was great always kept us in check and made sure everyone got to take part in every work activity that was provided. the most enjoyable part of working with the parks department was being able to see the children play at a clean and safe park. knowing that we are there to keep the parks clean for them n the smiles they had on there face made me happy.I really enjoyed working for the parks dept. there was plenty room for advancement the only down side was having to work with people that didn't want to work.I loved working at Rockaway. The people I worked with were great. We became more of a family then coworkers. I could never forget working in Rockaway. Working at the beach has taught me the meaning of team work. There 's always a possibility of people struggling to come back to shore, being intoxicated, being compliant, etc. You really need to focus and be able to go at any given moment.It waas fun everyday. I learned to document any situation that needed to be written down etc. My co waorkers were great and teh hardest pat of the job was leaving when it was so much fun!"
528,NYCEDC,"I really enjoyed working with everyone at NYC Build It Back. Great job culture and the people who I worked with were very friendly and very professional. Each day at work, I worked on a project that helped a victim of Hurricane Sandy. I liked working with the management because they were approachable and were open to suggestion. I learned how to use CMS on the computer. The hardest part of this job was leaving due to my contract as temporary ended."
504,NYU Langone Medical Center,"A great place to work. Staff and management are very friendly and make you feel like home!!! Happy to come to work everyday and motivated as well. Great placeThis was one of my first jobs out of college, so I wasn't making much money as an analyst. However, we were able to take grad school classes at a discount, which was really great.good group to work with and knowledgeable about processes.  management changed, however, still maintained focus on science and operations.  great group.Before they were bought out they were a decent company to work for. Not organized, HR was slow in getting back to you about anything. More like a small mom and pop organization.I have grown as an individual since I started working here, co-workers are fun to be around and very helpful. There is always room for growth and expansion, the job itself is very manageable.typical day at this job taking patient vitals and preparing them for examination from the doctor. good days and bad days but I always kept a smile on my face because I know most people don't like coming to the doctor. So many different people from different cultures. my co-workers was awesome always a good day.NYU Langone was a fast past working environment where deadlines needed to be met immediately. I worked in the finance department at this company. I inputed data, worked proficiently using Microsoft Office applications and setting up routine computer procedures to resolve simple software/hardware problems, accessing emails, electronic records and other basic office support software. Some of my employers were difficult to work with however I've always been able to separate personal from business.  Although I may not have agreed with someones process I pride myself on being a good teammate to get a job done.NYU Langone Medical Center is an excellent place to work. The staff is kind, hardworking, and dedicated to exceptional patient care.Typical day of work starts by reading emails and prioritizing your daily task. Prep faculty meetings for each course sessions with follow ups. Weekly meeting with deans and management. Review educational courses with directors.  Contact vendors and speakers for special events and training.  Collect all data and educational materials needed for the Inter-Clerkship courses.  The hardest part of the job was to get all the educators, directors, deans and management to agree to a specific educational course for the clerkship. It was a horrible battle of brains and egos. Best part of the job was my co-workers who supported me. It was a family type bond that kept me going.i love working there, the staff and doctors are great and so are the patients. its just awesome overall. there is short to no breaks and always be on your toes because it gets really busyI have worked at NYU Medical Center in Radiation Oncology for 14 years.  I was trained on the job in all aspects of clinical work and QA.  I passed my board exams and have continued to grow in all areas of clinical and research.  I have developed departmental policies and procedures.  On a daily basis, I manage the HDR program.  I strive to make the department more organized and efficient.Been here now 8 years love it. Very friendly, loving place to be an work. Over all exciting place to work wonderful staff, loving nurses and Dr's. Nyu one of the best hospitals in NYCWorking for NYU Langone Medical Center was the beginning to my exceptional potential in Finance. I started my career as an Financial Analyst Associate working with the analysis and invoicing of federal and non-federal grants. I managed and submitted invoices to the project coordinator for six clinical research departments. I worked closely with the manager and analyst to assure accuracy and timely execution of documentation and expenditures for quarterly, monthly or annually invoicing of expenditures for payment. I submitted over thirty invoices monthly following all policies and procedures of the authorization submitted from the administrator for NIH funding. I created journal entries in the general ledger for transferring of fund information. I reconciled expenses that hit after the project period and recorded transaction on the next invoice submission. I worked very closely to all teams assisting with information that they may not be able to acquire because of there obligations to finishing financial reports. I learned a lot from being pro active; now I am able to work autonomously which lessens micro management when completing tasks. I complied documentation for the A-133 and all three years we  exceptional with the reports as a team and organization.I really love this per diem job. I enjoy doing IV's and teaching new floor nurses who are just learning to do IVs when the opportunity comes up. There is great teamwork amongst the nurses on the Vascular Access Team and that makes it always a pleasant day there.I love working here but I would like to see more opportunitied to grow.Its a small hospital, the environment is freindly and not as hectic as other hospitals. We have great management, freindly co-workers, and I enjoy the fact that I get off fairly early each day.This was a great experience. Professional work environment. Multiple work sites available for per diem shifts.i am still signed with this company and will return if i ever live in NY again.NYU Langone Medical Center is one of the best places to work.  I enjoyed my time there. And I will gladly go back.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the culture of the company.  People stay there for over 45 years there.Great management, great perks, room for advancement. Healthcare team works well together with the common goal of patient care in mind. Nurses are treated well, they're encouraged to further their education and are pushed to do better and better. Lots of support provided. Salary is great for manhattan living.-Great team -Wonderful work-life balance-Flexible hours-Flexible scheduling-Get to choose department-Great co-volunteersI really do not think that after spending all this time on your site I should be made to write you a story or review on a company. I don't want to do that. I object to being funneled into your market research.maybe it has to do with where you are placed, but my employers office was bought by NYULMC in november, and since then it brought nothing but chaos. E-mails weren't answered in a timely fashion, questions were never answered. i waited about 8 months for the site manager to hand me rules for medical records. everything is unorganized and chaotic. there is favoritsm and BULLYING. i felt very uncomfortable as to how i was spoken to.  One office manager felt like she had something against me and was always after me. i wouldn't mind working for NYU, but the faculty group practice where i was, was all over the place, and i would NEVER go back there."
526,ObjectWin Technology,"I enjoyed the Placement/assignment that I got in Starwood Hotels, but I thought Objectwin could have Tried a lot harder to get me a New assignment when it Ended!!!My experience with ObjectWin has been very positive. Once placed in my contract position, ObjectWin has been hands off unless I have questions for them. They are prompt with replies. I do get weekly reminders to submit my timecard which I don't need, but the connection is nice. I do get health insurance benefits, but they are not great - a very high deductible. No vacation and no holiday pay.Good pay / hour.  401K 3% match.  No vacation.  Standard medical / dental.  All hiring and paperwork are handled remotely.  Most of the company is out of India.Joined as an Executive in Pre-Sales Department. Learnt a lot about the market. Very friendly staff and encouraging Managers. There is always a healthy competition among the employees.This place was my first to work in USA, I was quite worried about how I will learn and work there. But my supervisor was so patient and friendly, helped me in every step when I was in learning processs. The management was helpful as well, how ever like every place there were some areas which needed some attentions. The best part was I was given all the independence and resources I needed to resolve the issues. I loved working there every moment. Had wonderful and relaxing  lunch time, when we used to discuss the ways how to improve the policies as at that time my supervisor was working on make a HR Handbook.We had a bad experience with this company. They hired an employee and terminated him without giving any reason that too in a week. No compensation was provided. The company is extremely unprofessional, just a slaughter house.  They do not accept calls, they do not answer mails once they terminate the employee. If you are hired by ObjectWin, you are doomed!Watch out if you have to sign up for any contracts with them. They are sneaky. Not reliable! Another exploiting Indian company!They find you an assignment, once assignment ends they don't try to find you another assignment.  You call and you have to leave a message on vmail.  They never return your calls.  They don't  communicate.  Very unprofessional people.Participate in daily scrum meeting, share with the team what I've worked on the previous day and what I'll be working on today. See, what all the other team members are working on which includes other    developer, and SMEs. Making sure to update my status in Agile Mgr. and continue to work on my immediate assignments.Poor physical work environmentMany systems and procedures to learnManagement very hands offTerrible work conditionsSmall Consulting company and I had good experience considering where I was in my career at that pointObjectwin technologies works very hard to locate a place of work for potential employees. I never had any trouble with pay, taking off, emergencies, tc. Thex were always available and there to help meet my direct needs. I woukd reccomend this company.Great place to work. This is smaller company with unlimited potential to grow.Great people to work with, Everyone was really Friendly and supportiveCo workers were hard to work withDays use to start late and ended early."
585,OBXtek Inc.,"Was laid off due to performance issue but given no verbal or written documentation explaining what the issues were. I just got a call one morning from PM saying I am off the contract due to the Fed's sayingI was not training up fast enough. Two things here went wrong. 1) I should have been counseled by the PM prior to being notified. 2)The PM should have investigated the issues and not let the Fed's influence them as I don't work for the Fed's I worked for OBX.It is not up to a Fed to say who goes or who gets hired it up to the contract.I actually liked the job and it was a up training for me but it certainly was not out of my realm of knowledge. I was actually doing 70% of the job in the short amount of time.All I can say is this is a horrible company to work with and for.  AVOID!.  Owner hires Project Managers that don't know a thing about Federal contracts or any experience with Information Technology.  Saw a complete turn over of staff due to the mismanagement of the Project Managers lack of experience with Gov Contracts.  Had numerous complaints to the owner of the company but was told he can't touch the project manager due to a contract they had with him.  I saw 1 co-worker forced to be fired by the Gov Contract agency due to PM mis-mismanagement and 1 was written up for providing passwords that the PM requested even though the PM had not been PIV'd, he should not of even been allowed in the building............I realized quickly upon joining OBXtek that I had an opportunity to roll up my sleeves and be part of real team of professionals. Hard working and very smart people who legitimately take pride in their work. I am looking forward to working with this team again and wish them the best as they grow!I just started at OBXtek and couldn't be happier.  Ignore the negative press.  Ignore the negative internet chatter from their competitors."
651,OGSystems,"company works in the National Intelligence arena, supporting various government intelligence agencies.  Co-workers were great, work hours are a bit flexible.Payroll and timekeeping administrator. I enjoy getting to work with our employees on a daily basis and show why OGSystems is a game changer in the IC community.A small company that offers some of the great benefits that go with that, great compensation, good benefits, ect.  The downside of working for a small business is the lack of job security.  Overall a highly dedicated group of individuals working to provide great customer satisfaction"
352,Okta,"Okta is the foundation for secure connections between people and technology. Our IT products uniquely use identity information to grant people access to applications on any device at any time, while still enforcing strong security protections. Our platform securely connects companies to their customers and partners. Today, thousands of organizations trust Okta to help them fulfill their missions as quickly as possible.Working at Okta has been absolutely great thus far. After 6 months, I have personally seen the things they told me about in the interviews (mainly being opportunity for advancement). The work life balance is excellent - work hard, play hard."
434,On-Board Services,The job was enjoyable. I did not care for the benefits package or lack there of. The management team was there for the company and could care less about the employees and their rights.
448,OnDeck,"A typical day at work would be making somewhere between 75-200 cold calls. I would pitch deals in a consultative process to really hone in on their ROI. My co-workers and management were supportive and available for any questions I may have.It is a good place to work with a competitive environment, fast paced and thrilling. I received the best training one can ask for. I learned how to run an organization on that scale successfully.OnDeck is a greta company to work of.  I strongly believe attitude reflects leadership.  The leadership at OnDeck can be seen in how the employees communicate with each other and in their work product.  Everyone at OnDeck works hard.  Even in the hardest part of the day, I could look up from my screen and see  my coworkers working away.  That would inspire me to keep doing my best regardless of how tired I was.  Every day at OnDeck was enjoyable."
125,Oneida Total Integrated Enterprises,"Oneida Total Integrated Enterprises sets the bar very high for professionalism and job requirement's. At the same time they provide the incentive and resources to be able to achieve the goals and objective set before you.  Very challenging, very rewarding"
783,OneRoof Energy,"No room for growth unless you know someone or have an in.  It is hard to get management opportunity unless you are in someone elses pocket.good company, great environment. good benefits but poor compensation . Great location. Very fast paced. Every other week there is a meeting to discuss business and direction company is taking, results, etc.Good place to work and grow your career. Business casual fun environment. Good co-workers. And  management. Recommend others to work thereI managed all day-to-day call center operations including lead generation, call campaigns, customer care, sales and engineering. A typical day would consist of me starting the early morning meeting, then executing an outbound dialer campaign for the call center reps.I monitor calls while they are on the phone, and also continue to monitor calls afterwards as well. Upon listening to these calls, I offered my advice on the calls, and set up all reports for metrics going forward.I handled the incentive payout for the day and also made sure the engineering team had a chain of qualified solar leads go through so we we could sell solar systems.Fast moving environment with great employees.  Company is still in start up phase but has great potential.  Enjoyed working with employees to provide excellent HR services including benefits administration and onboarding.  Responsible for automating and updating processes.this was a company that had alot that I could learn and did learn. My skills with excel and Quickbooks increased. The accounting team was seperated based on project and corporate areas, I was the only person involved on both teams due to client promotional payouts.Start early, end late, need more resources.Learned that start ups are risky!Mixed review of management.Staff works hard.Tough not knowing if/who will survive.Best reward is solar is increasing across the U.S.enjoyed working for this wonderful solar companywonderful work place, fantastic opportunity for growth- great corporate culture- awesome managersOne Roof develops a proprietary application that provides an end to end transaction platform for solar financing.

I'm used to working in larger, enterprise level engagements so this was a chance to really get my hands dirty and wear a lot of different hats.Good place to work with decent compensation - the company is very receptive to new ideas and suggestionsA typical day at work consists of managing leasing agreements from initiation to completion.

409,Open Systems Technologies,"Worked for Company as fill in. was Level 2 tech, Data migration specialistWorking at open systems is great. Every employee is given freedom to work on whatever they want. If you do not perform they will let you go. If you are doing great you can come and go as  you please.Great location in the city, with a great culture that encourages you to take breaks, because they know that when you get back to work, you'll be better for it.Loved going to trade shows and speaking about the new products we were producing at the time. new and exciting work environment.Loved working here, gained a lot of experience. Had the pleasure of learning about the different aspects of the mortgage industry.Provides good consulting opportunities in the banking sector. Has got a presence in most of the major investment banks and asset management firms in the New York area.I wouldn't suggest working here if you are not experienced from a previous company. They don't have a formal training program and are not capable of proper training.Nice to be part of open systems consulting , very clear and communication form top to management . Always there to help for any need related to personal attentions or professional decisions.I loved working for Open Systems Technologies. My counselor  always kept in touch with me and gave me lots of encouragement. I loved the company I worked for and enjoyed my time there and my co-workers.Position was temp contract for reviewing medical insurance data base.  Potentially good company although management was in process of realignment in department worked.From my very first day at Open Systems I received no training what so ever. Management was nice and wanted to see me succeed but they did very little to provide me with any extra tools to do so. You must get there early and leave late, and every day is busier than the last. If you do something that is good you must keep moving because everyone but you will have forgotten about it by the next day. The co-workers were very pleasant but they are very busy as well which makes them less inclined to help you as needed with no formal training. I learned to work hard, be independent, find answers for myself, and always show determination.This company saw the evolution of business where technology was concerned and provided an innovative option for record-keeping. For companies in the Bahamas that opted to have files electronically converted, Open Systems is able to facilitate the transition. In the business world, companies are always evolving technologically thus making a small company like Open Systems viable and successful.The new people who trained with me and the other teams were very nice and so helpful. My experienced teammates were just the opposite. I miss the bigger paycheck, but not the attitude.Great people, great vision, great environment.  This company is employee-focused and has a passion to make a positive difference in everything they do.Got more hands on experience dealing with Cisco and other network equipment that I didn't before. Increased responsibility handling more end users as a site contact.A typical day involved scanning filing and being part of a team. Occasional book keeping for accountants. Data entry knowledge is a must.Although I only spoke with staff by phone they were very helpful and courteous! Open Systems is a staffing center. There is not a review for the company.Open Systems is a contract placement firm.  I have found them very professional, competent, and fair-minded.  They work hard to keep you working.My reporting manager was someone who loved to share market info and teach you the right techniques. An open door policy, it was an awesome experience.Great pay and great culture.Learned a lot about the consulting worldFair and engaging managementVery friendly coworkersConstant changeThey are quick to implement descision as soon as they can see what needs to be done"
73,OpenTable,"Insured that clients were kept updated on the status of reservation to their satisfaction. Welcomed and seated clients, making sure tables were set and ready as soon as possible to insure smooth turnover of clients during dinner service. In charge of reservations via OpenTable, as well as scheduling hours for hostess shifts, and training of new hostesses.Fun Job.  Not what it used to be.  The fraternity that is ""The directors"" cannot be trifled with.  Butt-kissers will do well.  If you cross the female director with anything other than submissiveness, your fate is sealed.productive work in a laid back environment. Great benefits- tons of room for growth.Some managers were VERY inflexible.  Sometimes it seemed a little unfair, like it seemed like promotions were given based on who management likes, and not work quality.  Co-workers were all great, I had a lot of fun working here and learned a lot.Its a great place to work, I love my co workers and management team."
695,Opera,Great operating system. Not sure what else to say.I am well versed in the operating system and always enjoyed using it. I loved using itNice to work in an opera house.The repertoire is amazing and it's wonderful to be able to play and perform almost every day.Opera is a computer system used at IHG hotels. I've used it at all holiday inns I have been with and liked it all all properties
49,Oracle,"The experience I have gained here has challenged me and allowed me to continue to learn and explore. It has also helped me to understand the environment of a large corporation. I enjoy my co-workers and learn something new from them everyday. Since we are scattered across the country, its challenging to not have hands-on training, which is the hardest part of my job. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to know my customers, being their support contact, and researching their needs.Oracle is good company to work. Offers a lot of opportunities. Learned about NPI process steps. Financially very strong.This required a lot of travel so if you do not like traveling this could be a problem.  There is not much office interaction and management is usually remote.My time at Oracle was tremendous. The products, services and people are truly amazing. I learned what it takes for an enterprise organization to function within the technology industry. Great co-workers, great leaders.My employment was through an acquisition. The company is not very friendly towards the customers or employees that it acquired. The processes only work well for Oracle and not so much for acquired companies. The internal processes are very difficult to navigate and it will often feel as though you have to fight to get things accomplished. Nothing is resolved quickly.This job was great to work at and learn but unfortunately I did not foresee much room for growth. My co-workers were always willing to lend a hand and so was the business manager. Sadly, many people would leave the company after a few years due to little opportunities in career advancement and compensation.Working at Oracle/Taleo I have learned the HR tracking applications.   Within this application, I am supporting existing clients, consultants with basic configuration questions and bug related issues.   Working on this application requires indepth troubleshooting skills, patience, excellent customer service skills.The company is a huge mix of millennials and a little bit of professionals. The pay is okay, could be better. After a Re-org and now the acquisition of NetSuite, the future seems dim. Seeking something new, bur taking my time as it is not awful here, just not settled in and really don't plan to do so.* dynamic work environment* inexperienced management* not so steady co-workers* frequent organizational changes* learned a lot on Oracle's engineered systemsIt was challenging, but people do want and need Consulting Services from Oracle.  It is more a matter of the sales setup, in terms of who gets credit for what, which turned out to be the most challenging part of the job.Set boundaries early as it relates to your personal life. Average hours worked were 50+hrs. Great colleagues - intelligent hard workers. High emphasis on automation.Oracle is a very good company to work for. I worked from home, and become very good at figuring things out on my own. Their intranet is where you find out what you need to know. Due to many mergers and acquisitions, there were always new products to add to our sales portfolio. With the move to cloud based technologies, ongoing learning is part of the culture. I enjoyed the learning experiences while working there, and the people are top notch to work with.Oracle provided me with a lot of amazing resources and opportunities. At the same time, the culture is a bit stale and management didn't seem to care much about our success.Good job advancement.  Benefits were good, but they were a little pricey.  I had the ability to work from home.  My manager allowed me to manage my own schedule.Friendly enviornment at workplace. You get more work-life balance, its like fun and work at your workplace with your colleagues. Apart from work, you get good social network with your co-workers and in other team members.Its a place you go to for a good work life balance. However, if someone is looking to work in a challenging and high growth environment - this is not a place for him/her.Oracle is a great company to work at if you want to save money in your 401K, not a good place if you want to enjoy your job. I can only speak for the sales department. It's easy, but not many people like it.Oracle is well established company with lot of technical and business depth and a stable place to work at. The company is in a process of going through change in order to respond to the changes in the industry.Excellent Work place, would def recommend working at Oracle. good team environment and a potential to make a good living.Company provides a lot of support for training, but upward mobility is limited unless you have a supportive manager. Patches are inconsistent. High turnover.Awesome people to work for. Great management and location. They work hard to allow advancement in the company. Would work there again."

757,Oxy,"Most management is awesome, as well as other individual contributors. I love that they promote within, as opposed to outsourcing.There were opportunities to move up, but the oil and gas industry is very competitive. No type of job security. Management is very backwards, and most of the time didn't understand what our jobs were.worldwide company that gave me a lot of experience with customs and frieght forwarder. company was manged very well. would work there again if it was an optionbusy day. good co workers, management very nice. enjoyed my job. Enjoyed assisting customers. I learned what I could about crude hauling and some of the dispatchingnice work camp, hot meals, very cold, extreme working conditions at times.  Friendly people.  Not much to do during your time off.It's always a fun day at work because of the people that we work with. We believe in making the best of every day. I learn something new all the time. The hardest part of my job is not being able to help those in need when i know they are truly struggling and have done all they can on their end to make the best out of their situation. And the most enjoyable part of the job is at the same time providing support and any assistance to those who truly need it.NICE ENOUGHI learned to make myself and my family come first, there was no management. the hardest part was no sleep for 30+ hrs while getting no respect. the best part of this experience is that I learned the grass is not always greener on the other side,Great company.  Incredibly busy during the 15 months of my employment.  Pleasant co-workers, friendly management.  Work was scheduled for alternate Fridays off.Nothing was typical here, I learned that I respect structure and management input in the workplace. ""Coworker"" Controlling, bossy and insulting. The hardest part was being put down and micro managed by coworker. Working at home.Co workers were fun to work withManagement was really goodEquipment is old, not up to dateExcelleng place to grow and get lots of responsibility. Very well integrated team members. Good mentors and advisors for beginners. Plenty of opportunities to outside on the fieldi would like to work in your company and will do my best to increase the company's profit and productivity. thank uOXY / CRC is a good company to work for.

244,P&G,"Proctor & Gamble has a great history of promoting within their business. I managed over 150 employees and practiced this on a daily bases. I coached employees to be hard working and improve their people skills.Procter and gamble was a good experience warehouse job. I like the people and the hands on work that I had to complete daily. The pay rate was good and the management was really good with benefits.it a nice warehouse with fast pace workers.We had to pick up material from the machines with the forklift and take them back to there assigned spots. We continually repeated the same steps till all material was cleared off the floor.duties would include: inspection of forklift that I was assigned to that day, after which I would spend the rest of the shift scanning warehouse product and then moving the product efficiently to desired location.The people of P&G are amazing. The recruiting and testing process is very rigorous and I believe it always has been.  So you have the opportunity to work with the most amazing people.  People are able to make significant contributions at every level.  Most employees are very driven to succeed so the work environment can be both challenging and inspiring. Overall P&G is a great place to work!Sign into Walmart log, scan and inventory products, designed plan-o-grams and end caps. Management was very nice but also took her job seriously in a very professional manner. I had no coworkers but was required to interact with store staff. The hardest part of the job was when store personnel would not cooperate. The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexibility.I enjoyed the place that why I stayed there for a long time and ate good food while I was at it. But to tell one the truth I would probable make this one of last place to get hired because the work is tiredsome.Great place to work. This was also an huge company so it required the workers to work in a timely manner so that the customers would be satisfied with what they would receive.Great company. P&G is very interested in training their employees and encourages their employees to be the best they can be.P&G is a great place to learn and grow. Starting out, I was given incredible responsibility and enabling latitude to solve problems and build the business. This growth experience has helped shape me into the professional I am today.I really enjoyed working proctor in gamble but it wasnt flexible with my dauthers medical appointments so my assignment was ended, but overall was a great job to work.I worked with a great group of people. My job was selling new and existing items that were authorized by various warehouses, into the grocery stores in my territory. I had fantastic people to call on, and unbelievable coworkers.P&G hires the best people, it's a great place for leadership development. You get a lot of responsibility even early in your career. Most of the people that work for P&G are very proud of it.The company is a very large company with multiple manufacturing sites around the world.  The benefits are very good, but salary is strictly determined by manufacturing sites management and years of service.Good place to work, rotating shifts is the hardest part about working there. worked with good people and your job is secure with good benefits and retirementNot guaranteed work the hours are fine. They're just really unorganized . And the co-workers are allowed to do whatever they want. Use profanity etc.P&G has state-of-the-art manufacturing processes and technologies.  A very professional and respectful place to work.  They are also committed to and invest much time and money into the training and empowering of their employees from a skills perspective.There was no typical day here. Each day brought something different, this was one of the things that made it great. I learned that working in production was great. The hardest part of leaving this company was the hardest part of this job. Management and Technicians were college graduates at this Company. the most impressed  part of this job was the skill based system. I was considered a leader and did extensive traveling for the company to up grade people systems and it is still in progress today. Had it not been for the weekly rotatating of shifts I would have never left this Global Company.  One of the most enjoyable things here was learning maintenace of equipment. Management had an open door policy.Good for some. Not good for others. Strong company. Good people  good brands.  Nice working envirmemts. Work from home option.Great company to work for and to learn from. Employees are great, very smart, and hard working. Customers are at the forefront of everything we do.I have spent many years at P&G and can only sing their praises.  I have been able to have a long and fulfilling career at the company.  The company culture and people there are wonderful, supportive and embrace everyone."
414,"Pace Analytical Services, Inc.","We I first started with the company the people are very welcoming. They take good pride in showing you the works so that you can grow with the company.Pace's workplace is less than amazing.  I absolutely love it there. The people are beyond friendly and accepting.  The work is a new experience for me, but I couldn't find myself more interested."
690,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory,"Depending on your group, you can have very interesting work. But in many parts of the lab, funding is very tough. And a long-term career path (at least in the sections with which I am familiar) is extremely hard - I know many senior staff who have left.Management wants to have its cake and eat it, too.  They treat scientists/engineers like hourly employees, enforcing charging policies not sustainable for any reasonable work/life balance while expecting salaried work.  Definitely a political minefield, as well.  Look at the wrong person with a perceived wrong look, and good luck finding work in that group again.On the other hand, if you know the right people, you can make moves around the lab to do virtually anything you would want, given someone is paying for it.Another problem is that they expect post-graduates to be short term help, not really expecting them to stay on as permanent staff.  This is in direct conflict with promises made at job interview.Perhaps I had a bad experience, but other people have said similar things.The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is very good at producing results, but not very good an retaining researchers. There is a significant turn around because people are hired without a plan to pay them. This would not be a problem if there was a way for those with funding to find employees that fit their needs, but there are not so people with funding will hire new people.The facilities are excellent and there is plenty of opportunity to do some real science. Initially things will be a bit slow because there is nobody who's job it is to train you in the use of the equipment and you are not allowed to use the equipment until you are trained. I recommend turning to people who are in your group. They will be able to help you navigate the minor pittfals there are and avoid internal politics if it should ever become relevant.Overall it is not a terrible place to work, as long as you are realistic about you situation.Innovative operation-EH&S served all Directorates,  Excellent EH&S staff.  Enjoyed providing solutions to EH&S challenges across the organization.I liked this job a lot because I learned in depth proteomics by doing lab work for a Chemical Proteomic Group. The group that I worked for is very helpful in guiding me to do laboratory tasks by training me one on one.Great working environmentNice research atmosphereGood management systemHelpful people aroundAdvanced instrumentsPNNL is a widely recognized public laboratory that prides itself on hiring professionals and subject matter experts to drive their mission of science innovation, research and development. This particular laboratory located in Richland, Washington is one of the largest in the United States employing over 4000 staff.It is not a bad place to work especially if you are passionate about the job.  I was in operations and it is really just about maintaining the status quo.  Typically all you need to do is log in and make sure all the lights are still on and then monitor your inbox for the rest of the day.  Occasionally there are some administrative tasks or projects to work on.  I learned a lot about operations while I was here and the people do try hard and are probably some of the smartest people on the planet.  There are some strong personalities but for the most part people are pleasant.I have worked in worse places but man am I bored.Designed projects from inception to final product and novel circuit designs. Worked with nuclear physicists on unique, cutting edge nuclear detection circuitry.PNNL is a great place whch balances research and industrial development works and provides a lot of flexibility and career potential.My days are spent typically designing PC boards and helping design novel circuitry for radiation detection. I also help scientists with documentation for proposals and papers.I have leaned a LOT about radiation, and how it is detected, from large amounts to very tiny amounts. I also learned how to design circuitry to detect this radiation.Our management tends to be rather ""hands off"" which I consider a good thing.The people I work with have got to be the best part of my job - I only have a BSEET in electronics, and I work with PhD level folks who treat me like an equal - they are some of the nicest people I have EVER worked with or for!Hardest part of my job is everything is charged to a project, and if you don't have a project to charge to, you don't get paid!Best part: Again, the people I work with,If not for management that was ""good old boys"", this would have been an ideal job. It is intellectually alive, fun people, well run, but very old fashioned in its values.I was an independent Contractor for PNNL providing maintenance of US SLD Megaport Initiative in the port of Cortes. I was enjoyable and challenge experience.The SULI internships are great! They allow for students to become familiar with particular technology subjects, meet a variety of experts, network with peers, and learn how to perform experiments.PNNL is a great place for an internship as a student. Getting to work closely with scientists at the national laboratory provides a great opportunity to learn about a variety of technical fields. The quality of staff is great, although projects tend to move slowly.This is undoubtedly the best place I have ever worked! They ""get it"" when it comes to taking care of their employees. They understand safety, family obligations, and having a life outside of work. Hence,  their employees work hard for the company and are enjoyable to be around.exciting research projectsvery intelligent people from diverse backgrounds/expertisecollaborative environmentWorked for PNNL for 24 years.  Loved working there.  Management was great and the benefits were wonderful.  The 401K matching was great as well.typical work days were 8 am to 5:30-6:30 pm. I worked mostly in the laboratory. I learned a lot about organic synthesis scale up, CO2 capture research, and chemical engineering, specifically hot syngas cleanup (sulfur removal) and beginning to end biomass-to-hydrogen conversion, by hydrolysis/deconstruction of cornstover using WO3/Al2O3 to ethylene glycol (EG) and subsequent reforming of EG using Pt/Re on ZrO2 catalyst.Had nice and helpful managerBuild up more working experimentPreparing proposal.Writing Research reports.Good co-work to work with.Bad Management.Good relocation package"
574,PAE Government Services Inc,"Feels good to give back and help other people in need. But a lot more work needs to be done for all the new cases out there with new medical conditions and financial hardships.Good company very proactive bosses. Every person from  the top down really care about their people.   You can have a bright future by working for them.Excellant place to work. Work schedule is always available ahead of time. Learned a great amount of the security regulations and how operations were conducted. The Co-Workers are easy to get along with and they will go out of their way to assist you in any way to make you successful in  your mission. There is no hardest part of the job. Going to work everyday is the most enjoyable part of the job.I took the job in 2010 to work on San Clemente Island has a Supply Technician. I only worked on the Island about 3 months and then they put on NAS North Island. On North Island I was put in a very small office with 3 other people and my job changed to purchasing with no compensation or title change.Pae great company to work for.Staff well treated. Productive wonderful living arrangement.Great response from company if an issue.Great co-workers and immediate supervisor. Medical benefits cost WAY too much.  $1500+/month for married person/no kids.  Upper management is immature and not qualified and/or experienced to be in management role.Management played favorites with employees.Never followed the Collective Bargining Agreement.No so called Supervision of employees.When a concern was bought up, supervisor would say"" I don't want to talk about it""I focus on my assignments and get it done. On my seventeen years of working in the same filed I learned to be responsible and be on time. I can do multitasks effectively and able to handle a high-volume workload and meet customer satisfaction.Devise work environment with many cultures and many locals involved in the day to day running of a forward operation base. There are opportunities to develop you people-skills.Working with PAE at the time was an opportunity for me far the fact that I got use to working standards and I learned new things on the job. I got use to working with people from different regions and use to different methods of doing work for positive result.provides a variety of services to government supported by an excellent, state of the art Information Technology team.I was employed by the company known as Defense Support Services (DS2) for several years before, during, and after it became a PAE owned company. My coworkers and managers were highly capable, professional, and a pleasure to work with. Employees that truly care about working to their highest level are respected and appreciated. I was given a great deal of latitude to perform my job as well as excellent compensation and benefits. I enjoyed a 9/80 work schedule which meant that I was off every other Friday. Also, due to my length of employment,  I accumulated about 6 weeks of paid time off that could be carried over. The Business Development team I worked with was top notch. I would still be there, but I chose to become a consultant to ease into an early retirement. I would not hesitate to recommend working with the offices that I became familiar with: Greenville, SC and Ft. Worth, TX. A number of colleagues stood out as superior. I've worked for other companies where that's more of a rarity.Good place to work with good benefits (health, Vacation, Sick leave).  Employees treated well.The Sr. Vice President and General Manager was a hands on individual and very approachable.Great place to work and would recommend employment there. They generally take care of their personnel and offer great locations to work and willing to relocate.Pretty sad when management allows people under them to influence there decisions.  You have to walk around the shops on egg shells.PAE was a great company to work for. The people were hard workers and everyone came from different backgrounds from all over the world.I really don't have an opinion of PAE either way. They were awarded the contract at Vance AFB and I have worked for many companies of the past 20 years here. They are like any other company I have worked for.PAE came in and took over a government contract in Fort Lewis, Wa. Within 3-4 years the work force was cut by over 60-70% and we began to lose contracts. ive worked for multiple companies and they were by far the worse.always working with the schedule between overtime and travel trips you have to be willing to work with other team members and always be willing to work. it takes a very motivated person to be successful in this group.Stable   organized  attentive to employee needs. Tremendous growth as a company Travel is well arranged. Corporate office is engagedIt's ok, but watch your back, they will get rid of you in a heartbeat.Keep your resume on the job boards.Not much more to say."
332,pall corporation,"I worked in a microbiology lab where where i validated drugs from pharmaceutical companies for their antibacterial properties. I learned more about microbiology lab than i did in college. I partook in interviews and building the team for the lab. The dynamic between myself and my coworkers facilitated the completion of our assignments. Hardest part of the job is meeting the time framed that has been put in placed while trying to validate a drug that became unpredictable. I enjoyed the company of my coworkers on and off work.Worked part time for this company. Rude and unprofessional.  No respect between employees and management. Employees have no respect for each other.  Employees do what they want! Needs Management to step up to the plate and Manager each department. HR really needs to get involved and resolve many issues.Micro Managed by a bully, my advice is stay far away until they figure out he is the problem - people don't quit the company they quit the manager and this guy is why I quit along with a ton of other managers.company is good. pay is good. people are good. management should be little better. the overtaking of Danaher is bad, its making people loose job. Pay is good but could be better.Purging previous years' invoices to make room for the current years' invoices,  placing purged invoices  in alpha/numeric order, placing them in the archives. Training for SAT was sporadic, some coworkers were memorable.There was plenty of work to keep you busy threw the night. Co-workers were enjoyable to be around. Management was exceptional.

Management restructured often, which left everyone running around cause no one knew anything. Promised training to advance and increase pay, never happened. Boss had his favorites, and was a slug.The Job was not that bad but everything was built in house. No parts were ever there.. most of the stuff was made in house and still not on the shelf..I develop new membranes or methods out of new materials. In this work, high inventive and technical skills are necessary combined with quick adaption to problems. Additionally, collaboration between groups (chemistry/development) is essential.Critical thinking and time management are important to decide when a research idea is not feasible.Worked as a shipping/receiving clerk and learned more of receiving/shipping process. Management worked well with its co-workers. Co-workers worked well together as a team. Most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers.This Place is a Joke! They only hire people without experience. A typical work day is watching everyone walk around and gossip. you are not trained properly. Management have their favorites, and have no idea what they are doing. Co-workers are Phony. The hardest part of the job was not getting rewarded for your hard work. The most enjoyable part of the job was the day I left. Well since they just sold the place I'm sure it will not last to much longer. Good Luck!Business is business Pall Corporation is a outstanding Corporation.Long working hours for everyone but overtime is a plus unless you are salary based.I learned we have great hard working people in great places.My coworkers are one of the greatest part of working at Pall.The hardest part of the job is working long hours for overtime to make what is annually promised to me, which leaves me with no  life balance.The most enjoyable part of the job is to hear my supervisors complimenting my hard work and dedication does not go unnoticed.If all you want is mandatory overtime and loss of winter shutdown due to management keeping an impossible production schedule. Then this is the place for you. I have never been in a company that thought so badly of management, that the day I started training I was told to run as fast as I can and never look back.Annual raises are measley and it doesn't matter if you slack off or work hard.  They are the same for just about everyone.They give you a ""promotion"" by changing your title and increasing the work load with hardly any pay increase.Help me get out of here!Fast pace work with heavy machines that curragate pleats in materials to develops industrial filters. Worked with a great group of people. The management style was open and flexible to all.  The hardest part of the day was during inventory checks and the most enjoyable part was when inventory check was completed.The Port Washington site is an amazing facility. Both the people and the architecture are continually inspiring creative thinking. Engineers and scientists are continually encouraged to generate ideas for inventions as part of performance reviews and all ideas are considered in making products that wow customers. Overall, it is a great company for the advancing engineer.Pall Corporation demands a professional work environment, and it's employees largely adhere to these standards willingly. Work amenities are well above-average. Stock program, 401k, Health Benefits are all high quality.There has been an ongoing organizational restructure for the past three years which makes nearly every employee's position transient. The nature of a transitional environment leads to job insecurity, and issues adhering to long-term organizational goals. This has subsequently hurt the creation of a true team-oriented work environment, due to employee's fears of losing their own occupations, and the revolving-door nature of the organizational charts.Pall is a good place to work if you are self sufficient and are able to understand dynamics. Not sure what lies ahead for Pall but I suppose it could be good for some.  They have a great work/life balance as long as you do your job.Great place to work. I learned a lot of skills that will help me with my future. Management team communicates well, but could be better with the directives."

They take US and foreign customs data, re-package it to make it searchable, build in apps for ease of use, and sell access to the data to companies from mom and pop to Fortune 500. A typical day includes heavy customer/client engagement, weekly meetings with internal teams, and a push for daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly goals. Depending on the day of the month, these calls to action can become quite motivating or frustrating. The hardest part of the job is the hours, and the expectation that you're tied to your desk. Business hours are 9:00am-6:00pm daily. Oftentimes, lunches are taken from your desk if at all. And for various reasons, there's always work to be done-which is what you're signing on for with startups. Not a downside necessarily. Just a fact. Great people, great product. But not the right role for me at this point in time."

My job consisted of regulatory review, submitting protocols to IRB.  I reviewed invoices for payment.  I enjoyed working with sites and co-workers to help get a protocol started in a timely manner.  We worked at a fast pace and always willing to help each to make the project successful.The people at the company are great.  co-workers are very supportive. Management is bad. Productivity is measured by numbers which is fine except management keeps changing what is important and defining goals that are loaded with buzzwords but are fundamentally useless on a day to day basis.  Learning is OJT which is fine. there is always a budget crisis.  But the people are really great and the sense of humor at non management levels is enjoyable.Company is growing rapidly and hiring many new employees. Great co-workers! Work life balance is not a priority for management.PAREXEL is a good place to work however there is limited career growth opportunities.  Also there is a decline in senior management oversight, leadership & support within Quality but overall a good starting point for experience.The job is very demanding, although you do not need to have a specific professional formation. It is a huge company so that you learn to work along with people from all over the world.

I have applied for over forty positions internally and have been turned down without notice or feedback.

673,PATH,"PATH gave me the opportunity to expand my boundaries in the non profit world. I experienced communicating on both a local and global level.- Everyone was very talented and passionate in what they do!- Directors are willing to show you step by step and clear expectation- Coworkers are super fun!- Also, BEAUTIFUL OFFICEassisted the homeless and others in need of useful resources. I was capable of providing them with food, clothing, and other miscellaneous items so that can have and live a more productive lifestyle while living on the streets.The most part I enjoyed about my job was the consumers. I was well respected and loved by them. Working with them throughout the years, I've learned patience, responsibility, and understanding is the key to success when dealing with my clients, as well as listening skills. I always treating my clients with care and respect, the way I would want to be treated. For most of my consumers,I was there voice. The hardest part of my job was when my voice wasn't heard  when it came to stating my opinion about certain situations, such as behaviors and my advice on what I thought would be the best way to deal with it.The most enjoyable part of my job was making sure my consumers was well taken care of I went beyond my job many times to make sure that they were, I listened when i was needed to do so, I was always considerate and mindful of their feelings.The company knew them through paperwork, I new them by being there.This organization does what is needed to promote a healthy work environment. Every individual contributes to your knowledge of the organization. No one says, ""That's not my job'Wonderful co workers. Ability to work with individuals that have faced much adversity. Being able to house individuals that have been homeless.Extremely interesting and rewarding work. Wonderful group of people. Just not enough work. Would often come out of a session emotionally drained, but in a good sense. Felt I began to truly understand how it must feel to be a seriously ill person. Therefore very rewarding to feel one has a part in alleviating people's pain by helping to train a new generation of doctors. Love the medical students ! Extremely bright and dedicated young people. And it's wonderful to see people from all different parts of the world and different religions and nationalities working together as colleagues.In the outside world these people would have been enemies but here they are brothers and sisters. And each time, at each session one learns so much from the professors. It's like going to medical school without having to pay for medical school ! And the more I learn the better I feel my work is, with a deeper understanding of all the subtle complexities of human illness. I love this company for its seriousness of purpose and yet for the very human way they treat their employees. The light touch, not the heavy hand. And there is no sense of routine, but rather of constantly searching for how one can improve.Co-workers are very helpful and make working environment comfortable and less tedious. Hardest part of the job is seeing clients becoming discourage in their abilities to do different things and when they begin decompensating. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping others achieve their goals.I enjoyed working at PATH, Inc. But his was a temp position and I wanted to remain there full time. Staff was friendly and helpful. I would have enjoyed working there for a longer period of time.Assisted Behavioral Health Office Supervisor with reminder calls to clients.Processed information for doctors and physical therapistsCopied, filed and faxed information for doctors and therapists as requested.Backup ReceptionistIt's a wonderful place to work--meaningful mission, plenty of smart people and a friendly environment. Each individual's input is valued Work-life balance is great. Pay is not bad and the benefits are very good. The only minus is the funding uncertainty since projects are funded by grants.I've been an employee of PATH-CONNECTIONS HOUSING San Diego since the doors opened in 2013. What I've found about the San Diego office is management allows staff to be creative, which promotes ""Thinking Outside of the Box."" Since working working with this organization I've elevated my skill-set, tailored my communication skills, build comprehensive community partnership, and most of all strengthen my self-confidence. I'll admit if you're there for the money, than expect to work for it. As for management, there was a time I experienced discourse, but once that was handled I have nothing but praise toward our management team. I'm grateful to have a organization that is not just a leader, but also has the ability to follow(staff suggestions).Lastly when it comes to case management, I decided to give it a #.......#WeAreCaseManagement. If you're innovative and a 360 Thinker than come join the team. A Catalyst for Change.Not a place for aspiring mid career professionals with experience. Great for a first job or established executives. Great exposure, but instability and lack of management throughout organization.Did a lot of paperwork making due had all documentation to order prescription meds. Worked with diverse populations most of them in poverty level.My time working at this agency was rather unpleasant. Upper management neglected mid management and other staff. Some employees and security often stole cleaning supplies and the best donations. There was negative competition between departments which lead to staff trying to embarrass one another. One example of pettiness was workers sending inflammatory emails and copying other workers plus upper management. One worker smiled and told me it's the PATH culture too highlight through email perceived staff errors. Less than stellar front line staff are constantly hired to work with the clients because the agency chooses to pay 25k or less while paying 90k and higher to upper management. Many of the workers do the least required to maintain work. The agency seems afraid of lawsuits and allows stealing, repeated tardiness, case managers who refuse to meet with clients regularly, harassment, childish behavior, inappropriate behavior with clients (talking down to clients, exchanging personal phone numbers with clients, friend in them on social media, and using clients as servants).Enjoy helping patients with daily living.Administer MedicationsPrepare mealsTransport to AppointmentsAssist with daily activitiesEnvironment very friendlyThis was and it continues to be thriving. As a Psychology major it has been a learning lesson for me. I was able to pick up what I learned at school and apply it to work.PATH (People Assisting the Homeless) is a great place to work and the rewarding feeling of assisting one individual at a time to not only find permanent homes but following them for a minimum of 12 months to ensure they are successful in transitioning into housing is a part of PATH policy and procedures. I love this about PATH because you truly are changing the lives of individuals as a whole and it is not only about the agency. The administration always put the clients first and for me this was a plus.I have been working as a biostatistics consultant for PATH for almost a year.  I love the projects that I get to work on, because I believe in the innovation that PATH brings to its research projects.  I like being able to work from home, but feel connected to a broader team of PATH employees, consultants, and field workers around the world.  My favorite part of the job is working with like-minded people who want to change the world, and who need me to use my specialized skills in biostatistics and computer programming.  Unfortunately, the work is contracted, and I am looking for a little job security, ideally in a full-time position.The staff at PATH are so kind and loving, you can tell they really love their jobs. They want to be there for people, and do what they can to help their clients get the best service possible.It has been a pleasure developing my teaching ability and communication skills.  I work with a variety of people and love the interaction amongst a variety of individuals.Outreach, SOAR program, and case management with individuals experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness."
353,PayPal,"Worked at a subsidiary of PayPal at Boston. The experience was half way between decent and good. Had high expectations for the work but was disappointed. Very good people though, loved working with them.Work-life balance good, fairly low stress environment, but if you don't fit a certain personality type, you will be relegated to bottom of the performance ""calibration curve"" and will get poor ratings and generally be ignored by management in favor of the teacher's pet types. Visibility is supreme at PayPal, and counts for more than results. So if you aren't a self-promoter, you will fade into obscurity.PayPal is a fast paced call center where a lot of hard working talent gets lost in the shuffle and menial busy work. Each day consists of handle anywhere from 30-70 contacts from customers via phone. There is very little down time and the scheduling is inflexible. Those who get ahead know someone, are willing to make big sacrifices to their work life balance, or get lucky. Turnover is very high and management holds onto apathetic supervisors just because they've been there a while. The benefits and bonuses make up for how difficult it is to keep a positive attitude at such menial work.PayPal was an excellent place to work. The culture was diverse and the management was spectacular. I was a contract employee working as a Talent Acquisition Coordinator. My day to day duties consisted of onboarding new hires, acting as an onboarding ambassador. I scheduled interviews for potential applicants throughout the country. My coworkers were so helpful and like a family, we were true teammates. The hardest part of the job would be to schedule interviews on and off site for sometimes up to eight people throughout the country. Many of the executives had very hectic schedules. The most enjoyable part was interacting with my teammates who were all offsite but especially dealing with my coworkers on site as well as working closely with the applicants.Over, it was a good place to work. The co-workers and workplace environment made it easy to work. Great benefits, company parties, and team-building events were a plus. The only drawback was having to meet unrealistic goals and metrics. Metrics are based on comment cards sent into customers. If customers are unhappy with the company, and not you directly, you still get penalized. Some micro-managing with upper Management. Can be stressful at times. Calls consisted mostly with payments and account status. Speaking to co-workers in the Philippians can be frustrating. If you have no problem with meeting metric, then this job is for you.PayPal has wonderful values, PAC committees that gather employee feedback, holiday pay, sick pay starting 2016 (a benefit that was given after a PAC committee review), health care, 401K, ESOP, Flex Spending, Management takes an active roll in employee development. Family friendly (Company Parties). Beautiful grounds, Secure building, Clean Restrooms, Clean mothers room, Charitable business, happy work-floors (There are tough days, but they applaud your crowing achievements). You can really build your career with PayPal.Excellent benefits and work/life balance. Inclusive culture with a progressive mindset. There has been steady growth over the years and the outlook for PayPal is excellent.The company is in a good posistion for growth and dominance in this market sector. Key partnerships are essential after splitting from ebay. Lots of change and there are many levels of management. As they grow I would anticipate a lot of flucuation in the continued future.I used to love working at PayPal but within the last few years it has become extremely apparent that once you hit 10 years or so they suddenly need to ""reduce headcount"" and you are out the door. Great place to start but make sure to keep options open once you've been there a while.New company since split from eBay - still feeling the growing pains. Enjoyable, but frustrating job since upper management made decisions without considering input from hands-on experts.I worked here and gained good experience in Customer Service over the phones. I worked in the call center and it was a controlled environment with strict time constraints to be adhered to and so forth.  If you want to move up here, best advice is to take initiative early and build rapport with your managers or otherwise be pinholed as just another worker.  I considered this to be just a stop in the road but stayed longer than I planned.  This was an overall good place to work and I would do it again under different circumstances.Great training program. I train a lot of the new team members. Management is supportive and invites input from workers. I have enhanced my skills as a communicator and trainer. Not eating to much in the awesome cafeteria is difficult. I enjoy interacting with Paypal clients to resolve they're issues.I really enjoyed working at this company. I worked with a great group of people and my supervisors and manager were nice and willing to work with me. I hardest part of the job was meeting the time allowed for each call.Good place to work for full time employees. Offers great benefits, good work life balance and good growth opportunities.Could have better policies for high performing consultants to get converted into full time employees.PayPal never seems to reach their potential.  Tenured, senior high performing employees routinely shown the down at or near their 10th anniversary, especially white males.  Absence of grey beards, and older women too, negatively impacts the ability of PayPal to understand the marketplace. Lack of business acumen in the management ranks is detrimental (most people managers are in their first jobs ever.) The management style is to keep employees afraid, which negatively impacts morale.  Entrepreneurial spirit is severely disciplined. PayPal is devolving vs evolving. Look for a buyout/sale/downward trajectory as their market awareness is poor (Level 2 insider.)What started out as a close family type of atmosphere grew to be corporate and all about making the most money. Great benefits and the people in the trenches are what makes this place great but the culture needs to change and improveGreat place to work benefits start first day.  Lots of training and testing but, with it.  Opportunities for advancement .  On site restaurant great food.  Answering customers phone calls and or emails.  Lots of reading from knowledge base.The company has good benefits, great work culture, very supportive, fun management and continuous training and productive fun work environment.I love the whole culture at PayPal. The training was wonderful. The culture is welcoming and warming. Co-worker supportive and helpful. Management there when you need them. The openness and honesty is the most enjoyable par.My review of this company is awesome.  The managers are great and they are willing to help in any way to help you succeed to get your goal.  Awesome companyPay Pal Was Soo Amazing They Believed In The Upside Down Pyramid Form. From The CEO To The Less Tener Agent The Paypal Culture Is Beyond Phenomenal."

I enjoyed speaking to all the different employees at the job.  I learned how to multitask in different situations at a fast paced environment.  The hardest part of the job was not being appreciated by the upper management.  I desire working for a company that values their employees.Great people with entrepreneurial spirit and the willingness to help others.

No work was ever too physically demanding and I worked with a lot of experienced and helpful individuals. I learned a lot about production while I worked here and would recommend it to just about anyway. The hardest thing about the job was just learning to get into a rhythm of checking everything  on the machine to make sure everything was running ok. I did enjoy everybody I worked with though.As a Life Science Lab Instrument Technician, the most rewarding accomplishment I did for Pfizer on a day-to-day basis was delivery my services to so many wonderful scientists when their equipment went down in the middle of an experiment. I would stop my world and come to their aid and restore the operation of their equipment right away. This, in turn, allowed them to deliver their work to their team. As always, they would thank me, being relieved from this dilemma with relief on their faces. My customers would send emails to my managers, thanking me for my support to their studies.Pfizer is a nice company to work for. I work with very nice people. We had some wonderful time together.

I learned how to read and write up the PID Board. The management and co-workers were okay they followed the rules and went by the guidelines. The hardest part of the job was Inspecting the products because the particulate can be very small. The most enjoyable part of the job was making unlimited overtime.Sometime we had easy days and other days were not so easy. I've learned to just be patient and just do the job as it is presented. Management was somewhat far. The co-workers was fun to work with at times. The hardest part about the job was when something happened you had to know what to do, but as time went by all the things that happened was second nature. The most enjoyable part about the job was learning how different things work and how to fix them.Goals are clearly identified and you can cross train in other jobs.Great mentoring program due to large talent pool.

While working as a team to reach branch goals. You have to always come in with a smile greet each customer, make sure they are acknowledge. There are different roles to a teller, not just process transactions but work the lobby as well. Help customers use innovative technology for convenience.While working in the Active Pharmaceitucals Ingredients Lab, I was given the opportunity to get training in multiple techniques involving chromatrography and wet chemistry as to work in fast pace and customer service to the chemical plant. This has given me the knowledge and capacity to do a good job while maintaining data integrity and the plant moving. I have great co-workers who motivate me and help me if I am in need. My inmediate supervisor is approachable and pro worker.Pfizer offered numerous opportunities for advancement and professional growth. My knowledge of the healthcare industry grew significantly from a face to face interaction, to analyzing and developing regionally and national healthcare organizations, thought leaders, payers and providers.As a Senior Master level Manager, I was able to routinely work with Marketing, and Managed markets leadership to develop customer focused strategies to optimize sales.I started when it was Lederle Laboratories in 1981. When I go into work I turn on my computer and see if I recieved any Emails. I check to see what the work load day is going to be, so I can plan out my schedule of testing for the day and with my coworkers.My Managers I have had over the course of the years, if I had any questions or concerns work related they were answered.The hardest part of the job was saying goodbye to coworkers that I have built up a great friendship with and worked with for so many years.

Nepotism is a problem at the Pearl River site and upward mobility is difficult with unqualified managers and employees. Discrimination exists in certain groups, as pregnancies seem to be a hassle for some team leaders. It is a shame because there really is potential here at Pfizer.I love working with Pfizer Company.  The benefits are great and the pay is wonderful.  The people are full of love and dedication.  I really enjoy being apart of such a wonderful family. I learned how to communicate properly and the importance of staying focused to get the job done right the first time.  Management is always there to help and motivate every individual.

Everything that I do here is what I went to school for, and enjoy it.The culture changed after several over reaching acquisitions and the sales force was bloated in the mid 2000s. Several products in the pipeline never made it to the market. For the first time, in 2007, Pfizer had a lay off of sales personal that has conmtinued to this day.I am currently employed at Pfizer, I would rather not write a review. The compensation package is adequate. The work/ balance is below average due to mandatory overtime.I enjoyed working for Pfizer.  The compensation package was amazing.  I enjoyed working in the field and spending time with my family.  Unfortunately, my time there was too short.  In 2009 my territory was dissolved. Looking to get back in the industry!Worked there 28 years as my brother worked there 42 years, management was great and there were always compensation for your work and just being part of the ""Pfizer Family"" Really can not say enough...except GREAT!A mature company in the healthcare industry. My experience with Pfizer has been very positive.  Great benefits and internal support system.  Treats employees with respect.Workplace culture is great and you will be kept busy. It is a fun environment, but the work can be pretty demanding. Continue to learn and expand skills on your own time because you'll mainly focus on a couple of skills. The work is rewarding at the end of the day, but it is very easy to get lost in the trenches of the daily grind.I enjoyed this position for numerous reasons. I was able to design, develop and deploy an in-house patient registry enrollment program for heart valve patients per the requirements of the Safe Medical Device Act of 1990. I successfully educated 100,000+ patients/physician worldwide regarding product lines, medical, legal and regulatory issues. I was also given the opportunity to locate 896 patients at 14 institutions (U.S., Canadian, and European Hospitals), develop protocols, study requirements, case report forms, budgets, contacts and feasibility process for a IDE follow-up program complying with FDA directives. I enjoyed working with all of my co-workers which included the engineering and legal staff. Even though our projects were very stressful and challenging, we always found time to enjoy our jobs and each other's company.Nice place to work.

I did enjoy everybody I worked with though.Work all shifts. Leaned a lot about pharmaceuticals. I enjoyed work with Management and my Co-workers. A typical day at work consisted of: First have a meeting to inform on how processes are going (problems with equipment and status of process).  Second I would see previous operator too insure where process was.Easy work for the pay you receive. Great benefits with 401K and Vacation package. Highly recommend working for the company.The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to do a product to safe  people lives. The hardest part of my work was when the company closed."
3,"Pfizer, Inc.","A typical day at work - checkin with your team on any issues affecting the working environment for the scientist and set priorities to get the facility back up to standards.What I learned - I learned to be a leader on a few projects and take on some responsibility on improving energy efficiencies. My co-workers were great, we had a softball league that we participated in.The hardest part of the job was when the company had to reduce staffing.Great benefits, great coworkers, and emphasis that all contribute to ""helping to made medicines""  which will in turn make a positive impact in the world. Emphasis on a ""healthy Pfizer"" - free flu shots for colleagues,  fitness center on site.After I graduated form the Pharmacy School, I work for Pfizer as a medical rep., as the policy in Saudi Arabia mandated to have healthcare background. The workplace, the system is exceptional and you well interact with the finest workforce in the industry among the companies. The firm policy is strict, either internally or at the market, the resources you have to achieve your goal are the best among other companies. However, the advangates come with a price, as the market leading position of Pfizer in the market required an exceptional performance in utilizing the resources provided to maintain the leader position, in which it will too tough at the begging, but it will be easier and funnier when you acquire the experience.I enjoyed the work and I excelled quickly. However, the culture and particular consultant that I worked under was a micro-manager and did not allow for lunches, breaks, nor open communication among fellow team members. I learned how to navigate within a new database and how to work with the procurement team and other licensing departments. I used skills and techniques in order to update, renew, sell and support Pfizer clients and vendors with their newer software launch program.I was familiar with their software set up for the most part and ticketing system due to the many different applications that I used on a regular basis with my previous place of employment.I did a great amount of database clean up and worked to update the licensing information and manage the software contracts of the different clients and vendors that worked with and for Pfizer.The most difficult task of my everyday was overcoming the poor moral of the environment and the level of micro management that existed.Don't get me wrong.. I can handle some of the toughest scenarios and I have had my fair share of bosses in Corporate America that had some level of micro management. However, this woman and this consultant took it to new extremes. It was unhealthy overall and I should have been more cautious when she said that her turn over was high. None the less, I respect the nature of the position and I am flattered to have been chosen to work on her team and represent this company. I am grateful for all experiences that are put in my path, be it good, bad or indifferent.I believe  more... that nothing is coincidence anymore, rather what you choose to make of the situation. I am a firm believer that attitudes and behaviors drive success. This was the biggest hurdle within this situation. Therefore, out of respect for the team and my future.. I did not want to waste time pursuing a position that wasn't going to be a good fit and a permanent career move.  lessI worked remotely for the entire contract there. I had some travel involved, but not excessive. Due to expectation of evening change windows, it gave me flexibility to take time during the day to complete other activities.I loved my job and everything that came with it. I was a very dedicated worker and did my best with every assignment I was given.Very friendly and great place for learning      had a positive experience working at Bioclinica. I had great team and very supportive colleagues. I enjoyed working with my client.Pfizer is a great place to work it is a great environment to grow gain valuable knowledge and they always put family first and completely understand the difficult balance for family and work.A typical day consist of ISO Training, emails, and keeping the equipment running. Often the equipment is ran as close to its failure rate as possible to maximize production but at the cost of downtime to the equipment. I learned how these medicines are made and the importance for each and every one of them. I also learned that the challenges changed every day and that being able to adapt was crucial!Management has a few good ones within the fold but they are stifled by their upper management. Most of management is willing to listen at what you say, but often not willing to do anything to change it until it is well past its time to do so. There seems to be a buddy system amongst certain areas of management to keep the same contract companies when their are better ones out there.My co-workers were the best part of my career here. We worked well as a team to complete task. whether these task were in our specified area or not. We built bonds that ensured to one another that we had each others back.The hardest of part of my job was being hand tied by management. (i.e Not being able to fix equipment when it needed it but only to patch it up.) Management is the hardest part of the job.The most enjoyable are the family/ friend bonds that were created over time that allowed myself and my co-workers to grow. We accepted or challenges day in and out. The stress at times was high but we always got through it together!Excellent environment for innovation and research. Friendly and helpful colleagues and management. Most enjoyable part of job is constant learning. Typical day spent in lab and at desk.Often 16 hour shifts, every other day.In clean room for 2 hrs out to ours.Many SOPs constantly updated and reviewed.A lot of training, but not proper training. Poor decision making on management.Great learning experience, however the company has limited growth opportunities. Also the company is infamous for laying off colleagues and cost cutting.Goals are clearly identified and you can cross train in other jobs.Great mentoring program due to large talent pool. Good sense of job satisfaction and make great friends while overcoming the challenges of a highly regulated industry.I work at Pfizer for sixteen years with an excellent group of people. It was a great team work environment and outstanding leadership that encourage every employee to develop their skills and advance their careers.Very productive place to work  enjoyed working  with the people on my shift we had very good teamwork  The work environment was very enjoyable and peacefulNice place to work. No work was ever too physically demanding and I worked with a lot of experienced and helpful individuals. I learned a lot about production while I worked here and would recommend it to just about anyway. The hardest thing about the job was just learning to get into a rhythm of checking everything  on the machine to make sure everything was running ok. I did enjoy everybody I worked with though.Difficult to navigate the multi-layered, old school corporate ways in order to identify best path for career growth.  The culture can change from team to team.Was only with PFE for a short time, but my impression is that at the time PFE ws a ""my way or the highway"" company in their absorption of Pharmacy. We had many talented people and excellent process that they did not even consider when they purchased Pharmacia.Great life/work balance. Challenging work within a great corporate culture with perks of a fabulous cafeteria, gym, lovely offices and lots of collaboration amongst colleagues.I do not want to make a comment on this company, therefore, I wont say anything bad about it. The owner gave me a chance with an internship when I had no experience which allowed me to have the opportunities that I have today.good company to work for lots of great people, They have a lot of drugs going LOE very soon only issue. They need to work on getting more people involved in other activities other than selling"
438,Pharmaceutical Firm,This was a good firm but no learning regarding my field was given to me. i was just a junior officer over there and were dealing the petty cash and invoices of Bank and journal vouchers
337,Pharmacyclics,"No longer the company that I was happy at a few years back.  Lots of Micromanagement from the new management.  Poor culture and bullying going on within different groups.Extremely supportive managers provided guidance as well as pushed us to succeed all while promoting team work. It was evident from the start that the company cared for your well being.I accepted a position moved my family out here after a less than stellar interview. I was promised that they would make up the lower pay rapidly with job promotion if I produced results. Within less than six months I had senior directors thanking me for the stellar job. The promised promotion to make up for the loss I took, never happened and over a year later never will happen.Line managers lie to your face, gossip behind your back, spread inconsistencies ( aka lies), and talk to other try to hunt down personal information to manipulate. This is appalling. Never have I seen this in a work environment to the degree. It is unprofessional boardering of discrimination lawsuits. I am just waiting to move on at a different company. Others have switched departments as frequent as every year just to get away for the rude and clueless upper management.Managers take credit for employee work. No class when it comes to talking to people. They just dont care. Culture does not promote  open communication. No growth, lack of promotion/raise unless you kiss-butt or are buddies with the manager.Fun, fast paced, great team and management. Recently acquired company, most enjoyable part was seeing everything come together on the Events team.Culture of fear. Lack of leadership at most levels. Not a fun place to work for most. Lots of people are leaving, which is why so many jobs are available. Expect more of this.Greatly improved since new management took over.  There are great people working there and the drug is amazing and doing great work.Was a great place to work. Very close to my house. I got to meet great people and they are still my friends. They had a company wide lay off after clinical trials failed.Great product--a home run.  Culture--Toxic.  Exec. Team lead through micromanagement, fear and intimidation.  Amateurs at building a collaborative, high performance team.  Very political.  Compensation and promotions are out of the blue no rhyme or reason.  If COO likes you and you suck up enough, you will have two promotions and large increases in one year.  Everyone can work their tail off and never get promoted.  Very uneven rewards and no recognition.  No work life balance.  It's all work.  Leaders are rude and they don't deserve the titles or compensation they have.Typical Day: Many meetings to set up and take down, up to 1-4 per day all between 11:30- 1, and upwards of 20+ attendees. What I learned:  I learned patience is all one has when dealing with crazy timelinesManagement: Management takes care of their own, they were all AMAZING.  Although in any place there may be some which can be difficult to please. Co-Workers:  Best co-workers ever, many whom will stay with you during rough seas.  Never saw so many people work as hard as they do, co-workers and the powers that be. Hard part of job: Seeing the stress on peoples faces, and wanting to do anything to help relieve their stress, but I am not a qualified scientist or Dr, so I would support in any way I could, especially by making sure they eat or drink to keep going.Enjoyable part of job:  The FDA approvals and the importance of their new drug Imbruvica.  It is extremely rewarding to be on that crazy train to see the end results.Everyone below Manager level is paid Hourly.This means half of the company..!Typical day usually requires some sort of testing whether it be KF, disso, assay/impurities, or GC. PCYC was willing to train me from the beginning so i learned everything from cGMP documentation, how to run LC's, to audit readiness, etc. Management in QC is excellent, other departments may vary. Colleagues in the Quality department are great. Teamwork is crucial. Hardest part of the job is getting over how urgent everything is. Everything always seems to be most urgent and due ASAP. The most enjoyable thing about the job is knowing my work has contributed to helping patients.Employees: stressed out and confusedManagement: arrogant, selfish and incompetentProjects: disorganized and un-realCulture: 'push you around', 'sink and drown',Questionable ethical standard, or lack thereof, and decisions made by untrained individuals."
78,Philips,"Lifeline was an exceptional work place. Very educational, professional and eye opening. Its an emotional experience.Great people help make a great company. The open work environment took some time to get used to but helped foster collaborative working. The ability to work from home when need-be was a positive.Contract engineer performing supplier quality work.  Helped Philips & their suppliers get through remediation period and successfully ramp up back to normal production.I worked at lifeline not only for my paycheck ,but the rewards of helping the subscribers . There arn't alot of people that handle calls when the sub presses that phb for depression ,lonliness,anxiety,suicidal,robberies and confusion and just to talk and the typical I've fallen and can't get up was frequent,to hear a friendly voice that they may recognize. My coworkers had compassion,kindness and were monitored on a frequent basis. We left our life behind to help people.Snow,rain,sleet we were there.Good atmosphere and cool place.Good job and good compensation and good benefits and good security and good advancement and good management and good job culture.Overall, the worst experience of my professional career.  The beaurocracy is beyond compare, with zero important decisions delegated beyond the second level CEO.  That's right, there are three CEOs reporting vertically into one another, and even the Vice Presidents don't own their P&L.   There's a complete mismatch between accountability and authority, annual performance goals aren't finalized until Q4 or after the year closes, and the subjective nature of the reviews allow politics and relationships to vastly overshadow any objective measurement of success.  All metrics are kept at a total division level, so free riders can rejoice with a good bonus while hard workers are exploited and asked to continue to do more for the team.a fantastic company but specific managers make it ""less than appealing"". I would  highly recommend you work there, but you need to be able to tolerate managers (some) who only care about their paychecks and not about you.A typical day at Philips consists of me reviewing Global Complaints and trying to manage the complaints I already have in TrackWise our Complaint Handling Database.Temp: Customer Service for 2 years (original assignment was 6-8 mths). Company had no intention of hiring as direct.  Job was outsourced to India. Co-workers were very nice, fun, and helpful. There was no hard part of the job, easiest I have ever done. Not enough challenges.  Too many managers, not always available when needed.It is fun working in the company. I have dealt with complex troubleshooting issues of LAN/WAN. The management is very co-operative and friendly. The co-workers help us to understand the concepts.a day at work is usually the same depending on what department I am working in stock room shipping or receiving. mainly stockroomfor now between me and 5 other workers we all have different responsibility. the hardest part is when I receiving orders at the last minute that has to be pulled from stock and transacted and deliveredto production area before the close of the day management is good especially if you have a problem very is to talk to. most enjoyable part of the job is employee discounts .what I learned fire safetyspill control, hazardous labels of material and how to store themWork from home and Travel as needed to customer sites. Occasional weekend work and late night work scheduled as needed.Philips is a great company to work for, as with any large corporations, moving up could be quite slow.  However, in exchange you get stability, solid benefits, a great work environment and the satisfaction that you are benefiting society through better healthcare.Work/Life balances, focus on employee satisfaction, decent pay and benefits.  Diverse background of employees.Hardest Part - Levels of managers and collaboration to get things changedEasiest Part - strong HR involvement in employee satisfaction and listening to employeesPhilips is a good company. The products are innovative and well received by the public. The compensation is fair, but there is no room to grow as an FSR.I found Philips a very difficult place to work.  I was new to the team and no training was provided.  I had to learn my job by trial and error.  When I went to management with questions, they had no answer.  Had to work on holidays.Great company to work for. Great benefits and compensation packages. Philips is a leader in the healthcare industry with a majority lead in the market share. Diverse product set with quality manufacturing, engineering and customer support.The work is easy just very fast pace. When I first started, everyone was very friendly. Once you learn how to do the job you will have no problems.a good place to work how to make exit signs management was good coworker communication  was good inventory time  was the hardest part most enjoyable when we came together as a family at holidays before the day we get offa great place to be innovative in your approach to ultrasound and sales. It is a place for your to share your ultrasound and physics expertise. there is a good compensation package.Excellent environment, management are excellent too, the facilities are reliable and good for all the duties, the people are very friendly and have a good attitude"

16,Pinterest,"Don't expect job security even though they will be the Discovery trendsetters in the Silicon Valley. Management could be better, specially middle management, there's no work life balance in SF"
163,Pioneer Data Systems,All jobs are contract and I don't see that permanent placement is initiated.  However I like the company that I was placed with and would like to see Pioneer do more to permanently place me there in long term employment.
469,PlaceIQ,"Amazing people with an enthusiasm for finding the right solutions. In addition, the culture is a culture that most companies should cultivate.Great culture.  Smart people.  Awesome place to work.Management is really wonderful.People are always willing to help out.  You really feel like you are a part of something special.Great technology and leadership.Great co-workers.Fast paced.Good food."
668,PlasmaLab International,"Most co-workers are great - with the exception of one person that has caused several great people to quit because of their actions toward them and management ignores this problem (even when confronted with the reason these people are leaving).  Management refuses to let this person go, even though this person causes a lot of problems with co-workers.  Management does not take responsibility for problems caused by them (management) or others around them.  Seems like management does not really want to be there any more, but keeps going even though they are not actively promoting the companies products as they should.  The fate of this company is uncertain because of the managements lack of interest in promoting the company products."
794,Pluralsight,"I love my job, I love what my company stands for, I love the people I work with and who they desire for our company to become.Work was very comfortable and allowed us to be creative and motivated with the elimination of the PTO policy. I learned that freedom allowed to bring the best autonomy out of employees. Management was great, although with hyper growth the culture can quickly become slippery when hiring several managers at a time.I could not say good enough about my co-workers. Great teamwork. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with hyper growth, there tends to be a lot of growing pains, but you learn a lot by going through this. The best part of the job was the paid benefits, free drinks and snacks and paid 'family lunch' every Wednesday (which happens to be a great team building activity)"
187,Plymouth Rock,Every one is very into making sure it is an enjoyable place to work. Lots of gatherings to make sure the company is united. Quarterly meetings with the CEO to make sure every employee is aware of company goals and results.I enjoyed working together with my coworker as a team. I learned lot about insurance procedure- date entry and indexing.
709,PMSI,"A typical day at work calling Medicare to check lien assignments. Working a diary everyday. Submitting signed authorizations to the MSPRC and follow up for the Conditional Payment Letters. Work with management with Special Projects as necessary. I learned a lot about how Medicare works and what they will and will not approve. Management was strict and approachable. My co-workers were great and a lot of fun. The hardest part of the job was waiting on the phone with Medicare which could take up to 40 minutes or longer. The most enjoyable part of the job was the variety of lunch vendors who fed us.This job is a good place to work. The management is not very good but other than that it is a good job. They fired me for putting the work truck in a ditch. They would not give me my last paycheckMost days were busy, but enjoyable, because in so many ways I was helping people.  Either on the phone or checking in patients, or checking them out with their next appointment,  Sometimes there were some that  had a need to talk, and i listened with patience, because we all need someone to talk to sometime.  Every now and then some patients would get upset, and we (as well as myuself) would do whatever we could to keep them calm, and try to resolve their issues.  Really enjoyed being to make the patients happy, but it was hard when you were not able to get them in for an appointment when they wanted it, but did the best I could to satisfy them.  A lot of days were a challenge, but yet it was still enjoyable and rewarding.Good company to work for. Learned a lot about medical equipment, vendors, and the flow of the relationship as an DME account manager. A lot of organizational and technological changes during my tenure. Friendly co-workers.Great company to work for. Awesome potential to promote and relocate when merited. Highly recommended for anyone degreed or not.A typical work day would consist of inbound/outbound calls/emails. I learned how to multi-task and how to give excellant customer service. Management and co-workers were pretty decent. The hardest part of the job was not having control of your incoming calls and being able to notate each file accurately in the amount of time given. The most enjoyable part of job was to be able to assist the clients in receiving their meds in a timely matter.I worked at PMSI in several capacities starting in 1997 as a pharmacy tech, and have always been able to grow thru my own merits and efforts.When I resigned from there it was only to maximize my potential professional growth, I still believe in the company, and would be honored to return in the future.This company has very poor management. The management team is never on the same page and the work is very stressful. The pay is very low and the benefits are great at allI constantly follow up on denied claims and I also work patient collections. I post payments and I know how to read explanation of benefitsPMSI can use some improvements in several areas.  The people were not friendly for example when my Aunt & Brother died I didn't get any sympathy from anyone not even a cardHard work , hard on your body but good pay. lots of traveling. You have to be willing to work long hours,The corporate culture was that of a large ant hill.  Many people always running around trying to do what is best and getting in each other's way.  Many chiefs and no cohesiveness.  I worked with some of the best people in the pharmacy benefit management industry.  I know I will never have such an opportunity to work with people that I could not find fault in any one of them, ever again.  I left when I realized that I would not be able to get ahead professionally or financially and when my vacations were all work vacations.Excellent Company with excellent potential.  Enjoyed working with a group of excellent people with a wealth of knowledge.I loved working for this company.  The had great benefits and a great staff.This company could be something great if it didn't keep shooting itself in the foot. Lack of direction from upper management leads to missed deadlines and low morale among the ""worker bees"". Because PMSI is under the ownership of a holding company, we are always under the fear of being sold. It seems most of the effort here goes into ""fattening us up for market"".If you are desperate for a meager paycheck and just need a place to land between jobs, then this may suit you in the short term. I wouldn't recommend making a career here.Spent most days collecting and scanning medical documents from adjusters. I learned to hone my multi-tasking skills at this job. Management was very helpful. I worked with only 3 other people in my market but all were very good at their jobs. The hardest part of the job was finding time for family as you worked almost every day and into the night some nights. The most enjoyable part of my job here was working with the adjusters and forming ""friendships"" and building trust so that they would continue to bring you more work.This is where I first learned all the Do's and Don'ts of customer service. Longest and by far, most rewarding of all my jobs. Learned so much of my skills set from the training I received here.I enjoyed working at PMSI everytime  when someone had a birthday we always had our desk decorated and birthday cake. It was a very fun place to work , we had fun  but  always made  sure that the patient was always satisfied because they were our  customers  . When we satisfied the patients then we new  we did our job right.   The management was the best every .They knew when we was at work that we gave our all to satisfy the customers and they let us know how much they was proud of us. The hardest part of the job was we did get close to the patients and when one would pass away it would upset some of us. Over all it's a great place to work.The best part about the job is the employees that you work with. The patients are great as well. A lot of the same patients are seen and it is nice to see their smiling faces.days are full, there is always something new, supervision is cool. The hardest part of day is the most fun. Everyone works together well. The best part is the pay, it is great.9-11 hour days, fast paced, revenue based end of month crunch...every month.While I have had the opportunity to be mentored by incredibly successful people, I find that in any relationship actions speak louder than words, and from where I sit I'm hearing a lot of words but not seeing a lot of action. It's disappointing as an associate.The most enjoyable part of the job is I am able to bring different idea's to the table to help with efficiency within the departments. The hardest part of the job is maintaining the team spirit throughout the floor with already low morals."
700,Point B,Nice company. OK Benefits. No training. Management is not well defined.
21,Postmates,"I turn on the app and start getting request to pick up food from restaruants. Then I deliver the food to the person at their home or office. I usually hang out near the colleges where many students and professional request deliveries.I like to work in clean and organized places. I work in a simple and efficient way, I fulfill all the demands that.   Postmates in transforming the way local goods move around a city by enabling anyone to get any product delivered in under one hour .it wasn't and isn't your typical job.you work when you want, which as awesome. but traveling around the city burns a whole in your pocket. every delivery was a challenge.  racing miles through the city to bring a customer there favorite food. metrocard fares ate through most of my profits so i had to let it go.I like how it's flexible and i can do this as a second job but can't find a phone number to call and talk to a live person. Does anyone know of a phone number ?  I'd like to do this but I have many questions unanswered.😞.I work for Postmates when when I need some pocket change. When you're ready to work you just go online on the app. Its pretty easy. The man that manages it here on the west coast is laid back and he's pretty good at communicating with us to let us know when he's not going to be in town. You don't see your coworkers because everyone works independently. Hardest part of the job is making lots of money.Postmates is an awesome App platform to work with I only have positive things to say about Postmates, San Francisco, it gave me a     sense of personal accomplishment it was just very rewarding end to end.Postmates is ok, if you want a no hassle side job then postmates would work for you. If you are trying to take care of a household then you probably won't do well with postmates. The main issue I hated was to get jobs you had to drive around town, jobs are dispatched to the closest postmate. So there can be a lot of wasted gas and time. Also, they would often send me miles away to get food from certain restaurants and no matter what I did it wouldn't be warm upon arrival. Which means no tip for me and an unhappy customer. Customer service is a joke too. Once as a customer my order was wrong and all the company offered was a discount on delivery for my next order. So I was left with no immediate resolution, incorrect food and a company who didn't care. All in all, I left for a better courier company that not only paid much better but treated its drivers and customers like they matter.After two weeks and 104 deliveries, there is no pay, the dashboard show the earnings, but no transfer to my bank account, and the customer service is only through  email that  they never answered.A good extra income job. Good because you work whenever you want by simply turning on the app. It worked great for me because I'm on a motorcycle in Los Angeles traffic. If your in a car probably not so good. I wish I got compensated for my quickness and I also wish deliveries were sometimes closer together when dispatched. Overall good if your a college student who rides motorcycles looking for extra cash.You can create your own schedule and are never required to work . The only downfall is not having health benefits. Other than that, the fact that you are your own boss is amazing! As long as you get those two -three jobs an hour your hourly intake is awesome!Steady Eddie definition. someone who will not hit it and quit it - he'll be there for you whenever you need to get the big o. This job was always there for me when I needed that extra cash.  Convenient for everyone involved.  Decent company.  Decent pay.Easy and fast way to ear money. usually pretty busy throughout the day! company works well in helping you out when needed.Being a food deliverer for postmates was straight forward. You create your own schedule and are able to go online whenever you wanted to. Everything needed was on the app. However, when an issue came up with the order, Postmates customer service was non existent. There's no number to call when an order was difficult or not going through. If the issue was not for an active order, a request has to be emailed to Postmates, but they would never reply. Even to this day, I never received any responses for my many requests.The reaponsibilities are high. i make my own time, my own schedule, and I am my own boss. I like the fact that customer service is still involved. I am a people person , so seeing the satisfaction in a customers face makes me happy.Working for Postmates has been a fun, enlightening and flexible experience. There is a lot of support within the company from colleagues but sometimes management can be slow to make decisions. Overall it's a great company to work for that offers phenomenal benefits, as well as flexible work/life balance.Fun, laid back, and driven individuals. It is a typical start-up company environment. The people are nice, and you can expect the kitchen to be stocked.My experience, while working for Postmates, has been great. This company provides opportunities for it's employees to make money and explore the city of Chicago. I use the time I spend at work as exercise; it's a release.Got lured in because of the start up culture and all payed insurance. But everyone here gets treated like a number and there is zero job security. I got hired on as a quality analyst and within six months my role was outsourced to the same phillipines representatives I would analyze. There was no notice of the business decision and barely a compensation for the unexpected lay off. Don't work with them. You'll end up looking for a new job very soon.Working as a Courier was an ok job. This job requires you to be dedicated to the job in order to make a great outcome money wise. You also had to keep your customer rating up above 4.5 stars.This was the WORSE place I ever worked for.They treat their employees like numbers, not like human At All!! Anyone who is  thinking about working for Postmates, don't!  I rather drive for Uber than work for this uncaring and ignorant company.They have no culture. Their pay is very pitiful.fleet support isn't good, but if you find a way that works for you it can be beneficial for you.. depends city to city what payment you will receive"
471,Praescient Analytics,"Great company desperately trying to grow business and expand into platform agnostic tech consulting and analysis.PA got its start servicing Palantir contracts and is now trying to build expertise and workload with other platform service providers.Leadership is weak, immature, and unethical.  Constantly changing directions on a whim and have little loyalty to employees.  Benefits look good on paper until you learn little truths like the $5k Training Allowance is not a guaranteed benefit.  Most requests for training are denied.I currently work with Praescient Analytics as an analyst consultant, but I would like to move forward with my career in ways that my current company cannot fulfill.  I love the family atmosphere that the executive team cultivates as well as their excellent benefits package they offer.  I hope they grow in the near future!A typical day is spent training troops on the different use cases for the Palantir Platform.The hours are flexibleWork hard, be super flexible due to poor BD processes, excel and get minimal to no recognition."
605,Praxis Engineering,"Company with integrity, respect for their people, and as they continue to grow, they try to maintain a small company attitude and keep their employees feeling like 'they' are the company!Praxis Engineering is a collection of talented minds that like to have fun. Very collaborative and productive culture. Management is available and approachable. Corporate goals are clearly defined and the vision is engrained into the daily routine. Solutions driven (not just butts in seats).My time with Praxis has been truly enjoyable. Company is built upon and driven by its core values, which translates into a balance between productivity and fun. Full of great people that are customer driven.I would still be there if government funding had not run out on funding.A small company with wonderful benefits.  Very hard work, but refreshing to be heard by management.I had a great experience working with Praxis. Relaxing and kind environment to work within.I've only been with Praxis for about 6 months but I love the group here. It's hard to find a company that genuinely encourages a good work/life balance; most companies say they do but rarely follow through. Just about everyone I know here is involved in something outside of work: charities, running clubs, theater, etc..., and whatever you want to participate in, the company will almost always provide some kind of support.As for the work environment, it's the little things that I've been impressed with here. In this industry it's often the case that the contracts you work on don't vary all that much regardless of who you're working for, but how the company supports you on those contracts does. My initial set up here was quick and seamless, from HR and the whole hiring practice to IT and getting my workstations running. I've seen enough incompetence in those areas in other companies that I notice when it's done well.Bottom line: In my career I've worked for very large defense companies, an extremely small one, and even a gaming studio, and I can say without reservation that Praxis has the best mix of interesting work, well-rounded employees, and great ownership.Praxis has more legit work than I am used to. Previous employers had never given me an opportunity to pick the type of work I wanted to do. I don't feel that the good work is a mystery here, it's shared with everyone and I can be in charge of pursuing my own interests and have the support of my management, seemingly profit coming 2nd. I've been encouraged to pursue training in areas of emerging technology, and cost hasn't been a concern. When I had a surgery, my family received a very thoughtful care package, and I have noticed an overall commitment to employees being a priority. It's the first place I've worked where I've felt the company has a heart. The other engineers I work with are very good, consistently. I've not met one that made me wonder how they got hired and I've learned that I am given the benefit of the doubt by customers because I work at Praxis. Because this is confidential and I won't have to admit it publicly, I admit that I have grown professionally here in large part due to the people from Praxis I work/interact with. I've also started brewing at home thanks to a special interest group I am a part of at the office. Excited for my first creation. As long as my profit sharing, bonus, projects, and annual increases aren't cut, I can't currently see any reason to want to move on.The Praxis Management team is an outstanding group of knowledgeable technical and business professionals. They guide the company and the policies. They ensure that the employees and staff are provided the best training and opportunities. We, as employees, are encouraged to pursue training, certifications and additional degree programs that both interest us and benefit the company. What makes us better makes the company stronger. The dedication of management and employees to customer success drives all of us to do our best. When we exceed customer expectations and requirements we increase the opportunities for the company and employees to expand our base of satisfied customers. The hardest part is choosing what to study next. In a way the training opportunities are like being in a candy store and having to choose one treat at a time. Truly, the only limitation is how much you restrict yourself as an employee. The opportunity is there. My co-workers are great and it's always a relaxed learning environment. The most enjoyable part is the balanced approach. We work hard and the management recognizes that and holds activities to show appreciation for our efforts. What I've learned is that it is okay to speak up and share ideas. On any given day any one of us may come up with an idea that makes a difference to one or more customers. The job is always interesting, challenging and rewarding all at the same time."

224,Premier Research Group,"This isn't a great place to work because its management is so clueless.  They have a real problem keeping contracts and that's keeping them from turning a profit.Productive and a nice environment to work,A good number of people will be willing to work in Premier Research because of its diverse nature. People from different countries work together here and do blend together for a common cause.Down times proved to be slow and unproductive but the benefits and pay made up for it. Management and co-workers were great. Would have been a great company and almost got a great advancement but the site I worked at closed down just before promotion.A lot of changes need to be made and at this time seems that they are. At this point we just have to wait and see if the current changes are the right ones.  Hiring at the Senior level makes it difficult to advance into different areas within the company.For the last two years I have been working closely with Pfizer study teams to bring data from external vendors, such as ERT, in house, reconcile the data, and troubleshooting any errors that arise during the process. From this position I have become very familiar with the different types of data collected during a clinical trial, how it is stored in the clinical database, and the complex process that takes place once the data is available. While working on forty plus studies at a time it is important that I am able to multitask and give each study my best work. This position demands the utmost attention to detail, including a strong sense of accountability not only to myself but also to my respective team members. One error on my end or a missed deadline could mean months of work and delays for the rest of the study team. I have found that I strive under this work dynamic and am very proud knowing the work I put in on these studies could lead to something much bigger.Great people who try to compensate for out of dated systems. Fair management with little involvement support. The people who work there make this company and allow it survive despite out of date systems procedures.Great co-workers and manager.  During a study it was very busy and there were many opportunities to learn.  Between studies we had a lot of training and team building exercises.  I enjoyed working with patients and staff.A typical day included Phase 1/Phase 2 studies on NSAID medications, taking vital signs, starting IVs, pain assessments, documentation, knowing and keeping updated on current protocols, basic lab procedures, etc."

Limited career growth in Marketing and Sales.As an intern I was able to participate in multiple audits for various companies. I gained hands on experience in the auditing field. The people there are great to work for.PwC is a great company. It provides great benefits and career opportunity to any staff level. It's great to be part of one of the most prestigious public accounting firm in the world.In the financial services market, there is constant pressure to meet short deadlines with an intense amount of work. Among other groups, there is a flexible work environment.Overall a great place to work! It was as an early place in my career, it was definitely a learning experience. Overall, I would recommend this location to anyone who is looking for a great job experience!- Work on requests with time limits - Laid back environment - Workload varies - Lots of benefits - Great experience- make friends with everyone - Managers are good people -Overtime pay - Must stay overtime if work at hand is due and not completedGood work environment, challenging but satisfying, not much work/life balance but they are working on it. I great place to start working and understanding the corporate world.PwC allows you to learn and grow. Great projects are mixed with miserable ones. A lot of really good people work in the company with excellent experience and expertise, but some are far from being perfect.There was no work/life balance and employees were expected to give up their weekends for about 9 months out of the year. Management was very appoachable however and had an open door policyGreat opportunity for recent graduates. Exposure to a lot responsibilities and different types of jobs. Team work required, long busy seasons.Working at Pwc as a contractor at the moment, I'm lucky to be surrounded by a team of professionals with great attitude and personality. we provide help to the employees on daily basis on their laptops mostly but we also make sure everything else is working perfectly, things like printers, video conference equipments, phones, TVs and more..Co-workers are extremely smart and talented. They help you to grow your personal brand and establish your unique value to the firm through diverse experiences.Great people, great work mostly, and excellent support. Need to remember that it is a business driven by revenues. Long-term, one needs to align what they do with how the firm makes money.I was part of a small close-knit group of consultants with good access to my management. I truly enjoyed the minimum 2-week mandatory learning opportunities.I landed on the wrong team that over hired in anticipation for some big wins that unfortunately did not come.  The culture and people that work here are great however; you really need to find a great project/teamPwC provides a good opportunity to expand your understanding of auditing and accounting principles. PwC has very high expectations of its employees. Employees are expected to learn on their feet and to keep up with long hours and high stress deadlines.I loved this job. I worked there for about 8 years. Management team was great. All the tellers were great. I have no problems with this bank. It was the best working experience of my life.Great company, depends on your group, obviously a global company with similar opportunities.  Beautiful office and locations, great benefitsCareer is propelled forward through combination hours over standard and networking in addition to performance. Although the work alone won't guarantee you the promotion, management is always willing to speak with you and help you be as well rounded as you would like. It's a great place to start your career.This office is a great opportunity for recent college graduates seeking experience to build their marketability.  There is little opportunity for advancement for individuals with years of financial industry experience. This is not the core practice which causes limitations in growth.Good training program and a lot of projects to learn and growGood work environment and locationHours is long Coworkers are awesome"
761,PROS,"worked with a very good teamThe environment was easy to understandthe culture was amazingthe management was greatprojects were really not managed wellI enjoy each an every day I came to workI worked as an idependent contract employee.  i was able to set my own hours and schedule.Management was very supportive of my projects - help was there when I asked for it.Very small staff - always able to communicate together.The client was not as supportive as the team was.Great place to learn all aspects of backhouse to corporate relationsGreat place to learn all lab skills/quality skillsGreat bosses plenty room for advancementMany knowledge opportunitiesIt Is A Great Place To Work I Do My Service Work Here And Cant Wait To Start Working Here More In The Future It Will Be Cool To Help Out More People Just Like MeWork here if you like being underpaid and unappreciated. They do not take care of their employees. This company is a joke.PROS Software Company was good to me for my whole entire senior year when I was in high school. I was an intern there and I learned a lot about the IT and the Office Services part of PROS. Everyone is really friendly there and the company is very laid back and fun. I loved my experience there and wish I can do it all over again.I currently work for this company it is a good place to work, but oil field work is slow so theres limited hours and limited pay at this timethe job is great despise all of the micro management good company over all, the company has great safety really caring owner.No work/life balanceFast employees turn aroundHire inexperience employees for cheap salaryTry to catch up with technology with no expertise to implement or manage the technologyOur boss was very helpful and cares about his employees and team members. He usually doesn't pressure anyone to finish a job too early, and always encourages us to take our time to make sure we do it right the first time. Tries get to know everyone personally, but never discriminates anyone. Everyday I could expect something different on the job, such as new faces, and different situations. It was a job that was very difficult at first, but everyone there was more than willing to help educate and share their knowledge and experience.PROS has many good aspects to it. You have contact with a wide range of people and have an opportunity to impact positively on their lives.Very intelligent population of employees; great culture and employees sincerely care about one another.  Executive leadership needs to be more strategic.  Most executives have only worked for PROS, so they don't offer a broad viewpoint.  Lack of processes makes accomplishing tasks challenging.  Senior leadership takes too long to make a decision.This is a good company full of very smart people.  The professional services departments is a sink or swim department.  If you ask for help you will get it, but you have to be willing to do the work.  If you are then you can be very successful, If not then no one will be there asking you how to help, or holding your hand.  You are responsible for your own success at this organization, and will be rewarded for it.Great Place to work but the distance was to far to travel. Hours were very long and I was salary.we get the labor done anything our customer wants we get done fast and easy, you have to pay attention to what your partner is done so y'all done try to do the same thing. if u need help always ask."

140,Qiagen N.V,Great place to work! Wonderful team rand great learning experience. Very strong brand.
743,Quest Diagnostics Incorporated,"Quest is a good place to work if you are out of college but with it being a very busy and fast pace lab, it makes training slow and also, long work days.A high volume laboratory that constantly keeps you on your toes.You learn how to manage your time in order to do your job productively and efficiently.  Management expects you to be able to do your job without too much supervision.  Co-workers are great and quite easy to get along with and are almost always there to give you a helping hand.  Hardest part of the job is being able to manage the different hours they may give you if they are short handed.  The best part of the job is that your constantly learning new tasks so that no day is ever routine.Used to be a great company, until they hired management with no people skills. Yes fast paced,  yes high volume company. Benefits are competitive and most coworkers are patient driven. Working for this company is an insult to employees. You are a number and can be replaced with PT employees easily. Women get paid less. If you are required to work overtime..... Dont expect to get paid for it. Then you are punished for working more as required by the department. A global company  who preaches ""patients first"" sure needs common sense. Be careful if you become a patient while your an employee. ..why because they truly don't care, no empathy and they steal your life. .Good luck and dont believe anything they tell you..you can see the character of their actions. Previously over 10 years employed. ... Glad I leftI have never posted a bad review on any employers that I have worked for before, but this one was different. At this company you are considered a number and not a person. Some parts of the policy were very unfair to the employees.  Management was not all bad, but some of them were very inconsiderate and obnoxious to say the least. Compensation could have been better, but benefits were good. I am very glad that I have been relieved from this company. It was very difficult to be effective in this position because of the criteria and expectations. We had to sit for hours trying to process the interviews to a suggested perfection expected not to mention how long some of the interviews were. This was not always easy to do because applicants are most sensitive to answering a lot of medical history questions.  No matter how hard you try it was not good enough. This position caused quite a bit of stress .The Company had a high turn-over rate. I would not refer anyone to work here. That is because I do care about people in general.Quest Diagnostics is a horrible company to work for especially as a phlebotomist. The pay is horrible and below other companies pay. The benefits are extremely expensive and you can still expect to pay 80 dollars out of pocket to see a physician. You are constantly under staffed and overworked and rarely get to take your breaks on time. There is a lot of pressure put on you for keeping wait times down but they do not provide the help needed. Supplies? don't count of having what you need on hand to do your job. Constantly running out of tubes and butterfly needles and having to send one of your staff members out of your already short ran location driving around to other locations to find the supplies needed. Management is horrible and do not help with these issues. I do not recommend working for this company! Go else where if you can!They lie, promise raises that never happen. If you are lucky enough to get one it's $0.08 after a year. They do not value their employees. Every day threatened that you are replaceable. Unable to transfer to different positions. Your manager will say bad things about you to ensure that you can never leave or transfer. Never able to get time off, even if planned and requested months in advance.I think Quest Diagnostics should care about there staff. They keep on changing procedures when incident happens. Need to know that some staff working graveyard should get more and the management should listen to us more.There is more to this company then what it could be. We should be able to contact the proper people there. when there is a problem. There are different shifts and the Grave yard shift is the hardest..A good company to work for overall.  Good, mostly helpful employees.  Very demanding supervisors and managers, who did not quite understand the difficulty of our jobs, but would always expect miracles.  Constant mandatory overtime, including intimidating employees to work overtime or face disciplinary action.  Not understanding that us, employees, have a life other than Quest Diagnostics.  Very little salary increase over the life of my employment, actually laughable.Quest drives for process improvement throughout the corporation reflecting in new and innovative ways to perform. Good stable company. Competent management in place. Run like a major corporation which leads to National deliverable focus vs. local deliverables which may be more applicable to your region.In the billing department, the upper management has no concern for most employees, they have their favorites and friends, they were allowed to bully and harass other employees, nothing was done, the managers and team leaders openly talked about other employees and their personal business.I truly loved the work part of my job, the company had great benefits.fun and excitied to be there  the management was awesome  and my co-workers we was a team the hardest part of the job was leaving when i was offered a position the salary was lower if got hired on i couldnt  except but this was a great job orange park floridaThe place is ran like a sweat shop, all about production and numbers. The manger of processing watches people on camera and pretends to be all the good of company but is only to make himself look good. The supervisors are all lying puppets. I wouldn't recommend this as a long term place to work.Very High collection volume you meet great people all day friendly and helpful co-workers. I learned a lot working for Quest Diagnostics the computer systems that they have are wonderful and informative to help accurately collect and process specimens. Although Management may have friendly and even helpful personality traits, It can make or break your experience as an employee. To be honest there really wasn't anything hard about  the it. The Most Enjoyable part of the Job for me would have to be the veni-puncture collection. I love putting patients at ease and hearing them say I didn't even feel that, this really makes my day because I want to assure them that I am concern with there well being and overall health.I love my co-workers.The patient load in high volume. the benefits are great. Management tends to hire outside for supervisors regardless of current employee's experience or education. That the reason I am currently looking outside of the companyI have been with Quest Diagnostics for almost 4 years and it has been a downward spiral. Management and the company only care about numbers. Nothing is uniform. It is hard to get questions answered and the job is tedious, but somewhat easy. The pay is on the lower end of being decent and the insurance is HORRIBLE. Co workers are unprofessional but some are friendly. The only thing enjoyable about this job is hearing the satisfaction in a doctor or patient's voice.This is a good place to work if you are looking for a place to gain experience working in the lab processing area's.  Co workers and management are not friendly or helpful.  No one seems happy there. Long hours.  The most enjoyable part of this job was getting off at the end of my shiftQuest is a okay company to work for, they value their customer, but not their employees so much. They give you 1 personal day per year and they count missing days against you when you have to call out. They 401k is awesome and also the insurance that they provide. I've work for them off and on for a total of 4 years.The manny patients that we see in this type set up  job help me very much in be coming a great phlebotomist, seen patients of all ages taking care of at least 50-70 patients gave me a great practice and experience. The harder part of the job was when dealing with small children its never easy to see them cry! Great team work help me to make my job more essay and enjoyable.Quest Diagnostics offered little room for advancement and lower than average salary for existing employees. New employees come in to company at much higher salary than existing.Very productive company. Hard to balance work and life. Requires mandatory overtime. Good pay and benefits. You get to meet alot of good people from different backgrounds. Management can be better.Quest is a wonderful place to work.  Great learning opportunities, the culture and atmosphere is respectful and kind.  The compensation is above the norm and very fair."
173,Quintiles,"Great people, management is not always aware of how processes, transition, and the clinical model and career pathway workKeeping up with tested slides and properly storing them. Organizing and keeping up with lab equipment was very important as well as carrying many medical files and placing them in alphabetical order. Great environment to work in, hardest part was carefully placing the slides in their storage area having to be extremely careful. Easiest job I would say keeping up with the records and maintaining the lab equipment and assisting others.A typical work day was pretty med range as far as stress levels go and the work loads are not to bad. You go in, wait for a delivery truck to drop off your work load and then you began your work which takes about 2 1/2 - 4 hours and you are on your feet the whole time.I learned better time management and to speak up if I had an ideal that may better the business. Nothing good to say about the Management team so I won't speak on it. Co-workers are like family. The hardest part of the job was trying to remember all of the protocols to are continently being changed every few weeks. Second half of the work day which was light and some of the positive people I worked with was the most enjoyable part of the job.The job I was hired for didn't have long to really take off.  After a few weeks, my boss learned that his new boss was transferring the project we were working on, over seas and the whole team would need to look elsewhere for a position - either within Quintiles or outside of Quintiles.A company with lots of opportunity to do different work projects, however it does not afford those opportunities to those lacking experience in specific jobs, therefore not a great place for growth.Develop recruitment strategies and an enrollment plan with the investigator and site staff to meet recruitment goals in coordination with the Global Monitoring Plan project recruitment plan and conducts evaluation, initiation, routine monitoring and close out visits at each assigned study site, as outlined in the Global Monitoring Plan.Decent pay scale, benes, and bonus opportunity in management.  The lab business unit has always been chaotic without enough applied vision.  Clients generally allowed to dictate timelines.  A lot of good people on staff, but burnout is a significant problem.  The merger with Quest Clinical Labs brings potential for significant change, but uncertainty ahead, especially for redundant resource bases.Quintiles is a great place to work.Competitive wages.Competitive insurance.Many opportunities for upward mobility.Quintiles provides a stable environment within an evolving and changing market.Quintiles is a great company to work for ten years. Excellentsalary with benefits including gas card, car allowance as thejob requires travelling to physician offices in Greater Philadelphia.Team spirit and positive environment. Leadership encouraged.Job security is a plus if you make it to permanent employee, but temps are hired and fired with reckless abandon. Very little mobility in the company that isn't predetermined. Management is toxic and underhanded, with almost no transparency and a lot of ""because I said so"" reasoning that has no place in the work environment.If one makes permanent employee, be prepared to have drastically increased responsibilities over time with little to no increase in pay as a result. Low starting pay, and doesn't even increase to stay competitive with inflation.Strong background in project management, technical training, and support. Ability to balance complexity and partner with all levels within a multi-national environment. Analytical, articulate, and diligent.Management treated employees with respect and listened to ideas from the field.  They truly cared about the individual as well as the companies bottom line.Its like home, like a family you never want to leave.  I am only a temporary associate who works on the Medicaid team.  I am stationed at my own desk, with very little micro managing. Self starter and goal oriented, to get the job done.technology. work flexible.(telecommute). Client visits. Vendor services.Great name in information industry, new tools and products.largest vendor industry.Very good company to work for. The employees work very well together in getting the projects done on time with a very hard working teaming atmosphere.Good company to work for. There are several opportunities to learn and grow. The staff is very knowledgeable and willing to help. There are many opportunities for your hard work to be recognized.I loved working with Quintiles. A very diverse place to work with good benefits. Salary was good, and the employee gym.  Everyone was excited to work for this companyWorking at Quintiles was a great experience.  They take care of their employees and help them further their careers by offering opportunities to grow and advancement.They are slow to promote but very understanding with life events and giving a good balance of work to family life. Depending on your role you work at your own pace to produce results.Pros: Work/life balance, benefits, vacation, and compensation. Cons: High turn over rate within engineering department.

561,Quotient Inc,"Typical day consists of working with the sales team, investigating any issues that came up regarding shipping, incorrect invoices, etc.  I process and distribute reports, assist the Office Manager with coordinating meetings/sales events.  I learned that communication is key to be productive.  Worked closely with the Office Manager and the President of the company (the only 2 in the office).  The hardest part is communication between our office and our other US office in NC.  The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with people and being able to work independently.An advantage of working for a company this size, is that they actually listen to their employees. if you want to work for a company that cares, work for Quotient. They just did a major overhaul (improvement) of the benefits package (health insurance, disability, retirement, etc), and after asking input from their employees. They have a very pleasurable work environment, and staffed with smart people.  Quotient will get you the tools you need to get your job done without hassle.keep up the good work, you have a strong foundation for todays company, and the future. companyI enjoyed working for Coupons.com as a contract Copywriter.

763,Range Resources,"Loved the job and the people.  Laid off due to the gas market downturn.  Flexible hours and some times work from home.  Paid dues for associations.  Lunches provided during bad weather.  Security provided .Some management needs to be replaced, most people were good to work for, salary was good, overall good company to work for.Bad Upper Management, Working in the gas field is good. For the most part you get to be your on boss and there is no hectic schedule.Range is a great place to work.  Industry is hard right now.  Lots of opportunities to excel.  Management is great.  Pay and advancement are ky components.Very friendly work environment where team work is essential to success. Bid's were done months in advance of new year. Hardest part of job was getting everyone to buy in to change.Had the pleasure of doing different jobs within the company that was productive under lacked supervision. Had the respect of upper management.Range Resources is a promising company in a country that does not yet have the necessary infrastructure for it to thrive. Overall, Range Resources provides its employees with good wages and rewarding work. Unfortunately, the supply of natural gas currently exceeds the demand for it, and the company's profits have plummeted, causing excessive downsizing.Range Resources is a great company. The Oklahoma City office had amazing people that truly cared about your success. They had great opportunity for advancement.Before the home office opened had to travel to Kittanning for one month for training.  Typically when I applied for the job it was for the Executive Assistant but that position got filled so they offered me the Drilling Assistant Job and I accepted.Contracted work through them from my broker at the time. Its your typical suit and tie place, with strict rules and not a friendly environment.Range Resources is a top notch company to work for which offered their employees a lot of incentives, benefits and advancement opportunities within the company.  Due to budget cutting many positions were severed - which was mine.Range was a wonderful place to work.  The company is excellent, with great leadership at the helm.  The people were exceptional, and we were well supported by our management.I enjoyed my 3 years with Range Resources.  Excellent people.  All the co-workers were good to work with.  The office was always helpful in any situation.My time at this company was very enjoyable. I appreciated working with a lot of very smart people who were willing to share information and teach others. I learned a lot more about Prizm and Zone Manager than I knew before. The work atmosphere was very pleasant and everyone showed respect for each other. Management had an open-door policy and you didn't have to hesitate to approach your manager with any concern.A typical workday for me at Range Resources involved creating and updating reporting programs for the accounting and operations departments. In addition to this I updated technical documentation for any reports that were worked on. I learned how to prioritize tasks and that productivity and output are far more important than perfection. My coworkers were hard workers who collaborated well on various projects. Each of my coworkers had a wealth of knowledge in their respective expertises and I enjoyed picking their brains. I was in charge of reporting, one coworker was in charge of developing the database for our BI system, another coworker was the on-site AS/400 developer, and there were three analysts who served as the go-between for the developers and the end-users. Management had a tremendous amount of experience in the oil and gas industry and were a valuable resource for various assignments I worked on. I reported to one manager who oversaw the three developers and he reported to the manager who was in charge of IT-support (which had 8 employees). The hardest part of my job was managing end-user expectations. The most enjoyable part of my job was struggling to keep up with end-user requests when I was the only report developer.Same as last review for EOG Resources. Maintain and grow production!Management is severely out-of-touch with staff and it shows in every possible way! Extreme lack of communication inhibits career growth and development!Range Resources is a good company. Management was very easy to get along with. I had flexible work hours. I had the opportunity learn a lot about the gas and oil industry.It was very enjoyable working at BP, and the people were great.Well defined process' and proceedures. Workers help each other and are team oriented.I learned a lot while working here and worked with some great people. The work schedule was nice with every other Friday off with the 9/80 schedule."

Call anyone and everyone on your list determining the right person to get in touch with regarding purchases of IT equipment. Research on LinkedIn and other forms of social media to learn about those that you are contacting to help build relationships with them to build rapor during the sales process.You'll love it here.  Business development representatives: it's a very good place to learn.  Great good place for kids straight out of college.  Fun and exciting.i loved the fast paced environment, kept me focused and diligent on my task at hand. learned how to effectively complete task's in a efficient manner. loved the management, when the company grew i felt like i grew too.I really enjoyed working at Rapid7. If they had made an offer after my internship, I would have taken it in a heartbeat.  The people are great and I found the work to be fulfilling.Not recommended for seasoned administrative professionals. Not an empowering environment for powerful females due to management.Long hours but a great place to work with good people. A lot of people get burned out so you have to be able to roll with the punches  and come in ready to work everyday.This company is in the best position industry from a sales perspective. Security is a hot topic these days and companies are required to own the products/ services they provide. All in all worth working here if you can keep up with a fast paste work environment.There is nearly always something interesting and challenging to work on at Rapid7. Team members are fun to work with and quite competent. The SDLC is mostly agile.Work/life balance is very good. Results are by far more important here than logging hours. There are generally core hours when meetings occur leaving schedules relatively flexible.Executive management is approachable and happy to discuss any ideas or concerns.Most days I come and leave when I feel like; as long as I get my work done and communicate my status at our daily standup, everything is good. I'm able to work from home when I need to. Deadlines are in place, but the workload is rarely a burden. The different teams are fairly silo'd, so it may be different depending on where you land. Despite high salaries, good benefits, and a flexible workplace, turnover is fairly high. I think upper management may be trying to optimize too much sometimes.Progressive company with amazing security products and services. Talented co-workers, eager to learn and accelerate their careers. Obtained advanced knowledge of security applications, best practices and compliance regulations across many industries. My position required weekly out-of-state travel. Had the opportunity to meet great people in the IT Security and related fields.I have been with Rapid7 for almost two years now and without a doubt it has been the most satisfying, exciting and growth oriented experience of my career. This is a company that embraces innovation and new ideas, encouraging their employees to push what is possible. The people are really smart and also very dedicated to succeed. There is unlimited growth potential and the executive team really invests in their groups, from learning initiatives to career planning. Oh - we also have a ton of fun here too. It is not often I would say it is ""fun"" to go to work every day, but Rapid7 makes me often feel that way. We have a high bar for who we hire - but if you are up to it you should definitely check us out.I have been here for 6 years and often get asked why I have been here as long as I have. Here are my reasons:*Love the people I work with and work for. Everyone is passionate about what they do and care about doing quality work. Also, people are not afraid to roll up their sleeves and get their hands dirty. No such thing as 'that's not included in my job description' - (and yes, this includes upper-level management - on a technical or non-technical level).*Career advancement opportunities. This is a combination from rapid7 growth and working hard. If you are going above and beyond, you will get career advancement or transfer to a department you're interested in getting into. If you are doing what's 'required,', you will not see opportunities.*Piggy-backing off bullet point #2, it's fun being part of a growing company; every year is different and presents a set of new challenges.Things I wish I could change:*Benefits are average, nothing remarkableSuch an amazing mix of innovation, culture, passion, and a work/life balance is encouraged!Run, don't walk, from this place.  A bunch of kids playing with the toy they're being paid to push. Management a joke.Great company to work for and definitely an exciting place to work.If you have a decent career, don't ruin it by gambling on Rapid7. This is the main purpose of my review, to prevent another person from making the same mistake as myself and others who joined this company.Typical day: work 10 hours at home or office. Work can be very interesting to very boring.Learned: rule engine programmingManagement: or lack thereof, terribleHardest part: not doing proper research on this company before joiningEnjoyable part: co-workersPros:# good co-workers, depending on your luck# challenging work# ability to work from homeCons:# incompetent management from CEO to manager level. Company changes directions multiple times in quarters while not hiring additional resources, there is essentially no plan. Managers need training, a lot of them are highly technical people who have been promoted to manager level too soon.# insane work hours... I would put the daily average at around 10 hr / day for the core engineering teams. I have never seen employees work this long before, of course some overtime is understood but overtime all the time?# high level of bureaucracy and back biting and little chance of career advancement.# lack of proper QA, testing is usually 2-4 days before release to publicManagement does not care about you as a person - its you, the number. Peers are very shrewd and have defined cliques (yes, it is like a middle school). Weren't there from the beginning? Don't even bother trying to fit in. Very loud music is played constantly, footballs and soccer balls are tossed around - makes having a serious client conversation very difficult. Management also does not care about customers. It's a ""boiler room"" type environment where you are required to just call without strategy and if you don't, you get reprimanded. The Sales team is one giant joke that revolves around a lack of strategy, poor management and silly rituals. Every time someone closes a deal, you have to listen to someone bang on an OBNOXIOUS gong and then you are required to waste 10 minutes high-fiving everyone on the floor. If you do not, you are reprimanded. Conversations are had at full volume, with some reps yelling profanities and making very inappropriate jokes - despite you having to call customers simultaneously. Its a company that cares more about how ""cool"" the people are that come in the door, rather than if they are quality employees and can actually perform the job. If you don't jive with their silly culture, you will be made aware of your place on the outside. Long story short, if you want a job where you have potential to advance and actually learn how to sell effectively, this is not it. Your growth will be stunted by political BS, favoritism, and an overall lack of appreciation for the individual."
219,Raytheon,"Challenging Engineering problems all day everyday:  Just the way I like it.  The section that I work in lets engineers do what they are best at.Learning is encouraged at Raytheon especially in the electrical testing field, management practices and administration, new and innovative electronics, computer sciences, and highly specialized NAVAL equipment. Hardest part of the job is the schedule of the Government, and potentially the hours required to work. Most enjoyable part of the job is the care and support that management and upper management play int he advancement of their employees.Routine/repetition in daily tasks most of the time. Was given the opportunity to be cross trained in a publications department. My former immediate manager valued employee opinions whereas current management doesn't appear to care. Mixed, some were back stabbers to benefit themselves. The hardest part of the job was trying to work past the negatives.Raytheon has been a good place to work.  During times of growth with work to keep the staff feeling secure it can be an enjoyable place to work.  When there are reductions in head count and closing of facilities the workplace can be depressing.   There is a flex work schedule for many employees that allows the employees a daily schedule that can be better tailored to their lives.  Most employees follow a 9/80 work schedule with alternating Fridays off.  Benefits including health care, dental, vision, 401K, and IRA are industry standard and are adjusted every year to be in line with competing employers.Work environment is casual. Come in when you want: just make sure you finish your work.I learned a ton. They really trust you to be able to do the work. And there's good and bad to that: you have an amazing opportunity to grow, impress and learn but you may stumble and fail.Management is variable but overall, I haven't heard anyone complain immensely. No micromanagement or abusive behavior.Co-workers are engineers in the most traditional sense. You're amongst your own kind.Hardest part of the job is dealing with the unsexiness of the defense industry. Another other complaints comes with any software job: boring bug tracking tasks, etc.Most enjoyable is the flexibility and the freedom to prove your knowledge/intellect.Pay is average.Raytheon is a great place to work.  Many opportunities for advancement in a fast paced and demanding work environment.   If you're a hard worker and have a great attitude sky's the limit with this company!good place to work but hard to develop and move up due to the union. non stressful environment with good management. benefits and vacation/ sick time were a plus.Flex time to allow work life balance made it easier to maintain perfect attendance. Attention to respecting others while getting the job done was a strong emphasis in the working environment. I learned the importance of integrity and the impact it has on self and others.The Co-Op experience was fantastic for learning the different sides of the business at Raytheon. I only had 2 years of experience at this company, but the overall culture/job was interesting and challenging.The leadership really look out for all the employees to the best of their ability. Great benefits and the family to work ratio is great for those with families. The only downside to working with this company is the lack of job security due to the contract based employees.It was obvious early on that Raytheon wants to be one of its larger competitors. I worked at the other company and they aren't succeeding at being as good or better. For starters, the technology some people need to do their job is so outdated. Even basics like Outlook aren't rolled out. Prepare to step back on time unless you are willing to find and pay for training on your own. Lots of conflicting messages about flexibility and balance.Starting from Corporate and into the businesses, there are cultural problems. It is very hierarchical and leaders are worshipped. Leaders foster a culture of mediocrity. If you have suggestions, you may be told that you're negative or a complainer. True commitment to diversity and inclusion is lacking. So much of a person's experience at Raytheon depends on the management chain.Great work environment. Management could use some training. Hard place to keep contracts. layoffs very often. Good benefits, college reimbursement,   401k, medical and dental.Very clean shop, with new equipment to work with.workers are all easy to work withManagement always there to assist when needed.Company has great benefits.This company was a very good company to work for. They gave good benefits along with good pay. I was sorry when I got laid off when they laid off 15000 employees nationwide.I've worked for Raytheon for almost 10 years. Excellent company and benefits. Diversity and respect for others important in companyTook the job, even though I live 75 miles north of Lawton.Great people and benefits, but too many miles are on my car now. Moving isn't an option yetIIS develops very complex systems.  There is a tremendous amount of domain knowledge within the company.  The main fault with the company is that these large unwieldy programs are being strangulated with an ill fitting agile/scrum management implementation (not to be confused with an actual engineering methodology).Benefits are the best part about working for Raytheon. It's a forward thinking company and they take care of their employees.Good place to work. Good benefits and lots of work. Working on state of the art equipment and lots of different programs.Raytheon has very challenging and fulfilling work if you manage to be placed into the right team.Some of the challenges is retaining great talent because benefits have been reduced such as elimination of profit sharing and reduced annual raises.Hughes Aircraft was purchased by Raytheon all together I spent 32 years with the company. Did many different engineering tasks. Lot's of opportunity to try different technical paths. Had a great carrier there for 32 years."
232,Raytheon Corporation,"Challenging Engineering problems all day everyday:  Just the way I like it.  The section that I work in lets engineers do what they are best at.I worked in a reproduction department with 2 shifts. We made blue prints and secret and top secret documentation for the military and DOD (Department Of Defense)Family situation changed and I had to leave the job. Otherwise, Raytheon was an excellent company. The 9/80 schedule makes for an awesome work life balance. Management was great and encouraged training and growth.IIS develops very complex systems.  There is a tremendous amount of domain knowledge within the company.  The main fault with the company is that these large unwieldy programs are being strangulated with an ill fitting agile/scrum management implementation (not to be confused with an actual engineering methodology).Employees were always team players and as such, worked as a team along with management.I management these great teams of employees and honored to have been able to train them to be team players.Excellent leadership.

Finished my degree in Computer Science while working here. Eventually wound up in the IT department until I left to pursue working for myself.I train soldiers how to maintain unmanned aircraft. Its a fun job that i look forward to every morning. The people i work with are primarily veterans, so the work environment is exactly what i was hoping for in a job outside the military.Excellent place to work. High tech people and very professional to work with. Great work place and very upbeat. Work doing different tasks everyday and constantly discovering new resolutions.Job was exciting and satisfying; leadership was in Ivory Tower, very bureaucratic and hierarchical at headquarters.Routine/repetition in daily tasks most of the time. Was given the opportunity to be cross trained in a publications department. My former immediate manager valued employee opinions whereas current management doesn't appear to care. Mixed, some were back stabbers to benefit themselves. The hardest part of the job was trying to work past the negatives.This is a very typical defense industry environment.  There is a lot of emphasis on getting the job done well and on time.   Management was very well versed in the defense area and worked very hard to accomplish its mission.The work environment was a bit crowded with tight seating arrangements.Most of the people were nice and friendly.Good place to work.

Basic instruction for ANSF personnel, and to mentor the local national English language instructors. However, the Afghanistan contract was cancelled in the month of December 2013, due to U.S. budget cuts and U.S. military withdraw. My contractual research and developmental studies for Raytheon continued U.S. state side with the development of instructional ELT Aviation English curriculum lessons for AMT professionals.Great technology company. IT is a great functional area in which one can thrive. I highly recommend this employer. It is a stable and highly diverse environment; truly respectful of its people.This company was a very good company to work for. They gave good benefits along with good pay. I was sorry when I got laid off when they laid off 15000 employees nationwide.Raytheon is a great place to work with a great group of employees. The work schedule was flexible and it provided a great work life balance. Unfortunately my contracted ended there but if it didn't I would have stayed for a long timeThe company was great at challenging employees to meet high paced schedule demands to get equipment back to the customer."
749,RBC,"Busy office but manageable. Management and co-workers were great to work with. Very enjoyable job!It was such a great experience to work for RBC Wealth Management. I learned to work in fast pace environment and to managed competitive priorities. I was helping a team of two financial advisors with all the administrative tasks, calendars, communication and financial transactions. The managers and supervisors were great allies to help me grows within the company. The team I worked with were mainly reactive rather than proactive and it made it very hard to learn a structure and organization. However, I always felt appreciated by them. I was able to remain myself and still belong to the team.Enjoyed working with my clients and prospects.Reasonable commission schedule.Nice office and location.Office closed due to lack of recruiting on part off management.Royal Bank of Canada offered a professional and comfortable work atmosphere. Salary and compensation levels were competitive. Personal were very Team orientated.Very comparable in terms of compensation and work-life balance with the bulge bracket banks, but still lacks top exit opps. Culture and management varies widely between different groups. Great place to learn a lot.RBC was a great company to work for that allow for growth and personal development.  I worked my way up from middle office to front officeRoyal Bank of Canada is a very sound financial institution. I worked for the Bank for 10 years in the Futures division located in Chicago. They are very responsible to there employees and create a comfortable work environment.It's fun and rewarding to work for RBC. The culture is open and inclusive.  Senior management communicates and keep employees informed about the direction and strategies of the firm.RBC is a good company to work for.  The benefits are good, the pay is competitive.  You do want to make sure that if you pick a career path (operations over business line) that you stick with it however.  Once you get too high up in one or the other it is hard to switch over.I worked within the trade support team for just over 7 months on a contract role. The role support the equity sales traders. I was located in London..I have worked here for 14 years and have found that the culture has increasingly become very toxic. That being said the benefits are good and there is a decent amount of job security.RBC works hard to provide affordable competitive benefits.  However, they determine employee salary by analyzing industry averages and meeting, not exceeding, the average.RBC is a terrific company to work for and love that there are options for growth if you are willing to make changes.  Just like any company there are differences in opinion and management but overall this company is good to work for long term.Excellent leadership.Learned about banking.Excellent training.One of the best companies that  I have worked for.They give you all the tools to be sucessfulMy day begins with updating reports, checking for errors and preparing for closing calls. The rest of my day is all about making sure all deadlines are met. Towards the end of the day we make sure  that all account are balanced and if we have to  assist each other to  get issue that demand urgent solutions.Lots of hours for little outcome. Depending on the group you could work on some M&A deals but mostly you will be pitching a lotThis company is a small but nice place to work at, They show appreciation. The contribute to your success. You really work as a team to in a good way.Support 40+ executives with a variety of requests including travel, creating presentations/org charts, answering phones, faxing/copying,Enjoyed coming to work.  I like to keep busy and help other employees if need be.  I enjoy talking to client on the phone and developing a personal relationship with them.Great intern projects and responsibilities. Company and people really care about your professional growth. Good work/life balance is actually something that is stressed on employees, depending which department you are in but overall it's the company's culture. Really great people to work with especially within the Project Delivery Office (PDO). I would love to come back and work here full time.like working here because the days seem to go by fast. This was a very high stressful Job because it was about the stock market and other people money."
779,Real Staffing,"Great company to work for.  Would work for them again.  Good learning environment, good compensation, grro benefits, other programmers worked well together.Management at Real Staffing is very responsive to contractor's needs.  They resolve issues quickly and efficiently.Real Staffing provides technical staff to the pharmaceutical and medical device industries.  They provide contractors who fill short time positions such as quality assessment audits and validation activities"
85,RedBeacon,"I worked a summer assisting my grandfather with contracting work through redbeacon.  I enjoyed this immensely and learned many helpful basic repair skills along with knowledge of a wide variety of tools.Awesome company, work in you PJ's. But they do expect you to perform, since your on contract with them. Been with them almost 3 years. They were a start up until Home Depot bought they,. Going national soon, which is exciting. So long term contracted job if you perform and don't have attendance issues."
242,RELX Group,"RELX is a great company. They offer the best benefits.  The team is great to work with.me, I have learned so much, and was promoted twice with the team."
129,Relypsa,Relypsa is a great company to work for if your a FTE or contractor. The people and the culture is great from my experience.
477,Rent The Runway,"Every one was friendly and very helpful with helping new employees.I learned how to do things such as drycleaning, machine operating, and spotting. Co workers are always efficient and on top of work. Hardest part is working a high amount of hours completing a high number of garment , almost 10,000 a day. but it's also fun and challenging. Most enjoyable part was the environment and people that I worked with.Associates are great. Upper management needs work. Prime example of a startup company that lost sight of the core values that made them.Awesome Culture.Very young company. Very calm environment. Can drink in the office.No dress code. Very free spirited. End of the month is always a headache but not a big deal.Coming into the position, you are trained on all aspects of the rules and guidelines of the company. This is strictly a customer service role. Unfortunately, the only growth within is to become a Senior customer communications associate (with a $1 raise). The pay is not enough for the 9 hour days and weekend shifts.The most enjoyable part of the job is the random perks and fun coworkers.working at rent the runway was an great opportunity for me. it was fast pace and i like that. they provided me with great hours and worked around my school schedule.Once management was changed, the culture shifted. There were a lot of dishonesty going on with the CEO causing a spiral affect in their Customer Insights Department.I enjoyed working here unfortunately there wasn't any open permanent positions at the time my contract expired. The staff was very open and kind. They're an awesome team to work with!A typical day at work includes documentation of all new merchandise, quality assurance, and last but not least, input of all new inventory into our warehouse management system.Lots of lifting, poor management, lots of employee turnover.  Overtime most days due to poor decision makingVery hard workI was able to learn how to dry clean garments. I had learned more information on how to wash clothing. So many things I experimented and experienced working are skills I still use today.One must have an extremely tough skin working in the corporate office at Rent The Runway. Thank goodness for wonderful co-workers who became friends and confidantes. Many times seeing their faces and getting to talk to them during lunch was the only thing to keep me going.the morning there were kinda busy, but died down after 10 amI learned that your pay hardly increasesco workers are very friendlythe hardiest part of the job was staying positive therethe most enjoyable was smoke breakCompany culture is very inclusive and everyone is easy-going, friendly and sociable. As it is still a relatively new company, management is sometimes confusing, but seems to be developing successfully.One must have an extremely tough skin working at any of the Rent The Runway stores.  Thank goodness for wonderful co-workers who became friends and confidantes.  Many times seeing their faces and getting to talk to them during lunch was the only thing to keep me going.  The combination of low inventory, extremely long wait times for dressing rooms and irate customers, it definitely took the toll on everyone.  Few things that need to change that would dramatically improve morale:- Please thoroughly TRAIN THE CUSTOMER SERVICE TEAM!! It is unacceptable and hurts us when CI tells customers over the phone the wrong things to get them off the phone (ie: telling customers wrong store hours, incorrect information about when their dress will arrive knowing that we cannot guarantee what van a dress will be on, saying that we carry all 65,000 dress in store when we only carry 1,000, etc.)- Please be more clear on the website explaining the ""walk in"" procedure, if you walk in without an appointment you will have to wait for a dressing room to open up you can't just pop in and immediately try on, dressing rooms are reserved for the clients who have paid for an appointment, too much confusion from walk ins who take their anger out on the employees- Management: Please have monthly events for the team to boost morale.  Dealing with a high stress job is emotionally taxing.  Please keep your promises when saying that we will have team outings (bowling, dinner boat cruises, karaoke, team dinners, etc.) and please be open to feedback from employees and do not bring outside drama/personal  more... matters into the job - we should not be subject to your anger over what happened with your boyfriend, friends, etc.The most enjoyable part was seeing my co-workers and learning a lot about myself and drawing out strength I didn't know I had.  lessI like the people I work with. We all work hard but the job is a little underpaid when it comes to how much work and energy we put it in.A good company to work for. The work environment is fast pace but an enjoyable work to go to. Enjoyable and fun co-workers, very friendly environment too.I worked as a store stylist for Rent the Runway. At first I was excited and thought I would really enjoy the work and in some ways that was right, however things took a bad turn. There is good and bad, the people I worked with are great, but the compensation is a joke. When they tell you you will make $40,000 a year or $20 an hour, run away because that's a lie. Trust me I'm saying this and my sales were some of the best in the country. You really cant move up in the company from retail to corporate, they don't hire from within and they don't promote. Rather than advancing stylist to senior stylists who had been at the retail location they hired outside stylists. What does that tell you? The business also needs SERIOUS work. There are a lot of issues with there never being enough merchandise to sell, dresses never arriving to customers and dresses arriving but being dirty or ripped. Which of course customers will yell at you for that, and when you complain about business practice nothing happens. If it's your first job its a good stepping stone, but if you are experienced and want a career go elsewhere. One of the worst markers of this company is that you could walk into their retail location right how and ask all the associates if they would quit on the spot given any other job offer and they would all say yes. Trust me I have asked.Amazing company with some of the best, most methodical people that I have ever worked with! Definitely a fun work environment to be a part of!Fun, cool place to work. However I didn't want to go another year a as a ""temp""The company is run like a sorority house and they have no clue about fashion. Do not leave a well established company to go here. They hire and fire irrationally.Morning consisted of processing returns for shipping (i.e. scanning, sorting and cleaning.) Afternoons were more chaotic with the majority of the day's shipments requiring assembling of orders, processing orders, organizing showrooms, communicating with center control from New York. During evenings, preparations for next day shipments, double checking inventory and managing damaged and problem orders. The work partition involved incoming, outgoing, and cleaning. However, many of us floated from divisions to speed up work flow. Hardest part would be the long hours of constant physical strain for 12h+ sometimes. Most enjoyable parts had to be the teamwork, break station with pool table, and helpful/accessible management team. Typically the personality constant of everyone was determined, work orientated however friendly, funny and approachable."
349,RetailNext,The company is laid-back but fast-growing with many opportunities in the future!
496,Reuters Group,I worked in customer and management roles in a variety of countries for Reuters prior to their merger with Thomson and subsequent redundancy.Fantastic company.Fantastic cultureFantastic people.
658,RGS Associates Inc,"Professional company with smart and dedicated employees and a supportive and positive culture.  Leadership makes solid decisions to ensure future company success and is very transparent to all employees.  Everyone supports each other as much as possible, but there is always a competitive nature to the consulting industry.Most enjoyable part of the job has to be the positive atmosphere and the great co-workers from corporate.the smaller company benefits include knowing top management and being a valuable asset to a small team. Management was flexible and helpful and benefits were excellent.Great people!  I feel the area of improvement would in management in taking care of employees.I love RGS, I have been a remote employee since I was hired and I can say that the company has been accomodating and the onboarding process was flawless. I can really appreciate that the company is focused on people first and profit as close second. A very happy and productive enviornment.It was awesome going to work everyday.The company has fantastic people. I really enjoyed all my projects while I was there.The company cares about their employees and their clients.The onboarding process is like no other, communication and mutual respect for all employees is what makes RGS an awesome company. The can do spirit and the team work are what make the company and the individuals second to none. I love working for RGS!"
773,Rice University,"Very collaborative and a great place to learn and expand one's knowledge base. Located at the heart of Houston - it is one of the few schools that dictates the best possible jobs across all industries ranging from big management consulting firms to core engineering and sciences jobs.The people are great but the pay is lacking. The work can be interesting and the benefits are strong. Lots of opportunity to branch out and work with other departments. Free class per semester.As a student, working a job on campus has many benefits, and work is very flexible if you have test or something. Your job depends on your positions, and can be anything from managing a library to filing papers or staring at a computer.Fun research environment, beautiful campus, good salary, good location, vast parking lots, awful health services, good recreational center, good nanofabrication facilities.First off, I notice most of these wonderful reviews are written by students or student workers, not by regular employees. Honestly I'm not that impressed. The best thing about working here is probably the benefits, mainly the health insurance offers very good coverage. But, in my opinion it's pretty expensive, more expensive than average if you're covering more than just yourself.The work environment itself in non-campus office positions is extremely dull and boring. You're typically glued to your desk and the offices are set up in a very isolated manner, to the point it gets depressing. You may meet a lot of nice people here, but there are also a lot of people that are in lower positions that are stuck up and on their ""high horse"" because they think working for Rice is such a big deal, even though they're actually at the bottom of the barrel in the lowest positions. My experience has been that the people higher up are actually the nicer people.Time off is ok, but they're very strict about how much time you can use and when and also you're expected to take NO time off for the first 6 months except for University holidays. In most departments you'll get 1 week off in December for a holiday break (but some departments work through the break) and 3 weeks of PTO (vacation, sick, etc all included as one). Even though this sounds good, the time can run out quickly because many holidays that other schools and colleges are closed, Rice is not. You don't get Good Friday, President's day, or even Christmas Eve and there's no spring break for staff. So if you want those days off,  more... you'll have to use your PTO, which will take almost a week of your time away just on holidays.Traffic in this area is horrific. I live about 15 miles away and it takes about 45 mins to 1 hour to get there in the morning and 1 hour - 1 and 1/2 hours to get home in the evening. If there's an accident, close to 2 hours. They frown upon working from home and flexible schedules even if your job is not people oriented. So, there's no option of working from home.My biggest gripe is that the work is SO boring and slow paced and dealing with the attitudes of some of management that don't communicate with each other, then take it out on the employees and try to blame us when something goes wrong. Overall if I could go back (I had 2 jobs offers when I took this job) I'd have taken the other job I was offered).  lessI work contract and assisted the Director of the Provost Office, where I focused on Rice Purchase Card reconciliations, file organization and management for the faculty where I handled documents such as CV's, sabbatical leaves and faculty promotions; worked closely with the Dean's of the different schools/departments.Overall it is a very good place to work. I have found that most everyone on campus is incredibly supportive, no matter what department they are in. I have never called someone for help and been told they did not have the time for me. I have learned that we are all in this as a team. My co-workers are wonderful, caring and talented individuals, who again see the department as a team and not as a group of individuals.What I find difficult about the job is the lack of advancement. The job is, what the job is, no matter how good you may be at it, you will never be awarded with a raise or a promotion. You must leave  where you are happy and comfortable in order to secure more money and a promotion of any sort.The most enjoyable part of the job is the access to all forms educational lectures, visiting artists and performers. We have an incredible window to the world within our hedges!Go in and log onto your computer and check you emails respond to them and help customers.I excelled in my customer service skills.Management were great and flexible.Outgoing and nice.Being asked to work 4 extra before going home but was done.Working in such a prestigious University.Had the best time of my life in the department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. Developed expertise in Dynamics and Process Control and ended up teaching a course to senior engineers at the end of my PhDTypical name submitting purchase orders and paying invoices. What I learned working for Rice University is that the University is on a budget and if new federal funds are not received this will impacted your merit raise at the end of the year. Management sought highly qualified employees that could assist them to change their current process to a faster updated system of records. Co-Workers worked and assisted others during vacation schedules or during down time. The hardest part of my job is processing over 5,000 invoices from begining to end by fiscal close while maintaining vendor files and the equipment folders for large purchases with proper documentations. The most enjoyable part of the job is assisting the faculty and coworkers with purchase orders and ensuring accounting principles and accounting budgets or in line with the grant proposal.I like to start the day off by letting the team know or finding out for myself what are the priorities of the day.  We generally work together to accomplish goals.  I am a leader, yet, I also know how to join the team and work together.I worked with students, staff, and parents daily while analyzing their needs and meeting them with federal and institutional financial service options. This university consistently ranks among the best places to work for many reasons. Primarily, I loved working there because of the great benefits, amazing job security, family oriented co-workers and brilliant students. The top notch theater arts, guest speakers and athletic competitions further connected me with the student body. Wonderful place to work!Very good university, very good environment. The professors are all friendly, and you will learn much from them. Strongly recommend it.A typical day was hard work and getting the job done.  Enjoyed working with undergraduate and graduate students to assist them in adding and/or dropping classes.  Enjoyed assisting faculty with events and conferences. For the employee were always encouraged to take classes to learn new systems.  The hardest part of the job was making the student aware that the Examinations and Standing committee denied their case.This work is a  research based work. I have learned different aspects in robotics and artificial intelligence..The most challenging part is implementing algorithms on real robotic system.I enjoyed building intelligent systems and working with robotsI work in a research lab. The work is good, resources are top of the line, and people are always helpful. I would recommend it.Nice platform for pursuing career in Academia. Exceptional institute for higher education. Relative small number of students so the faculty:student ratio is high.Rice was a pleasure to work for.  The benefits and compensation are nice (for a post-doctoral position), and the staff in the Physics department were helpful and responsive.If you love outstanding scientific research, Rice University is the perfect place. The city of Houston is great and the campus is just minutes away from its cultural district. The library is the best I've ever been to. The laboratories are amazing!Rice University is an amazing place to work. It does carry about the employees. It does have amazing lectures given by famous people in their field. Health benefits are great and Rice university takes care of everything so one can focus on doing job well.Rice University is an awesome place to work.  I have enjoyed my years of service here but am ready learn other work environments which will enhance my skills and challenge my experience."
277,Robert Bosch LLC,"Review prints find parts to build the machine. if needed I will make the parts. quote jobs talk with customers about there project and if satisfied over build. sometimes customers wants more than what was quoted at the start of the job.Worked for the company for nearly 20 years.  They use to walk the talk of the culture and importance of community.  They used to treat their employees like valuable team members.  Now, it has turned into a burn them and churn them, no matter how much a person has contributed to the success of the organization.Management changes every few years and the culture changes to reflect the beliefs and management practices of the current establishment.My position required leadership skills to direct the work force towards company goals. This included on time deliveries, customer interaction, and diplomacy. Other responsibilities included training of workers, both salary and hourly, and safety. It was a pleasure to work with, on the most part, professional people in their fields of expertise. This created a high expectation that the team would achieve daily and long range goals. I earned the respect from all levels of management.1. Bosch expect you to grow automatically, the training/follow-up feed back is severely insufficient.2. Bosch encourage you to work over time: it is not on the rule, but the task assigned to you definitely make you work over 50, even 60 hours per week, on an average Engineer;  3. Highly bureaucratic management.4. Lack humanistic care: my colleague's wife is during pregnancy at her 9th month, the company still assign him to German for 8 weeks! He miss the most important moment in his life! Similar things happened very often.5. HR is not nice to you, especially if you are a not US citizen: your green-card sponsorship, H-1 B are reluctant approve with delay.Relatively good compensation; Good to be a manager in BoschBosch is a non-profit organization, which means it's not publically traded and there are no share holders. It's a very diverse company, as well as the largest automotive supplier in the world.Bosch treats its employees well and there are many opportunities, especially for those with 4yr degrees.Wonderful experience while working for Bosch in Broadview, Illinois.  Excellent Leadership and ample opportunity for career movement.  Technical and operations training is world class.  The benefits at Bosch AANA, are great especially when compared to what other companies are currently offering.  The only reason I left is Bosch moved their distribution to Atlanta Georgia.Well structured company to work for. Great benefits. Great pay and fun people to work with. Management was awesome. Was respective very well. Made a lot of friends.Management not transparent to employees but decent work culture and good opportunity to learn.Decent compensation and very good work-life balance. Limited growth opportunities for employees.Don't recommend, they don't care about the employees only the profits and quantity of parts put out, long hours 7 day work week,lots of employee turnover* Fast paced and results driven environment* I Learned that you will never achieve true confidence or success without stepping out of your comfort zone.* I Worked with some of the most talented managers with strong engineering back rounds that were committed to success. They were always approachable and willing to share their knowledge.* My co-workers and I worked as one. We worked as a team and addressed problems in the same manner.* The hardest part of the job was learning how to get all supportive groups of inter-connected processes to work together and consistently live up to their end of the task.* The most enjoyable part of the job was making commitments to our customer and being able to deliver on those commitments.Good benefits and opportunities for advancement. Moving to a centralized theme wherever possible to provide consistency to employees.Good benefitsGood work environmentterrible communications between departments.little advancement possibilitiesA lot of escaltion/task forcethe majority of employees are waiting to retire and do not care about being productive. management seems to encourage this behavior. it's a wonder things get done.Management leadership skills are lacking. Its more of a dictatorship. You are treated like a number and not a person with a life and family outside of Bosch. The hardest part of the job is the mandatory weekends. Some months we can work of 21 straight days. The most enjoyable part of the job is the pay. Advancement is on a ""who you know not what you know' basis.I have learned a lot from this position regarding strategic planning of the product line, communication with different management levels inside and outside of organization and also i have learned that i am not a 100% office person. I like to travel outside the office, meat people and get challenged by their needs.So it's hard to get a real feel for the company culture/environment.  I work in a Ford facility which is much older and has an older work culture, however while on site at Bosch facilities my experiences were much better. They have to distance themselves from the customer, Ford, even if they're in the same building.A typical day at work for me was extremely rewarding. This was a 7 day operation that required a lot of team work. What I learned from here was my knowledge of heat treat and the importance of team work. The management staff that I worked with was top notch. Most of my coworkers were also top notch. The was really nothing hard about this job but hearing the news we were closing. The great working relationships that you build!!Typical day is mostly desk environment but it greatly depends on the product line one works in.   Being a large company many responsibilities are compartmentalized, however a position where interaction with multiple disciplines was most rewarding because it allows you to become a generalist.  At the same time, you could also become an expert in a specific component, so it's easy to find that this company provides opportunities across the board to fit the breadth of knowledge you're hoping to gain in a product/system.The typical day of work at Bosch starts early and ends late, but it's an enjoyable work environment with good people. I learned how to work hard for room and board, how to make lifelong friends and how to enjoy a salad buffet. Management was effective, and coworkers worked together fluidly. The hardest part was leaving. The most enjoyable parts were learning how to do my tasks more proficiently.( A typical day at work ) my crew and I reaching our daily quota          ( what I learn )  troubleshoot , calibrating , testing , rework                  ( management ) respectful and supportive ( co-workers ) , respectful and willing to lend a hand ,( hardest part of the job )  when machines would malfunction , ( most enjoyable part of job )  leading my guys helping and teaching as much as possibleTreated badly an terrible job security. They followed me to the bathroom an talked down to workers. i will never work there ever again an do not recommend it to anyone."
179,Roberts Recruiting,Awesome company. Best benefit ever was being able to work from home!
119,Roche,"My role in this job ranged from documentations expert to data manager to bio-statistician. Entering with a background in applied physics, I had a diverse and strong skill set, and this job required me to preform at all levels nearly all the time, whether I was networking with colleagues overseas to develop a testing procedure that would yield strong statistical power or to give an open presentation on our team's progress and statistical results. As my contract approached its end, my time was spent on data management and documentation.The company provided ample support and cross-department assistance. The atmosphere was largely amicable and the employees were incredibly friendly, which alleviated the stress that came with the workload. I was given the space and guidance to learn R, quickly becoming our office's expert, and developed statistical analysis modalities for verification protocols. I learned quality control procedures and how to produce adequate scientific publication for FDA submission. Learning is my favorite part of any job, and my role at Roche allowed me to absorb the knowledge and experience I need to become a stronger industry scientist.Our company was approaching launch when I joined, so my employment was restricted to a contractor position which did not grant vacation nor holidays. This was an issue for me, having missed out on holidays for the previous 6 years (4 during undergrad, 2 grad school), impacted by the high-intensity requirements of the job as we approached 510K/CE-marking submissions. These are the only qualms I had.If you don't agree with anything, make sure to keep it to yourself.  You'll by walked out the door so quickly that it'll make your head spin. HR...cluelessRoche is a very stable place to work, it provides great health, 401K and maternity benefits and job security. It's an international company with lots of growth opportunities internationally and locally.The work/life balance and benefits are far superior to other employers in the area.  The overall attitude of all leadership is to be learn from you as they teach you and prep you for the next stage in your career.  The most difficult part of working for an employer like Roche is having corporate headquarters in another country.  It can tend to cause some angst in getting through red tape and the fact that things are ran differently in Switzerland vs the US.  In short, a great place to land and settle in for the long haul.The direct reports control your outcome of your performance. The cafeteria is decent and the place is full of people who have worked more than 10 years. It is very difficult to win with the constant harassment by your reports and constantly going to HR to create havoc for the Manager.Roche is full of intelligent people who are always striving to better themselves, their company, and their products. I worked as an intern in the Technical Transfer Team and could not have been happier with my experience. I was encouraged to learn as much as I could during my time their and everyone I met was enthusiastic and helpful.Stable organization with great benefits and compensation. Generous profit sharing with full time employees. Plenty of activities and causes to join through the organization.Good. Nice working environment. Good working culture and good balance of work and personal life. Would recommend working at a great company. Great benefits as well.This was a great company to work for.  Management helped to foster a learning environment where anyone willing could grow.Roche is a great place to work. They have a clear direction as to where they are going and want to be. They are very supportive of your career goals whether with the company or not.Every time I got to work everybody would greet you with a smile. My co-workers were friendly, my supervisor was friendly and my work space was the best.Typical day at work consisted of me locating the shortages/overages of premium payments sent in from bail bonds agents who are writing under Roche by comparing our sales report to theirs, and notifying them of such differences. Also creating state needed documents specific to each state the bail bond agent resides in so they are able to legally start writing bail bonds. I wouldn't recommend working here, as teamwork is not a top priority at Roche Surety. Every man for themselves is basically the atmosphere I have come to learn over the past year. I learned how to better organize myself through all the chaos. The hardest part of the job was communication amongst co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job is the one friendship I developed with someone who has been with the company for about 10 years. At a moments notice, you can be let go without any notice of the termination or a legitimate reason as to why.I was really happy to work for this company, by mornings we started at 7 hrs and continue working until 12 hrs, that was the lunch time for my type of contract person, then 1 hour lunch and back to work from 13 to 16:30 hrs. but Friday, job on Friday end at 13:30 hrs.My co workers were very respectful of our privacy but anyways there were group activities after work.The hard part of the job is that I didn't have a permanent contract with the company, for the annual Christmas party I was not invited, and some other important meetings I was not required.The facilities were awesome, and the working life enjoyable.I mostly engaged as an overnight machine operator with the company. I inspected deficiencies in the glucose measuring strips that they manufacture, produce, and distribute. After that, I graduated to being a machine operator. I was trained to troubleshoot machine stoppages, errors in the coating process, and the quality creation of a well inspected and manufactured product.At roche, my coworkers had positive attitudes. The job kept me busy, but it was not physically strenuous at all. I really enjoyed my time there because although the work is not the most exciting thing, I know I am making something that someone out there truly needs, which brings me joy.There are very few cons about my job at Roche. One of these is that in the management, there is much unfair favoritism. Another thing about management is that they walk around and observe the employees almost constantly, which made me a bit uncomfortable. Over all, though, I loved working at Roche!PROS - Work/life balance. Plenty of events that encouraged camaraderie. Family like environment. Very regulated organization that leads to great professional development.CONS - Contract based for more than 50% of their manpower. No benefits if under temporary contract.Great company to work for. Love what the company does. Am glad to be part of a company that is innovative and truly cares for it's employees. Would recommend this company to anyone.I enjoyed everything about working for Roche. The company is well organized and diverse. It had a very positive impact on my life.Consulting:•	Assisted consultants in giving suggestions about the design of the clinical trials and providing R and STATA code.•	Employed multiple imputation method to solve the missing values associated with clinical data.Data Analysis:•	    Project #1: The first clinical trial research was jointly conducted by Johns Hopkins Hospital and University of Chicago to discover the relationship between the levels of depression of patients and 14 other demographic variables.•	    Project #2:  The second clinical trial research was to investigate whether patients who lose smelling function having higher odds of being delirium in clinics.Currently i am working in Roche Pak Ltd as Senior Service Engineer.I am gaining knowledge day by day and my professional skills are also enhanced as time goes, i am very much satisfied with my professional growth. The only thing which bothers me is the work/life balance. That is not balanced and i couldn't give proper time to my family.The co-workers are what makes this company very unique. They are positive, welcoming and always willing to lend a hand when asked. The company allows growth professionally and management is supportive if communicated. The company has great health benefits and safety is a high priority. The work/life balance is hard to maintain."
96,Rocket Fuel,"Rocket Fuel is an awesome company to work for. I had no tech or advertising experience and I am very grateful that they took a chance and taught me what I needed to know to succeed. I am very lucky to have a flexible schedule and incredible benefits. My coworkers and I work very well on a team and management definitely helps to foster those relationships.Great corporate culture, and an experienced/diverse workforce.Work events, team building activities.. fun place, but no room for growth."
51,"Rodan & Fields, LLC","The job culture, the trainings, the team, the camaraderie.. it's definitely a dream come true! It takes time to plant seeds and advance, but the entire biz plan is worth the dedication.The Sales Support department is an absolute mess. Systems are always crashing, management is too busy or incapable of answering questions or basic follow-up. Other departments are slow to respond to important inquiries. Generally too much paperwork and red tape to go through to get anything meaningful done.The pay, benefits and company culture make the company a great place to work overall, but the Sales Support department is in need of a huge revamp.Initially, the company was fantastic and the job was pretty enjoyable. Then the company's consultant and client base grew exponentially, we were understaffed, short stocked, dealing with outdated and troublesome software systems, our resources for appeasement were limited, micromanaging us seemed like the goal because other departments were not performing adequately & then dealing with screaming phone calls -we were getting chewed on both ends, all stick & no carrot. The company kept wanting suggestions to combat the high turnover rate but they just didn't listen. Options for overtime & weekend hours to catch up on the backlog of emails or calls eventually became pretty standard or else it would become mandatory. Of course, there were impressive incentives offered but after a while, those dwindled in the direction of underwhelming. Promotions were available but competitive and sometimes those decisions were perplexing. Benefits (dental/health) were pretty top notch, 401k planning, and at the time, they were attempting to offer stock options but those couldn't be cashed until you had been there 3+ years. The only saving grace would be the coworkers who felt more like family and were wonderfully supportive while saving your sanity.Great culture, very poor mid management.  Growth outpaces the intellect in the building but hey, at least there is growth!  Good pay, good perks including a box at Oracle arena!If you can weather the storm of the chaotic management stylesand overall internal strife that has been happening over the change in the C level folks, then go for itYou work for yourself.  It is a multi level marketing company that sales skin care products.  A typical day would be trying to sign up customers to purchase the products, check on current status's of other orders.Love this company. I started two years ago and really impressed by the support and growth that is available. Highly recommend this company.Joining up with Rodan + Fields was the best decision I've ever made. This job has been such a blessing to my family. I am able to work without compromising my valuable family time.Amazing skincare that actually works!  I was hesitant to try it, let alone become a consultant for Rodan + Fields but now I can't live without the products. I love the skin I'm in!As an Independent Consultant for Rodan and Fields, you have the perfect work life balance. You work as little or as much as you like. The opportunities are endless. The hardest part of the job is just getting off the ground. The leadership is beyond what I have ever experienced.very social, but not consistent, when sales are good money is great, tedious almost all of the time and thats what i loved the most, pyramid company, not stable enough for my family especially financially hard with my special needs sons dr. billsFun work place, with wonderful people to work with. Growing and developing skills needed in a job force and real life.Wonderful experience of good skin care, learning to care for your skin and teaching others how to do so. It's wonderful to spread such a wonderful message and advice! Really does change lives.It is a wonderful way to help my friends and family with their skin complaints with products that work and a reputalbe company that cares about it's sales reps and customers. The difficult part of the job is trying to bring up the product in daily conversation and not pushing the intrested party too hard. But its keep the balance of sales rep and helpful friend that is key to being sucessful. Also learning useful marketing skills to help grow and expand my clients and awareness.The products are amazing, and it can be as structured as you would like.  I enjoy using the products and the people on my team which keeps me involved.I love meeting new people, the perks and just the fact that you can stay home with a flexible schedule, where if you have kids you can take them to their sports and school without a worry who can pick them up !!!Great community of people who are overall incredibly supportive and helpful.  Work when and where you want.  I love having extra spending money when I get paid and look forward to it being more than that.Work from home, set my own hours, I am the boss get to work with a fabulous team and product developers. I'm home with my son when he needs meGreat place to work. Great people. Make sure that when you apply, you apply for something you really want to do. Make sure you recognize your worth, so they can respect your work!A typical day is contacting individuals who I feel may be interested in purchasing skincare for problem areas.   I have learned being persistent and following-up is very important in sales and I can't be disappointed if someone is not interested.  I am an individual consultant, however, I work with a team who work together and motivate each other.   I love meeting new people and telling them about Rodan+Fields.  Typicially, a win win for everyone.  Better skin and I make money!Rodan and Fields allows me to work in direct sales on my own time. I can make as little or as much money as I want. Advancement is based on my own personal drive and willingness to succeed. I enjoy fitting my business in my life a few hours a week and I am my own boss.Doctors Rodan and Fields created Proactiv and from the success of Proactiv, they started Rodan and Fields.  It is an amazing company that offers continuous learning, advancement, and fantastic products to market and sell.  They provide all the tools and training to build successful teams.  I don't have a typical day at work because it is a business that it done on my terms and on my time, so it is very flexible.I have learned more about recruiting, leading, and building a team and profitable customer base. I manage a team of over 20 other consultants.The hardest part of the job is rejection.The most enjoyable part of the job is celebrating with people when they experience amazing results of our products or achieve financial security."
191,Rovi Corporation,"Worked with some fantastic people. In fact, made lifelong friends with a few of them.Had a fantastic ad ops director, not a micro-manager, but she was always accessible.I felt the salary was not very competitive. There is a chance to grow, but it's quite slim, meaning if you don't seize a chance to get promoted, it could be another several years before another you see another chance. And the thing I was least impressed with: they're willing to put sooo much pressure and work on their lowest level employees. They really want to squeeze every drop of effort out of you. Doing a good job? Great, your workload has just increased as a result. It's like they think we are robots sometimes. After working there several years, I was happy and relieved to finally resign from my position. Those are the CONS. Here are the PROS: a nice company culture. I really liked all my colleagues and even management are generally pleasant people. So much so that we were happy to do things together outside work. The company will put on seasonal events like Summer Olympic Games or a Pumpkin Carving Content so we can all just have fun and have a few drinks. Working hours are flexible, which is nice to meet your personal schedule. Benefits are pretty good (health coverage, 401k contributions, ESPP, and health club reimbursements (up to 50% of cost up to $500 per year). Time-off is very nice (4 weeks paid time, in addition to 10 holidays and 1 floating holiday). Rovi does not drug test new hires.I have worked at Rovi for 1 year and 6 months, it was a fun place to work especially my co-workers. The deadlines from the clients sometimes will make you work overtime because the contents could not wait. Unfortunately they outsourced my position back in April.I enjoyed most everyone I worked with.  Management seemed to care about their employees.  Unfortunately, their most profitable piece of software is being phased out by multiple ISP's thus creating attrition with an already thin group of team members.I am a liaison between several different entities withiinand outside network organizations. I have learned how to work with different personalities and work styles. We are able self motivate is very keen on Work/Life Balance. They promote time with your family or outside of work with then entail productives work environment.I have had the pleasure of working with a dedicated, intelligent and hard working group of people. Unfortunately, our parent company, ROVI does not value the devotion our group has to our work.  Constant micro-managing, layoffs and outsourcing have given a once proud and healthy workplace low morale and has killed the amazing culture we had.I have heard of many unsatisfied employees but that is likely due to a cultural shift after a change in CEO.  The new leadership worked hard to get the company back on track and it appeared to be working.  I worked remotely and traveled frequently.80% of my time at the company was enjoyable - talented, fun people to work with on new technologies and interesting projects.  However, the last few years were not.  IT restructured and tried to define itself as a service component but I was not lucky enough to see the final outcome if it did come to fruition.Uptight and unfair management.  Who you know not what you can do. micro management.I worked at Rovi in Tulsa, OK from July 2013 to May 2014. I enjoyed my job and my the work environment. They were very flexible on scheduling and days off when I needed them. There was a constant stream of people being let go, forced to quit, or laid off though. This created a lot of workplace gossip and a lot of unknowns.Rovi was a nice place to work. I would like to go back. Unfortunately, the division I worked for was sold and I was laid off. Their in house software development continues but it remains to be seen what comes of it. I believe Rovi is undergoing some changes and relocation at the moment. My experience there was nice.Job work / life balance is non-existent. Expected to work overtime all the time. Constantly short on staff. Unrealistic expectations. Upper management is detached from reality and their employees. Good benefits, compensation could be much better. Many positions are underpaid.Everyday is always different, very fast pace. Need more resources in the development team.Overall, Rovi Corporation is an excellent place of employment.Push, push, push - otherwise you will not succeed at selling Rovi's interactive properties.  My day would start from 8:30 AM to 5 PM, Monday to Friday. Being a Rovi employee brought out the best in me. My managers and coworkers were a pleasure to work with and are knowledgeable in both their actual jobs as well as with the mission of the company. The hardest part of the job has to be actually getting there. I live 18 miles away but the commute can take well over an hour. Besides the commute the actual job and environment are all a pleasure. The most enjoyable part about working for Rovi are their incentives for continuing to strive to be a better employee and person. They put together a lot of out of office activities and offer bonuses for producing hard work. The draw back is job security and advancement. I've known several employees that have been with the company for years only to end up leaving because job advancement is scarce.• Rovi is a great place to work; there is never a dull moment at any given day. Plenty of opportunities for career advancements.• At this company employees are exposed to new challenges throughout their careers. This is in turn helps employees learn new skills.• Very open and approachable management, all managers treat employees as peers and with respect.• Excellent co-workers make day to day work a pleasure.• Due to company offices spread across the world at times one might feels they have to work day and night, attending conference calls etc.• The work place environment, freedom to make decisions allows a person to achieve their best.I had the pleasure of working under great managers. They were really good at giving direction and guidance and their feedback was always constructive and helpful.I had awesome co-workers who were very helpful and there a really high morale with the group. Even between those that are in different departments there is a strong team bond.certify DVD and PCDVD products for Analog video copy protection. Some of the finest professional employees in my career.Awesome, competitive perks! Great service to customers, company events, lots of training opportunities"
542,Royal Bank of Canada,"Busy office but manageable. Management and co-workers were great to work with. Very enjoyable job!It was such a great experience to work for RBC Wealth Management. I learned to work in fast pace environment and to managed competitive priorities. I was helping a team of two financial advisors with all the administrative tasks, calendars, communication and financial transactions. The managers and supervisors were great allies to help me grows within the company. The team I worked with were mainly reactive rather than proactive and it made it very hard to learn a structure and organization. However, I always felt appreciated by them. I was able to remain myself and still belong to the team.Enjoyed working with my clients and prospects.Reasonable commission schedule.Nice office and location.Office closed due to lack of recruiting on part off management.Royal Bank of Canada offered a professional and comfortable work atmosphere. Salary and compensation levels were competitive. Personal were very Team orientated.Very comparable in terms of compensation and work-life balance with the bulge bracket banks, but still lacks top exit opps. Culture and management varies widely between different groups. Great place to learn a lot.RBC was a great company to work for that allow for growth and personal development.  I worked my way up from middle office to front officeRoyal Bank of Canada is a very sound financial institution. I worked for the Bank for 10 years in the Futures division located in Chicago. They are very responsible to there employees and create a comfortable work environment.It's fun and rewarding to work for RBC. The culture is open and inclusive.  Senior management communicates and keep employees informed about the direction and strategies of the firm.RBC is a good company to work for.  The benefits are good, the pay is competitive.  You do want to make sure that if you pick a career path (operations over business line) that you stick with it however.  Once you get too high up in one or the other it is hard to switch over.I worked within the trade support team for just over 7 months on a contract role. The role support the equity sales traders. I was located in London..I have worked here for 14 years and have found that the culture has increasingly become very toxic. That being said the benefits are good and there is a decent amount of job security.RBC works hard to provide affordable competitive benefits.  However, they determine employee salary by analyzing industry averages and meeting, not exceeding, the average.RBC is a terrific company to work for and love that there are options for growth if you are willing to make changes.  Just like any company there are differences in opinion and management but overall this company is good to work for long term.Excellent leadership.Learned about banking.Excellent training.One of the best companies that  I have worked for.They give you all the tools to be sucessfulMy day begins with updating reports, checking for errors and preparing for closing calls. The rest of my day is all about making sure all deadlines are met. Towards the end of the day we make sure  that all account are balanced and if we have to  assist each other to  get issue that demand urgent solutions.Lots of hours for little outcome. Depending on the group you could work on some M&A deals but mostly you will be pitching a lotThis company is a small but nice place to work at, They show appreciation. The contribute to your success. You really work as a team to in a good way.Support 40+ executives with a variety of requests including travel, creating presentations/org charts, answering phones, faxing/copying,Enjoyed coming to work.  I like to keep busy and help other employees if need be.  I enjoy talking to client on the phone and developing a personal relationship with them.Great intern projects and responsibilities. Company and people really care about your professional growth. Good work/life balance is actually something that is stressed on employees, depending which department you are in but overall it's the company's culture. Really great people to work with especially within the Project Delivery Office (PDO). I would love to come back and work here full time.like working here because the days seem to go by fast. This was a very high stressful Job because it was about the stock market and other people money."

596,SAIC,"Work for them for over 6 years, great company! Worked on a variety of Coast Guard support contracts. They care about their staff.It was my favourite place. The people, the contracts, the systems we worked on. Fascinating. But these are government contracts and those come with rules and the contracts are sometimes awarded as 1 year with 3 extra years optioned. So carefully charging correctly and staying in POP dates and not charging incorrectly is a big deal. Option years suck because that means your only guaranteed 1 year. They could go somewhere else for the next 3. Every year, your worried about the next option year being approved. It's like working on one year contracts and stressing every year that you might be laid off.Large Company tough to fit into management perspective, not a great situation when it comes to re-deployment, pretty much on your own to find new job.A place to help young people grow. Once you go through schooling and have degree, it's hard to advance. Then you have to look for work elsewhere.My fellow associates were all very responsible and professional enough to make sure we accomplished all of our testing requirements. Everybody pitched in to assist wherever help was needed.SAIC is prime on several contracts so it is easy to go to a different project if you wish, but for a company whose only product is it's people it really does not invest in its product. They cut benefits and then the following year sent out flyer bragging about record profits. That just has not sat well with many employees.nothing out of the ordinary, good work environment, fellow employees were friendly, helpful and professional, work location was close to the house and flexible.Great benefits and wonderful leadership. Enjoyed visits from managers taking us to lunch and spending the time to get to know us. Very forward looking company. Hands off management style.Destroyed chemical weapons while employed. Was a shift supervisor and the job was rewarding. Primarily I made sure that operators were safe while destroying the chemical weapons.boeing is fun you just work a ton of hours if your a contractorthey say that there is no prejudice towards contractors or Direct hires but that is false....they will treat you like dirtGood company to work for.  Managers take care of their people.  Great opportunities for networking within and outside of the company.  Lots of opportunities to change work locations to move around.I was lucky enough to  work for SAIC on the same contract for 5+ years.  The pay was excellent and the travel was exhaustive at times, but rewarding.  If I could, I would stay with SAIC but our contract was not renewed and the Company does not have any positions open for my skill set.SAIC is, in my opinion, primarily focused on getting the job done and protecting their resources - the people that work for them. Typically at work, people work with one another on complex problems and the atmosphere seems open to others asking questions.Really the only down side of the management is that they're intent on starting new initiatives to benefit employees, but there is often little follow through.The most enjoyable part of the job is when the customer expresses their gratitude and delight at the job we've done.Contact management mentality with personnel assigned and managed by assigned organization, in this case U.S. Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC).I was employed by SAIC but was contracted out for eleven years to SIMS and JRDC contract did not have much to do with SAIC except for one or two times a year. It was an ok place to work the benefits could be better.The SAIC team that I worked with in Charleston, SC took on projects in a team orientated manner.  Most work performed had input from other team members and project managers. This helped in preventing errors in projects and put more confidence behind the product. Also, management was good about being flexible when it came to needing time off for family, etc.. Overall my time at SAIC was a pleasant experience and I was able to learn, take on new tasks, and grow within the company.work Monday threw Friday 8 hours days start early A.M. when I'm home I typically test equipment an build the system up before we send them out on road before we install them into vehicle's. I travel all over united states to different military bases. Typically about five to seven guys who go on the road.  we  make sure after we install the system into vehicles we make sure it is operational then we train an teach military guys that the system is up an running an answer any question that they have.Working in a small dynamic engineering team, we have set product goals to meet quarterly. I work closely with a group of engineers that are motivated and innovative, like me. The culture of the company is very cohesive. I have enjoyed working here with much gratitude, and I hope to accrue the same with a new company in the mid-west where my parents reside.I was able to walk into a great paying job doing the same GIS tasks and further my professional career. I will never regret my decision to join SAIC.At SAIC I have learned a lot about working with customers and working as a team. There are many high quality people with a lot of skills which I work with.The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to work with a group of professional people and knowing I am performing work for the military.SAIC is a relatively large company in my program office.  The only gripe that I would state is that the HR is not extremely helpful when dealing with their employees.  Instead of typed emails they're much more likely to send a PDF which does not always assist."
18,"Salesforce.com, Inc.","Amazing industry with great growth potential. Hardest part of the job is management and changing dynamics of roles. Company culture is sometimes not what it seems.Rosetta Stone is committed to making sure that learning languages is fun, easy and accessible.  The atmosphere is laid back and the teams all combine together to make sure the job gets done.Salesforce company culture, benefits, work/life balance and flexibility are pretty good.  There are certain areas within Salesforce that are much better than others (R&D/product side of the house, HR, etc) seem to be run very well, care about their employees and have great career development in place.  IT, has the same benefits, but lacks both the career growth/development opportunities, and positive management.  I'd suggest if you are considering Salesforce and are technical go to R&D and steer clear of IT.  Otherwise, loved the culture and environment.Have good experience everyday.Learned new subjects.Has a great management.Good friends to find.New things to learn all the time.Salesforce is an booming future technology, making customers access easy by completely moving to cloud with good customer requirement customization application.Amazing peopleAmazing projectGood cultureFun and WorkHardest part : nonemost fun part : always new things, people have visionlot of internal growth opportunitiesThe company will take care of its employees and it's fostered a very positive work culture, perhaps the best I've been part of.Great place to work.

Tasks depend on the specific project you are working on. flexible on arrival time, as long as you put in your hours and get the job done.Salesforce is an amazing opportunity to learn about the world of information technology in the cloud. There is an incredible steep learning curve and bombardment of information however the longer you stay the more you start to grasp significance and advantages of each vertical. Salesforce is one of the best companies to experience and they have upward mobility for anyone willing to work for it.Great company with really good intentions. However, they want/need to expand exponentially and that leads to a little confusion. Lots of resources (maybe too much) and some overlap which can lead to confusion. I felt that it was almost becoming a production line and this left little room for creativity and also to ""find your fit"" from a personality perspective.Great company to work for. Great learning experience with trainings and company culture.Lots of room for growth and ability to move within the company. Employees are treated very well.Work hard and play hard attitude. They follow there 1/1/1 philosophy. The employees are well diverse. Everyone is nice and kind.A typical work day at Salesforce consist of emails, meetings, written communications, and networking. In my role, I learned about leadership such as event coordinating, volunteer coordinating, public speaking, and being resourceful. The work culture is very diverse by age, cultural background, and education level. The most enjoyable part about Salesforce is that it's a company that's an advocate on volunteering and philantrophy. They encourage employees to give back to their community or a nonprofit organization. I've never heard of that concept until I worked for Salesforce.It is a great place with very smart people. There are many opportunities in this huge and still growing company.

The management did their part and I enjoyed my work.  We were given all the help needed.Due to frequent acquisitions and work load, the work life balance is difficult. Management tends to stay put, leaving little room for others to grow into management roles.I work as a contractor so the environment is based on the customer, so far i've had a good experience in the workplace.

287,Samsung Electronics America Inc,"I got a lot of experience in this Very big project ( west quern 2nd phase project). It's Oil and Gas project. it's the third Biggest project of oil and gas in the worldIt was a very fast paced environment in which you had to keep up with. I wouldn't recommend for anyone that is not used to being in a fast paced setting. Overall, it was a great assignment job.Typical day was a 10 to 12 hour shift with 3 to 4 overtime for every other day. I maintained 400 production tools process flows and adjustments for the majority of the time. The rest of the time would be dedicated to meetings and management of passdown logs. I learned a lot from samsung. Physics, quantum mechanics, chemical engineering and so much more. It was the job I loved just because of the amount of things to do and learn. The culture was very segregated engineers and techs would be separate from production and house services that caused a lot of political infighting but things got done. Most of the management had a very high attrition rate and was replaced often. Mostly due to the lack of advancement. The pay raises were there but there was no upward movement in the company. The hardest part of the job was the balance of the information and its application to the production. You had to be able to see things down to the submolecular level to figure out how you needed to fix any given situation while trying to figure out how it would affect the rest of the production line as a whole. The best part was when you figured it out. That realization when you can hold your own with some of the brightest minds in the world when it comes to something you can't even see.I did a few months work at the San Jose Campus location prior to its rebuild. The management is great in the Sales department as they take care of their employees and contractors equally when I was there.I love to work in Samsung and i like to grow very fast but some conditions is preventing to achieve to my goal.

People at SAS are very nice and always willing to train you if you are open minded.Company does not know or train supervisors to be any kind of leader.  Good ole boy network is alive and well here.  I know people here that have been with the company 16 years and have never been promoted.I loved my job, I hate that I had to leave ... military orders. My boss was great and I loved the challenges they had for us. I do wish it paid better considering the large amount of Miles, wear and tear it did on my car.- Many meetings and work pressure- Best in class Corporate Operation- Responsibility and pressure- Many co workers rate Samsung same as I do- Employee audit- Good Pay for hard workersEmployees never stayed long and something was alwasy wrong with checks on payday. The work environment was intense and stressfulI love what I do when I work for Samsung but trying to move up in the company takes a really long time. There are no benefits for part timers and everything is focused on full timers. Enjoy my just and the people I meet just wish there was more.Alorica is a nice place to work at somethings within the company are not professionally handled. Would like to understand some of their policies better, not every inderstandableManagement and coworkers were fun to work with, and all materials were provided. We had proper training and if anything had to have any sort of difficulty, our manager made sure to train us properly on it.Since it was a third party company outsourcing customer service, there was no internal growth possibilities due to preferentism therefore no job security.If you are not accepted from the beginning, the ""Country Club"" crowd will push you out and make completing task virtually impossible to complete in a timely manner.Shipping and receiving products via 18 wheel deliveries.I had an entry level opportunity that has lead me to my current employer being Wireless Evolution, Inc.Wonderful Management, very educational.Co-Workers were not a part of my team.  Associates within the Warehouse works for the Warehouse we leased.  I lead our Warehouse staff from our only Samsung Distribution center in the Midwest and reported to upper Management at home office in Dallas.Working 3rd shift, decision making was always crucial as the rest of the company was asleep and most likely unreachable should an issue arise.Working for Samsung which is an innovative leader in the industry.Samsung work environment is hardship based on customer requirement. but for the employment an employee can live for the long time in samsungI recieved 3 certificate  from this job for being best line worker of the months i learned how to do everything  on the line,if i got to work and my lead was running late i knew how to start the line and get everybody goingI'm looking to build a name for myself with a new company at this point. Working for Samsung was fine. The company itself is amazing. But I didn't see room for advancement.Samsung overall is a great company to work for. They treat all employee's equality and fairly. Each day we were taken care of and made sure we felt part of the team and we were happy. As every job not everyday was the best day and the environment would be stressful surrounding the events of the Note7 having issues. My co-workers were very hard workers and all enjoyed being at work. The management was also pretty good. Some supervisors were a little lazy when it came to stepping up and helping fellow agents that needed it.You are usually walking around trying to find customers to interact with but most customers come to you.

330,Samsung SDSA,"strong Korean culture is something that can be adjusted a little as a global company. respectful relationship between upper management and subordinates.I was a contractor when for a 1 month project after 3 weeks staying at Samsung my Supervisor decided to hire me a contractor Helpdesk Technician. until after 1.5 yrs, i got promoted to be come a system administrator / service deck specialist.You experience different things, experienced different task that can help you improve your skillsyour team are very friendly and they motivate you to improve and challenge yourself to do better.Best: Work independently and proper training.Worst: Very long contract position, I was not offered salary and benefits when they told me I would.I have worked with Samsung SDS for more than 5 years. I managed all Technology solutions and a team of 10 support technicians and engineers for their North American and Canadian Contact Centers. I managed multiple simultaneous customer projects for local center improvements as well as call flow and applications support and changes. Our team is responsible for monitoring real-time operations as well as Data Center services.Environment is professional, many stuff to learn since you are responsible for most of the things, flexibility to do home office, sometimes working hours exceeded 12 hrs a day as per project requires.Good people with a od company culture; very strong job security!It has been very energetic working environment with good leadership and challenging projects...The typical day at work consists of a lot of excel work. I manage 3 Warehouses (where the Samsung products are stored and shipped out of) so I run my daily batch reports with the new loads that shipped out the day before. I am in charge of making sure that the carrier's invoice is matched with what Samsung is saying it should be -- based on the contract. Within 10 months with the company, I was chosen by my manager to join and lead a group of people for a special logistics project. After 2 months of hardcore training, the project fell through due to complications with the headquarters. The group that I was supposed to lead were fortunate enough to transfer over to different departments and I am now helping with other miscellaneous tasks within the office -- more report analysis/reporting to my manager. The hardest part of this job is that I feel that there is no opportunity to advance. Because of Samsung's cultural background, I feel that work ethic and performance cannot provide the advancement and reward that any hard working employee should receive. I will always be grateful for the amazing opportunity to work for a Fortune 500 Company right after undergrad, but I believe that any hardworking individual should be rewarded. It is going to be really hard to leave my co-workers behind as they have been there to guide and assist me with reports, daily work, or simply everyday-life-advice. I will always remember my daily 3:30PM walks with my department girls. In summary, I believe that my hard work ethic and ability to exceed expectations should be recognized and  more... rewarded.  lessResearching cutting edge technologiesCommunication between USA and KoreaDiversified employeesOffices in San Jose and New JerseyA typical day was mostly attending support tickets to fix bugs in the application.

We had fun activities as a staff and now due to unity instead of adopting the lively camaraderie it is being removed altogether. The gym was the best feature of working here but even that is unknown state and is up for altering with a severely incomparable substitute.

Good perks and 401k benefits.Great culture as an old entity, but lack of leadership after merged with a french company.  lack of innovations and commitment to growth as a company and employees.After working there for so many years I was hoping to grow in my role; however, I was stuck doing the same thing over and over and got bored.  Culture is fun but as a loyal employee one wants to grow and feel appreciated by the company.  Some of the managers are a bit unexperienced (not all) and very young.  The lack of experience can create difficult situations.  The company has great clients and brands but you will not be assigned to a role because of your skills.  If they need a body, they will trow you into the fire.  To survive in this culture you need to constantly be kissing arses.  You will work hard but that's given.Good place to work in sapient environment.Financial growth as well as skill enhancement..Decent pay master and work life balance is very good for recruiters when compared to other similar consulting environmentSapient is an employee friendly place and compensation is good  too. Leadership is approachable.Work culture is fun and they do lot of activities and parties too.Hardest part of the job is time management sometimes.People are friendly and socializingIn my experience, there are 2 types of people who work here.1. Who identify themselves very strongly with the Sapient culture. They work hard, party harder. Dont hesistate to take responsibilities, risk-takers and cool people to hang out with.2. Who are content leading easy lives. Work just so much as needed. Nothing more, nothing less.The career path, compensation etc. is driven by whioch category you belong to.Overall, the company is good. Encourages you to come up with creative solutions. A sincere effort is more often than not acknowledged!The real talent at Sapient lies in the mid-career stage workers. These are the architects, the designers, the developers, and the PMs who tirelessly work to successfully deliver projects for clients.You can expect a culture of hard work with limited reward and work/life balance. On the up side, there are really smart people working on interesting things for high profile clients.Sapient is a company that truly values their workforce where they value you as a PERSON first, and then utilize your skill second.  A strong job culture that, when you're the right fit, you harmonize with your peers and create and complete amazing projects.  I call it ""Google Consulting"".  If you're looking to be inspired by the work you do, and the people you work with, I highly advise you to find your place in this company.i enjoyed each and every minute in the company i really had a good experience with them.And the co-workers where really very good and i was really comfortable working with themTeam are global so you often work outside of NA timezones. Good overall culture and flexibility is offered.Overall it is fun with lots of activities and work going on. Office design is awesome.Good working environment, fun place.Most enjoyable part: Bagels on Wednesdays and Fridays.Nice place to work for Business  Consulting in the midstream industry. People who want to work on the area of Business devlopement & Long Term Client relationship, strategic Partnering with Clients...this is the place to go to. Also recently taken over by a french company Publicis which also has Digitas and Razonfish under the same umbrella, so the possibilities are boundless in future. Sapient also imparts and encourages lot of trainings to grow their people in the area they want to. The houston office is limited to Global Markets business unit, mostly deals with oil and gas pipeline systems automation and TRM.Productive fun place to work with a foozball table.  Work life balance is important here.  Flat organizational structure helps approachability with leadership.Company is good for college pass out with wide spectrum of project to gain experience. Very slow progress for Manager and above. You need to watch your own back when on you go on Bench.The work and atmosphere entirely depend on the project that you are on. Most of the company is at the site of the client, half of Government Services is at NIH in Bethesda so there is not a lot of visibility among leadership there.OnPoint/Sapient has terrific people.  The company supported many of my change management initiatives.  It was rewarding to know I made a contribution through education and training.	Verifying the functionality of the Insurance portal. 	Developed Test plan based on testing requirements and created Test cases. 	Responsible for creating quotes and policies, calculate ITV and endorsements in  	Main Frame environment	Actively participated in enhancement meetings focused at making the application more stable for real time usage. 	Reviewed the bug reports in bug meetings with developers. 	Involved in various levels of testing including Smoke test between various builds and patches. 	Involved in UAT (User Acceptance Testing). 	Worked with agents to develop user UAT (User Acceptance Testing) for Internet-based busi-ness applications. 	SAP CRM GUI testingSapient is a great Company to work for.

623,Science & Technology Corporation,"You work hard every day changing a Cu gasket to the vacuum installation. Too many changes in a short period of time. You learn a skill to make everything in the lab, from making a metallic component on lathe  machine, to testing a circuit board or welding a fine Tungsten filament to an electrode."
577,Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC),"Work for them for over 6 years, great company! Worked on a variety of Coast Guard support contracts. They care about their staff.SAIC is, in my opinion, primarily focused on getting the job done and protecting their resources - the people that work for them. Typically at work, people work with one another on complex problems and the atmosphere seems open to others asking questions.Really the only down side of the management is that they're intent on starting new initiatives to benefit employees, but there is often little follow through.The most enjoyable part of the job is when the customer expresses their gratitude and delight at the job we've done.It was my favourite place. The people, the contracts, the systems we worked on. Fascinating. But these are government contracts and those come with rules and the contracts are sometimes awarded as 1 year with 3 extra years optioned. So carefully charging correctly and staying in POP dates and not charging incorrectly is a big deal. Option years suck because that means your only guaranteed 1 year. They could go somewhere else for the next 3. Every year, your worried about the next option year being approved. It's like working on one year contracts and stressing every year that you might be laid off.The SAIC team that I worked with in Charleston, SC took on projects in a team orientated manner.  Most work performed had input from other team members and project managers. This helped in preventing errors in projects and put more confidence behind the product. Also, management was good about being flexible when it came to needing time off for family, etc.. Overall my time at SAIC was a pleasant experience and I was able to learn, take on new tasks, and grow within the company.work Monday threw Friday 8 hours days start early A.M. when I'm home I typically test equipment an build the system up before we send them out on road before we install them into vehicle's. I travel all over united states to different military bases. Typically about five to seven guys who go on the road.  we  make sure after we install the system into vehicles we make sure it is operational then we train an teach military guys that the system is up an running an answer any question that they have.Working in a small dynamic engineering team, we have set product goals to meet quarterly. I work closely with a group of engineers that are motivated and innovative, like me. The culture of the company is very cohesive. I have enjoyed working here with much gratitude, and I hope to accrue the same with a new company in the mid-west where my parents reside.SAIC is prime on several contracts so it is easy to go to a different project if you wish, but for a company whose only product is it's people it really does not invest in its product. They cut benefits and then the following year sent out flyer bragging about record profits. That just has not sat well with many employees.A typical day at work involved classroom instruction with students from a specialized branch of the Navy. I learned that no matter how much you think you know that there is always something new to learn. The client management was very demanding and did not provide much in the way of resources. The Corporate management of SAIC was supportive and went out of their way to take care of us. My co-workers were all former military professionals that provided subject matter expertise on many different subjects.The hardest part of the job was the long hours, many times in excess of 14 hour work days. The most enjoyable part of the job was the realization of our students comprehension and application of the instruction we provided for them.I was lucky enough to  work for SAIC on the same contract for 5+ years.  The pay was excellent and the travel was exhaustive at times, but rewarding.  If I could, I would stay with SAIC but our contract was not renewed and the Company does not have any positions open for my skill set.At SAIC I have learned a lot about working with customers and working as a team. There are many high quality people with a lot of skills which I work with.The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to work with a group of professional people and knowing I am performing work for the military.It was a contract job but the Management treated all staff very well with great benefits. It was a great environment to work and there was a great team work in accomplishing the tasks.Unfortunately the contract ended and we were laid off.I love this company, it is a fast paced work environment that lets you utilize both technical knowledge and common sense to get the job some. the people are a great to be around, and the work is enjoyable.I have worked here for four years and enjoy helping the training of our first responders in courses for terrorist attacks. You get to work in a unique environment.This job was Gov't  contract work, so your job is always on the line, I learned so much at this job, as I was just a material handler but I wore many hats, wherever needed I was there.Great contractor company to get your feet wet in. Poor management at 1602. Fun people to work around but upper management they all are friends and if your not in the CLICK you get walked on. It's hard to advance unless you know someone.The managers are dedicated to looking after the employees and supporting needs for change or adjustment based on the growing development of SAIC and its clients.Good company to work for.  Managers take care of their people.  Great opportunities for networking within and outside of the company.  Lots of opportunities to change work locations to move around.SAIC has been a great opportunity. This company believes in mentoring their employees and ensuring professional growth. SAIC is a fast moving environment that requires extensive detail to systems and paperwork.A work day was always filled with something new. From preparing for a class to being out on the range. I learned a lot about self motivation and resiliency. Along with hosting classes I had my own personal duties consisting of ordering supplies, organizing my co workers schedules, accompanying the managers for meeting. My managers where very kind and had a vast knowledge base if I ever had any questions. There was nothing really to hard about working there. We worked as a team and someone was always able and willing to help the next person. I really enjoyed the fact that everyday was different and that we worked so closely with or customers.SAIC provides a great stable work environment. At SAIC you will work with some of the brightest and smartest people in the whole  country.The hardest part of the job is when the client does not take your recommendations.Best of part of job is that SAIC customers are world  class.I know it's hard to claim, but there are few places that truly have that organic relationship between management and workers. SAIC happens to be one such place. At no time do the workers feel under appreciated. That being stated it should be pointed out that SAIC is in the same work category as Booze Allen, Harris, Lockheed Martin and other DOD contract companies. So if you don't care for uncertain futures or periodically searching for another place of employment, seems to happen every bid cycle. Avoid. However if none of that bothers you and you love the excitement of it all, SAIC is the place for you."

677,Seattle Genetics,"loved this company I was sad that I had to leave. there was no room for advancement.Every one supported for my career growth at work place, have learned many more things in current work place. I have good experience in all the skills. now i can handle all the things in project like supporting, developing. and i specially worked more at health care projectsGreat Benefits, medical, dental, and vision.Many of the co-workers are unique and interesting individuals with wonderful personalities.My job load was stressful at times, with little direction from management. The overall culture of my company is great though. Nice, friendly people to work with who want to make a difference."
583,Seneca Resources,"This company is more suitable for a skilled, younger person who is trying to start a career in the oil and gas industry and add this experience to his/her resume or a person who isn't highly interested in job advancement. I have not learned much because the options are very few for advancement at this company. I feel that the communication levels and people skills are below effective. In my case, there is no hardest or enjoyable part about the job.This job has always had me on my feet. I worked months straight. But at least I always had something to do. Although it was very productive, it would be hard at times. Mainly, because you have to find the appropriate person for the job.Seneca was a decent place to work but I was warned when I started by many of the employees that had been there for some time that they layoff frequently. One such employee told me she had survived 3 layoffs last year she was layed off. The company is very secretive about it and you won't know until it's too late. I enjoyed working here because it was an easy environment with good managers in my department. The layoff and the way they handled it made me feel very much betrayed by those that I had come to trust and regard as collegues.Great place to work. People were nice, and the environment was a nice office to work in. Always enjoyed the holiday parties and company picnics.Great place to learn the ins and out of the oil and gas industry. Co-workers where helpful and friendly in all aspects of work. Great overall working environment.I enjoyed my work experience here.  The variety was great, coming from a specialized focus in the oilfield, I was able to broaden my knowledge of all completions processes.nice place to work , all employes fun to work with, there is no hard parts about the job and i enjoyed leaning the ins and outs of the gas industry"
784,"Sequenom, Inc.","Mostly good people to work with and the job was easy and not very stressful. It is a shame that the company is tanking due to poor upper management choices.I loved working for this company.  The benefits and compensation were awesome.  Would go back tomorrow if I could.  Only left because of schedule issuesSequenom, as a company, does great work. Small company doing wonderful work in prenatal and genetic testing. However..the accessioning lab is not so great. Management is horrible and inept. Very unorganized and employee moral is low. VERY HIGH TURNOVER RATE! In the first few weeks of my employment, 5 people quit. As far as the work, it was not difficult. It's mostly data entry, so having lab experience is not necessary. I don't know what the other departments are like at the RTP location, but I would caution those of you who apply for the SPT position. My opinion: don't do it!Very flexible work environment.  I learned a lot about laboratory compliance and credentialing ancillary facility/organizations with Medicare, Medicaid and Commercial PayorsManagement team is excellentCoworkers greatI cannot think of anything that I could deem ""hard"" about the job, I looked forward to working and never minded coming into the officeI enjoyed everything about the jobHas a great CLIA lab work process, good work place to work for, I've learned allot about time management.  The management team are too objective to picking on internal personnel on a micro managing circumstances.  I had great co-workers there when I was working there.  The hardest thing of part of the job is that I was appointed to do someone else job other than my own.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when I over came the logistics of the job after the guy who left the company and that I had to take over his place.I had high hopes for this company as I left another full time job for this position thinking that a start up comapany would offer room for advancement and a more personable culture however, that is not what happened. My co-workers were wonderful, I enjoyed the effort that everyone put in to make the day go by  smoothly.   I was stuck doing a high repetitive job and my success was at the hands of a misquided and clique like management team.  I really tried to do my best for this company but they do not appreciate the talent they have there and instead to get ahead, you need to be best friends with your superiors. The lab workers were always blamed for things going wrong and there is no incentive to excel.  I would highly suggest you take your skill set elsewhere.Overall, Good company to work for, although the benefits aren't much, but insurance is okay. It has relax environment to be in, and the location is NICE.If you want to have easier working conditions, this company is definitely for you. This is my first molecular job and it was very impressive to see cutting-edge technology, compared to where I came from (LabCorp, INC.). Unfortunately, it is run by management that does not know how to do the test. This accounts for lots of confusion and mishandled progression. There seems to be a lot of meetings without real solutions, and a lot of wasted approved overtime. It was so bad when I first came here, that the norm was to work 6-7 days a week. Things have mellowed out a bit now. There was a recent lay-off, which didn't affect Laboratory Employees too much, but I feel that this may not be the last of it. There are waaaay too many supervisors, and too many CLS's employed by this company. I can easily see more people being let go. So consider this as you apply.I applied to a CLS position.  I received an email requesting a telephone screening interview with an HR representative almost immediately.  My contact with this HR rep was extremely challenging as she was not knowledgeable and was very defensive.  Most of my contact was spend ""walking on eggshells"" so as not to offend her but she seemed to be offended by everything.  It was very disturbing.  I was left with the impression that this is a very poorly managed company to allow this person to screen technical staff and provide a ""first impression"" to potential employees.Sequenom designs, develops, manufactures and markets innovative technology, instrumentation and tests that target and serve discovery and clinical research, and clinical molecular diagnostics markets. Applications include translational research, oncology, agricultural genomics and in vitro diagnostics for prenatal and retinal disorders.Sequenom seemed much more open and flexible when I was first hired.  As the company has expanded from just under 200 to just under 600 employees things have gotten a bit more corporate and some of the old culture of Friday happy hours where you could sit and chat about projects in a relaxed atmosphere has gone away.  I still enjoy working here, I'd recommend it to anyone looking, but it's definitely not a small company environment any more :)I love working for this company selling and education ophthalmologists about a novel genetic test. Love the people I work with, they are hardworking, smart, funny, and dedicated.low vacation accrual. management mostly male.overall a good place to work.Sequenom is a good place for R&D if you are scientist. Specially great are the TGIFs...they cut back on those now.However, if you are a CLS CAUTION and stay away from it. It was cited numerous times by CLIA and dont know why they are still open. You are much better off with working in Quest/Labcorp.Their management sucks and still under training. Not a good place for a CLSOperate like a start up even though they are a well established company with more than 15+ years in the genetic analysis and research market. Good people and is expanding. Management could do more to promote development and more innovations.Nice company to work for with lots of future potential. The company is on the cutting edge of molecular diagnostics.It was a wonderful, truly a great organization. Good managers and team building! Very ethical and productive enivironment"
656,Serco Inc.,"A typical day is starting out with a team meeting. Then we get our priorities for the day. Sometimes the priorities change throughout the day. We setup our computers for the work stream we are working and then we start. Our days consist of processing applications for the Affordable Care Act. During the process we call consumers for information so that we can successfully process their applications. What we learn is customer service and problem solving. The goal is to help the consumer. I like working with my co-workers. We help each other with questions and where to look for guidance in our work instructions. We get along very well and we treat each other like family. The management team is easy to work for. They are easy to approach and discuss the tasks we are working and they listen. The hardest part of the job is all the changes that take place. Most enjoyable is helping the consumer and the team I work on.I don't have a long review about this company at the moment.I ask that you do your research before you work for this company.Be upfront about what you want as far working there and be prepared for changes every 2 minutes and is forced to adapt to those changes without error in the work.If you are working on a contract for Serco providing good services, the organization truly does not care about your efforts or contributions. They truly only cared about the profits you were working for.not something to be able to advance opportunities, unfair management, hours were not something i agreed to. was a good experience in data entry. overall an ok jobworked with serco in the Colorado springs area for some time and after what ive seen there I would not recommend this company at all, the management that oversees that locations project is very unfair and biased. the project manager will smile in your face then stab you in the back - very spineless. if you do choose to work there negotiate your pay prior to hiring on because that is all the pay you will get. they post job openings for higher mechanics solely because they have to and you can apply and talk to them till your blue in the face but they normally already have their mind made up. keep in mind that this is contract work and they have already peaked. they are on the downhill now and wouldn't be surprised if the didn't get the chance to bid again due to the ruffling of feathers with the city. BEWARE!!!The job was a piece of cake, anyone could do it.  The pay is solid, with your insurance being paid for by the company (as a single person, family costs more).  The hardest part of the job is trying to not pull your hair out at the amount of archaic procedures being used.  It's like the higher-ups (on-site, and off-site) have no idea how to utilize modern technology. The reporting is atrocious, using something called ProgramVision to get pre-made reports created by people that have clearly never worked with data before.  No standardization on anything.  You have different rules and procedures for tasks that are essentially the same.  Too many jack of all trades, masters of none.If you can make yourself numb and sit for 8 hours, this job is not terrible.The upper management never seemed to care about what was going on in your life outside of work. There was one time a girl had a seizure while AT work and the time counted against her when they were the ones that called the ambulance and she was taken to the hospital and admitted. It used to be, if you had a doctors note the time would not count against you. Then it changed to even with a doctors note, they counted the time against you if you didn't have the PTO to cover.work hard stay motivated meet your goals. show up on time. stay sharp and focused to reduce errors. I loved the hours coworkers and management. Attendance and quality is the overall kicker.Lots of favoritism. Personal life is no concern of leads. And management. No encouragement. Demoralizing attitude of leads and PM.Working as an analyst at Serco is not a tedious job, the work load expected is highly achievable. Guidance is minimal which works well if you're a problem solver or like puzzles.  Environment is friendly and clean.The people are fun to work with but health benefits cost way to much. There is always place to move up in the company. Work life and personal life is sometimes hard to balance. I enjoy all of my job no matter if the consumer may yell at me or updates on the systems don't happen as fast as you think they should.A typical day was going through DMI's and I learned a lot about data entry. Great place to work. Management and the co workers are absolutely great.Great program to support soldiers and their families.Disgruntled co-workers due to poor compensation. Position requires a Masters degree but pays like a high school dropout. Contractor gets the money not the employees that work for them.The job was easy and the pay was decent. It would have been nice to get a raise though but same pay after almost three years. Insurance was decent. Time off after one year but management could care less if you take a day off without pay here and there. Trouble was, there was only two of us so taking off work was a hassle especially when the office was swamped with customers. Our direct manager was decently available to contact but his boss was a nightmare. She came out for a visit and let's just say 2 weeks later I put in my notice. Horrible manager. It's sad that she's been with the company for so long and openly jokes about how many she's scared away. Also I might add that the ""part-time"" position was a complete waste and they didn't seem to be able to hire anyone competent to do the job. I was the ""Site Representative"" which basically meant the office tattletale. I would say supervisor but they made it clear I had no authority but they wanted me to rat the others out for being late, etc. Not the worst job I've had, but definitely not a company you can build a career with.Passionate and well-qualified Professional Career Counselor experienced in briefing and counseling Soldiers in all stages of their transition. Excels in implementing professional development plans for transitioning Soldiers who aim to enter the workforce upon separation. Adept at coaching Soldiers through roadblocks in their transition identifying opportunities for training and professional development.Workedd as a General Clerk 11, job was okay training has improved, enjoyed co workers and learned how Health insurance works. You have to be able to sit for extended periods of time. Its a Nice place to work.I have worked for three years at Serco. I have enjoyed it very much. The managers are wonderful to work with and will do anything to help you succeed.  The co-workers are pleasant and work great together. We work daily with each other and there is never a day you wont need them. The people I have worked with have been the most enjoyable part of the job.Work life balance was not very good, management was excellent, and supervisors were very understanding. People are great. Loved it just hated sitting for 8hrs not doing anything on daysEnjoyed the aspect of helping out members of the community in need of employment.  Allowed freedom to create the employer base needed to find appropriate job opportunities.  Great manager and co-workers.Serco had numerous contracts and was always looking to move professionals around if they were unsatisfied with their current position.  Strong in program management and acquisition of products and services for the governmentNo work or hardly any... the management cares very little if at all for the employees ..cant have a personal life or prodfessinal one here at the wentzville location."
316,Service Now,"very flexible in terms of schedule, fun environment, cultural diversity, excellent benefits packages. Love the free snack and the beer bash and BBQ.Service Now is a good place to work. Depends on what position you are in, but overall a great company to work for. All and all not a bad place to work.very dynamic place to work at, with very limited coordination, more managers than real workers, need a very thick skin layer to keep going, everyday you might be at risk of loosing job, because manager of other stream did not like you.* Productive and fun workplace with ping pong table.* Good perks with lunch provided once a week"
315,ServiceNow,"Assist clients with daily activities that they have requested.  Requests would come in on daily basis from multiple clients and a queue manager would assign them out based on availability.The people who work for ServiceNow are amazing.  Highly intelligent, hard working, and team supporting.  If you need help, they are there for you!The challenge is this:  Billable hours are the mantra in Professional Services.  You are constantly pushed to make your billable hours, but you have limited or no control over what is sold.  If you are not meeting your billable hours, which varies in requirements from quarter to quarter based on what Sales ""says"" they are going to close, you are constantly reminded that you have not met your quota.Though there is never an overt ""threat"" that you will be let go if you don't meet your hours, there are enough ""reminders"" that make you feel insecure.If you are technical at ServiceNow, this is not a problem.  There is always more than enough work.  If you are non-technical (process, organizational change, governance), this is a constant challenge.  ServiceNow, despite individual groups attempts to change the culture, is a ""Software House"" -- platform is king.The job always kept you on your toes, the best part being the communication and collaboration among team members.The level of transparency among the peers and managers is also worth praising.Working at ServiceNow is like drinking out of a fire house. Very bright folks. Everyone is driven and carries their own weight. Never a dull moment. Lots of restructuring making it difficult to have job security and advancement.Fast paced culture, going thru the typical growing pains, very good product development.  Bright future for this company.  Smart management team.This was a great company to work for.  I started working there during its infancy, but now it is becoming a 1 Billion dollar company.I have learned a lot, traveled a lot, and was very loyal to the company.Great place to be if you have a chance.Awesome work experience. Nice exposure to work.Learned a lot from this work experience. Had good time and the team was really cool.This company truly invests in and values the employees. The culture is incredible and the product is solid. Im truly inspired regularly through working with different teams and collaborating on what can be done! I'd highly recommend working here:)ServiceNow is an excellent young company with potential.  If you are a valued member of ServiceNow your job is secured.  During my time here I have seen a lot of turnover in other departments.  You can be here one day and gone the next week. This is the only discouraging thing about SNC.I love this company and I love the people. They are by far the best people I've worked with after 15+ years in high tech. Everyone will roll up their sleeves and pitch in to help get the job done. People are open, honest and transparent (in my experience). By far the best company I've worked for in high tech - the benefits and pay are world class! I've learned what it really means to have a true team and see these people in action together. The hardest part of the job is learning a completely new SaaS platform around ITSM. There is also a lot of change here and if you don't handle change well, it may be tough for you. I personally deal with change really well so that's probably part of the reason I am so happy here. The most enjoyable part of my job has been working with such great people. My co-workers are the best!!Great company culture, dog-friendly, perks are amazing. Hands-on, collaborative work across departments. Have fun on a daily basis and above all get stuff done!Great company with high Growth. Excellent product line. The company is going into a transformation process to support new product lines and new startegies. Sometimes too US centric in startegies and decision making..Great place to work, people are amazing and some of the smartest people I have met. Only there for a 6 month contract.Training could have been better, and longer.  Got used to drinking from the firehose.Hardest part of the job was trying to keep up to requirements during training.Best part of the job was at 5pm I got to leave it until the next day.ServiceNow is a toxic culture where inexperienced management is trying to lead without having a vision or strategy...This may be well and good if they left the rank and file alone to do their jobs- unfortunately for all the employees management is constantly imposing their changing direction and capricious policies on them. There are little to no processes in the company and the Program management office lacks direction so nothing gets accomplished. Nice employees in general- high turnover rate as everyone is trying to get outSNOW is a great place to work.  The atmosphere lends itself to professional advancement.  SNOW was like my second home.  My collegues are people that I still share life with. Great for college graduates and expereiced professionals alike.Wonderful work life balance and great dev team and outstanding sales people. Great benefits and pay. Executive Team top notchAwesome leadership and vision. The product is one that you can be confident in, and truly represents a next level of service for the United States Government. The Federal team is experienced, driven, and highly successful. The market is receptive and the team has made some significant movement forward in the last year alone.Company has grown too fast, infrastructure still needs a lot of work. Many employees confused as to who is responsible for what. Management tends to micro manage.Co-workers are friendly and helpful, learned a lot about ITSM, hardest part of the job was how quickly management expects you to ramp up without assistance.Hard time with work/life balance when you are traveling all over the world.ServiceNow provides you with all of the tools you need to succeed. Management has an open door policy."
531,SGS,"This is a company that puts the well been of its employees first.The site I work at was on 8th street location in Deer Park, Tx and the Assistant Manager wanted me gone from the jump. I started as a Contract worker to Dow Chemical in Bayport, Tx which was a horrible experience. The Operators there ran the show and if they wanted you gone they would make it difficult for you. Or they will make it their business to get your Fired. The Lab Manager at SGS was fair but I feel like she was oblivious of what was going on and her Assistant Manager at the 8th Street location in Deer Park was manipulating her to take her position. I was let go because of what someone else say. A fair investigation with both parties were not conducted. I realize by past experiences with this company it was the planned. I eventually was able to received my Unemployment benefits.I'm enjoying my time working for SGS. I performed various ASTM methods on various petroleum products. I trained fellow employees in the proper techniques of various ASTM methods. I've had the cooperation of supervisors reporting results to clients and have built good relationships with clients and fellow employees.However, of late, we have lost half our staff to better opportunities. I have decided it is time for me to pursue better employment opportunities also after 9 years with SGS.I learned after working at SGS for a few years that the company really cares nothing about their employees. They will work you to death if you let them and they want you to feel grateful that you have a job. You won't get paid enough for amount of work you have to do. Managers and employees are allowed to talk to people horribly and never have any repercussions.  Every administrative process is tedious, repetitive and ridiculous. It takes a room full of people talking through jobs to get them invoiced because the process is lengthy and the instructions given to you can be interpreted in so many different ways. I've never seen a company have so many errors with invoicing in my life. The building I worked in had so many OSHA violations; wasps and mosquitos flying in the kitchen and offices, leaky windows causing mold and mildew on the carpets. The air conditioner never worked; in the winter the temperature in the office was 50 degrees. These things were reported and nothing was done by management because they could never get approval from corporate to spend money and fix the problems. The health benefits are astronomically expensive for employees.  Stay away!Although SGS is a multinational corporation, compensation and benefits weren't similar to engineering like companies I've worked before.I tried to take a certification class that SGS itself offers to external clients. The discount for being an employee was way less that I expected and they would discount from my salary the time I was 'off-work' :'(Very demanding career as you sample coal from trains, barges, stockpiles and mining pits. Great way to start out of highschool to learn basics on working in real world. Very dirty and dusty at times as you crush and prepare coal for lab testing.SGS is the world's leading inspection, verification, testing and certification company. They provide lots of training to staffs, with high efficiency.if you are looking for a low end job then this is place for you. if you want a real job keep looking. they cant even take right amount of taxes out your pay!! new training program is laughable. computer and phone system are outdated. there is no advancement. they pay new hires more than people who have been there for several years. you dont even have own desk. so if you wanted to make up hours you cant.starting pay is way above what you can find anywhere else they have good benefits, your 401 starts just after 90 days some companies it starts after 1 yearIt was like working with family. We all worked as a team and cared for one another. Productivity, learning and integerity was the overall goal. I would work there again anytime they needed me. Best Job I ever had.SGS North America is a good company overall to work with. As long as you know your role and do a good job, they will notice.  The co-workers are great and that's what I like most.  Right now there are some managerial changes, so it's difficult to say what's in store, but I think it's headed in the right direction. Work-life balance could be improved a bit more and sometimes dealing with Corporate can be tedious.  Overall, if you put the time and effort in, and willing to learn....SGS is a good company to be at!It was great to begin with, but the culture changed. I retired from there. My job went from tech support to sales in addition to the tech side. They had very little regard for their employees, due to the amount of folks looking for a position of any sort.While working for SGS I learned a lot and had a lot of opportunity to learn. I enjoyed working with most of my co-workers and enjoyed the early schedule. But the Management was a joke. They treat their employees extremely poorly and are very much based off of favoritism. The site manager was horrible to deal with and cannot personally run a lot of the equipment.Poor management. No adequate training performed. Stressful work environment. Poor communication between management and staff. Used to be a great place to work until SGS took over.SGS is all about the bottom line.  Promises were made when they bought Accutest Labs. and nothing has been done. They plan on closing more labs.The company took care of their employees. Safety of their employees was top priority. As long as you did your job the way it was required to be done, no one hassled you. Provided you with your entire uniform except boots.no rain outs, how to work as a team, management team good, good people to work with. Walking threw mud when it rains. a complete work day.During my two years at SGS I acquired new knowledge in the developmental side of the automotive industry. The company offered outstanding benefits, including a 401K and accumulating vacation time. I met some wonderful people and had the opportunity to work side by side with engineers from all over the country. Overall i enjoyed my co-workers and the duties of the job. Unfortunately management had poor communication between themselves and the employees which led to mistakes. When mistakes were made an unforgiving, unprofessional response was gave to employees, which led to there high turnover rate. If clear direction was provided and treatment of the employees by management was improved, this would have been a life long career.This position is a very similar to my last review. The hours dedicated to on the road and in the office are the same . The exposure to clients is a very important aspect of this job.I work in the Deer Park lab for 5 yrs. I work my tail off to move up but the lab manager was all about favoritism.  If she didn't like u she made it known to everyone. She is a condescending mean woman and   will treat you miserably. The other staff are no better or just follow along even if they disagree with her.  And if u try and go to HR they don't do much to help you feel comfortable. The raises are only given based on how much you can such up rather than performance. Also everyone is always in your business. Nothing u do goes unseen by someone.Decent Job, I've had a lot worse.  i was a loader, tank trucks and railcars.  Very procedure driven company.  Safety was always top priority.  Good entry job for plant work."
739,Shepherd Center,"Love Shepherd and the culture. Great place to work if you want to ""do good"" and feel like you're contributing to help patients. Horrible management, no advancement, but if you're OK with that, it's a great organization!Worse job I ever had, you kill yourself with turns every 3 or 4 hours , patients are very heavy and most of the time you have NO help because there is no ""team work"" nurses DO NOT help because they are ""busy"" in their phones. There is a lot of gossip, and if the patients have MONEY you have to treat them like your mother or you will get fired. Management is horrible please do yourself a favor and run run run.Shepherd center was a very nice place to work and to learn about more in the medical field I learned a lot dealing with paraplegics and quadriplegics and also with brain injuries ventilators and also tube feedings Skin Care the shepherd center was a great place to learn all types of research about paraplegic and quadriplegic and how to work with them so they are able to go home we work very closely with the families on training them on how to take care of their loved ones we also work closely with the patients so they knew how to take care of themselves and to also train other people people how to care for them!Great Hospital to work for. I highly recommend it to everyone.It has really helped me to sharpen my skills as a Certified Case Manager.Shepherd Center is an excellent non-profit organiztion to work for and all the employee through out the center are very professional and the hospitality is great. I have learned that everyone is treated fairly and kind. The Directors that I work for are the greatest they really care about their staff and if you have a family situation they are there without micromanaging. My co-workers are the greatest, this is the first organization where there everyone is very supportive of each other and works as a team. The hardest part of the job is trying to serve the consumers and the want answers right now instead listening to what is actually being said. The most enjoyable part of the job is having patience.Former respiratory therapist, wonderful patients and a feel good place to work. Management in the respiratory department needs a turnover desperately. Would be a wonderful place to work if management changed.Shepherd Center is a Hospital for people with brain and spinal cord injuries. A typical day of work consists of displaying a high level of customer care. The atmosphere at the Shepherd Center is very friendly and up-beat, which allows your caregiving experience one to remember.Very dilligent in work habits. Excellent turn around time for patients.Treated staff well. Good benefits/pay. Would not have left if under different situation.This hospital has been a wonderful learning tool as a young nurse.Coworkers are supportive and the administration constantly looks for new ways to improve employee satisfaction. Long hours with a great deal of physical activity such as lifting and turning patients. Great for obtaining well rounded skills of a registered nurse.Superior training and great management at the Shepherd Center. The shift hours are perfect for me as well as the location.Things really need to be shaken up in the middle management area. Most have been there for more than a decade and are stuck in the way that things have worked. Granted Shepherd Center has done some groundbreaking things in the area of TBI and SCI rehab but that does not mean there is no room for improvement. Management is often the cause of a lot of tension in the work place due to inadequate communication skills with the staff. There is also an air of mistrust that causes a lot of perception problems and often forced resignation or termination of a staff member which increases the already high rate of staff turnover - it's a vicious cycle that upper management is hopefully taking note of in their assessment of the hospital's programs. Management should learn to value and trust the people they hired to do their job and to contribute new things to the organization as the old ways that have been perfected are learned.I am a Outpatient Access Rep. I work in a high volume call center taking inbound and outbound calls from patients. I love my work because I know that what I am doing is key in the success of the Shepherd Center. I work very well with all of my coworkers and am known to be the life of the department. I am the one the will have everryone smiling and laughing even when they don't feel like it. The hardest part of the job would be seeing the injuries that our patients have substained in the accidents they were involved in but the best part about my job is seeing the progress and change of the before and after they become patients here.Participated in SCI research with classmates and team members. Performed subject recruitment, testing, data collection and analysis for arm and hand function of SCI patients.My co-workers were awesome here. I learned so much about Spinal cord and brain injury. Most of the patients are so thankful for your care and kindness.I learned so much at Shepherd Center, How to be able to multitask and being on time knowing you have a patient that needs to be at an appointment at a certain time. Learning different skills and keeping you certified in your profession with advancement every year.This a top of line work place for spinalcord and head tramria patiens .I learnwd alot there I was very young at the time .The people were very help surpotive of there stiff thats why I wsa there for 22 years.Working at the call center is different from working in thw clinic dealing with actual patients. You come in, log into your data system. For me, I'm either doing medications; where I call in prescriptions to various pharmacies. Or home health, where I send the doctor different paperwork about patient's lab results, reports, and/or wheelchair requests, as well as therapy requests.I work very well  to protect the policy and procedures..I respect team work and I have learned some much working for this company for 4.5 Years.The challenging part about my job was bowel programs,I literally prayed through my traning because I needed the job and it got better for me..I got alone with my co-workers.The Shepherd Center is a wonderful place for rehab. The management could work on there personalities and the way the interact with their employees.All Care for quads and parapalegic paients. Including but not limited to bowel /bladder management.I loved working at The Shepherd Center. This was a brand new build of the system for Shepherd. Although there was a huge learning curve for the staff, they were very understanding and wonderful to work with. I love a challenge, and with all the custom assessments, this was a challenge. What fun!"
396,Sherwin-Williams Company,"Long hours with short staffed stores. Great benefits and job security.Typical day as a a part was simple. Unloaded truck, took orders, assisted customers, mixed and sold paint. Good work environment, and if you wish to stay with the company, career opportunities are present.This used to be a good place to work, but over the last few years it has declined rapidly.  Management does not care about employees, too much overtime,  we can never do enough, constantly told how bad we are performing.  Managers lay all the blame on supervision, but they are spread too thin.  Management is not present amongst the work force.  Constantly being told how broke the plant is, yet management has no problem feeding theselves lunch with company money.  If you do a good job you are given more work.  If you don't do a good job you are ignored and allowed to sit around.  Advancement is based on the good ole boy network, not ability or qualifications.  Good workers are leaving rapidly, while the bad workers are still hanging around.Also, expect that managers will share your personal information with others.  There is no such thing as confidentiality.  Retirement plan for hourly workers is basically non existent.I loved this job. Production/machine operation was not only exciting, but attention to detail was the most important thing. 11/10 would work there againA typical day includes daily store operations, mixing paint for DIY customers and contractors. Assist in determining staffing needs, recruit store employees accordingly with proper approval and establish work schedule as appreciate. You have to remain knowledgeable on products offered and discuss available optionsIt's very sales driven! You have to make sales calls and accomplish sales goals.Fun and challenging work place. Great customers, good pace and great experiences in management. I would recommend this as a place for anyone who wants both a physical and mental challenge daily.I clock in at 7:30 and from there I look on the ""deliver"" bored to separate the paper work to see what goes first to last. After that I start to load the truck up starting what goes last to first that makes it easier for me when I unload the truck. Then I start my day driving and doing my delivers.great place to work and varied day.  You can really make a solid career with this company.  You will always have great benefits and great pay.  It is a good place.This company was an awesome place to work. Although very quiet and not a lot of people, I really enjoyed the environment. I was in my third trimester when hired for this position. They saw my potential and my work ethic instead of just my baby bump. They saved my life and I am forever grateful!Excellent work place and wonderful staff. One does not feel out of place and help is right there if needed. Friendly environement and safety is their main concern.In a typical day at Sherwin Williams Company your day was mostly filled with supplying customers with thee best service possible, going above and beyond. Also as assistant manager making sure the staff and orders were being done properly. The hardest part of the position was managing time between office work and assisting employees to make sure things are running smoothly. The best part of the job is when you receive a ""Thank you"" from a customer, also when you successfully teach a employee the proper way to do things.This is a good job if you don't mind getting your hands dirty and a little heavy lifting. My main concern is that it's difficult to advance into management without either a college degree or entering their management trainee program.My boss was very submissive and would allow certain workers to perform jobs poorly with no consequences. However, the environment created on the job site was fun and energetic.It can be slow on some days. My co-workers are pretty cool even the manager. the hardest part is lifting all the heavy things. Most enjoyable part is being able to just chill. Training is a bit fast. Only way to learn is to either teach yourself and repetition.I actually loved working at this particular place in tupelo. I love the people I worked with and the enviroment. They made me fun very comfortable at peace.Lots of accountability across the board for: meetings, reports, assisting other departments vendor handling lead follow-ups, customer issues related to all leads, system glitches that require extensive follow up with vendors, product knowledge, and a host of other responsibilities.Cannot move up to management because I have to be full time first, but will not offer me full time. I am the hardest worker in this specific store, very committed but being a single mother, i cannot stay here.Worked for Sherwin Williams for a year and wasn't advanced for my pay. Was told on many occasions it was coming but my manager's never put time in to fill out the appraisal properly.should have been full time raise,3rd key raise, then appraisal. Had to open and close a store and take bank deposit even though I wasn't 3rd key but just a full time. I worked hard for Sherwin Williams and basically just got put to the back of the burner. Stayed at 9.50$ the whole year. Was told by my manager and others  I will get a raise of 10.80 which is the same pay a part time 3rd key makes. That is withholding my dollar raise because I was full time. Other than that and the occasional cranky contractor it was smooth..I was a sales associate.  We sold paint to indivuals/companies.. Liked the staff..Management was very understanding and respectful.This is a really good company to work for. There is a lot of room for growth if you are interested in retail management positions. The employees are all really great people and making working there a lot of fun.I had the pleasure of sustaining various levels of management. Mentoring employees during their training periods was satisfying knowing my effective communication skills assisted in the growth towards their career goals.Carrying out logistics is an important phase in bringing together events in a timely matter. Fellow employees were able to have detailed information at hand, therefore, being well prepared.Effectively overseeing the office work flow required making sound judgments and key financial decisions. I had valuable relationships with employees, clients, vendors and visitors."
148,Siemens,"at siemens the training is great the employees are friendly and there is no limit to how much you can make in terms of uncapped commissionsThe job and responsibilities were changing from hard copy to electronic.  This was challenging and gave me a pride of satisfaction after learning the tasks.  Enjoyed being a team player and working with management.  The most challenging part was the constant changing of the software and testing until the application worked correctly.  The most enjoyable part of my joy was the contact with the employees that I had to interact with in my job.Company went through many C-level management changes in the 6 years I was there.  It eventually resulted in the loss of the biggest federal contract the division had- Siemens has a wide range of products.- Siemens invests a lot of billions to develop the employees.- The team is helpful and hard workers.- The internal competition is very st rong.I was an intern at the company during a summer. Overall it was a great experience, the staff was friendly, the pay and international benefits were great.Siemens is a great company with great vision. They are career oriented and certainly are forward looking. They take a great deal of pride in producing products that improve the world.Great company to work for had safety lunches every week we were safe cared for there employees and treated me good vary professional people and companyLearned a lot quickly.  There was a mix of contractors and employees and everyone got alone.   Siemens acquired Acuson and things started to change.it was a great company to work for I learned a lot from this company and it was good pay and also good people to be around would like to work for the company long term. they teach you everything you need to knowits very nice to work in this company it has a very nice management and they pay good and it has a very good benefits.they also giving a seminar for some employees every year.This was a stable work environment. This why I work there I work there for 26 years. My only for leaving is that my retire came too early. This was challenging work it involved installing intricate medical machines in Hospitals around the world.I benefited greatly during my time at Siemens. I learn a lot about my trade and how to manage it. They also gave me the opportunity to start a management career.Held positions of responsibility ranging from Manufacturing, Procurement, Planning, and Logistics for rapidly growing company specializing in the Oil, Gas, and Mining related industryThe job is fine, the work is fine, for the most part, the people are fine (if you can tolerate the nepotism) but dealing with the local management is the bad.Responsible for all customer owned product that is sent to the repair facility.Manages tool room for production to receive all direct material to facilitate repairs. Manages 40 million dollars of direct material14 direct reportsSiemens is a great company and rewards accomplishment and proactively supports employee development. Encourages and celebrates individual success and shared goals.I went to Siemens as a contractor and was offered the chance to work full time for them. It was the best decision I made. The pay was awesome! The benefits were great! Especially wonderful were summer hours and telecommuting. Couldn't ask for anything better. Negatives - I had a new boss every year. Reviews were harder and harder every year with near impossible goals.I thoroughly enjoyed working at Siemens, however there are too many chiefs and not enough indians. No one was ever on the same page and there was always confusion.Here at Siemens I have many roles. They give their employees the chance to advance which is great. Compensation and benefits are amazing. My co workers make my job easier.I worked up ther for a month in the electrical division syarcuse ny office. Im a field service gen/engine tech. Was promised a vehicle  with gas card before I started. That never happened. I was doing service work from my own vehicle. I also could have hired a secretary  on my behalf. Way to much paper work. 12 Pages of paper work for a pm. Crazy. There system is awfull. Benifits are good but u paying for.  Money was not worth the hassle.  Great supiv. Loved him was not his fault. Also to much back stabbing going on. I quit and moved on.  Think about going to work in the generation division for this company.  Thank you.An excellent workplace where I have been educated further in my Equipment Finance and portfolio management career. Once a division with an increasing portfolio willing to bid and finance various types of industries and transactions, SFS is shortening its vision of what to finance, limiting it more to Siemens related products and industries."
54,Skillz,"Worked at my own pace and had excellent help. Pay was excellent!  Christian work environment.  Always had a good team environment.  Positive and uplifting.my time at Skillz in the underground was great!. my coworker was amazing in different ways and my boss was a great hardworking man. Its a fun down to earth place to work at.I get to work and I tend to any clothing that needs fixing, hung, or put in a different place. I help any cutomers that come in and I ring them up when they have found all of their items.I watched the companies product from beginning to end. Afterwards, handling any questions, concerns, and questions from costumers. I know first hand everyone was satisfied and happy with the company service and product.As manager my responsibilities is to do anything and everything that needs to be done to make sure the store runs smoothly and effectively and to make our monthly sales goal."
4,SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory,"SLAC is a wonderful place to work.  SLAC is a DOE laboratory operated by Stanford University, meaning employees get the perks of being Stanford staff and can also enjoy being part of the global accelerator community.  Employees generally stay around for many years, even decades, since they love the work, publishing papers, and attending international conferences.  Operating an accelerator 24-7 creates a job culture where people want to work long hours and often don't notice they're working late when they're working together to setup the beam for an experiment.However, affordable housing and childcare is difficult to find in the area, pushing more young families to commute long distances or move on to other laboratories.  The waiting lists for infant care often exceeds a year and long commutes put a substantial strain on the work-life balance.Used to be a great place to work and be immersed in pure science. The lab is compartmentalized into fiefdoms which are all different from each other. The best-funded division is LCLS and has a lot of potential.number of smart people to work with;  enjoy the work, but budget is unstable; origination changed frequently; in-consistent management;people are busy, don't have much time to chat.Great place to be exposed to desk work and business work. It is also a great place to get exposed to the financial part of a company.Great opportunity to work with a wide range of employees in developing new horizons in science provide profession growth and life balance.Stanford University is a beautiful place to work. Benefits are excellent. The company is very diverse and it was enjoyable working   with other people from around the globe.My typical day at work includes both office work ad experimental hands-ons. Learned a lot during my past four years here and enjoyed it! People are in general easy-going, proficient, and helpful here. The hardest part of my job is the flexible and sometimes unpredictable work hours.It is a good environment to come to work everyday. I've learned new things which the physicists had discovered during their experiences such as new atoms. My co-workers are very friendly. We have  gone out for lunch and talked about our social life. We have had a big gym in the lab. We can sign up for exercise classes or do on our own time during break, lunch, or after work. The hard part of the job is the funding from the government. If the DOE will not give us enough funding there will be some laid off. Over all, it is a nice place to work.It were many interesting projects. The team work was very fruitful, people were friendly and supportive.It was good time!I Enjoyed working there; people are nice and mostly cooperative. It has a decent benefits package. Commute to work is not difficult. For most of the positions, hours are flexible."
291,Slice,"Achieved new levels of knowledge and productivity. Great small business concept.The job overall was excellent, The management was nice and down to earth. They treated their employees with respect. When I started there I had zero experience with that type of work. They taught me everything and helped me when I struggled. My co-workers where nice and had a warming welcome daily. They where fun to be around and work was enjoyable. The most enjoyable part was when i delivered the pizza and seen the awesome customers. The day would start off with clocking in and getting the bank money. Grabbing your car top sign to start the day off and prepare to take deliverers. Usually there was dishes so they took priority, Because without dishes there is no movement. Wiping out pans, grading cheese, mopping floors and helping out with make line was nearing the end. At the end of the day we'd take in our signs and give in our money and get our cut from the tips and call it a night.Love to work and be at Slice's. Very good food, awesome management, very flexible with hours and anything else you need!A person can gain more than experience working for jobs. gain new friendships and new life experiences. Dealing with different personality can be trying at times but Deja vu gave me the gift of gaining more experience in life as well as work. A typical day of worked- answering phone calls, sending e-mails, working lot with Excel and word. Re-stocking a room with resources for student organizations to use.I learned a lot about costumer service as I worked with a variety of individuals. I learned about leadership and how to be a figure for others.Co-workers were amazing.I enjoyed every single thing about my job!"
303,Smule,"Cool company culture and nice smart people around.Dumb manager, who enjoy micro-manage and drive crazy the whole team. She is making side money managing off shore team, cut their salary and put to her pocket.Company brings good changes in the world.Great apps creator for fun and development of musical skills."
576,Snagajob,"It was a very challenging job. Calling 80 prospects a day could be very stressful and that is why I think the fun culture and activities at Snagajob were so important. I really enjoyed the people I worked with and the office building was full of fun things that allowed you to escape the daily grind when needed. There was not a lot of job security with my position, but the company took very good care of its employees. I was constantly challenged with this position and I enjoyed using my problem solving skills to make sales and achieve success. Everyday was a little different and I enjoyed the different classes that were offered to us to enable us to live more fulfilling lives and become more valuable employees.Snagajob has a very strong culture and mission statement which makes a huge difference in our lives as employees and serving the jobseekers and employers nationwide.This is one of the greatest employers that I ever had.  The company culture is very conducive to success.  At the same time, everyone is accountable for their actions.Your job is not secure and management doesn't know what they are doing. The company is spending more than it is making which is leading to lay offs and other people moving on to find better jobs. Not the great place to work as advertised.Great atmosphere, great people, all around fun place to work.A typical day at snagajob would include coming in to work; logging on to your computer and expecting your manager to ask a boat load of questions about your evening.It was nice to have the freedom to complete projects freely, however, I wish I was able to work on more advanced projects."
635,Social & Scientific Systems,"Family environment, support from staff, close to public transportation, Friendly team, good benefits. love to work dailyCompany has a lot of attributes that treats their employees like family.  Good benefits and perks.  Limited flexibility to work from home.  Undeveloped unix department.  Company in flux with technical division.A typical work day consists of daily program/project deliverables which consists of reviewing agreements/budgets/monitoring reports, uploading reporting and budgeting information for project group, meeting with team for tasked items to follow-up with. I lean an extensive about of information pertaining to clinical trials and contract management concerning subject enrollment and patient study contractual costs. The management is relatively laid back. My co-workers are great; very helpful and resourceful. The hardest part of my job is how to deal with managers that do not know how to manage and provide managerial expertise when necessary. The most enjoyable part of the job is coming to an employer where you know (for the mostpart) that you are valued.While I loved and strongly believed in the government study that I worked on there, the supervision team consists of long-term employees who do not take pride in their work nor do they value the study or employees who value such. Knowledgable diligent workers who exceed managements expectations and would otherwise be congratulated and used for their skills are targeted for personal harassment (NC State laws do not protect employees from unfair or unethical employment practicies) and end up seeking other employment due to contingency and inconsistencies among supervision which results in high stress levels.Was making sure staff was equipped with the right devices before departing on travel.Had great co worker who worked as a teamWorked on Agriculture and eviromental study, outbound calls, inputing data while speaking with client, high call volume, intense study, assisted with training of new-hires, assisted supervisor with additional duties as assigned.I learned a great deal about government studies, protocols, health and medical terms. Systems and programs.Hardest part of the job frustrated clients. Most enjoyable being able to assist, resolve calm the situation.SSS provides excellent client service for many long-term projects. Dedicated staff with high level skill sets support government sponsored programs."
318,Software Advice,"Typical day as an Advisor is spent responding to requests on price quotes, demoes, or general information on enterprise software. Prospects left information that we would use to get in touch and respond to request, gathering business information in the process. At the end of the call, we would email general information on the appropriate software vendors that would match their needs. We would then turn the notes we took on that call and sell it to the software vendors as a qualified lead for them to set up a webinar demo of their software.I learned how to stay patient with sales and look at the outcome of an entire quarter rather than focus on weekly or bi-weekly goals.Management was great at teaching you the necessary skills needed to perform well and they were patient to make sure you understood everything fully.I enjoyed the competitive environment, the above average pay, and the co-workers were all very responsible and hard working.The hardest part of the job was the monotony. The calling process was aggressive, calling prospects up to six times a day from different phone numbers.Software Advice is a great place to work. It's also a hard place to work. We work really hard, but it's a really supportive atmosphere where small, daily victories are recognized and celebrated. We've got a great group of people here, everyone's really fun to work with and always brings their A game."
158,Solidus,Co-workers are  the greatest. Everyone worked well together.We were always helping each other whenever necessary. The entire staff were hard workers in all divisions.
86,Sony Playstation Network,Interned in the San Francisco office and it was a great experience. I got to work on meaningful projects and my co-workers were extremely helpful when I needed help. The office is laid-back and the managers trust you to manage your own time. I highly recommend working here.
592,"SOS International, Ltd.","Flexible hours, good time management. Helpful peers; new and senior employees can always find assistance in work environment whatever the time might be, even after midnight.SOSI takes care of their people very well. Honored to have had the opportunity to work for them!  Detailed in program management operations, transportation, training and human resource management.The poor rating in this review is specifically tied to a project I was a part of overseas, not SOSI corporate or SOSI in CONUS locations.  Without going into details, there was not much management support to the few contractors deployed forward, and the job itselt had no upward mobility or stablity.  Compensation was great but tied to danger pay due to location, rather than job performance or duties.The only bad thing about this job was the contract basis, but other than that it was a fast pace and there was something different everyday.Avoid if you can continue to interview while your there. attrition is constant and never ending. No process or guidelines that resemble a professional company or effective process. Most new folks are still interviewing once they start.I can not recommend this company.  While there are some wonderfully talented individuals who have worked at this company the senior leadership chruns through managers in every department and the turnover is very high with each manager lasting an average of 1 year.  This is due to the ineffective top leadership.  There is no trust established among the senior and departmental leadership and at the time of my employment the company had failed to establish an effective ethics program or transparency in their financials which is key to doing work in the government contracting space.As a former manager in this company, reviews were conducted for every overhead employee but no direct individuals.  Once rated and reviewed the reviews went before a board of top management where the CEO often directed changes in the ratings (lowering them) for individuals under my supervision whom he had no day to day contact with.  Both merit increases and promotions were predicated on these reviews and I found the process discriminating and ineffective as it became an evaluation of how well the senior management team (specifically the CEO) liked the individual or not and not a fair assessment of performance.  I feel like this is the number one reason employees can not advance in this company or receive proper mentorship and development. Before considering a position with this company it is advisable to talk to past as well as present employees before accepting a position and research their reputation in the industry by talking to teaming partners, former customers, etc. before making your decision.I have been working for SOS International LLC for years and the company has provided me with an incredible amount of opportunity to work in a client driven environment focused on developing its staff to be the best they possibly can. Commitment to the mission and dedication to the work is the expectation from employees. An ideal place to develop your skills.Mid-size company with ambitious and lofty goals - but the culture and feel of a smaller company.  Its an exciting, fun place to work.I would go back there today if there were still around.  You have to be selected and qualify to do the job.My immediate supervisor were very nice and very understanding, you can make up your own hours according to the working hours.family oriented, professional, opportunity for growth, great benifits.A typical day at work consists of performing daily tasks in a timely, accurate, & quality manner. I have learned to maintain attention to detail in this job at all times in which case an error is not an option. My co-workers have great personalities, are friendly, and are a great people to work alongside. However, there were several that lacked integrity, and some of us found ourselves picking up extra workload of others.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with its instability, and not being able to grow or promote. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of knowing that I am performing my best for a greater cause.Everything they do for proposals is done very patchwork and contract recruiters are used and then dumped. Vulgar language is prevalent throughout, and employees are mistreated and verbally undressed by supervisors in the open. I saw a middle-aged woman yelled at to tears on several occasions.My coworkers were great to work with, however management was so horrid it was near impossible to accomplish anything.Finally, they use no discretion on tasks which require a security clearance. Contracted employees without clearances are read into areas of contracts that they should not be. Great place good benefits... calm corporate culture.A little greedy when it came to pay cuts.. worst compensation but kept benefits at a good compensation. Overall best experience!Work was mostly in combat hospitals in Iraq.I learnd to be more carefull and vigilant .We had a reasonable management support.Worked in harmony and high cooperation with my co-workers.Hardest part was to be away from family.I enjoyed helping paients and their families during cnflicts.All other reviews are clearly written by disgruntled employees who can't even spell right. I've had a great experience with this company, they reimbursed a lot of my training, I got a lot on the job training and got a career advancement that I didn't even expect to get in just a few years. I've moved through several different roles and if you are proactive you can do that in SOSi. The company has great benefits, immediate 401K 100% vesting schedule, great health/dental, great number of days off/PTO but lacks remote work arrangement or relaxed casual Fridays just because of the owner's perceptions. Most of the staff is really nice, very personable and easy to deal with. The professional quality of people differs - there are some gems but there are some random people too, unfortunately, sometimes the management just hangs on to those random people just for the sake of emotional attachment and continuity though they really suck at what they do and are not employable anywhere else. Because of this situation and the uneven quality of management across the company departments gems often leave so the turnover is pretty high. The company is NOT run by a foreign family. Everyone is American and has clearances, the main owner was born outside of the US, that's about it. Every department is as great as its leader, the COO is a bit intense and not often easy to work with, so some execs are able to stay and work with him, others don't. The family likes to have the headquarters in NY, however, they don't really have a business there as it is a government contractor. NY office is a huge financial  more... and operational burden because the payroll and finance is run out of NY while the rest of other corporate departments including PMOs and billing are in VA. There is often a disconnect when people work in the next cubicle, imagine the situation with the different states. Some execs are really old and complacent, others are lazy being hired for big name companies they used to work for. Unfortunately, often there is no punishment for a bad performance, people aren't held accountable for very big mistakes or procrastination and it's a real morale issue for lower level employees. The company has a lot of entry level low paid employees and senior high paid questionable quality execs, the lack of the 'middle class' costs the company money but somehow they don't see it. Overall, I loved my time with the company and my advice is to accept the job depending on your specific offer/department circumstances.  lessIf I could do it again, I would have never worked here. The company is run by a foreign family with dubious international ties, yet they do classified work for the Government. They are loose-lipped about classified information and are overall documented unethical. They are notorious about not paying you so if you're out in Iraq or somewhere and relying on your salary, just don't work here.Great work environment.  Very individualized (contract).  Great mid-level management.  Unfortunately I just do contract work.  Would work full time if the opportunity presented.•	Performed general administrative support•	Was present during interviews and served as a translator•	Translated both written and spoken word•	Interviewed and screened potential applicants and visitors•	Moved to and from various bases throughout Afghanistanno room for advancement, liked my co-workers a lot, not treated with respect at all, I learned a lot about sterile processing from this company.I enjoyed the employment, pay and benefits. Just unfortunate that the job ended for me.No overtime, worked over 40 hours on a typical week.Co-workers were the only good thing."
637,Sotera Defense Solutions,"Sotera is a good company to work for and is winning a lot of good Govt contracts.  Professional environment and great co workers.  I highly recommend Sotera.This was a good place to work before budget cuts and sequestration affected jobs. Mid sized government contractors all suffered and Sotera was no exception.The story of a job placement company trying to be a defense contractor.  All staff meetings were to tell employees about acquisitions and plans for company revenue growth.  Only discussion of employee success was due to a project team's efforts prior to their previous company being acquired.There appears to be some financial issues since everything discussed centers around money and how the company can make more, or at least enough to meet debt obligations.There is not any job security.  Every day is questionable whether there will be a tomorrow.Coworkers are nice but above that becomes less than satisfying and supportive.Pros:Excellent ManagementGood PayFlexible work scheduleIf contract was lost, company would work with you to find a new contract.ConsContract workIt was fun and enjoyable working at Sotera Defense Solutions.  I only left after being laid off due to the absence in government contracts.  I was fortunate enough to work there for almost four (4) years.I enjoyed being the Travel Coordinator for the senior software engineers and corporate employees.Wonderful experience due to supervisor, she was willing to mentor those who wanted to learn.Great leadership, many opportunities for advancement. Highly cleared positions and encourages independent work.I enjoyed the team I have worked with and the atmosphere of work which allowed for thought and innovation and encourage team participation and a since of family. The contract ended due to government cuts.This was a temporary project that I really enjoyed working on.  The work environment was very layed back, which brought an ease of concentration.BusyValuable knowledgeExcellentgreat co-workersJob easyGoing to work everydaySotera is owned by another investment group who has no history in this field and it shows. Administration where I worked was stressed and understaffed. Speed was the number one objective and the word ""quality"" always took a back seat. That may be the normal at most places of work however. This appears to be a very stressed company financially at this point. Please keep that in mind before you accept a job there. The employees that I worked with were very nice people but they had been asked to give up too much family life to be happy.I enjoyed working for the company. I received respectable pay, and enjoyed some company perks (ie. box seats at the Verizon Center). I would have loved to have continued working for the company, however major contract adjustments were made, thus not allowing me, and many others to continue to do so.Sotera Defense Solutions has afforded me several advancement opputunities since I started with them in 2007. They are a very personable company where you don't feel like just a number, but you are part of a team and a large family.Familiar with IT Infastructure. Learned VMWare Sphere Client 5.0   and other Web-based  Tools Productive, Dedicated  and Motivated.Sotera Defense Solutions has a lot of good people to work with.  Mainly a DoD subcontractor for most projects, which means defense cuts really hurt the company.Culture depends on which sector you are in.Good mid-sized Defense Contractor.  Started with Signature, aquired by Global and then re-named to Sotera.The impression that I got from this company is that they do not care about their employees. I felt more like a number than I did an employee. It's been my experience that smaller companies go the extra mile to make sure they let their employees know they care and that they are more than just a timecard or employee number. They strive to let them know that they want their employees to make a ""career"" with the company instead of just work a job. But I did not feel this way with Sotera at all. I do not see myself ever working for this company again. I had a very enjoyable experience working for Sotera. The Human Resource Department is very efficient and being able to talk to management is even easier.They are professional and very responsible for their staff as well as to their staff.Co-workers are very hard working but I looked forward to working with them since they came to work with the best attitude and professionalism. You work hard during the day but you go home feeling that you have accomplished the duties that have been put before you and they praise you for it.Sotera is by far the best company I have ever worked for.Great company to work for. The management team is very personable and willing to listen to their employees.I currently lead a team of analysts for the Defense Intelligence Agency. I can provide more information upon request as the work can not be described in this forum.Sotera is a great company but doesn't offer enough advancement opportunities. I am looking to grow my career within the realm of management and proposal development."

I was greatly impressed with the high level of skill and intelligence---and modesty---that the staff and management possesses. Working with them, even for a short time, brings one's ""game"" up to the highest level.Enjoy perks of the typical silicon valley startup. Everyday is about the same and everything moves at a slow pace."

61,SPIRE,"A strong presence in several niche markets has kept the company profitable and successful in an industry that is suffering some growing pains. Continued success due to strong development and technology capacity looks to be strong.The changing nature of the industry puts more focus on 'in the office' time for Account Executives, making presence in the Boston office the better part of most days a factor in continued success. On a personal level, living in Central Massachusetts is not a great fit for my current position and the commute (which was not as frequent based on the initial scope of my current position) has become the hardest part of the job.Management is 'hands off' style for the most part, affording individuals with the ability to self-motivate, a strong opportunity to work independently and achieve success.Spire Corporation was a great company to work for. I managed the marketing and design functions of the company for 16 years.Spire had great pay for someone coming right out of undergrad however the company culture of passing the blame and speaking to each other in ways that are inappropriate to a professional work setting (including managment) is what sent me running.100% commission split cannot be beat. The company has a database of rental listings, a supportive management team, a friendly atmosphere and a great location in the heart of Manhattan.SPIRE Institute is an Olympic training facility that houses a full time academy in which we develop the future of high school and post graduate students through sport.I work directly with the students in regard to their total well being during their time at SPIRE.A company with a lot going on. Always an eye on the future. Interesting co-workers  and people managing.This was a job that just did not work out.Just did not get along with my boss.I just wasn't a good fit."

The hardest part may be the heat.I learned about different varieties of seafood and wine. Very busy and fast paced. Kept you on your toes. one terrible manager. I accidently put the last job as the bad manager, but it was splash.A good company to work for. A typical day is driving around and inspecting properties, sometimes making repairs when needed.Lifeguarding there was the best experience i have ever had and i will say that it was a privilege to have worked hereI was qc surpurvisor lead the teammanagement stocking/boxingeverything was in my handscommunication skillsThe usual washing and detailing cars in a fast paced casual fashion. Making dirt and forest appearing vehicles come out brand new and untouched. Always glad to put a smile and shock on a csutomers face. Hardest part of the job was getting every inch of dirt. Most enjoyable was seeing all different types of foreign cars and basketball players cars.I gave employer three full color compositions to choose from for their logo. Also designed T-shirt compositions for black or white shirts. This was a fun and quick job that accomplished employer's expectations and vision.I took the kids to get their lunch watched them eat/ate with them. Helped get them dressed to go swimming and took them across the street to the pool and watched them swim. We also put sun screen on them a couple times at the pool. I didn't learn anything I didn't already know from watching my little sister. The management was very well organized and the staff was nice to one another. The hardest part of the job was when one of the kids would have a tantrum but it wasn't that hard to get them to calm down. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the kids.Splash was a small perfume company that was located at the Citi Bank building in downtown Chicago. A typical day would be designing sale ads and signs for special sales that the company would have for their merchandise. I would get a call and email from the company owner about the information that I would need to design the flyers and ads. Hardest part of the job would be sending the designs to the location. The easiest and most enjoyable part of the job was designing the ads at home.service pools all over the city Managed 3 crews of 3-4 workers Plumbing repairA typical day at work starts with a briefing, event setup, and supervising. While working at Splash I have learned time management and enhanced my communication skills while maintaining great customer service. Most of the managers are supportive and open to any suggestions. The co-workers are great. WE all get along and help one another whenever it is needed. The hardest part of the job is knowing how much responsibility you really have on your shoulders but in the end it just makes you feel that much better when your shift is over because you realize you succeeded. What makes this place such a great place to be for our patrons is our staff because we don't just work together, we are a family.splash is a very fun place to work, but also very hot. Management had their stuff together, and my co workers were great. I loved helping people find what they needed , and I liked making them feel comfortable."
754,Spokeo,"If you are cool with checking your brain at the door this is the place for you. They hire people that are waaay more book smart or talented than they need, then micromanage the dickens out of you. If you've been working for more than 5 years, I suggest you look elsewhere.Yes! they provide you with catered lunch everyday . But I think that's only to make up for HORRIBLE management that expects you to do a lot more than what you're getting payed for. They continue to make changes after changes that makes the job more complicated & you feel stressed out more than half of the time trying to keep up with the changes. All the customers that call are always upset because of the unsatisfactory service provided, you get lucky if you speak to a happy one in your 8 hour shift. If you're ready to put up with angry people all day, go for it!Pros:- Great startup and resume builder career- People are fun and work atmosphere is hip- Flexible schedules- Free catering for lunch- Lots of fun perks (Video game area, Fitness reimbursement, Monthly Events)Cons:- Customer Service Dept is still in development, lots of constant changes regarding policy- Entry-level Pay (12.00 per hour)- Not enough advancement opportunity- Management could use work regarding workload distribution and evaluations should be based on work performance- Wage is not up to negotiationThe Spokeo atmosphere is definitely fun, but it is run by a few very young Stanford alumni who have big egos and have difficulty being told new, better ways to do things. Although they tout a relaxed setting, communication there is very poor, and they do not allow for working remotely whatsoever, which can be hard if you have to balance family and work.Love the company and what they stand for. They really take care of you and make sure you enjoy working there- catered lunches everyday, ping pong table, pool table, nerf gun armory, stocked kitchen, etc."
184,Spotify,"Put up flyers and send out play-list cards. Learned about marketing and social media marketing.The hardest part is to interact with real people and no enough training process.The most enjoyable part is that it is a very flexible job.Great experience for a college student looking to network or get experience in that kind of position. We got students pumped about Spotify and had a blast doing it.Such a great company to work for! The work life balance is phenomenal and there are plenty of perks. Such as free catered lunches, free concerts and company events.I made sure that the guards that were on the shift with me were moving around and making sure no one entered into the work space of spotify.I learned a lotSpotify is very laid back, fun people, free food.Free concerts and other events.There are no hard part to the job. Everyone do what they are suppose to.Managers are very helpful.overall the people are great!Sold Spotify premium packages to different college students.Held different marketing events on Campus. Influencing college students to pay for subscriptions was difficult, but I made it easy by being sociable and making the process fun.I loved temping at spotify, it was the best job I've ever had so far! Unfortunately it was a temporary assignment and I was not able to stay.Spotify was such a wonderful place to work! There was an ongoing sense of community between co-workers and departments, a consistent flow of information keeping us updating on the latest digital trends, and the open opportunity to showcase new ideas to peers that could further the overall advancement of the company.Spotify created many wonderful incentives for the Campus Influencers.  However, the management and organization of the position was not done efficiently.It's a great place with great culture and perks.  Employees all enjoy hanging out together and are all friends outside of work.  Mostly everyone on the ground are open minded about meeting new people and trying new things which creates a great lunch environment.  (People often eat together during lunch time and sit with different people)However because it's managed by leads in a different country, Sweden, it's often times hard to align interests between the different cultures.  Poor managers are allow to remain in senior positions because there hasn't been enough documented cases to see a trend in the poor management.  Communication about changes in the organization from Sweden to the US is often lacking and unclear.Everyone at the company works super hard but that doesn't mean there isn't room to have fun. There was countless video games, ping pong tables, couches, pool tables, snacks and so much more all over the office. I was part of the office management team and we catered to all of the employee needs. It was a wonderful job, and I met some pretty amazing people who do pretty amazing things.Learned a lot about marketing and enhanced my future. Learned to properly utilize mouth-to-mouth marketing. Was an interm basis.One of the Two on campus that organized events sponsored by Spotify"
33,Square,"Easy job. Everyone is nice. Long hours and must be attentive to detail. The expectations are high in order to get quality orders to customers.There isn't a typical work day, each day is filled with new challenges and difficulties. Each day ending in satisfaction.I would never recommend this place to anyone to work. They treat their contractors like objects rather than people. They segregated us by colored badges just like the early 1900s. The 'Blue Badges' wouldn't even look at the 'Green Badges'. It was very discriminatory.- Everyone is there to help!- Friendly Coworkers-Very Fast paced and challenging-Transparency throughout the whole companySquare's work environment makes it really exciting to go to work every day. The people are so nice and it's a great place to learn and be more developed day by day.get company with diverse people. great benefits and the customers are awesome. family community. sincere, genuine people. awesome place of employment, i enjoyed my time with them.Three week training on products, hardware, troubleshooting, credit card processing, and company history. Then a few sporadic online training. Daily notifications and alerts of ""all hands on deck"" to say please work as fast as possible and avoid creating internal tickets and emails to focus on phone calls. Very difficult to get answers to questions from managers and other team members.The people are very friendly. Worked on a team with highly capable people. Managers respect your input. Changes and input to software is genuinely considered and evaluated.The company is fun and takes care of their employees. I enjoy my time working there through my recruiting group. Fun place.it really nice place to work it is great management, but hour is less for me at least I am looking for 40 hours a week and if possible ot that part.I value the time that I spent at Square because I I grew a lot in my own personal development. Square fosters a fun environment and carefully balances fun with working hard. It's a company that you can work for and be proud of the product.Great company with lots of talent. You're bound to learn something new several times a day. Perks are great. Free food, flexible vacation policy and ...One of the fastest growing companies eve."
608,"SRA International, Inc","Excellent company. Good work environment. Good advancement opportunities.They supported their employees well. Got at least a cost of living raise each year.Good benefits.They really tried to find work for employees who lost contract coverage. They would continue to pay them for a short time and provided them with a contact to help search job opportunities in the company.We recently merged with CSC Gov about a year ago and the company has drastically reduced benefits as well as pay across the board. Annual reviews/raises have not been given for over a year and morale has appeared to have reduced due to thisUntil they were bought out by a larger company they were an amazing company with amazing employees. They knew how to get the job done and in the most efficient way and upper management was always supportive and willing to listen to as well as take on new ideas and concepts to make things better.Fortune 500 company for many years running.I loved going to work for SRA. Each morning I would greet everyone with a smile and a ""Good Morning"" every day. Hoping to put a smile going into their day. All of my co-workers were wonderful, we were a team. We worked and laughed together. The hardest part of my job was letting go of teams do to the loss of a contract. I learned a lot while working for SRA, they had wonder employees to mentor other employees, even management did the mentoring. Everyone was family. I did learn that the better a company treats its employees the better the employee will be for the company.SRA is a good workplace environment.  Management lacks experience in certain areas and compensation and pay is minimal compared to others in the industry.ProsGreat coworkers. Great IT support.ConsHard work, a great track record, and many years of service don't mean a thing. Management is spread so thin they barely have time to do their own job, much less worry about helping you stay employed within the company. While my supervisor swore he'd done everything he could to help find me a position within the company, it was somebody else who alerted me to a position I was qualified for. CSRA might talk a good game… Show MoreAdvice to ManagementStop treating employees solely as a means to profit. In eight years of working with CSRA, I never met my supervisor or anyone else in management. Why talk about the ""CSRA FAMILY"" when you don't even care enough to meet the employees? Or at least be honest. I was no more than a name and a number.Hours at the center are from 9:30a-6p, Monday through Saturday, except Tuesdays which closes at 8p. Great people to work with, but clients would often take out frustrations on employees and management is very menacing. You cannot bring up an issue about management without almost instant retaliation. Somewhat difficult to maintain 40 hrs per week.Suitable for a job but not career wise.  No room for growth.  Difficult to move on to new projects.  Internal hiring system needs improvement. Overall, company employee relations declined after it  was acquired by CSC.very friendly environment, supportive management, busy at work, very helpful team, very lucky to be in that team, challenging work.There is no room for growth. No bonuses, salary increase, employee recognition. HR wants you to work like a slave and not be compensated.  Only concern for them is to make the company look good so they can win contracts.Excellent company, super staff and managers, great benefits, and supportive management. They provide education training, mentoring, and job security. They are worldwide and make career moves easier than most.Worked at SRA for 17 years. ""Lived"" through the process of becoming a publicly traded company and then privatization, downsizing and reorganizing. Original corporate motto was ""Honesty, Integrity And Services"" then it changed to ""Honesty And Services."" Worked with many of the original staff who were recognized experts in their fields but who now have left as culture changed.The benefits were top of the average offerings before it returned to being a private company and corporation restructured. Perhaps SRA will be a great place again to work, discover one's talent and or become a subject matter expert.The Directors Document Records Management system was a project that supported over 400 customers and application users. My responsibility was to support, train, troubleshoot, enhance, issues tracking, requirements tracking, testing, documenting and enhance.  I loved serving our customers.safb location.  SRA appointed a strange micromanager who thinks she knows everything and rude to the point you couldnt work in peace, nobody likes her.  They are now CSRA and always have the same jobs open because nobddy wants to work with this micromanager.Not a very nice place to work.  Very low employee morale.   Terrible managers who are hands-off who routinely undermine and degrade their employees to the customer.  As a result employees have a very negative attitude.  Zero opportunities for advancement.The hours are amazing because management fit them around your schedule. The EAC site are neatly kept and work comfortable. As any other office setting, your co-workers are about the same. However, management will make it as comfortable as possible for everyone. Equipment is well kept and always accessible. When conducting outreach, you are required to use your personal transportation. However, there is mileage reimbursement. Overall SRA is an positive 9 out of 10. Lunch is 30 minutes but you do have two 15 minutes breaks as well. Only problem is dress code. The polo shirts could be a better quality. Bandages can be better quality. Other than that the company is amazing. You do have a gap in work, hopefully this year they can get a year around contract with CMS. Houston North Location always have a great center. The site supervisor is caring, hardworking, and very attentive. She goes over and beyond for her staff. If you do your work, then you can always come back to SRA for a second term or contract.Worked for SRA for more than 9 years and never regret having to work for this company. It allows you to grow and advance your career with a family work atmosphere rather than a stressful work environment.SRA seems like a good medium sized company but I have only been acquired from a different company during a contract rollover.  My experience has been tainted by a manager that does not have clearly articulated goals or expectations.  The corporate culture seems pretty good and the onsite training was great.  I think that if I was in a different environment within SRA, I would feel better but where I am now just seems like a pit that is getting deeper and deeper. I may change my review if I move to a different position/contract but for now I will say that SRA is no worse than any other larger government contractor.SRA used to claim that the company ""hired for a career, not for a contract"". That changed when the company was purchased by an investment firm, and the new dollar-driven management philosophy took hold. All that was good in the old SRA has been gutted by the new owners. The Cyber Practice, a core SRA capability, was disbanded in the name of cost cutting efficiencies. Highly trained, cleared cyber employees were released as contracts came to an end. The company has changed dramatically, with the sole focus being on the bottom line, no longer on the employees.This a great company to work for if you are starting your career. Management is pretty good, the work is challenging at times, and my co-workers are pretty good. However, salary and benifits are not competitive at all. Moving up or moving to a new career can become a bit of a hassle as well. They also do not compensate you will for moving to a new position. I went back to school to start a better career, and when I finally found a new opprotunity with more responsiblity, they did not offer me a raise to take the new position.Being on client site 100% of the time, I hardly ever hear from HQ except to sign the time cards. This company is all about the bottom line, which has become more and more evident in the few years I've been here (cutting benefits; merit increases based on HQ-determined numbers, not your actual performance). They have far too many mid-level managers at HQ that don't actually do...anything. Reward the people that represent the company.Work/life balance is good, but that has to do with site management/client and not the actual company."
134,SRI International,"Great work flexibility, low pressure environment. Management tends to work in a vacuum and does not promote team environment. Culture is very unique overallI worked for SRI International for 9 years, they never ceased to amaze me with what they were working on. SRI always is out looking for new and better ways to satisfy the customer.SRI Harrisonburg is a beautiful site, good facility. Right now it suffers from not having its own HR department, and decisions are made by HQ. Half the labs are empty, waiting to be filled.It was one of my first jobs in the field outside of school and definitely a learning/growing experience.  I have many fond memories of this place.SRI International is a good non-profit company, but it has undergone some significant changes in senior management in recent years. I am not really sure about the direction of the company any more, but the people there are top notch.SRI International is so multi-faceted, opinions in the suggested areas are bound to vary from person to person.  For instance, people working in support roles have a pretty set schedule, as with most jobs, while engineers and research personnel often have a more flexible schedule.Most of what I learned would fall under the heading ""Intangibles"", other than properly filling out documentation for the project I worked with, according to the client's guidance.Management seems to be hesitant in holding people as accountable as their peers would like, but that is a reality of any Project-type environment:  the majority of team members primarily work for someone else, and can always opt to leave.The hardest part of my job was working at such a distance that timely responses were not always possible from the corporate end.  I was in a decided minority compared to the majority of the work situations.The most enjoyable was the confidence my supervisors had in my abilities, and their consistent and constant support, as well as the timely mentorship.My supervisor did not train me very well with the everyday assignments that was given to me daily.  My co-workers did not want to cover for me at the front desk for breaks and lunch breaks.  My eleven months with this company was not very good.Working with scientist and engineers is my favorite. We had government contracts, and so it was tedious at times.  The people were superb.  Special project on new lines of business, computer systems modernization, and spin offs kept us busy. Stable and rewarding environment.   No stock options!Day to day busy with one duty or another. You always have someone to give you good advice. Its up to you to come prepare to do what is needed to be done.SRI is on the cutting edge in many areas of research,   the culture inspires individuals to do their best and is open to many areas of  interest.   The people are great to work for and there is a culture of working together to enjoy work and comradery among the employees.Decent work place with friendly supportive management. This site is relative new but the productivity is going up and all the numbers are ok.A good company with a diverse employee base, as well as high-level technology.Lots to keep up with, if you're ""up to the task"".Employees receive training in many different areas of specialty, so this company is a great first job for people.The management can overlook the forest for the trees and very rarely sees the big picture. Inconsistent criteria for advancement. Compensation is low for the amount of work required (overtime will be scheduled to the point where one's work/life balance will be disrupted).As a four year veteran who is just now taking his own advice - do the work, get your training, excel at it, but don't stay here too long.Confusing management system.  The workforce is growing very old and they are having a hard time attracting younger people.I believe that any typical day at any job is the same all around. There are times when you could be busy all day, that you don't even realize where the time has gone. And then there are the days when  work is slow that you have to go around asking for work, just trying to look busy. Management was real kick back, but firm when need be. But very open minded people. Not hard to get along with at all. I would have to say that the hardest part about the job was having to pick up after the technicians and maintain the medical supplies in the warehouse. And the most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things and meeting people with many different personalities and characters.A typical day of work for a Corporate Security Professional is never the same. I learned that most of the time people are not recognized for their hard work, but instead humiliated for any type of mistake made.A reputable institution and for someone without an PhD, it's a good start. It's very old school so there's very little room to move up without a PhD. I've worked in labs where education was second to skill base, although at SRI I found it difficult to be taken seriously unless you have a PhD.SRI Culture is described as a ""Google"" like campus with senior professors, professionals that create and innovate. Diverse market source for R&D.I've been with Sarnoff and SRI International for the past 16 years.It is a great place to work. I am intrigued with world changing  technology. It changes at a days notice.No two days are ever the same.Great management and colleagues with awesome personalities.Hardest part is the deadline, everything has a deadline. But we tend to work well under pressure.Most enjoyable would be the day to day. I truly enjoy my job and the people I work for  and with.SRI International is an innovative company that is very creative and has many hard working folks who put a lot of time and effort in assisting the Military in their mission.  The XCTC program and FlexTrain Home Station programs are very good tools that were created to meet the digital training requirements for National Guard Bureau and have accomplished this many times over.Multi-tasking with various clients for engineering research proposal development."
342,St. Jude Medical,"SJM is good company to work for I'm glad I got the opportunity to work and get to work in the quality group, it was new to me and I picked up new skills.Everyone is normally in a good mood and easy to talk to. Communication barriers in the department that I work for are not an issue and neither has it been with other departments. Management in some areas could learn to loosen up in order to allow their employees to maximize their full potential and abilities. Other than that, compensation is decent, the people are great, the company is solid and there's a cafeteria if you happen to forget that morning to bring your lunch.Average payLong hoursNo bonus for sr. engineers and under.Its basically a meat grinder.No one tells you you that you have to work long hours. However the expectations for delivery of projects will compel you to work long hours. Additionally, if you meet or exceed your goals for the year don't expect a promotion unless you are in RD.Management is flexible when and how you put in your hours for work. There is ample opportunities to advance within the company, but you are not compensated well when you are promoted. There is also no type of bonuses program. The benefits are excellent though.Management can get very unorganized and sometimes unprofessional. Don't expect too much on pay increases when converting from temp to full time St. Jude employee. They offer good benefits but PTO sucks. A lot of opportunities for over time.Worse place I have ever worked. Management is a joke they have their picks. You are not given the respect you deserve. And you make one mistake even if you are training you never hear the end of it. Low salary also 10.00 for first second and third 11.00 that is hired on. Tempts. Make 9.25.The St. Jude Medical Hackettstown, NJ location was a wonderful place to work. The people were very kind, fun loving and hard working. We all worked very well together, as a team. I did find that the IT department is structured in such a way that advancement at satellite offices is difficult. Most days at work - the first 5 years - I would make sure the backup were successful, test restores, assist users, install new systems - both client & server, patch servers, and ensure that the manufacturing IT operations were running smoothly. At times the FDA would show up and we would quickly set up front room/back room scenarios for auditing exercises. I would also remove viruses and ensure that all users had the latest antivirus on their machines. We used a help desk system called Remedy daily and that made it easy to keep track of tickets. I enjoy helping people very much.A typical day at work is processing medical device report forms by correlating in groups or with field specialists such as sales representatives and health professionals. I have learned a lot about the human heart and all the possible adverse outcomes. I have also learned that there are many different devices and products out there that can treat those adverse outcomes. St. Jude Medical has taught me to have more empathy and patience with my co-workers. It taught me to teach myself how to provide an enjoyable environment in an every day office. The hardest part of the job was witnessing many co-workers come and go since we had a strict budget for the department. Many different managers and directors have also had their share of time with the department. Other than the workload and the strict budget, this job is very enjoyable in the sense that you really get a feel for what it is to practice team work.The employees and management team are very genuine and supportive. The culture is very positive and it is a fun environment. New ideas are encouraged and implemented.Great job, learned a lot and promoted several times, so advancement is possible. Your always busy with good work environment. The hardest part of the job was working with the doctors, but the more you work with them, the more you understood.Overall I would not recommend working there. Too much politics and managment has no vision for the future. New engineers are hired based on capabilities, rather than on experience.The environment is diverse and humane with conditions that foster professional growth. The sense of job security is ever present although the recent acquisition may put a damper on that. The company is solid and treats people wellWorking at St. Jude Medical, I have learned a lot about the medical device industry. I have come to enjoy the greatness of making devices that can save lives. But at the location I worked at, I did not like my management team. Due to the fact that I worked for two different Production Leads, I was stretch very thin and cross-trained in many positions which I had no issue with. Although I was able to complete tasks for both teams, the leads did not have good communication which led to misunderstandings and unnecessary panic at times. The hardest part of the job was definitely the lack of communication between leads and their employees. There were a lot of employees who would have enough productive work for half the day while there were a handful of operators who had to be extremely productive the entire week to complete their tasks. Another hard thing about this workplace is how sly they are to making experienced employees train employees with more seniority and then promotes the senior employees into the trainer of those respective positions, which is completely unjust to all of the experienced employees who work so hard to learn and perfect their techniques for their position.I would not recommend anyone to work here if they wished to have a long-term job because I do not see enough employee appreciation within the company, not just from the department I worked in. I know this because I have worked with engineers, techs, and other employees from different departments and they, too, had their share of unappreciative experiences with this company.Responsible for opening the office. Check voicemail to see if any therapist called out if so then work on moving cancelling the patient appointment. Answer phone calls direct them to the appropriate area. Check patients in, collect co-payment, schedule appointments. Register new patients. Call insurance to verify benefits, obtain authorization for treatment . Balance money at the end of the shift.I worked for SJM full time from 1995 to 2004 and the culture has stayed the same, hard working but trying to have fun at work. I have worked for some of the other large med device company's and would rate SJM as the best. Would like more consistency on how contractors are converted to full time.I can't vouch for positions outside of IT, but management is pretty flexible. Bad weather? Kids sick? Working from home is typically not a problem. I find all of my teammates likable.A typical day at work for me consisted of receiving, issuing, and ordering inventory stock.I learned the value of teamwork. My job was dependent on everyone around doing what they were suppose to do, and we did it successfully.The hardest part of the job was dealing with surprised FDA and International audits.The most enjoyable part of the day was lunch time, you get to hang out with co-workers and friends.it is a good place to develop one's career. on job training is available which makes it suitable for full and part time employees. clean environment too.Assembly line. Trained and worked in multiple stations when completing medical device. Hours worked were Monday - Thursday from 4:30 pm to 2:30 am.I would work for  St Jude again, but always try to be prepared for the position to be relocated somewhere within the U.S. or offshore.Management is really not strong. they are not on the same page, its not a united place where every one will work together as a team. They do not hire the right people for the higher chairs of the company."
419,Stantec,"management-oriented approach.does not have supervisors in place to catapult into future. engineering staff lacks maturityGreat company to work for as far as compensation, long hours of outside work. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with changing schedules. I enjoyed working outside with team members to complete tasks safely and efficiently.Fast paced consulting firm that continues to grown through acquisitions. Places a lot of value on employee billable hours.  Great place to work on multiple projects and gain some valuable technical skills.Needs improvement on employee retention and organic growth.If you are a perfect person who makes no mistakes, you like working extra hours without extra pay or even recognition for it, and especially if you like constant ridicule and pre-meditated judgement, then this is the work environment for you. Don't get me wrong, most people in my experience at Stantec were friendly and professional. Unfortunately, this could not be said for most of the managers. I HIGHLY discourage anyone without direct experience to the client to avoid this job at all costs. It was extremely difficult to go in to work everyday when you felt like an outcast, and any mistake you made was put under a microscope and scrutinized. The work is challenging and diligence to details is extremely important. Because of that, re-work is unavoidable. I would expect when re-work happens, a solid, cohesive team would come together, receive structured feedback, and learn from the mistakes to avoid them in the future. Sadly, this was not the case. Unorganized is an understatement of what I witnessed. The company doesn't seem to want to build up its employees from the inside and they aren't willing to pay for the experienced individuals, so they are caught in a self-inflicting lose-lose situation. What I learned is that the same way there are good quality engineers and poor engineers, there are also companies with good work environments and companies with poor ones. These environments are highly influenced by their leaders, or lack thereof.Searched for easements for pipeline project and uploaded documents into database. Worked 6 months due to company lost bid on job and had no work.Stantec is a great company to work for.  They are organized and very professional.  The compensation and benefits are what makes this work environment the best.  Happily paid employees make for a happy work environment.  This company really takes care of their employees.I great place to stay busy but not much room for advancement. Good people to work with, good opportunities for some very fun projects. Stay on upper managements good side.Keeping community in mind is their motto yet they could care less about their employees.  Not impressed with management and all the extra bull with the company.  They waste lots of time and money.  They bought our smaller company last year and after a few months starting letting people go, first starting with admin, accounting, then laying off CAD people, engineers and scientists. Not impressed with this large Canadian company.I worked at Stantec while pursuing my degree, I had a great experience there and worked with a diverse group of individuals. Would recommend this company to anyone looking to gain experience. Positive working environment and flexible schedules made my experience an exceptional one.Large projects underwater by millions and it takes ""management"" by surprise. Woefully behind the times with low skilled workers at the helm. Projects listed on website are ten years old executed by acquisitions where the leadership has bailed to successful companies.No repeat business and lawsuits filed by companies they have screwed. Earnings destroyed by execution problems and the stock nosediving.They toy with you if they will hire you or not, the management is unclear and rude. The  language barrier is ridiculous and you get blamed for everything. There is no set training they just throw people in blind and expect them to know everything. DO NOT WORK IN THE WYOMISSING BRANCH!!!! THE MANAGEMENT THERE IS THE WORST!!!!I'd say it's a typical office job.  Most of the time employees work independently, which I liked.  The only thing that struck me (and may not be so strange to you) is that the people are very smart and social, so quiet people like me might look a bit of a funny duck, nevertheless, such a person will be respected there as long as he/she is an honest worker.It's a professional place to work; however definitely not friendly.The work load is ok, but no respect for management as they belittle their employees all the time behind their back.It was a good Joe we had fun and work heard.. Nice pay .good hours to work.benefit s to.the people where friendly. Nice. Just a good feeling work place..The people I work with are all really nice and knowledgeable. My work with them is remote but someone is always available to ask for help if I need it. I have a lot of responsibilities and I know my managers trust me.The day by day is  dynamic and you can learn every day because of the team experience. my co-workers are good friends. the hardest part of the job is the summer in the road... too hot. the most enjoyable part is everything else.There are great opportunities for collaborative efforts within the US and Canada. The downturn in oil & gas is trying, but this is standard across the board within the industry.Like any consulting company your future is really up to you.  You either need to have clients or be a resource to people with clients.  As long as  you are pushing to advance your career Stantec will be behind you and support you. This is not a lifetime appointment where you can sit on your laurels hoping for the best unless you are willing to get what you get.Stantec has a wealth of industry people and the workplace is enjoyable. There are people with all levels of experience. A typical day starts at 8:00 and finishes between 4 and 5. Monthly luncheons provide the office with a forum for a safe discussion and update to the ever evolving industry.I truly enjoy my day-day work task.I am able to choose how best to complete my work.This is a socially and environmentally responsible organization.Stantec is a great company to work for. They have a vision for the company, and are very friendly and flexible. They offer competitive benefits. Most importantly to me, they have the resources to compete on world class projects."
247,Staples,"So working in the copy and print center at Staples was anything but calm, between printer problems and five hundred page orders there was always something going on in the print center. Depending on what shift you started on your day would be either more or less busy, but it was always busy.The co-workers were generally nice to talk to but ultimately uninformed as to the awesomeness of printing. The Easy Techs were really fun to talk to and be with they were actually very knowledgeable about their machines.The management of my particular store were gods of micromanagement and god was it annoying. They wouldn't actually do anything but seem busy at the same time. And on top of that any problems you had were summarily dismissed.The hardest part of the job was the time table and the machines breaking down. The most enjoyable, for me anyways, was the printing aspect which was most of it. I love dealing with paper mounting, cutting, and laminating, binding and color testing. All aspects of printing.I enjoyed my co workers and the environment at Staples, the managers were very friendly, yet still professional.  I enjoy working with customers so that was another positive.Love the people working there. Everyone works as a team. You will always learn something new working there. Its always a good time at work.While the opportunity for advancement was limited, I enjoyed the customer contact. Particularly enjoyed learning the various machines and the creativity involved in producing a quality product. The job provided the opportunity to learn new skills.It's fine. There's nothing much to say about a part time retail job. It's exactly what it promises, nothing more or less. When things are busy, they can feel overwhelming, when they're slow, it's interminable.Staples is a great starter company for someone fresh out of college.  Due to the size of the company there are opportunities for growth.it's a job. it's the same thing day in, day out. i haven't learned anything really. the manager is nice but he's quiet. nothing is really hard about the job honestly. the best part of the day is being on the floor to be honest.Overall I think it's a great place to work. The supervisors really do they're best to work with any and all schedules. They really have a pretty good plan to helping people keep their job due to schedules.  The plant manager walks around on a daily basis talking to employees making sure they are all doing good. And and you really work two weekends out of the year and its only one day.Good place to work. Plenty of different job possibilities to improve your career. good management staff that is willing to help you promote yourself if you are interested in moving up the ladder.Well a typical day would be coming in to sort through the boxes and packages first.Then we start to load the trucks with our factory paper. Next I would start to put the boxes that will be moving out on that truck in it proper place on the truck.fun and everyday there is something new as a challenge. work hard to server customer with best ability to accomplish their need. management team are really helpful when you need there help.Long days, price changes and an report to 15 different managers in one day all of them telling you something different.  The plan o grams never actually worked and the tech then was obsoleteI was employed with the company for less than a year, lack of hours lead to my leaving the company. My coworkers were fun to work with and they were all hard workers, making the job greatly enjoyable.Work hours for part time employees tend to be inconstant and fluctuate without any rhyme or reason. This makes it a challenge for the employee to plan their personal finances.A typical day of work was scanning boxes, picking the needed product from nearby aisles, placing the product into the box and then pushing it back onto the conveyor belt. Sometimes I would also make the boxes and clean up at the end of the night.Like another reviewer said, this place has a toxic work atmosphere. There is a core group of people who have worked together for years and if one of them doesn't like you- none of them like you. One of the supervisors is a textbook example of a psychopath.Never understood what I did to be on the receiving end of their BS, but I know my situation isn't unique since they have so much trouble keeping people. It's not a place where you can just do your job and go home.I showed up every day. I worked hard. They ran me off.A typical day at work. Delivering 8 to 12 hours a day.I'm delivering office supples to schools,homes and diffrent businesses.I deliver 2 two 3 new businesses each week.My general manager and all of the other managers at the store I work at have been so awesome. I left the company for school out of state and they got me a cake and gift cards to buy school supplies. When I got back for summer break they instantly re-hired me to work for the summer and were just as amazing. The upper management seems to be a little more difficult and unorganized. Our store runs great but when we have customer complaints, most of them are due to issues outside our store.This company is a joke period. Their print department, not only cant generate revenue, but they cant train their employees properly. Can't move up unless you know two team managers as in BFF's. They treat the employees like its Kindergarten.Staples tries to treat their employees reasonably well, but it is still clear that either they do not have the funds to do so or are simply unwilling. ALL employees, not just those in sales positions, are required to meet a daily quota of sales requirements, ranging from getting people to sign up for the free membership to selling a certain amount of extra product (i.e. a ""market basket"") with any technology sales.There is no commission and no incentive for reaching quotas other than keeping your job. If it were not for these quotas, I feel this would be a very reasonable and even enjoyable place to work; but as it stands, each day is very stressful. When I was being interviewed, the manager described it exactly as the title, verbatim: ""This is a high-stress sales position. Can you handle that?""This is not to say the work environment is not friendly. The managers are under pressure to reach quotas as well, so it feels like a team all working to achieve the same goal.Name recognition. Retail and outside sales presence. National Account Representatives pay is not acceptable.intially compensation was acceptable but has. Even reduced.did not enjoy working here. new tasks were introduced every month or two and pressures too. this is highlighted by the fact that they never increased pay."
689,Starbucks,"The company is willingly to develop their employees as much and as far that employee wants to go.work days varied, all co-workers worked together  and had good customer service., benefits were very good, regular pay raises, insurance.and free starbucks coffee.Colleagues were amazing. Fun and eventful days at work. Making coffee, practicing the foam art, all in a days work. When we weren't getting orders through the window, cleaning and ensuring the areas were clean, were also a part of the daily duties.I enjoy this job and my team.  Position can be enjoyable, yet stressful. Toughest part of the job is the toll on me physically.i just didn't  like unstable they were with their hours, you would get sent home early so they could cut labor, i liked working in a team. the hardest part was having to be on the floor on your ownThis job is great. I love my coworkers and the management team, although the customers can be very difficult to deal with at times. Overall a great job, however consistently burning your hands on hot coffee is hard to handle.Depending on the shift, my day typically differed vastly. The store had a great workflow established for morning, mid and evening shifts. I was initially filling in positions to help the store since I was new. So I would warm pastries during the morning rush and run the to the front counter or drive through. I'd brew coffees/teas, refill milks, juices, cups, lids, straws etc. I'd open another register to help clear lines during rushes. I'd clean dishes, lobby, the bathrooms, the store. Other days I'd be focused on making drinks on ""the bar"" or I'd be assigned a register.Starbucks is an amazing company to work for. I was hired while in high school and continued to work there through graduating college. They offer amazing benefits and are very flexible with school or other work schedules. There are always opportunities for advancement!It was a very rewarding job with many perks. I experienced a new atmosphere and learned many new skills. I enjoyed the job but the management was terrible and was the reasoning for my resignation.Great place to work at . NIce vibe to it . Free drinks. Free food. Free markout every week. Great benefits. They have a college achievement plan !Customers are amazing and loyal once they know you put them first.  Working in a drive thru store requires multi-tasking at a whole other level if you are a shift or store manager.  Must ensure routines are followed at all times, otherwise good intentions from staff can cause chaos quickly.  Great company and AMAZING benefits if you work for corporate store.  Don't waste your time with license store though, because it doesn't come close in benefits.Have a positive relationship with your co-workersProductive dayBe efficientStay motivatedFollow instructions from management Contribute new ideasStarbucks is a great job and I miss it. You start your day off by prepping the coffee for sales.

The pay is good for a part time job but not something that you can live off of comfortably.Lots of customer service with a smile! I learned how to balance many tasks and prioritize between them. It was a very busy job that required full engagement to do the job right. I learned a lot from this job and it helped to have the management that I did. The hardest part of this job was the continuous mind numbing customer service in the early mornings, but the best part was also the continuous customer service. I enjoyed being the smiling connection that helps others jump start their morning and get their day going.I loved working for this company. The atmosphere is always great and the people you work with are just as good. i learned a lot more about customer service working here because it is such an engaging job.Rewarding in every aspect of the job.  Excellent Mission and Values to live by both inside and outside of the job.  Excellent work life balance.Overall Starbucks is a great company. The people here are generally uplifting and the workplace is mostly cheerful.I would recommend working here for sure.Starbucks used to be a great company to work for. But as of late, the standards and expectations are on the rise while we labor is cut and we are meant to do the work of 2-3 people at once. It feels impossible. One of the more frustrating things is the fact that tenured partners' wages have been ""bumped to the new minimum"" so that people that are just hired or just been promoted are all making the same amount of money. A new supervisor that has been promoted is making the same amount as one that has been doing the exact same position for 3 years. Morale is at an all time low all around.This was my first job. I was not trained for very long at all. I was hired during the busiest season and we were short staffed so that put a lot of stress on me. My co-workers were nice and understanding though."

229,State Street Global Advisors,"I have worked for State Street on and off for years.  I loved being a part of their corporate and community culture - there is no typical day, inasmuch as the company is huge and each division has their thing.For the most part, employees are working almost each other in teams specific to their skills and knowledge basis. Everyone is approachable and independent work is a crucial aspect to the working culture here.Huge company with limitless potential. Made great connections. Demanding, challenging and high-paced work environment. Little support for managers. Lack of individual focus makes certain tasks difficult to complete properly.I hope you got some good manager but unfortunately the manager i am working with is very non-professional and treat you like slave because you are contractor.Management by committee can be quite frustrating. If you want to punch a clock, have a lot of flexibility, aren't frustrated by a lack of support (e.g. call the help desk for everything and rarely get on-site support OR self service for things that are not your expertise). Then this is the place for you.SSB is a  good stepping stone into the professional world. There are many opportunities there and the lots of good people to grow with. They continually promote growth and new opportunitesI only worked here for a few months, but I was able to see in that short time that State Street was a great company. I learned a lot during my internship, and it has helped me throughout my life after college.Expense cutting and under investment has led to long days at the office.  Company has been having annual layoffs for 5 plus years and don't see that changing any time soon as it chases quarterly eps.Good place to start your career, but if you stay too long, you will see that the salary raises are minimal, bonuses are not great and promotions take a long time.  Bottom line, expect to work very long hours for low pay and the compensation isn't great.Great group with opportunities for international travel and assessments of banking operations around the globe.Collaborative team and superior management.Amazing work/life balance, depending on the team.I learned the accounting skills for 18 years at State Street Bank. Many classes are on line that need to be updated every year to take and tasks are cross training. However jobs are sent to oversea for downsizing now and next 4 years so they need to fire to meet their budgets!!Fast paced and dynamic. All engineers were extremely professional. As a financial institution, the bulk of the work was done off hours. This allowed us to work unimpeded.State Street is a very nice place to work if you are looking for a serious, yet not quite overly rigid work environment. The dress code is conservative, and the culture is friendly. There is a hierarchy that must be respected at all times, but that doesn't mean you can't talk to the people above you.Management doesn't clarify job specifics to well.  I learned how to designed websites and other minimal tasks I've never had to do before.  My co-workers are great the management team needs some help.Working for SSGS has been the worst experience of my life.  Their is absolutely no sense of team cohesiveness and management fails to take any responsibility for any issues within the job.Fast-paced deadline-oriented environment. The associates in the operations groups are knowledgeable and motivated. Work/life balance can be cyclically impossible depending upon the business area. Task variety is challenging in a good way; a person can develop many useful skills.Most of the time hectic due to needed to handle multiple task every day and deal with internal and external managers, sub-custodians banks and transfer agents, domestic and abroadTypical financial services company.  Diverse environment to service client base in most of the leading investment vehicles that are currently on the market.Great Company to start the career. I was joint this company at 2015. This is the first position that I received after school. It is a good reputation in the industry. However, if you want to achieve a higher standard, I suggest you to take the CFA and move to IBD.Corporate atmosphere and people were good to work with, lots of collaboration, however company wide lay-offs occurred too frequently.Great work-life balance as well as benefits for employees. Competitive pay out of college. Work environment is clean and co workers are always friendly. Passionate about giving back to the community"
413,Steris Corporation,"This company is growing and 99% of the time they are fair and a great company to work for. Co-workers are great, management is good, and work/life is excellent.I have worked here 10 years and have seen a lot of change take place. Management continues to try to communicate with labor and improve the environment and make jobs easier. They want us to work as a team. There are nay-sayers, but everyone chooses their attitude. They want to develop their employees. The hardest part of the job is to communicate effectively to everyone. The most enjoyable part is the opportunity to learn and grow. It does stink that they just sold a large amount of their product line. Not sure of my future here.A typical day at work was always busy.  I learned new skills such as advancing my Word and Excel knowledge, making travel arrangements, and scheduling clients for training classes.  The hardest part of the job was the manager of the department could be difficult to work with, but not horrible.I had a great 17 years at STERIS, and enjoyed a lot of success.  STERIS has  a good culture and great people.  FDA issues prompted re-organization and cut backs.A great place to learn the technicalities of medical equipment planning.  Long days spent in front of a computer.  Not strong in creative projects.  More technical than creative.  Awesome benefits and job security.Management doesn't listen to any concerns raised by subordinates, and design decisions are chosen based on job title not the the merit of the design.  There is no hope of promotion here since management hires old friends from their previous company into leadership roles.  These promotions are not always merited or accepted amongst other employees in the department.  The displays of favoritism lower moral in the department.There is no project planning and all projects are severely behind schedule and have inadequate resources allocated. Employees do not feel empowered to perform their jobs, there is a high level of apathy, and unhappiness among the employees; all of these things contribute to the high turnover rate at Steris.I worked with a group of four with Steris Corporation for my capstone senior design project. The management at Steris Corporation was very communicative and helpful, and it appeared that they treated their employees well.I started with this company just after it began.  Now they are all over the world. I was employee #23. Now there are thousands of associates.I learned so much at this business, and am grateful I was part of the original team.  I was allowed to be involved with decisions for acquiring equipment, in installing new computer systems.  My main job was accounts payable; reconciling two computer systems daily, checks, and as we grew I had two people working under me.There was no hard part, as the CFO was my direct contact for 3 years and still had direction after a manager became my superior.I loved this company, and I would not have left except to join my husband who moved to Nevada.A typical day would include making 6,000 biological and chemical indicators every day. I was trained in other departments shortly after starting because of my easy ability to learn. I would have to move 1,000+ pounds of pallets. I also had to be exceptionally sterile. I was in charge of making, checking, packing, and documenting all aspects of the product. My management was great, and though some of my coworkers were not team players, I still enjoyed my time with them and had very little discourse. The hardest part of the job was getting into the swing of the fast pace, and the most enjoyable part was being paid to work out!Overall, great experience. Slow decision-making at times but for all the right reasons. Would like to experience work in divisions other than strictly manufacturing however.Steris is a great company to work for. very knowledgeable team.My typical day usually consisted of checking my que to see if there were any new service calls and if there were I would then call those customers and schedule a service repair time. if there were no new service calls then I would call customer to schedule preventative maintenance(PM). Then I would follow up customer that had recent repairs done and check on the status of their repair also ask them if they had any questions about their bill.STERIS is a productive and casual place to work. I interned there and learned many valuable skills that will help me during my career path.management has no clue what is really going on at work. only worried about paper and fake numbers.over good people and just poor management.Safety is the number one priority overall. Traveling for the job is a natural part of everyday life as a National Specialist. A typical day would consist of arriving at the facility prior to surgery to be there as added support during surgery. after cases concluded for the day, I would begin troubleshooting of the system or systems in order to narrow down the root cause or causes of the problems. in the 6 years I have been there, I have positioned myself to try and learn as much about the company as a whole, not just isolate myself to one individual department. The most difficult part of the week, is trying to be in three or sometimes four states at the same time. My schedule is typically booked a month to two months in advanced. The most enjoyable part of the job was the hands on education and the employees I get to work with overall.The best part of the job was the laid back atmosphere, but the hardest part was being a temp. Sometimes when there was so many new temps passing through it made it hard to work, because so many people were getting hired and fired. Everyone tries to be better than everyone else and nobody just concentrated on the work that needed to be done. Some of the Team Leaders were really helpful but some just didn't care about the quality, it was just how many parts were made. I learned to keep to myself until the work I've done is completed. Every day was different but always the same in a sense.Assisted up to 6 sales representatives in 7 states to educate their clients in the correct, safe use of the company products.Spoke at several workshops and conferences on subjects related to infection control issues as well as contagious diseases and their growing resistance to antibiotics.A typical day at work requires long hours. The hardest part of the job is adapting to wearing a full-face breathing mask.At STERIS Corporation, I was initially hired to create digital illustrations for their new HAMO endoscope line. These illustrations would depict on how to put the scopes together through wallcharts, Illustrated instructions and also being able to cross check the part on the part assessment sheets. My contract was extended to assist with the technical and instructional literature for a tutorial program for a medical reprocessing machine, Human Machine Interface (HMI®) Simulation. After the project was completed, my contract was extended further to create the package designs, labels, and instructions for two separate biological indicators. While working on these projects, I also helped in the creation of a logo design for the same medical device washer that I assisted with earlier that year.No growth opportunities.  Stagnant work place.  Executive mgmt rules by fear to get projects completed which are never on time nor on target.  Management does not practice what they preach.Productive work culture. Everyone is very friendly and works together to achieve company goals.This company offered so many great things to it's employees which I feel boosted the moral.  There was a gym onsite with no membership fees.   There  were various kitchenettes around the building which offered free coffee/tea.  Great,great company."

641,"STG, Inc.","The only qualm is that they are a government contractor, which means jobs are less secure feeling than when you work for other companies, depending on the contract you are on. Such is the contracting game.I spent the first two years of my career with this company. I learned a lot. They were always supportive of my education goals.No review needed this is the same company and place of work. this is a great place to work the daily challenges keep things fresh and the people are great to work with.none available - great atmosphere, I really do not have a lot to say it is a good place to work, I enjoyed my Vice President and Manager the most.I have been at STG for 10 years and it has been a pleasure.  I typically work alone and conduct all things security but when I need managements assistance they are always there to help.I am a contractor so there is no real job security.  The team that I work for is nice but not very close knit.  The team at our HQ that I have worked with is a lot more happy and outgoing and regularly do things for lunch or team building events.Things change quickly.  You may be part of that change.  The rank and file are good people.  Management is very fluid and changes often.  May be better with private equity investment... but not likely.STG Inc is a great company to work for. They notice our accomplishments and encourage further training and education. Benefits are great. Supportive management.The only con I have is that being a smaller company, growth opportunity hasn't been possible.worked in a secure environment, checked emails and Remedy/Tickets monitored network traffic. Worked with professional good people.My workday began with saying ""hello"" to my work-group, all of which were very professional in every way.  Also, no real supervisor on site to direct everyone focus toward a common goal.STG had great benefits.  Though being a medium sized company paying attention to politics was important.  I enjoyed my time at STG.STG, Inc. was a great place to work until the recent years. It was a government service company that was constantly changing. Low employee morale.Leadership is out of touch and losing business faster than ever.  Employees are treated poorly and tossed out capriciously.  In many areas, everyone over the age of 50 and all of the African Americans have been forced out or laid off.  In an attempt to keep existing business, salaries are being cut while overhead costs are skyrocketing.- A typical work day is working 8 hours a with zero over time.- I've learn leadership and how leadership plays a very important part in being a team player.- respecting your co-workers and valuing their opinion, -the hardest part of the job  was leaving-the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting different members of the military staff their families and culturesGreat place to work. Great management and coworkers. Flexible schedule. Good benefitsI manage day to day activities of each program assigned to me within my portfolio as determined by the Sector VP for Civil Agencies. Time sheets, invoicing, expense approvals, business development, white papers, presentations, proposal writing are completed as required. As a Sr. Program Manager in this function, I have learnt contract management, proposal writing, tiered processes for qualifying future work, pipeline management ,and the application of IT Service Management concepts (ITIL framework). I continue to provide and  bring new work to the company and pride myself in providing excellent service delivery to federal and private sector clients. My current employer has assembled a wonderful team, that are warm, welcoming, humble, honest, trustworthy, and dedicated to be brief. They are a wonderful group of individuals to work with and for. The most difficult part of this function are contractual terminations. Its always difficult informing letting good people go due to a project being completed. The most enjoyable part of this job are the networking and customer / client / professional relationships developed.  However, the best part of the job is playing a role in the economic growth of small to medium sized business within the DC metro area.Managed team of engineers:Critiqued engineering work, managed schedules, managed sub-contractors, attended coordination meetings.I greatly enjoyed working at Best Western. It was a relaxed, professional environment. I got to work with some wonderful people who taught me so much.I worked closely with Program Managers and Executives to manage projects for the Defense Sector.great pay and off on weekends. always doing something different every dayI have been with this company long enough to see the good, the bad, and now the ugly. What started out as a great pride to work for a company that actually cares about its employees where you feel the family atmosphere when you walk in the door has turned into a place of high turnover of employees, break down in the moral fiber of the company, and a chaotic work environment to say the least."
68,Stitch Fix,"the work environment is great for a person who is active and love multitask. The people who work here are friendly and they practice commutative skills. Different mixtures of cultures and management is very understanding and flexible with employees that are going to school or have another job.Unfortunately, i moved and had to leave the job otherwise i would've stayed there. Great environment and team effort all day. i learned a lot on how to style every women for their body type.The place don't appreciate temporary employee's whent home sick throwing up and I get let go the next day the people aren't very friendly free food really how long will it take before they hire a lot more people and get rid of the free food not longMy first day at stitch fix suck.the management is in their own world.Manager and trainer was playing and cussing the other employees.once they show you what to do .the trainer did not come back to check to see if I am doing the job right.at the end of the day manager and trainer had clock out before me.the new employee. they are very hood in the warehouse.don't like getting paid only twice a month.I have grown a lot as a person and learned a lot of great things! They don't believe in merit based raises and want to give you a lot of roles/not compensate you for it.I absolute love Stitch Fix, Everyone is very friendly, Managers will work with your schedule, you can listen to music, and they offer free snacks and drinks everyday!Stylists enjoy flexible hours with great management. There is a community of Stylists who work together fabulously. If you have a passion for fashion, you will thoroughly enjoy styling clients from across the United States!Management is really poor. They never communicate with one another, so the employee's are always finding things out at the last minute. You can see favoritism all over the place. I have been working there for almost a year now and I have never been given the opportunity to move up. I see new people with less than six months at the warehouse get promoted left and right. Managers run their department however they feel like it and they also make you come in early, but they won't show up until regular showtime or even later.Loser trash job stay away. Pure slavery in all forms like working in jail the worst job ever the people there are low class and management is pure garbage. Its like a chinese sweat shop if you are not a favorite then you will get treated like dirt!!This was my first time working at a warehouse.  I was a temp. The atmosphere can be very negative. Alot of the employees have attitudes and are hard to get to know. It seems like management changes policies and rules very often. I did see favoritism, which is not fair to the employess that work hard. Lots of Drama. Adults should act like adults, not childish brats. The amount of insubordination I saw was amazing. These people would have been fired somewhere else.  Not very flexible when it comes to family situations and your schedule. You'll get nowhere there if they don't like you. Free snacks  are great, but not worth working there.The job is easy, but I feel like the company is trying to make slaves out of theses workers. They say it's climate controlled, but the temperature is above 80, they have you stand in one place expecting you to pack clothes at a fast pace while trying not to collapse frm the pain frm your feet. They should provide you a chair if all you are doing is standing there. I realize that most workers breaking a sweat getting all the work done are black and hispanics and mainly the managers and the stylists who sits on their butts and doesn't do much yet get paid more are white. Its a major race issue within this company in my opinion, I feel like I'm a slave and us as workers that receive the clothes frm the trucks, put the clothes on the racks, pick the clothes frm the racks, pack the clothes and ship them should be treated with as much respect as the white people who sit down all day. Stop treating the ones that do all the work like slaves, I mean it's already hard for blacks and hispanics to find jobs so the only job we can probably get we get treated like slaves. I would enjoy it more if I didn't feel like a modern slave. I applied to be a stylist for this company and was denied for no apparent reason yet hired for a warehouse worker. Oh I forgot I'm not white nor have blonde hair to work in the cool part of the building. More people need to stand up for what's right and never let people treat you as if you are beneath them. Money is not everything REMEMBER THAT!!I took a job as a stylist part time to ease the transition into full time after having a baby. I was really excited about the opportunities that I thought the company might present down the road but I realized very soon that, even with a degree in fashion and 10 years of experience, I'd never be promoted even though I had very high statistics (they measure these very closely). As mentioned in many other comments, the management team is like a small group of sorority girls that choose favorites. I lost respect for the brand and the culture very quickly. That's what happens when you don't see and tap into your own employees potential and allow negative people to get settled into positions of power. Good luck fellow fashion majors- I feel your pain!This warehouse is very unprofessional. They play loud music with extreme content and profanity, like five different radios at once. The supervisors never speak to you or introduce themselves. All the supervisors do is stand there and talk all day. There is no air in the warehouse but in the offices they're nice and cool. Iv seen females pass out from the heat. Leads/trainers come to work with hang overs. We are always short on Saturdays because people call in. It's extremely ghetto so if that's not the atmosphere you like then I'm telling you right now this isn't the place for you.  If you have an idea they will steal it and take credit for it. All we do for 10 hours is fold clothing, wrap it and put it in a box. If it isn't to their liking then they send it back to you. Sometimes they sabotage your work on purpose so you have to do it over. The breaks are very very short. People have their cliques so it's hard to get to know do workers. Pay is alright and they have stocked drinks of every kind and different snacks. Over all I wouldn't recommend this company or at least the warehouse.Managementment team could be a lot more organized. They are very big on favorites. The don't accept doctors excuses or anything.I used to enjoy come to work everyday, but first they changed the schedule, second It's hard to get a promotion unless you are friends with the management, even if you are going above and beyond your required job duties your not getting full rise or even worse you get nothing, then you have to wait another year to get cents, the management is really poor, a lot of supervisor for just one department and they never dont know anything, they never can answer a question and will send you with other supervisor.

70,Stitchfix,"the work environment is great for a person who is active and love multitask. The people who work here are friendly and they practice commutative skills. Different mixtures of cultures and management is very understanding and flexible with employees that are going to school or have another job.This was my first time working at a warehouse.  I was a temp. The atmosphere can be very negative. Alot of the employees have attitudes and are hard to get to know. It seems like management changes policies and rules very often. I did see favoritism, which is not fair to the employess that work hard. Lots of Drama. Adults should act like adults, not childish brats. The amount of insubordination I saw was amazing. These people would have been fired somewhere else.  Not very flexible when it comes to family situations and your schedule. You'll get nowhere there if they don't like you. Free snacks  are great, but not worth working there.I used to enjoy come to work everyday, but first they changed the schedule, second It's hard to get a promotion unless you are friends with the management, even if you are going above and beyond your required job duties your not getting full rise or even worse you get nothing, then you have to wait another year to get cents, the management is really poor, a lot of supervisor for just one department and they never dont know anything, they never can answer a question and will send you with other supervisor.

Good luck fellow fashion majors- I feel your pain!Loser trash job stay away. Pure slavery in all forms like working in jail the worst job ever the people there are low class and management is pure garbage. Its like a chinese sweat shop if you are not a favorite then you will get treated like dirt!!I have grown a lot as a person and learned a lot of great things! They don't believe in merit based raises and want to give you a lot of roles/not compensate you for it.Management is really poor. They never communicate with one another, so the employee's are always finding things out at the last minute. You can see favoritism all over the place. I have been working there for almost a year now and I have never been given the opportunity to move up. I see new people with less than six months at the warehouse get promoted left and right. Managers run their department however they feel like it and they also make you come in early, but they won't show up until regular showtime or even later.This warehouse is very unprofessional. They play loud music with extreme content and profanity, like five different radios at once. The supervisors never speak to you or introduce themselves. All the supervisors do is stand there and talk all day. There is no air in the warehouse but in the offices they're nice and cool. Iv seen females pass out from the heat.

There is a community of Stylists who work together fabulously. If you have a passion for fashion, you will thoroughly enjoy styling clients from across the United States!Unfortunately, i moved and had to leave the job otherwise i would've stayed there. Great environment and team effort all day. i learned a lot on how to style every women for their body type.This warehouse would continually change the policies of the company and would expect employees to adjust to them immediately. Management was extremely poor, they would want you to warn them if you were going to be running late, they would say it was okay if you were little late but then would later have a meeting with you and hold it against you, as if you were a no call no show. Just overall poor management amongst all departments.Love the styling process and ""interaction"" with repeat clients.Not crazy about some of the metrics by which you're measured.

I have worked for this company for almost three years and enjoy it every single day.
361,stryker,"Stryker Orthopedics gave me a great opportunity to learn about Orthopedics. I spent seven years as a Stryker employee. During that time they were very helpful in teaching me all aspects of Orthopedic medical equipment distribution. During my time at Stryker I was able to grow as an employee and was awarded two promotions. I would highly recommend Stryker as a place to work!The system that was in place was antiquated for and adp product and they were not utlizing the full spectrum of the original package they paid for. They also were paying for upgrades that did not have to be done as they are not a fortune 500 company and it was way more expensive then it should have been but they were leading this project with hr director who had no know ledge of payroll systemsthe people were very nice and I enjoyed the work load expectancy for such a demanding company. Also the training on the type of work was very diligent and concise with what we were dealing with.I had a great experience with Stryker. Its a wonderful company with a supportive team. Your days are incredibly long and its not a typical sales job. It is very service heavy. You will learn a ton and feel incredibly accomplished.Stryker is a stable and secure company in Kalamazoo, MI. If your looking for a job with benefits, then this is a good place to work.Start at 6AM and built basic hospital beds. Medium paced work environment, and laid back. Management was wonderful. Hardest part was big orders and a certain deadline. Most enjoyable part was the people and the environment.Stryker is a great company to work for and the upper management and staff are very professional, friendly and willing to help new employees. Overall, the company offers a lot and it provides an opportunity to develop and learn new skills. The company promotes a great job culture.Stryker is a solid company that is growing everyday.  The culture of people plus benefits makes this a great place to work and grow.  They are part of the Healthcare Industry that will always have great job security.Pretty easy job.  the hardest part is working with needy doctors and hospital staff.  the compensation is great for fresh out of college students.  this is a good stepping stone for any medical sale positionStryker is a rapidly growing company. They purchased Bechtold and merged the company together. There is a lot to learn and there is no shortage of work. What you will also get a micromanaging and cuts on overtime. Management has also gone through change and its not lick the old Stryker. It's starting to feel like whats more important is the micromanagement of employees and cut backs.Each employee seeks to drive one another. While it is competitive there is cohesiveness among employees. All are expected to work and achieve outside their current role and develop themselves.Sales staff worked well with office employees.  Management was open to communication with support staff.  The typical day included answering incoming calls from both customers and sales force, data entry, filing and other administrative duties.Very bureaucratic. Hard to get anything done fast. Upper level management is tough to get in touch with to get anything done. Earning potential is very very good. Doubtful many people would put up with the work without the pay. The ones that do well in this business work from 6 in the morning until 7 at night. Working in the OR and not behind a desk is a great benefit if you hate working in a cube like me.Large company so very slow decision making processes but very overall a wonderful company to work for.  They are progressive and always expanding.This is a great place to work the work is easy the people are friendly I look forward to being here and learning more about the company and what they have to offer I also think this would be a great places to work 30+ yearsI really like this job, First thing good for my health, because health is better , I can work better , Future is good, Environment is also good.distribution is one team. like family member.This is a productive and fun work environment. Co-workers become like family. Management has a very hands on approach to working with everyone and they believe in promoting from within.hard work and interesting tasks, excellent treatment the employee with very good security, good supervision, a lot of teamwork, sold good variety of foodCoordinated team and resolved the difficulties which we faced during validating the products and trained the workers about the measurement systems etc.It was good experience. I met a lot of very nice people. I would definable work there again. Very good company. Filled with opportunity, growth and chances.Stryker is really all about the people.  It is staffed with very hard working people who uphold a culture of ethics and compliance while meeting a demanding work load.  Stryker repays its employees with generous benefits and salary.  Employees know they are appreciated for their hard work."
262,SunGard Financial,"People are fun and kind to work with. I've enjoyed the work place. Co-workers are intelligent and hard-working. I've learned a lot throughout the years.Sungard was  a great place to work. I ran the Telecommunications and internal infrastructure planning and implementation. In the end I wanted more experience with evolving technologies especially Cisco powered networks.Lots of room for advancement, enjoyed working there, good benefits, low salary.   Moved up quickly advanced to higher paying jobs, management was quick to recognize my automation skills and allowed me to automate numerous processes in various Trust and Investment related departments.I provided Operational Support for our customers in the Securities Finance Industry. I coordinated and set up procedures to receive and transmit files and reports for our clients using various methods of transmission and encryption. Assisted customers queries via phone and email in a timely accurate manner. Utilized schedulers to run programs at specific dates and times. Providing excellent customer service in a timely manner was always my priority. We grew from 30 clients to over 300 in the time I spent with this company. Fidelity bought the company in late 2015 and many senior employees were let go due to a reduction-in-force to cut payroll expenses. This had always been a great company to work for and truly hated losing this job.It is a good place to work and in many ways, I wish I had stayed with the University.  However, I was looking to expand my knowledge and thought that a consulting job would be interesting.  Unfortunately, the travel which was reported as 25% turned out to be 50%.Great people, young culture. Do what they can to help you grow as much as possible. Open door policy with management, I feel very comfortable if I need to speak with someone in upper management. The work is a grind and very hard, but if you are a hard worker and detailed oriented you should be fine.Extensive hands on Test Automation Coding experience for Unit, API or Functional Tests and Hands-on experience in building applications with either Maven, Grunt, Gulp, MSBuild, ANTHands on experience of automation tools (Infrastructure, Test, Build) and experience in operation and maintenance of Linux/WindowsThis is not a job for students. I started working here because it paid well, but the hours were only full-time, and the level of security didn't allow me much study time. Management was not that great, either.Typical day at work was generally putting out fires on a daily basis with people that everything was an emergency which is something I loved - never a dull moment.Co-workers became like family because you work such long hours you are with them more than your actual family.SunGard is a fast paced and innovative company with great products and solutions. While the company focuses on the financial markets, it does not slow the innovativeness of its solutions. SunGard also provides great opportunities for career advancement.Working Here started off good. But then came lies from management about promotion. the people they put in charge don't do anything all day but play on there cell phone,eat all day an complain about stupid stuff such as staplers in work, Sorry team leads they want the other workers to do there work. Pay suck!!!! keep up mess!! so call friends talk about each other behind there back. Management have there picks and chooses. bring in people off the street rather then hire in house they hire friends of friends sad how management work I would not even call that management because it's unfair and they don't care about the people that work there butt off. Fire people cause one of the managers/leads don't like them. not all departments some departments are awful.We are still going through the integration process with FIS but the transition has gone fairly well as compared to other acquisitions.   The FIS culture seems similar to SunGard.  Leadership team seems good and communications about changes have been transparent and informative.Great work experience and very happy to be associated with this company. Great place for entry-level developers and business analysis. SunGard is now FIS as they were bought in December 2014I enjoyed developing software projects and learning about retirement planning with the Securities Exchange CommissionIf you need a job that's flexible around your home life, SunGard is the place to be.  They offer great benefits compared to most although now that they're being bought out by FIS things might change.  I've never worked somewhere that you can take 4 hours off whenever you need it.  Sometimes this gets abused but they really don't care as long as you're happy.The company didn't last long.  They ended up closing down and I had to seek work at other places.  I really enjoyed working thereA great company to work; I didn't stay here very long to have an opinion one way or another. The nice thing is that you work at the company's location you're assigned to and that was pretty cool.I would most likely still be employed with SunGard EB Systems if our Charlotte office had not been closed.  I had the opportunity to relocate to FL, AL, PA, or CO but family obligations kept me in NC.I started at this job and moved my way as far up in the small company that there was room to grow. I felt I had learned and gotten promoted as far as I could so I decided to look for new opportunities.  I small company is great because you become very close with the people you work with but mobility has limitations.I have worked for this company for 30 years. It has offered many opportunities for advancement. Great co-workers.Very good co-workers , parties, no stress environment. Friendly management , lot of training sessions. Working with ancient technology"
720,SunTrust Banks,"Awesome company but bottom line came first and often at the expense of the employees. Fun place to work a well thought out corporate environment. Benefits are excellent.Working through my daily pipeline keeping accounts updated, talking to customers (inbound calls) who want to work with us in bring account current or payoff.  Work projects that are offered by management dealing with accounts that may need to be charged off, re-evaluated for assistance to the consumer etc., talking with our attorneys, and answering emails, taking requests for reinstatement and payoff figures. I have learned time management, and the hardest part of my job would be not being able to assist someone who is really trying and they don't have the means to do so.the most enjoyable part is the people I work withIt was a enjoyable job at first but then became really stressful and impossible to meet goals. The role play was ridiculous with upper management, nothing was the right thing to say.Typical day of processing transactions and making deposits. I did learn a lot on the banker side of things which was a nice asset. But there is no room for advancement.Bank Teller/ Customer Service Representative, August 2003-September 2004Some of a bank teller's responsibilities include cashing checkAccepting deposits and loan paymentsProcessing withdrawalsSell savings bondsAccept payment for customers' utility bills and charge cardProcessing necessary paperwork for certificates of depositSelling travelers' checks Specialized in handling foreign currencies, or commercial or business accounts.SunTrust Bank allowed me to advance quickly due to my desire for learning the banking industry and work ethic. The majority of my managers were very understanding and trusted my abilities. Those attributes are what molded me into becoming a very thorough trainer and listening ear for my co-workers.Managerment wasn't fair or understanding. Human resource was for managers not for the employees. Lot of benfit was taken away. Co workers was good. You get blamed for mistakes that supervisors and managers didn't explain the process or produres correct. The most enjoyable part was meeting new friends.Definitely was a great place to get work experience and to understand corporate america, as they say. Helped me develop a certain level of professionalism that I do not take for granted.Good work environment, Good schedule, they really work with you schedule wise. Hardest part of the job was dealing with customers.Expect to work from sun up to sun down. Make sure to ask alot of questions from superior and to attend trainings.Not good on grqining before just tossing you out there to find your way in the mix.I would do transactions as well as have conversations with my customers. I learned a  great deal about banking from my co-workers. The management was fine but mainly learned from my supervisors. The hardest part of the job was really dealing with the rude customers. The most enjoyable part was the co-workers as well as the regular customers that would come in.I have seen many HR issues in the branch and management doesn't do anything about it. They continuously push us with sales and our sales goals are unreal.Great place to work in team environment to meet growing needs of a bank moving into the national spotlight.  Work included meeting with several lines of business in the asset finance brokerage unit, building new software solutions and eliminating redundant capture of data.  Systems included Misys LOAN IQ, AFS COMPASS, Bloomberg, DTCC, Calypso Derivatives system, Impact brokerage system, MTS Money Transfer system, OnLine Treasury Manager and GEAC General Ledger systems.    Regulatory reporting included Dodd Frank Volcker, CCAR Liquidity reporting, Shared National Credit reporting and other ad hoc internal audit requests.Most enjoyable part of the job was working with several lines of business helping them streamline and prepare for growth.  Flexibility to work from home and move around the office buildings to meet staff.Great place to work, Suntrust has a good learning experience in place so that you can learn your specific job and excel in the area of your position and career.Suntrust has a great work life balance.   They also are supportive of new technologies and provide training to those that require it.I did not enjoy this job.  I just wanted to help customers with the needs they were concerned about.  However, banks are only concerned with convincing customers to sign up for more accounts that I, as a teller was constantly told I had to offer to the customers even when I already knew the customer was not interested.SunTrust is a great employer with excellent benefits such as 401K and health, however, there have been many changes to banking regulations in the past 6 months and we anticipate many more in the next year which can possibly result in banker's bonus incentive changing (not for the better).Lots of empty suits walking around. The company is the epitome of corporate America. No one knows who to talk to, there is very little accountability, and the organization is constantly being rearranged with higher turnover than usual. Think of the show ""The Office"" but banking. The compensation is great, above market, however the company does not invest in new technology to keep up with its competitors.Make sure you have a manager willing to mentor you because SunTrust has the worst onboarding and continual development/training programs I and my coworkers have experienced.There are many people working at an abnormally slow pace so they can give the impression of being busy; as a result projects and initiatives take very long, there are delays and project cost overruns, and communication across the enterprise is difficult due to people's lack of accountability and caution to take ownership of anything. High producers are rewarded with more work and more responsibility while advancement is limited because of ""lifers"" waiting (or needing) for a RIF (RIF = layoff, reduction in force). The main advancement one will get is AVP to VP and annual raises. On the Consumer and Wholesale side, SunTrust has antiquated backend systems and infrastructure -from the 80s and 90s that continue to be patched, creating unnecessary errors and work so that people will be ""safe"" in their jobs. The CEO is very concerned with the bottom line and will not make any meaningful (high dollar, high value) investments for the future to build lasting value; as a result the organization is simply  more... a ticking regulatory time bomb, waiting to explode at any moment.In the Consumer division be sure to wear a suit every day. You won't be client-facing but the culture requires business attire, which is totally unnecessary for employees in support roles. There are no happy hours or after work events unless you organize yourself - office managers do nothing to support a positive corporate culture, they only serve to manage Managers' calendars, give out equipment, and make sure employees are sitting in the right cube.  lessA lot of sales involved.  Outbound calling, setting appointments, follow-ups, etc.  Not difficult, but not very exciting either.  Compensation is competitive.  Good bonus program.  I hear benefits are decent (I don't use them).I have no comment at this time about the company, good company to work and good management, sad that many departments are closing. No other comment at this time. Thank youGenerally, this is a good place to work in Atlanta.  Salaries are competitive and most managers are solid.  Company is also active in the betterment of the local community."
412,SWCA Environmental Consultants,"As a seasonal archaeologist, the project goals were clear and additional information regarding the project area were available upon asking.  Overall, the Tucson office had a great morale and work ethic .This company seems to have a high turnover, maybe more so in the Phoenix corporate office.  In every office there are people that should be fired and people who are worth retaining.  Trouble is, the fickle management doesn't seem to know the difference.  Good employees seem to be dismissed way too often; even when it doesn't seem to make sense. Just don't count on job security.Horrible place to work, no leadership, no advancement , no team work.  Seasonal work. No set processes or procedures.  Benefits are mediocre. Employees at a certain level are not held accountable.SWCA was a lousy company to work for.  Project Directors regularly threw underlings under the proverbial bus in order to cover their own ineptitudes.  Good archaeologists & biologists were regularly replaced & overshadowed by less skilled, but more ambitious & cutthroat coworkers.  SWCA also regularly overcharged clients, purposely did shoddy fieldwork, & arbitrarily changed pay.  Out of the several Cultural Resource Management firms I have worked for, as well as other places of employment in other fields, SWCA was easily the most unethical, devious, & all around negative work environment.This job is really fun and the work load is just enough were you don't feel overwhelmed. Although the work is project based, so some times it gets really slow. For example I had a couple weeks where I only worked 5-8 hrs. The Management is awesome.The best part about SWCA is that they have the technical expertise that provides the client a high quality environmental review in accordance with all regulatory requirements followed. The team works long hard hours.  The pay is lower on the scale, but the offset is in other benefits such as health insurance, investment options, and profit sharing. The name sake of the firm is very much involved in projects in most, if not all offices. SWCA is a large firm, but with a small firm feel.a typical day at SWCA start at seven o'clock the morning, driving to project area. This could be and energy location currently producing or a proposed energy location. we've been conduct the biological survey required for the client. The hardest part of his job was having to identify plants by their scientific names. The best part of his job was identifying plants by their scientific names.You can learn a lot if you are willing, a lot of very talented people at this office in Houston.  The management is fair and understanding.Its all right It just does not provide enough hours needed to make a living. If you get hired on part time its more interment so its when ever they need you. Which makes it hard to find a second job and be far to both employers.This company only used me certain times when projects came up in the area in which I went to school. The projects were usually very short and only required start up work on my end.I get to work and review what the day will bring. Checking mail and review my things to do list. Worked with good people and were willing to teach me new tasks"
710,Swedish Medical Center,"This is not a horrible company to work for. However, the benefits can be better. Also, paid time off can be better as well. All sick, vacation and holiday pay must come out of your own PTO bank.My typical day at work consist of me filing all employees paper work for all of there hospital and I was the only file clerk, the one thing I learned was workers compensation work in the departments. Management for this job was great no micro management I loved my coworkers all was had fun on the job as long as work was done. On this job was when I could not find a file that was need asap. My most enjoyable part was that I did not work on the weekend.Always learning and growing.  Management is typical management, under the gun to get the job done and under budget.  Co-workers vary from nice to mean.  Patients are the most enjoyable part of my job.  Mean co-workers are the hardest part of my job.In the 3 years that I have been with my current organization I have learned so much and have created new, lasting relationships with my team members. I have overcome obstacles, retained 80% of employees, been a go-to person for work and personal issues and gained knowledge from my superiors in management styles.Swedish has completely changed from the company I started with and has only gotten worse since being purchased by Providence Health Systems.  In addition, they have gotten completely top heavy and have promoted people with little or no managerial training.  This has resulted in unfair management practices and a climate of fear with high turnover and no security.  Definitely do not apply for a job as a social worker at Swedish - you will be sorry.Swedish provides all employees the ability for growth and is a wonderful place to learn and gain work experience. If you work hard enough and are willing to take risks you can go very far within the Swedish network.As a part of the Swedish Medical Center staff I felt that I had the opportunity, physical setup, and the support of management to do the best possible practices concerning nursing care for the hospitalized patient. The culture of care encouraged continual growth, respect for patient's individual needs, and distinguished Swedish Medical Center as a community cornerstone. I am grateful to have been a part of that team.If you're looking for employment at a clinic with high turnover (I'm talking FIFTEEN employees in a one year period out of 36 employees not including providers) then this is the place for you!1)  Unqualified management without proper resources.2)  Culture of tattling telling instead of addressing any of your concerns or questions directly with your colleagues. 3)  Frequent ""rounding"" from Swedish HR without follow-up and any resolution. HR is not on your side.  HR is here to save Swedish's hide and they have no desire to help their employees.  4)  Abrupt and inappropriate physicians who are not reprehended for breaking policies, bullying, name calling, and poor patient care.The most enjoyable part of the job is absolutely the patients, but unfortunately that alone is not enough to be satisfied with your job. I strongly urge you to consider other employment options.I have learn somethings but I fell that I am not using all the skills that I have and I would like to make sure I'm suing the skills I have gained, I enjoy my coworker, everyone is pretty nice, but I need more of a job were I am interacting with patient and coworkersI would love to say the people I worked with for so long at Swedish were like a family.  The teamwork was always excellent and it made the demanding/busy work of a clinic smooth and fun as possible.  I tip my hat to those who continue on.  I will miss everyone. I learned how to succeed as a leader being there the longest.  I was the resource for vaccines and inventory and EMR procedures.The hardest part of my job was justifying my position as new management came in.SMC offer's competitive wages, & overall good benefit plan. The biggest drawback of working at SMC is the very high-cost of living in the greater-Seattle area. Housing prices in Seattle go up on a daily basis, this trend doesn't show any signs of ending soon. Seattle is simply growing way too fast, we're second only to Dubai in the number of immobile cranes on building sites.but just enough so you come to work the next day. Little to no room for advancement.We nearly had to strike last year for better benefits.Its a large, healthcare company, with a culture of promoting from within, sometimes things can be slow to get things done, which is often the case in similar organizations.I will give them 5 stars, I work the overnight shift I have a great team I worked with.  The people; I enjoyed the workplace I enjoyed all the staff nurses doctors etc.  My management was nice.  I learned that I liked the administration sides of Healthcare. I would say that the most enjoyable part of the job are the patients.  The hardest part of the job is when we are under staff.Great place to work some, had a great director and some co-workers where great. I think Swedish needs to work on their advancement for those who have the skills and drive to move up form the bottom.A typical Day at work was mostly customer service related (unlocking doors/offices, giving directions)Learned about Lenel & OnGuard Security Systems.The hardest part about the job was when staff or management was second guessing my decisions. It seemed to happen too often.The best part about the job was being able to help people.A typical day was working on a team of 4 to 5 IV nurses covering 600+ inpatient beds as well as outpatient areas. Responsibilities included starting peripheral IV's including ultrasound guided peripheral IV placement. Accessing and de-accessing port-a-caths, daily monitoring of all central lines and central line dressing changes. I learned many skills as part of the Swedish vascular access team including PICC placement, ultrasounds guided peripheral IV placement and intraosseous device placement.Pretty good place to work, we have good team work on our floor but I can't say the same for other floors I have floated to. Staffing can be an issue and then management tries to over fill our floor so each nurse has 6-7 patients.Co-workers were amazing. I enjoyed the patient access department and the overall culture. Work was easy going, the doctors were amazing and fun to work with.1:6 ratios. That not all work environments serve all people. Did not communicate well with staff. If you were not liked by the powers that be they would get the worst assignments disappear from the floor and constantly debase you. Staying at the facility passed my 90 day probation was the hardest part of my job. Finding another job and leaving was the most enjoyable part of my job.I enjoyed working here because of how busy it was day to day, it kept me in shape and occupied. everyone was respectful and hard working. Most days were the same and consistent. It was nice seeing patients with familiar faces who always looked happy. Working here was my favorite job, I only left because I moved out of town."
652,SyApps,"Very Professional and a caring place to work at,Everyone had been really good at what they do."
282,Symantec Corporation,"good place. it was fun, good people. anymore than that, we can discuss in person.I am currently employed at Symantec.  They have acquired Blue Coat and most recently Life Lock.   I enjoy the people and time at Symantec.    Their is an onsite cafeteria serving gourmet/healthy food.All of the pro's and con's of high tech, but better than most.  Company has undergone a lot of change in past few years.  Expect more, given state of industry.Had great camaraderie with coworkers and people reporting to me.  We pushed each other to try the impossible, to ask the ""what if..."" questions, to expand our knowledge.Working with Symantec was a great experience. The team environment was very supportive and encouraging. I had the best years of my career at Symantec.Symantec has been great with accommodations that I needed.What I learned during my 20 years:- Security practices- Tracking suspicious computer/network behaviors- Watching for individual/personal behaviors to watch out for abuse of network/corporate resources.- Backup & Server availability.great place to work for unfortunately my department was outsourced to Pune India,The people or coworkers were all team players and always helped out  to get the job done.benefits all were goood ones.Too many chiefs in this place and they all have their own agendas. The minions are great and a lot work towards growth which a lot of their bosses support which is a great thing but a lot also prevent this from happening.I learned I don't like sales. But the inside sales organization was fun. The people are mostly fun. They tend to change the pay structure a little too much.Great company really learned a lot working in a team collaboration was wonderful experience if i get chance work again Good place to learning new technologies	Information Technology analyst with over 7+ years of experience implementing, configuring, analyzing, customizing, maintaining and administering ERP software systems.While my experience at Symantec was overall positive, some of the management will throw you to the wolves to produce good numbers while ignoring your skills.  Workers are viewed--beyond what is acceptable--as expendable.  Training is minimal.  No effort is made to mine your talents.That aside, the camaraderie is collaborative, and the culture allows one to add significantly to one's skillset.It is a good company to work for, very amazing experience. I enjoyed my work experience in here with my collegues. Enjoyed most of my workSymantec currently rates very low job security wise. The Symantec -Veritas split and acquisition of Blue Coat have made things volatile and chaoticThe management themselves are confused about what's happening and this does have a baneful impact on the employees. The chaos has holistically impacted the full timers and contractors and many are being laid offGood Company, undergoing transformation. Good times ahead with new acquisitions and investment partners joining in.Chilled out work culture with good work / life balance.Compensation is not great though.Not highly recommended for career enhancement.If you are not working for the latest company that they have acquired, watch your back.  Your job is headed to the cheapest place they can outsource it to.Veritas was purchased by Symantec. The majority of my employment was during the Veritas years. There was plenty of opportunity for overtime. As a matter of fact, it was required. I learned much during my employment here.Now that the Symantec/Veritas experiment is over, it will be interesting to see if the stand alone Veritas can return to former greatness.  Will need to adapt better to the cloud.Great place to work.  It is unfortunate that the Veritas Springfield site was chosen for a shut down after the split from Symantec.  I loved my job and the people I worked with.The company was great to work for.  They were extremely flexible with work from home options. They took great care of their employees."
365,Synchrony Financial,"Everyone willing to help, no matter their ""rank"" they want to help if possible.The hardest part of the job is keeping a cool head when you have been yelled at all day by upset customers, but the great people help you defuse as often as you need.The onsite cafeteria & gym help with that too.This company provides excellent work enviroment, family felling.  Great benefits. A typical day at work is mainly answering calls and helping customers with their accounts, taking payments, verifying charges, opening disputes.It is a senior design. Our goal is to build a security system in order to let the users using their finger print to open the cabinet.And I am responsible for coding the program for hardware like Wi-Fi, camera and physical locker. I connected the hardware with Raspberry PI that is a series of credit card-sized single-board computers by using python library.This is a happy, clean and environment. Ongoing training, open door policy, great benefits, Lean something new each day. I love this job, this company and where I worked.I love working at Synchrony. From management to coworkers to VP of Operations everyone is amazing. I worked in the Phoenix location.Fun, cool and laid back environment as long as you do your work. Callers can be ignoring and a hand full just keep your calm and meet the metrics. Call out policy and days off are ok. Each department get different holidyas off.all ready wrote review. i said it was a great company highly favored by most people who work here very uplifting enviorment really cares about employeesI will take escalated calls and help consumers with their financial issues.  Also, help debt collectors with procedures and training.  It is a great place to work with multi opportunities to move forward.Its a good place to get your foot in the door. they promote within and provide amazing benefits. Depending on the department they can be flexible.  The pay should be higher  is one of the only issues.I was working as a contractor in synchrony financial. I have found this workplace good for the employees and contractors also.A typical day of work will start with meetings. During my tenure i learned a lot from my projects. The hardest part of the job i will say meeting the timelines.Lack of communication, managers are very secretive and misleading. No one knows what is going on, lack of priorities. Overall terrible experience.Synchrony Financial is more than just a call center. It is a place where one can start a career. I love  that everyone all the way up the the CEO was once a call center representative. This company hires within which is amazing. If you are wanting to do more they provide you with the opportunities and encouragement to do so.Synchrony Financial is a great company to work for, it is a friendly environment and great working conditions.  The company is always helping out in the community making it great for volunteer work as well.Good place to work if exempt. However, advancement chances are slim unless you're well connected with the site leader. Good office atmosphere and friendly coworkers are a plus!Work work work work and meet your numbers if not you will be wrote up. It used to have great benefits but since it changed hands they are slowly taking away benefits.Lousy place to work. A lot of code learning in a short amount of time spread over multiple platforms in comparison to embarrassing low pay. Absolutely ridiculous!!! Older people or those with disabilities treated badly!Its been about an year since I started working for Synchrony Financial. I feel myself lucky for getting an opportunity to work in this  company.From the top down everyone loves their job there and it trickles down to the bottom and really makes a difference to work in a place like that.  More companies need to adopt their culture.  Being a part time work at home rep we still feel included in every way.If you can get in with Synchrony, there is plenty of room for advancement. It is a challenging environment, but you don't feel overworked. Great benefits and wonderful culture.Discovery Place is an amazing place to work there's so much to learn and see from animals, to rainforest, and science explosions. This place is so ideal for children who love science.Excellent benefits and rate of pay.Plenty of vacation and personal/sick days.Management excels at communicating with staffExcellent training program and changes are communicated effectively"
639,"Syntelligent Analytic Solutions, LLC",Love working for syntelligent.  The company is a small business and  the owner and CEO is one of the best in the industry. Flexible schedule and good benefits.
748,SYSCO,"Great culture for advancement.  Management offers lots of support, tons of training and terrific mentoring program program.inconsistant hours. highly stressful.as an order selector, had to maintain high level of speed of processing orders.as an forklift operator more comfortableA good place to work. Good pay. Great work environment. Great work hours. Good management. Great co-workers. Hardest part of job is some of the places you have to deliver. Most enjoyable part is the pay.Month-end is busy and can be stressful.   Sysco does offer growth personally and professionally, to contribute to the success of a dynamic organization.great company to work for. they take care of their employees, they appreciate hard work and compensate you for it. I worked in the warehouse and it is very clean and organized.they have excellent benefits and plenty of opportunity to move around within the company. they have plenty of perks and extras you can get with just a little bit of extra effort , theres always free stuff being handed out, the people are cool  It really is a good one to work for unfortunately I found it while I was in the back stretch of getting my welding certificates so I decided against staying but I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get into warehousing.There was very little communication, hardly any credible organization of the tasks at hand and most of the drivers were ignorant idiots.I was a night picker, got paid decent money, but was required to work long hours. if you are young and maybe not sure what you want to do in life this might be a good job for youWas a temp for 2 months.  Was trained for 1 day. Busted my butt for the time I was there.  Worked 10 hour days.  The first two weeks were great.  Co-Workers super friendly then week three hit and the cattyness began.  Micro managed by fellow employee who was not a supervisor.  They stood over me while waiting for me to finish my tasks.  Would go through my desk and just take stuff without letting me know or leaving a note so I wasted time looking for work that I thought I had misplaced.  Was ultimately let go do to not completing a function of my job that I was never trained on.It's hard work but you make real good money as long as you don't mind working for it. You get home most the time unless they stick u on a over night. So if you have young kids you want be with them every night.not possible to balance work life.     Great potential to much is asked fwith a poor manager to lead.   my experince with the company is poor but due to my manager and not the over all companyYou will make lots of money as a driver for sysco working 50-60 hours a week 12-14 hours a day. It is extremely hard and stressful so you will need thick skin to succeed. It can be done but its certainly not for everyone.Terrible place to work,15 yrs and got absolutely no respect.Nothing but a pack mule.Brown nose management did not stand behind drivers,did not properly maintain equipment,constantly cutting pay,hours,benefits while expecting more and more from drivers everyday.This place will destroy your body because of the amount of unnecessary work you have to do because of the totally fouled up way they do things.Do yourself a favor and RUN as fast as you can away from this company!Good old boys club, It's all about who you are in bed with. Sysco's size is a blessing and a curse. Large broker community at your finger tip, however products are price above market which ca be problematic in competitive situationReally one of the worst places i have every worked in my career.  The management is not strong and caters to larger pieces of business, and does appear to care about the small business owner in the industry.Working Mon-Friday      Monday & Thursday pulling doubles & delivered to West Virginia   Tuesday Paducah & Tennessee & Illinois Area than Friday in Lexington KyI didn't care for this job because of the stress that it puts on a person!My co workers weren't happy do to the job demand!Which I felt made my job harder! I enjoy hard work but the people I'm surrounded. by need to be happy !!!Great people to work with and for. Customers are great and I enjoy interacting with them every day. They all bring light in to the day. Long running company that is well liked by allExcellent environment to foster strong teamwork and support of the overall goals. Quick to adopt new ideas in an ever-changing landscape of customer needs. I very much enjoy working with the organization and its ability to deliver .Long hours interfere with personal life. It will distance you from your family and friends. But you will have an opportunity to make a lot of money if you don't over work yourself.A great place to work while you are in school, or a second job.  Has a great work life balance, works around school schedules.Every house will vary in regards to loads, routes, treatment of drivers.  Work is physical and requires patience when dealing with customers and with the load itself."
550,System One,"It's nice to be able to go in when you want as long as the work is done before the next business day.  Flexability as well as able to pick up extra buildings is always available.Sys1 will place you at a customer site and you will be trained for that customers needs. Sys1 will bill the customer and pay you as their employee. You wont have any benefits as a contracting employee. Your co-workers will mostly be the customers but you may be placed with other SYS1 employees.I personally have trained half a dozen Techs for sys1 at my current customers location and the hard part for me is I make as much as my co-system1 workers make.I personally enjoy the people I work with both customer and sys1 but you have to remember they are the customer and not a friendly face.Fun work place, Good communication, Great learning skills, and awesome teamwork. Good starting pay, better pay once you're rolled over. At times it could be a lot of layoffs due to the lines breaking down in the warehouse. Once you start working good its guaranteed to work 40hrs and over with overtime pay.Management structure seems very disorganized. ""Too many Chiefs and not enough Indians"". Very hard to get in touch with immediate supervisor. They don't want to spend the money for quality equipment/tools. Work trucks onsite were over 10 years old and in very poor condition. Work/Life balance is WAY OFF-balance!!!.  You go to work before the sun comes up, and you usually do not get home until around 6:30pm. So, you can never get your personal business done before 5pm.....which usually requires you to take off work early to get any personal business done. I was contract only, so absolutely NO benefits whatsoever. Hourly and overtime only. THAT'S IT. No per diem. No medical. No dental. No vision. No 401K. NOTHING. Upper management never seemed to know what was going on.We worked long hard days, but I loved every minute of it.  You spent weeks on the road, but the job was very rewarding.  Working in the alternative energy field is something everyone can't say they have done and I have.Great company to work for. A typical day is recruiting coordinating and sourcing.The most enjoyable part is leaving the office on a daily basis knowing that I met my deadlines.Very accommodating. Top notch staff and co-workers. Occasional travel. Get to work independently during most travel. Great job for motivated, self-starter type of people.The bought out the company I was working for so I did not work for them long enough to give a good review. The did offer a benefits package but I did not need it because I already had insurance. I did not have much interaction with the company. Everything from my previous employer's contract stayed the same when they took ownership.System One has been a very good place to work because what I most needed was flexibility.  I returned to work after being a stay-at-home parent and still needed to be available to my young children.  they offered the flexibility I needed at a competitive salary.  I have worked for them for over 13 years.  The Management was always available if I needed any assistance.Salary comparableexcellent benefitsEmployees are excellentManagement excellentthe hardest for me is climbinggoing to the same place dailyEveryday we have a team meeting letting us know about daily safety and about things that go on though out the shifts. Team leaders are very good about giving us information about the line we are working on. I've learned from hand packing, stacking boxes onto a pallet, use of jacks/power jacks, doing rework, and numerous of different inspections of candy bar. Everybody is very friendly and like to help you learn the job you need to do that day. Hardest part would be the overtime but you accept that when taking the job. The people make the job easier making the day go by faster.Everyday was different.Moved to different building every other day.Worked around machines.Had a awesome Crew leader/Superiors!I love cleaning so that was a plus.Got a lot of walking in.Had a great staff of employees.Pulling over 1,000 pounds up hill on a manual forklift was challenging    Lots of tasks to do everyday.they would have to you work long ours 7 days straight with out a day off or asking. would not switch people around to learn anything productive. as for doing different duties.Thorough and always communicative.  Enjoyed my time with this company and would be willing to work again for them. Each person I spoke with was professional and responded timely.good co workers and great system of operations made it a good working environment but if problems occurred and you fell behind you got moved along and had to try to catch up and if other crews fell behind you also did on account of waiting.......went out of businessco-workers for good to work with. very enjoyable job.Project was very interesting to work on. learned a lot about nucleur power plants from Westinghouse employeesThey are small group of very talented people who work very well together.  They work on a broad range of pharmaceutical test equipment for some rather big clients.  A typical day of work was divided between service, calibration and validation and I normally worked independent.  l enjoyed doing what I was assigned to do.  The hard part was the extensive commuting back and forth to the different sites I worked on.i loved the job it was just to far away for me and my ride to get up and be there on time the people where really nice and great i just couldn't take then ride to and from thereFrom my experience it was a better than average temporary or contract company and would work for them in the future. It was a contract company based in Pittsburgh, PA and the location I was assigned to was in Shoreview, MN, being it was a contract company advancement was not available and little to no benefits were reasonable.Only worked one job with system one and it was ok. I contracted through westinghouse to work at power plants. The hours were long but OT was paid so it all worked out in the endManagement was not in control of issues that arose between shifts and assembly issues. Broken tools to work with. Really No wonder I would not qualify."
520,T. Rowe Price,"Excellent company to work for, learn, and have work life balance. Depending on career interest T. Rowe has many paths to travel. management is open and helpful.Best company I have worked for!  Great work environment, co-workers, management team, and numerous opportunities for continuous learning, training, and education.  Solid work/life balance as long as you were efficient and a good time manager.  Easy to move up if you network appropriately.Advancement is more time driven than merit driven - regardless of your skill set, you will not be considered for a promotion until X months/years in your current role.Work life balance was solid with relatively flexible hours and a decent company culture.There is a lack of accountability though, so employees are able to skate by without any risk of punishment.Great benefits, and an awesome atmosphere. The management and compensation are lacking, and not up to par with other companies in the financial industry.There could be more vision in terms of their strategic technology plan, but overall the firm is a good place to work.  They have good benefits packages, and for the most part are good about work/life balance.Great company to work for with advancement opportunities and generous benefits. It can be challenging in the beginning to understand the IT infrastructure and to establish yourself. But the coworkers are very helpful.Prosgreat non-monetary benefits, easy company mobility, excellent work-life balance, and really nice people. overall, a really solid company to work for.Consin order to move past a certain level, you definitely need a solid education background or significant professional experience. hard to break through into the trading environment, similar to many competitorsAdvice to Managementtake smaller bonuses and reward employees at the bottom making less than 50k a year. no reason someone should be making $10 million a year when others at the same company are just trying to stay afloatManagement is okay and stay off your back if you do what you are supposed to. Easy to slip through the cracks if you don't lobby for yourself. Management path is the best way to advance in other areas of the company- nearly impossible to get a promotion out of operations unless you are on the management track.My days here are really enjoyable. I really like the people and the atmosphere. Work/Life balance is really important to the management.T. Rowe Price is an excellent company to grow and develop your skill and knowledge in the investment world. I highly recommend anyone who wants to start somewhere in the investment world to apply for T. Rowe. However, the company has a lot of catching up to do with industry standards and trends.great company to work for. Really good benefits including large 401k contributions. Just have to be able to deal with many different projects and responsibilities at one time. Opportunities are there, you just have to go after and get them.Good place to work but very little communication through teams. There is little to no communication between teams working on the same project. There is even less communication between management to the teams.Company taught me a lot about corp culture - great place to . I learned alot about how a company can teach you about life. Nothing in life comes easy... you must put in the work to achieve your dreams.T. Rowe Price is an absolutely great place to work.  Employees are very friendly.  Fringe benefits are very good.  Leader was great.  Very helpful.I like the job. Not a fan of doing the same thing everyday but if you don't mind talking on the phone to customers, and looking at computer screen while on a recorded line to ensure compliance then this job is nice. Not much room for growth though until you get your series 7. You get two 15 minute breaks a day and an hour lunch.It was nice working with T Rowe Price. Warm Culture. Co workers were very helpful specially Manager. Though there is still some discrimination between contractors and Full Time but I didn't have to face this in my team. Team was supportive and helpful.Good and stable company to grow your career in Finance domain. Nice work environment and people to work with.It was very corporate and quiet. Every weekend there was work and never had a day off. Management was never seenThey have a fitness center at both locations, Owings Mills and Baltimore.  There are two in Owings Mills, one brand new. The management at T. Rowe is great. There is room for growth and a lot of wonderful opportunities to advance.From my perspective, it seemed the only avenue to promotion into leadership was to be a part of the crony crew. Most members of general management were very close friends, in some cases connections dating back to High School. Promotions seemed to be honored based on friendships and not previous professional experience or true talent.  Friendships and being a part of crony club should not be a compelling reason to promote an individual. These high school antics have contributed to my decision to seek employment in a professional environment, where promotions are based on merit and not likeability or one's ability to mesh with a homogenous group.There is also no life/work balance with mandatory overtime. 8 hours is plenty of life to contribute to work. Family and health is more important. If you are not a crony, you will not experience organizational agility anyway.I worked for a group of writers who were a very interesting.  I met some great friends there, and learned a bit about stocks.  I made travel arrangements for the writers, kept vacation requests, etc.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the fact that everyone got along."
218,Takeda Pharmaceutical,"I have worked for Millennium/Takeda for 5 years now and I have grown so much within the the commercial side of the field.  My typical day is requires following up on action items, communicating to CMO of status updates and upcoming activities, as well as addressing any documentation excursion or revisionThe job was fantastic in that the company gave me all the resources needed to educated physicians.  This made the job more enjoyable and opened a ton of options to be successful.Management and coworkers are dedicated to excellence.Very challenging timelines make work-life balance a constant struggle.The best part of this job is knowing that the world will be just a little bit better for the work that this company does.It's a great place to work with bad management.the money is good but there's no use in the money when your never out of work only long enough to sleep. They also go through new people all of the time because schedules are sometimes not good. You can't have a life and work this job it's not possible.I would start the week by looking at my schedule which would tell my what materials I will be testing for the week and any other responsibilities to be carried e.g. water sampling, monitoring stock levels, waste runs. I would then get any paper work I would need issuing by a senior analyst and print of  any specifications which will be need on the day of testing. I would carry out the tests required in the most efficient timing which allows me to maximise my work day to the most. As this was my first job from graduating I have learned so much from the experience of what its like to work in a industry setting and the time lines which need to be met. I got along with everyone in my work place, the management were so understanding and very easy to approach with any problems, as well with my co-workers they would help me with any queries I had especially when I first started.The hardest part of the job was in my first few months of employment and it was referring to the pharmacopoeias as I was not familiar using them, but as time went on I became comfortable using them. The most enjoyable part of my job was the challenge of performing new more difficult techniques and tests that I had not had the opportunity to perform yet.Good work colleagues. Good management in Germany and Japan.However its sad that your production is remotely controlled from Singapore. One time a mistake was made, then later in Sept this year an old Chinese witch from our Singapore office came to our office and gossiping rude things behind our backs and lecturing some of us in the office and cafeteria - making us Germans sound like we are incompetent! All because a colleague was tired and made one mistake.. like they never make mistakes themselves! Very poor morale.A typical work day consist of traveling to 10-12 accounts and engaging with doctors about different disease states such as Gout, Diabetes and Constipation. Most day I provide breakfast and lunches to offices to build rapport with office staff and doctors.The company is undergoing huge change with new US Commercial President and newer CEO.  The culture is no longer one of honesty, integrity, and fairness like its Company Values profess.  Every year I was employeed with Takeda, we had a change in organizational structure and potential layoff. In addition to the organizational flux, management in some departments are poor leaders, promoted because they 'get the job done' but with little regard or support for their team that has worked hard to contribute to their success.  I would caution anyone looking for a stable company with fair and impartial leadership to pursue Takeda at this time in their career.	Developed detailed programs with NPLs that cover planning, initiation, execution, monitoring, and close out phases.	Use MS Project and other programs to outline specifics for program milestones, requirements, payment schedules, subcontracts definition, technical work description, staffing, integrated master schedules, and budgets 	Worked as a liaison to build coalitions among the various stakeholders and negotiated authority to move the project forward to meet the timelines	Monitoring program performance (technical, cost and schedule) through direct interaction with NPLs is a weekly routine.My co-workers were great and I had a great time with them.

This includes weekly field rides with my team where we review numbers, business strategies and developmental plans.  My style is as a partner who expects a lot, but never asks anyone to do anything I would not do myself.  The hardest part of the job is just being able to have a good work life balance.  Best part is seeing people develop and get promoted into future leaders of the companyDevelop and train 11 sales reps on a daily basis while managing a specific geography and all the products in that area. Develop business plans to hit company goals with the purpose of developing future leaders of TakedaTakeda offers some great benefits to its full-time employees, however, like most positions, if you are a contractor, they pile on the work with no real benefits.Many organization changes are currently underway. Great part of the company is that there are 1/2 day fridays to ensure work life balance.Great Company! Good Benefits and Employees. Good work life balance and overall place to work. Need more companies like this in the Lake County area.Great place to work. Great employees and great managers. Managers are real world. Takeda give responsibility and accountability at the local level, which allow individuals to determine their strategic approach.There is a great environment among the workers, act like a family all together.

214,Takeda Pharmaceuticals North America,"I have worked for Millennium/Takeda for 5 years now and I have grown so much within the the commercial side of the field.  My typical day is requires following up on action items, communicating to CMO of status updates and upcoming activities, as well as addressing any documentation excursion or revisionManagement and coworkers are dedicated to excellence.Very challenging timelines make work-life balance a constant struggle.The best part of this job is knowing that the world will be just a little bit better for the work that this company does.Good work colleagues. Good management in Germany and Japan.However its sad that your production is remotely controlled from Singapore. One time a mistake was made, then later in Sept this year an old Chinese witch from our Singapore office came to our office and gossiping rude things behind our backs and lecturing some of us in the office and cafeteria - making us Germans sound like we are incompetent! All because a colleague was tired and made one mistake.. like they never make mistakes themselves! Very poor morale.It's a great place to work with bad management.the money is good but there's no use in the money when your never out of work only long enough to sleep. They also go through new people all of the time because schedules are sometimes not good. You can't have a life and work this job it's not possible.The company is undergoing huge change with new US Commercial President and newer CEO.  The culture is no longer one of honesty, integrity, and fairness like its Company Values profess.  Every year I was employeed with Takeda, we had a change in organizational structure and potential layoff. In addition to the organizational flux, management in some departments are poor leaders, promoted because they 'get the job done' but with little regard or support for their team that has worked hard to contribute to their success.  I would caution anyone looking for a stable company with fair and impartial leadership to pursue Takeda at this time in their career.A typical work day consist of traveling to 10-12 accounts and engaging with doctors about different disease states such as Gout, Diabetes and Constipation. Most day I provide breakfast and lunches to offices to build rapport with office staff and doctors.	Developed detailed programs with NPLs that cover planning, initiation, execution, monitoring, and close out phases.	Use MS Project and other programs to outline specifics for program milestones, requirements, payment schedules, subcontracts definition, technical work description, staffing, integrated master schedules, and budgets 	Worked as a liaison to build coalitions among the various stakeholders and negotiated authority to move the project forward to meet the timelines	Monitoring program performance (technical, cost and schedule) through direct interaction with NPLs is a weekly routine.I was happy to dive into this position and learn.It was a great educational experience and can take this anywhere!•	Transcribe all recorded medical, educational, and legal audio and video-recorded material including medical meetings, operative reports, patient histories and examinations, discharges, x-ray reports, progress reports, legal and educational sessions.•	Thorough knowledge of medical, legal, and educational transcription guidelines and practices.•	Extensive medical and legal terminology knowledge.•	Ability to understand diverse dialects and accounts.•	Excellent communication skills necessary to perform all essential job functions.The job was fantastic in that the company gave me all the resources needed to educated physicians.  This made the job more enjoyable and opened a ton of options to be successful.Hire, develop and train 11 sales representatives to be able to effectively sell our products to their physicians.  This includes weekly field rides with my team where we review numbers, business strategies and developmental plans.  My style is as a partner who expects a lot, but never asks anyone to do anything I would not do myself.  The hardest part of the job is just being able to have a good work life balance.  Best part is seeing people develop and get promoted into future leaders of the companyDevelop and train 11 sales reps on a daily basis while managing a specific geography and all the products in that area.

Spearheaded the creation of a multicultural team to address the disparities of the African American community in the Multiple Myeloma therapeutic area. Brought in the Dream Foundation to create Dreams for Multiple Myeloma Patients to promote Dreams for adults with Multiple Myeloma.Great place to work. Great employees and great managers. Managers are real world. Takeda give responsibility and accountability at the local level, which allow individuals to determine their strategic approach.There is a great environment among the workers, act like a family all together. There was a management change(head change), which the workers were not really happy about with the new management system.Takeda offers some great benefits to its full-time employees, however, like most positions, if you are a contractor, they pile on the work with no real benefits.I owe this organization much gratitude for giving me the opportunity to work with a great sales force, develop much of my skill set over a long period of time and allowing me the appropriate education needed for continued work in the medical industry.My co-workers were great and I had a great time with them. But their human management was bad. They don't care about employees advancement.Many organization changes are currently underway. Great part of the company is that there are 1/2 day fridays to ensure work life balance.Great Company! Good Benefits and Employees. Good work life balance and overall place to work. Need more companies like this in the Lake County area.I would start the week by looking at my schedule which would tell my what materials I will be testing for the week and any other responsibilities to be carried e.g. water sampling, monitoring stock levels, waste runs. I would then get any paper work I would need issuing by a senior analyst and print of  any specifications which will be need on the day of testing. I would carry out the tests required in the most efficient timing which allows me to maximise my work day to the most. As this was my first job from graduating I have learned so much from the experience of what its like to work in a industry setting and the time lines which need to be met. I got along with everyone in my work place, the management were so understanding and very easy to approach with any problems, as well with my co-workers they would help me with any queries I had especially when I first started.The hardest part of the job was in my first few months of employment and it was referring to the pharmacopoeias as I was not familiar using them, but as time went on I became comfortable using them. The most enjoyable part of my job was the challenge of performing new more difficult techniques and tests that I had not had the opportunity to perform yet.I worked with contracts, and adverse events.I worked with some amazing hardworking coworkers.really enjoyed my time working as a Temp with Takeda."
552,"Talascend, LLC","I enjoy the independent work because I do not report to anyone. I am my own boss. The Resident Quality engineer is a bit of a trumped up position. It's more of a liaison type of position at the Ford assembly plant dealing with quality spills, interacting with the incoming quality personnel and the operators on the assembly line is very interesting work, although stressful at times, I enjoy the work.I work approx 12 hours per day IN the office. I take care of all global offices and must be available at all times, so always attached to my cell phone and my laptop to take care of their needs. I travel extensively to work with the companies largest client and assess where improvements can be made and work with the recruiting teams to ensure these practices are put into place. I love the people I work with and I love working with my customers and making a positive impact. I do not currently have a retirement in place - as it is not offered and have not had a pay rate increase in several years. Benefits keep rising and the coverage keeps declining, as we are a small company and not many people take out the insurance. Stinks when you are single!!Contract position with a large manufacturer working in HR. Worked directly for HR manager handling FMLA and Worker's Compensation. Co-workers were very pleasant and helpful. Great experience to be working with a much larger group than I have in the past. I thoroughly enjoyed the pace which was constantly busy. Was also allowed to focus primarily on two aspects of HR instead of being spread across the board as I have been in the past. This was positive experience as well.Talascend is a recruiting company and I was contracted into an engineering firm. When I was laid off Talascend did very little to try to place me again. I was not very satisfied with that.They gave me a very low rate going in because I had been out of the workforce for 19 months due to the economy and downsizing of GM.It was difficult to negotiate even the 50 cents extra that I received.I enjoy this work assignment. Great hours (4/10's), good pay."

22,Tapjoy,"I am on contract so my experience is not from a full time perspective.From what I have experienced, there are very capable and proven leaders who are ambitious to make Tapjoy a premium company and a leader in their industry.I believe Tapjoy is postured for a very big 2014.Tapjoy is an outstanding place to work. From day one, everything was hands on. Each sales rep would do all of their own lead generation, outbound sales calls, sales closing, and account management. The work environment was fun and energetic, an open floor with immediate access to management. Everyone was collaborative and encouraging, I could not have asked for a better work environment to learn sales.I manage Platform team and Partner Integration teams. My daily task includes the following1. Provide technical direction to teams2. Triage issues3. Work with Product team on the next generation products4. Work with Jira on the product backlog5. 1:1 with team members and peers6. Work with Business teams to understand the pain points and growth in business7. Participate in customer calls.8. Mentorship and coaching team membersPro: For the most part Tapjoy is comprised of some fantastic and smart people. Honestly, this is likely the only reason why many are still working here. There is also some ridiculous work-life balance here.Con: The smart and fantastic people are shoved into the corner, while the incompetent lead. Terrible organizational communication. Product vision is borderline terrible. Frankly, if it weren't for my peers this place would probably rank as one of the worst places to work.I learned a great deal watching this small startup flourish from under 100 employees to close to 300 employees."
297,TARGET,"This helped me pay for my college and it was nice working there. Woulnd not go again and would prefer more on time managers.Hired out of college to be an ETL (assistant store manager). Very intense training, and information overload for 6 weeks. Expected to perform and manage every single day. Weekends, holidays, overnight, early morning shifts are all fair game. Expected to work on average 50 hours/ week (but it's a salaries position so you will probably work more). Promoting is difficult. It's highly political so superior relationships with those above your boss are a necessity. It's a great position for someone looking for a lot of on hand management experience. However, it's retail, it's a lot of managing damage control, cleaning up after others (call-ins, actual mess on the sales floor). Not very rewarding.Almost everyone in management are unfair and show no respect to employees. Advancement comes only by how much management likes you. It's not based on your work or experience. There is a lot of he say she say at the Rock Hill store and others will believe it whether it's based on fact or opinion. It used to be a fun place to work and almost everyone got along but with the new management people only seem to be looking out for themselves and turning on each other just to get ahead. It's sad.I was a cashier for a year and a half and it wasn't bad. The minimum wage was $8 an hr when I was hired but it had been raised to $10 before I quit earlier this year.The hardest part of the job was selling the Target RedCard to customers and it was pretty much the only way to get recognized as a cashier. Benefits are good, and they include holiday pay and (I think) insurance. The reason I quit was because there weren't any opportunities for me to change positions the entire time I worked there and it felt like everyone else was moving up except me. Management was okay but not the absolute best. The best part was working with the customers. If I went beyond their expectations, they voiced it and it would make me feel great.Target is a very decent place to work. They offer a very reasonable wage and have decent benefits like health insurance and 401K. The work is very physical and it be overwhelming at first but eventually you acclimate and get into a rhythm. The shifts are divided into either 10 or 12 hour days with 2 paid breaks. The people are generally easy to get a long with and many of the on shift supervisors are good with communication and helping resolve yours and the business needs. One downside is during the busy seasons they usually force mandatory overtime, meaning you will have to work an additional day or sometime two days, and it can stretch on for weeks or even months at a time.target is literally one of my favorite stores so when i got the job opportunity i was thrilled. The team members i worked with were very nice and friendly and it seemed like this was going to be a great experience up until a couple months ago when i started to realize that the retail world is full of lazy and drama filled people. the management treats the workers as if they are slaves and demand things that they can handle on their own, Also when problems are brought to hr confidentially they are shared amongst other people within the building which is pretty crazy because if you don't even feel comfortable going to hr then thats a problem within itself. The raises are a pretty good amount when they come around but it makes you wonder if its worth it when the management isn't up to par.A typical day at work involves interacting with a multitude of guest personalities.  Assisting people with problem solving has been mostly enjoyable, sometimes not.  Management seems more interested in reaching corporate goals than in the individual workers. My co-workers are mostly fun, energetic, reliable and helpful.  The hardest part of the job is reaching goals of signing guests up for Target RedCards.  It seems like an intrusion to most people.  The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing I have saved people the most money possible through coupons, apps, sale ads, etc.  If they are also using one of Target's cards, that's bonus savings.I loved my job! I was a senior team leader, but because I didn't have a degree I couldn't advance to the next position, even though I had been ther for 15yrs and had done everything in that store. The pay was great, the benefits were great, the management in the last 3 yrs was awful! No compassion for their team members. No loyalty just numbers! This Target in particular lost what it meant to take care of your team. Their purpose as a company was just the bottom dollar. I wish I could have advanced in the company but it just wasn't meant to be.the work was good, worked well with other flow team members.  Team leads came and went on a regular basis.  Upper management did not communicate with all ream members, especially the night crew.  When new team leaders came in they were not notified that I have some medical limitations such as the inability to climb ladders, carry more than 50 lbs, can not stand still long periods of time, and have difficulty working more than 32 hours a week.  This is due to an injury to my right leg and knee, including insertion of titanium rods.  This caused friction and an even more hostile environment when I reminded them of my limitations.The motto at my store was always fun, fast, and friendly service, and the majority of the management and staff seemed to follow suite. Despite having large tasks and very busy and stressful days, the management and team always seemed to keep things to a realistic level, understanding that everyone was working hard and continually trying to lift our spirits. It was a much different feeling than other retailers I've worked at, where the management would usually just callously list goals and be unhappy when/if those goals weren't met. People are more than just efficiency machines at Target, they're people again.This was my first ever job. It was interesting learning new things. But management is corrupt. While I worked hard to earn my place other people were being recognized because they were friends. Everyone else got an amazing raise while I got a penny as a raise. You must think I didn't do my job well to earn a raise. I beg to differ. Lets just say if you aren't best friends with management or agree to kiss... you know where I am trying to get. You wont be able to move up in the company. Which is unfortunate since I do love the company and what it stands for. Corporate needs to take a look at who they hire as their management.This was a great place to work. I was a cashier, and I loved the work environment. The team leaders are so nice and I became very close with the people I worked with. And the company treated us well too. There was a break room with food available a few days a week. Schedule is flexible also, I worked approximately 30 hours while attending college. Pay is ok, I believe that the minimum cashier wage was raised but I could be wrong. The hardest part of the job was obviously dealing with the occasionally unreasonable customer, and there were times when the computers would glitch, but that all comes with any job. The best part was the sense of family and support among the team members and management. I would recommend this job for anyone, whether you want a part time job or a career there is opportunity for advancement and the hours are flexible!i specialize in planograms signing and packing out  freight i enjoy it makes the day go quick. i get along very well with my coworkers we are one team one dream we help each other .management there are very rewarding people that recognize you often for your accomplishments and are willing to help you develop to become the very best at your goals.the hardest part of the job is when the hours get cut mine typically do not i am a presentation team member and play very important roll on the salesfloorI dont know if is my store. But there's zero recognition from management. There's no advancement besides getting cross trained. We work hard and get expire food as compensation for our work. Again, may be my just my Target. Good friendships.Work starts at 22:00 and finishes when the work is done. Usually heavy workloads pulling items from backroom onto sales floor. After pulls are complete we either help flow team stock store or stay in the backroom back stocking product. I learned to move with a sense of urgency while staying accurate and organized. Management likes to micro manage but seems necessary for certain individuals. Hardest part of job is being on your feet constantly moving all day and trying not to be overwhelmed by the workload. Most enjoyable is being apart of a team.Horrible culture at West Jefferson DC. I had 30+ managers, 10+ Senior Managers and 5+ General Managers in 12 years. The compensation is good and makes you feel like you are trapped there. They used to have a good core team, but have run most off and replaced a lot of people with temps. Revolving door for employees. At one point I knew almost everyone that worked there, but only knew about 15% when I departed. There is not an attendance policy, OM can give you corrective action for missing 3 or 4 days in a year and do nothing to someone who misses 3 or 4 days per month. You only receive 1 15 minute break and a 25 minute lunch for a 10 hr shift. You are not allowed to leave the premises, and have to get special permission to even go to your car. You have to accrue vacation time weekly, but if you leave or get fired you lose it, even though you earned it. Just be prepared to work like a dog for 10 or 12 hours per day.Was expected to be perfect and never make a mistake.  0 support from managers.My career at target started out fantastic, I was given support from all of my coworkers and the management, but the longer I was there the support fell, they put a lot of pressure on two people, and I am in college so when I put in the days that I could not work my hours were dropped way below what i was expecting, they only put me on with minimum shifts. Almost trying to get me to leave. Well they won that battle I am actively looking for a new job. I would not recommend working for target unless you are willing to devote your life to target.A typical day at work will include work center management, performance management for part time staff, and full time management staff. I've learned how to operate a very complex work center that focuses on driving results. Management staff is very talented and understand collaboration to meet goals. The hardest part of the job is the work-life balance when employed as salary. The needs of the business sometimes will affect your off-time. The most enjoyable part of the job is developing other leaders and promoting those that have worked so hard to get there.The job it self is good, mon-Fri 6 to 230pm. Work can be challenging but depends on how good you are trained. Biggest down fall is Management. They do not care about the team members, they preach about development but it's all talk. They tend to promote a pretty faces over experince, exact words from HR-ETL, which hurts the moral of the team. They talk about fairness but they pick and choose who they reprimand I'm order to get the results they want.  No one is happy that works there, they Work hard for poor yearly compensation and a note that says you did good. Hours for normal team members are always cut back. The place is a joke.I worked for Target for six years. By the time I took my leave, I had been cross-trained in every area of the store, learned how to close down registers, and cover manager's shifts when they couldn't come in. I enjoyed my time there and it had its ups and downs as any job might. My only regret was that there was little opportunity to move up while working there. I was given the blessing of knowledge and learned many skills that were not easy to obtain, however though I was trained to cover manager shifts and close the store, I would never see myself promoted. It is because of this I had decided to leave and chose to focus my work into school instead.Target expects a lot out of it's leadership teams and focuses on constructive feedback and recognition to develop their teams. Compensation is fair although ETL and STL work/life balance is compromised and is largely dependent on the condition of the store you're assigned to. Personal accountability is also a necessary quality to having a successful career with the company."
55,TaskRabbit,"Overall I have had a good experience with Taskrabbit. I love the variety of experiences it has given me. I have enjoyed interacting with clients all over the bay area from businesses to right inside peoples homes doing a little life with them, helping them. The clients are the best part of my job there. The struggle is that there are some seriously slow seasons so it has not been a sustainable position for myself. I think its a great job for extra cash for students, persons with disabilities, teachers on breaks, and anyone who would like some extra work on the weekends. The hardest part of the job is the instability of the market for work. My most enjoyable part was just getting to know the great people and businesses I have had the pleasure to get to know in the process of serving them.A typical day was meeting new people and a lot of learning on the job. The hours are great because it is all up to you, but if you do not work enough you will not make money. I learned a lot I don't think you can match the experience of working freelance work with a place like TaskRabbit. Every job had new challenges with individual pros and cons. Management was great they handled any situation and work with you. The hardest part of the job was not having steady work at times but if you had steady work you had good money.So many interesting tasks to work on as a Taskrunner. There are lots of opportunities to learn and grow in your craft. Every Taskrunner you work with is extremely passionate. Awesome executive team who is very open and transparent. Amazing perks and benefits, lots of fun events, TaskRabbit really makes sure that you're happy to be there.great job if you have kids. Discount on all store items. The funnest part is being around all the toys all the time. Even if your an adult its still cool.TaskRabbit is yet another labor app such as Uber or Lyft which takes advantage of all of the available loopholes in the labor laws in order to maximize their own profits while doing nothing to protect or support their workers.New age working. Its amazing. I thought I was stuck doing home care for ever. It really is a wonderful job. It so great to work with so many different people and going different places My clients enjoy my works as much as I love to provide them with service.A typical day at work involves me reaching out to my clients, driving to the job site and performing the task at hand. Since it is freelance and I am an independent contractor, there is no direct management and co workers.Challenging but most certainly rewarding.I love helping other people, costumer service has been a great part of my life. I love meeting new and interesting people.      I like working on projects that can make me think outside the box and not the usual routine. Problem solving on small as well as big issues at hand are part of this job and that is what makes it interesting everyday.I love to help others while on the Job and taskrabbit has been the best experience doing so completing thier task."
364,TE Connectivity,"I'm a productive person who is focused on my quality of work and work at a steady pace. I time myself so I will know how long it will take to get a specific job done.I love overtime and only take days/nights off when absolutely necessary. I am able to work as a team or individually.TE Connectivity, as a whole, is a great company to work for with nearly unlimited opportunities for advancement!  (I've experienced this on a personal level.)That being said, it has the same issues that every other world-wide corporation has, particularly clueless management.  As with most large corporations, there are far too many ""Professional Managers"" that get hired from outside and do not understand what they are even managing.....they only know metrics, spreadsheets, and dollars, but couldn't answer the first question about what any given employee does in a day.Apart from this, TE always has an open ear for constructive criticism or ideas for improvement.  As stated initially, if you want to move forward with the company, you can; it just may take a little extra effort!Times have changed and company is more focused on hiring from the outside as opposed to promoting from within.  The people that have been there awhile are good people and work hard but are extremely under appreciated.The job gave me great experience working under a Manager. The site under TE took advantage of temporaries, which included myself, by never making us full time employees in their company. Not until Commscope bought the site that we were then able to become full time employees. Being a temp for three years with no vacations or benefits was a big draw back.Company offers great benefits. Also 3 shifts, and they are global so if you are willing to travel the world this is a great company to do so. TE makes connectors for all electric parts.fun workplace and nice coworkers. I work 5 days a week . very motivated people. great boss . good benefits. very busy companyA typical day at work involves sitting in one spot all day performing the same mind-numbing procedure every day. Communication between management and employees is seriously lacking. There are rewards for meeting production goals like money, food, and fun events.TE Connectivity is a decent company. I personally don't like Customer Service so I hate the job, though my management team is good. The Product Information Center has a lot of job security, though don't apply if you don't like Customer Service; it's a call center.A typical day was productive. I learned a lot about blueprints and stamping presses. The management and co-workers we're fair. The hardest part was getting along with everyone. The most enjoyable was knowing my family was provided for.Over all it was a good place to work, but there is a high turn over and several RIF's over my 8 years there. During the time I was there two new plants in Mexico were build and opened, this caused jobs in the US to be relocated.TE Connectivity has a very competitive salary and great locations to work. They taught me a lot about having a career and a day-to-day life of being an employee.Some people should have been shown the door years ago, and others work extremely hard after over 30 years of service to the company.  There are very many layers of management, and more are being added.  There are 60,000 employees, and directing and managing that many employees is not a task every company is up for. The CEO said he wanted to do right by the employees they were laying off, and it seems that they have been, so that's nice.  Let's face it, the company is famous for layoffs in the local area. There is so much room for growth inside of the IT organization in the future, because there are people that would love to optimize and fine-tune it and blow away expectations.  But for now there is just do more with less.  They also don't want to hear what the employees have to say.I am surrounded by hard workers who are knowledgeable and love to laugh, and like long walks by the beach.Work day is very busy and can be unexpected work from day to day, especially depending on the time of year.  Annual enrollment is a extremely busy time.  I am responsible for all funding in benefits area including Health & Welfare and Retirement both 401(k) and Pension. I am the point of contact for employee questions when our benefits center needs information verified or approved.I found TE to be a reasonably pleasant place to work. However, there always seemed to be layoffs going on at any given time. I didn't know anyone who felt secure about their job. It seemed like no matter how driven you were, or how good your work was, you were always on the chopping block.It seemed to me that instead of building and keeping a team of people at the top of their game who would help to make the company profitable and capable of meeting customer needs, it is a company being run by accountants who's only concern is the budgetary goals of the current quarter. Just my two cents.we are just now half way through our fiscal year and have had week long furloughs 5 of the 6 months. the job is good but I would like a full time job not part timeSad to say it is not a great company to work for.  No communication.Pay is not good for the work that is required.  The facility I worked closed but not one time did we get a visit from Upper Management to at least communicate to us or even ask for people to stay with the company.  The Site Manager at the facility was not forthcoming with information and very unfair in treatment of some of the employees It is sad that this company took a group of hard working employees and let them go without even a handshake.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the great people I worked with.  They were AWSOME.Campus Management is fairly consistent.  Immediate Supervisor is knowledgeable and helpful and interested in those who report to him.  As with any large company, communication is a challenge and we could do better in that area.  The most enjoyable part of my job is finding and fixing clerical/numerical errors that affect the outcome of the information that keeps our work centers operational.Great place to work ,but moving out of country,So sad to see it go . This company was around in NC and SC providing jobs for over 40 yrs.My shift was a week end shift which gave me lots of time for my family.My coworkers were great teemmates.The worst part was the 45 min,drive after comp,moved to SC from NC. My skills as a machinist in tool and die and in injection molding is the best tool given to me to support my family.good place to work.. good atmosphere.good relationship between employee and management. will consider a life time career if offered the opportunity.Wonderful place to work. Great people who work together to get things done. TE is very good about promoting from within, which I`m a firm believer in that. Hardest part of this position is component shortages, and getting them here asap. I enjoy the fact that we have an "" engagement team "" that plans dinners, parties, heart walks, etc., that we can participate in. And programs set up to help the community. Many regrets that the facility is closing.The years of downsizing made it worrysome if you will have a job.  Many of the jobs were sent to Mexico and China.  The company is very high tech and produce quality product, but the job security made in tough.  Raises were far and few between.. Our department, and other depts. went seven years without a raise."

Most days we would get done work late but that was always a good thing. At the end of the day we would clean up our areas, and wait for the Ok to go home. Everyone is always so helpful and dependent.Gained much experience in SAS programming in clinical trialsProffessionally one of the most enjoyed place. Worked with very good team.J'ai beacoup évolué sur plusieurs produits et sur plusieurs technologies.C'était très positif.pro mne nevyhovujuci celodenny smeny,fyzicky náročná práceDlouhe smeny,práce celý den"
2,Technical Consulting Firm,Great job security until they decided to close down. I really enjoyed working there.
280,Tekberry,Great team to work with some of the best I've had the privileged.  Would recommend company to any potential employee.  Company is supportive of its employees.
91,"TEKsystems, Inc","The Portsmouth NH office is good at matching you with their clients needs.TEKsystems was very happy with my performance at Sprint at all times.  They were truly a wonderful agency to work for.  They went out of their way to make my work experience at Sprint truly rewarding by stopping by to check on me.  They usually praise me in front of upper management.  That truly made me feel valuable.Even though I work for TEKSystems on a 3rd party global service contract as a Business Systems Analyst, the client is who we support with labor and our experiences. The client is disorganized and does not understand process improvement. They spend lots of time filling out FDS's and other documents that have no standards. Working for TEK is great but for the customer our group is underutilized.I would never work a contract position or use TEKSystems to place me into any position ever again.  Every opportunity they have presented me with was grossly underpaid, and the positions and work environments misrepresented.  Contractors are nothing more than a cash cow for them, and they treat them as such.  I was lied to about many things, such as provided parking (that actually cost me $11.50 per day) to the integrity of the managers at the client site.  I regret working with TEKSystems, and they have literally cost me THOUSANDS of dollars and ruined my holidays.  Stay FAR FAR FAR away from TEKSystems in Omaha NE.They sign you up and make sure your in the program all is great for about the first month and a half. Then they tell you you can't apply for other jobs ant they will not let you forget that, Then they spring on you that your contract is no longer gonna go how long they said it was going to g, which means no job until they find you something else so your basically stuck with then once you sign onEverything i learned came easy with how helpful everyone was and how well everyone worked as a team to get everything done on time. We helped move along the company for the cut-over and go-live projects to allow them to use the new software and scan guns. With that we stuck around to help train employees how to use the scan guns and troubleshoot mistakes and wrong actions.I have been doing contract work (on and off) for TEKsystems about 3+ years.  Their staff is always very helpful and address my needs when it comes to work.  They take care of their employees and make sure that the job they place you in is a good fit.  I really enjoy working with them and their eagerness to help.I have worked for Teksystems under the Pensacola, FL office and my experience was good. But the Teksystems in the New Orleans office is horrible lol. I dnt know where they get their recruiters or account manager from buy they are so not qualified. They do not do their homework but expect you to do yours, completely unorganized. If Teksystems is a ""Tech"" company, they should know IT terminology and not some notes from a website. I wouldn't work for Teksystems of New Orleans, I'll try another office.To be successful, you have to commit at LEAST 10 hours or more to your job. You can leave ""early"" at 5:00-5:30, but will have a lot of judgement from other people in the office. If you consistently, leave at that time your integrity to the company will be questioned. The company culture is amazing and so much fun, but if you don't want to live at work I don't recommend it.As with all staffing agencies the primary function is to find qualified, and reliable help for a client. Sometimes this takes all focus off of the worker and makes them feel like a number rather than a person. TEKsystems has been able to balance the relationship beautifully. Caring not only for the client but the people they send to those clients.Working with company has been a great experience compared to other staffing companies.  The recruiters stay in constant contact with you and ask questions about your current assignment.I enjoyed going to work everyday. This company is a recruitment company that strives to help the client as well as the employee. A typical day was to meet with my client and go over the goals for the day/week. the hardest part was working with the city people. The best was working with our contractors.My day consist of imaging laptops and desktop internal configurations desktop support tier 3 machine builds. I have a proven track record of meeting deadlines and service level objectives and have good judgment and to whom to escalate problems to various levels of the IT chain of command. I also have a proven track record deploying Window 7 as the lead tech and as a Deployment tech working with the project team and business unit contacts to confirm specific list of applications for each user to be migrated in a business group unit/group.TEKsystems has two primary business lines - (1) IT Staffing, and (2) Consulting Services.I was part of the latter, called TEKsystems Global Services.  During the selling and delivering of consultant services, we worked closely with the staffing side to acquire additional roles needed to fulfill the engagement.  The two organizations work virtually seamlessly together and make a great pairing.TEKsystems is a great place for your career - beginning, middle and end!Working for TEK means getting paid to be a contractor. If you are a contractor, you are treated as a replaceable cog in a machine and afforded that level of respect, especially if you work for state government via TEK. This is a good company to work for in terms of salary, but don't plan to stay in this role.TEKsystems is an excellent place to work. They provide high level training and maintain an excellent company culture. This promote from within company offers opportunity to expand your career at a faster rate than most Fortune 500's. I truly enjoy the people I work with!Working at TEKSystems has been an experience. Personally I haven't found pleasure because of the type of work I am performing on top of the fact the work life balance is non existent. The people you work with are great but there is always someone people are willing to help more than others which is essential to being successful.this is the tech industry production is essential. Environment changes from fast paced to slow, you must be flexible.When environment slows down more experienced co-workers are willing to share their   knowledge with less experienced workers.TEKsystems is a nice place to work.  Like any other company it has its positives and negatives.  I enjoy the work environment, the work life balance in my current role and the people I work with.learned many useful tips, and taught some.hardest part of the job was knowing that you had no benefits or raises available. Enjoyed working with most of my co-workers, always willing to help each other.This is a great entry level position to get experience in the IT field, however with no PTO and no paid holidays, it makes it tough to stay with it for more than a year. It helps get the experience for your resume to acquire a more steady career in the near future."
309,"TeleNav, Inc.","Provided in a pervious submission. Please see prior review. Choose not to repeat. Did not care for the politics. Very unorganized.I love it here because everyone's friendly, managers are outgoing, understanding and kind. The lunch days are awesome and everyone supports one another.Strengthen my practice on Scrum methodology as well as offering opportunity deep diving automotive area.heard the CEO talking about minorities in the bathroom one time and before leaving the bathroom made sure no one heard him and his buddy.Overall, Telenav is a great place to work. Good talent and people willing to help each other out. If I could change one thing is that there are too many ""bosses, not enough workers""... Too many managers and directors making poor decisions.Pay is excellent, but work/life balance is non-existing. With major sites in China, expect to work many nights because of the time difference.People and culture are among the best I've encountered in my experience. Benefits have improved in the past couple of years. Interesting technology to work with.  People and culture are among the best I've encountered in my experience. Benefits have improved in the past couple of years. Interesting technology to work with.There is a general lack of motivation or sense of empowerment in some teams. Work enthusiasm is uneven throughout the organization. Not enough innovation or creative thinking in management to maximize productivity without just making people busier and working on too many things. Execution efficiency is often hampered by the organizational structure.good company nice life style friendly productive environment flexible hoursTelenav is a good place for hands on different fields as professional individual that wants his/her name in a industry that grows. I learned to create excel modeling and find way to reducing cost in Operations.Good team work.It's nice company to start as QA Engineer. I got a lot of experience of mobile testing.Pleasant place to do work. Sometimes hectic getting things approved.-Mobile testing using SDK-Grey box testing using Central Logs-Grey box using PuTTy-Black box testing mobile applicationTelenav has a very good working place. I did the internship in last summer at Telenav. The co-workers are very helpful and en-courageous. There are lots of fun in the office. Actually working is fun here. My manager and other team members were very cooperative. I learned a lot of things during my internship period.Work everyday was the same but there were times where the department would be blasted with late updates and issues, making the day crucial on top of all my daily duties. Company provided great healthcare and fun events for employees with amazing prizes. My fellow co-workers were the best, I think that's what made it hard when I left here because working there for almost 5 years, people there became family. The company outsourced and was moving to another building, so there were ongoing changes and new projects without providing any training. I had to manage doing projects on my own with limited information, also trying to finish up with my personal work on top of that with no approved overtime. I tried my best and appreciate all the work experience from Telenav."
662,Telephonics Corporation,"Design of object-oriented embedded system software for a real-time communications system. Brought system from concept through initialrequirements and UML object oriented modeling, coding, unit test, integration and system test. Rehosted software from Jovial to C++ executing under VxWorks.  Development included the utilization of a wide range of development tools including the integration of the Telelogic Tau UML modeling tool, DOORS requirements management tool and the DocExpress automated documentation toolA typical day at Telephonics Corporation is very high paced from the moment you walk in the door. I have learned how to complete projects with team work. They are big on working with teams and having representation from all departments.  Management has changed recently so, I cannot comment. My coworkers were wonderful, I have gained family working there.  Hardest part of the job was a new operating system that was set up, they were still working out the bugs.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the many programs we completed successfully for the military.co-workers great. engineers top notch. job work/life balance stressfulThis is a company under great change.  The future is promising with the right management team.  Job security must improve for the best to be attracted to their team.I worked for Telephonics for less than 6 months and was relieved when I left. My management in subcontracts procurement was abusive to vendors, fellow employees and other members of the teams when we visited suppliers. The lack of ethical trealment of suppliers and the use of them as ""red herrings"" and ""stalking horses"" during proposal preparation was astonishing in its arrogance.I have a strong procurement background but had been away from aerospace for a while before working for Telephonics and was treated like a rank beginner. I was also treated as if if everything I said was a lie that had to be challenged. They told me they thought I lied during the app. process because after starting I could not travel due to their requirement that employees pay for their own travel and then seek reimbursement; I had had credit problems and did not have credit cards to be able to travel with.All in all, when compared to other world class aerospace companies like the former Grumman Aerospace, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Boeing, et al, Telephonics is a ""bush league"" third tier wannabe. Stay away, stay far, far away.Too much attention is spent on processes and procedures and insufficient time product/program success.Great manager and co-workers. I learned about the fabrication of printed circuit boards and their integration into electronic systems.Don't work here... H.R. and management don't care about anyone's feelings or needs. USELESS.I was fotunate to have worked with a great people and a wonderful staff while I was at Telephonics.High Workload, Rigorous Work Environment with short completion timelines & turn-around exectations, often combined with unexpected requirements & complications..I worked there four years and was given a good review in the first year.Then everything went down hill from there,You are always under extreme pressure.Their internal systems are difficult to work with due to certain constraints.Because of the type of industry it is,you are under the constant threat of layoff.The management I worked under was verbally abusive and did not want to understand the compexities of issues.The management violated the Company Code of Ethics,When this was brought to Human Resources it was basically blown off.Human Resources always supports Managements positions 99.9% of the time regarding employee performance.In my case and again this is my view,my management fabricated issuses against me in order to make it easier to be put in the layoff pool.I had 34 years experience in my field.In Nov 2011 I was let go along with 25 others in the company.16 of the 25 people were 55 and older.That tells you something,Telephonics has allowed me to grow professionally and personally"
226,Telligen,"Telligen is a great company, its employees in mind. Each employee is a owner after one year and this has benefits. The training I received was not sufficient to complete the job, but this is not company wide. Its complex environment with little room for error. Redundancy is the work, which if you like regime and unchanging work - this is for you. The group contract with OHCA and that part of the job is quite interesting. Overall, I loved my time there.Enjoyed every aspect of this job. Staff was great to work with and we all got on together very well.We were able to wear casual clothing 4 days a week with jeans on Fridays. Help was always available. Supervisors were very good. Felt a part of the family.great pay and benefits were great when I first started but now the benefits are not the best. Relaxed work atmosphere and team work is good depending on which team you are on. Staff turnaround is low but staff do transfer to other departments quite often.Not a good employer. Are encouraged to work harder and faster and not take breaks. Work is salaried. Work about 50-60 hrs a week for same salary. Work is contractual and can end at any time. Management is only concerned about making money, not the employees. Supervisors are secretive and there is alot of favoritism. Lots of harrassment of employs not in the ""clicks"".  I enjoyed the people I worked with while at Telligen, I knew what I was doing on a daily basis, and enjoyed working on my own, I don't like to be micro-managed as long as the work is getting doneTelligen is very in line with market norms as far as benefits and compensation. They whey heavily on market research to and adjust accordingly.Executive management is unapproachable and out of touch with employee population. Management likes to blame others.  No advancement opportunities.   Felt unappreciated from management. No work life balance.  Would not recommend.Calling patients to do their monthly phone assessment and education, charting there assessment and progress on health goals.Usually tried to get ahold of 7-10 patients a day as had a case load of 150 to 170 to complete each month either assessments or 3 attempts to reach member per month. Calling Dr offices to collaborate about patient. Sending out educational  material to the patients.I learned a lot about  health  coaching, care plans and using the computer at this job as well as Medicaid and finding resources for the patients.My direct mangers were good and very willing to help the team with  any time off needed.My co-workers for the most part were great team playersThe hardest part of this  job was the case load and deadlines at the end of the month. The most enjoyable part of this  job was the patients and my co-workers.Poor communication between management and staff. Not informed of changes until the last minute. Excellent training process. Was given one month to train with qualified staff member. Spoke with members on the phone about their current health issues, setting goals and developing a plan of care for each member.The employee owners at Telligen truly do make a difference. They are among some of the most passionate and caring individuals I have ever worked with.Telligen puts employees first.  Happy employees work hard to make their projects successful and their customers happy.I had a great manager, then I switched to a different department and was treated poorly. They expect you to do your work along with everyone else work. The HR department does not care.I was a contract employee for Telligen, but really enjoyed working there. The atmosphere was very layed back, and I had plenty of work to keep me busyGood company.  Contract work is unstable. People are great, but the work and job descriptions are not clear.All in all a good place to work, if you reside in West DesMoines"
154,Teradata,"I am new to this company for 1 week, too early to judge this company.  Will let you know few months later.The Teradata company is a very mature company.A job that provides opportunity to learn, progress and contribute to the organization.A teamwork-oriented environment in a company that empowers employees to create and take initiatives.A job that my skills are utilized to the maximum and allows me to grow within the organization.I interned in Teradata during this summer and I felt very happy when I worked there because I got many nice colleagues and my manager and mentor are really nice.Teradata pays well and allows growth for their employees however Teradata is a company that has been around a long time and is not adapting well to change.Very fast pace company. generous with vacation days. Learned how to managed stress and to prioritize workload.  Good opportunities for advancement within the company.  Some departments need to some management to take management class to learn how to manage people.Worked on a newer cloud product and Management has zero vision.  Avoid if you want to save your sanity.  They have no visibility into cloud vs on-premise and are still, completely reliant on large physical hardware.Good job as a big data consultant. Work with other companies as clients and perform data analytics and data science. Work with teams of other data scientistsGood oprotunities to work in different industries with international teams. The best of breed product, the best technology, and so onThe company is good if you are okay to take challenges.Management Good.Co Workers GoodTypical Day at work - GoodGood Good Good Good Good Good GoodMy co-workers were always extremely competent and knowledge.  Teradata always encourages the consultants to maintain their skillsets and encourages great performance.Horrible company.  Ran like the old NCR company.  In real financial trouble.  Find work elsewhere.  Management is out of touch with the changes in the industry.  Very old school company.Teradata is a good company to work for. With the pre-sale announcement that they were going to sell off their marketing applications divisions, many sales motions came to a halt. Hopefully, the new owners will take the old Aprimo products in a good direction.There was a nice laid back IT officevibe. If you did your work well and showed up to work on time, there was a decent amount of flexibility. The company recently has experienced a reduction in force with lots of uncertainty ahead. Top level execs have received multimillion dollar bonuses/pay outs meanwhile throngs of low level employees even with years of service will receive paltry in comparison severance packages. I wouldn't recommend pursuing a position here during this transitionary time.Need upward mobility for senior security architects.  Co-workers are close knit team willing to share experience and problem solving.Teradata is wonderful place to work with appropriate Job Work and life balance.overall job culture is best in industryI had a great experience working over there and people over there are very friendly and polite,the working atmosphere was awesomeGreat work life balance; Managers are very accommodating. need more diversity. The most enjoyable part is travelling to different states of the country.Engaging work with lots of opportunities to learn new skills. Employees are friendly and easy to work with. Enjoyable atmosphere.I was lucky.  At the right place at the right time.  My experience at Teradata was nothing shot of a great American story.  My experience demonstrates what can happen when a company looks at an individuals skills from a personal prespective and evaluates what that person could accomplish when given the proper opportunites.Enjoyed the people I worked for and with.  Typical business with good and not so good situations you deal with over 25 years.Most of the employees at Teradata did not have the appropriate computer educations to be working for this company.  It seemed as if they hired MBAs and tried to turn them into Technical Consultants or Watchdogs;  Upper management seemed OK, middle management was unprofessional to say the least and in my opinion a great reason for the downfall of this company.  There was ZERO logical reason for this downfall other than recruiting people with appropriate educational backgrounds and getting rid of DEAD WOOD long ago.It was an honor to work for this company.  Unfortunately, the place is ridden with unqualified employees who know nothing about computers and do not have any genuine interest in Teradatas products.  Managers were more like just money/recruiter people."
324,Teradata Corporation,"Working at Teradata introduced me to working in a fast pace office setting by teaching me how to handle stress and meeting deadlines and special projects without impacting my work quality or professional demeanor.Overall, Teradata is a great company to work for during my time there.  Unfortunately the division I was working for was sold and there was a reduction in force.If you aren't hired in as management you won't get good raises and the bonuses have decreased dramatically over the years. Training isn't a regular issue here and if you get any it must be on your own time. They offer virtual jobs, so this is the only true perk to Teradata.It seems the corporate policy is to hire at a low income and keep it low with very small annual raises if you even get a raise.Teradata Corporation is a proven leader in its field of data warehousing, with very effective personnel staffed throughout from entry level up through the executive suite. In my part of the organization (sales and marketing), there is a heavy reliance on a national / international network of far-flung resources, many who work remotely from their homes.As such, the culture is based around multiple daily conference calls and heavy use of email. It makes for a great work-life balance, and yet our productivity as a company proves that people remain focused on executing their responsibilities with focus and rigor.The hardest part of life at Teradata for me, however, has been the company's very flat structure and limited opportunities for career advancement and growth. Compensation is relatively competitive, though, which serves as a partial offset.Voted one of the best 25 companies to work for.Teradata Labs, the company's development arm, is based in San Diego (approx 1,500 employees)...with approx 10,000 employees worldwide.Bad Company. they don't care for their Employees. No Extra pay For Extra Hours worked. No Assistence provide for any Certifications. Higher Management is never reachable.My day consists of updating our current ERP system by fixing code, writing new code, testing, and creating Oracle forms. On top of upgrading the ERP system, I support the current system by helping the business users solve errors or problems they come across. My manager is great. He's very laid back as long as our work is completed in the time it's allocated to. Upper management could be better but still good people. The hardest part of my job is juggling all the work that's given to me in a given day. We are a $5 Billion company and our ERP team only consists of 14 people. Between supporting the current system and upgrading to Oracle E-business suite R12, time has to be managed well. The most enjoyable part of the job is staying busy.Responsible tracking and auditing travel & expenses for over 30 countries globally which is cultrally interesting and challenging. We have a good group of people and great contacts within the other department internally and globally. Hardest part is at times the language barrier, but we work with it and in the end it works. But, this can also be the most enjoyable, learning about all other parts of the world. All in all a great company!The company is great but going through changes, not all changes are good though. The management is a bit older and can find it hard to relate to the younger workers.Good technology, great coworkers. Lots of new strategic acquisitions in the big data space. Long work days due to large account base.Company trying to move in new direction.  Making the right decisions to shed low return assets.Lots of very good technology.The people I worked with are some of the smartest I have ever known. Managers are the best I have had the plaesure to work for.challenged with Hadoop and Cloud analytics offerings -> slow to no growth;  would be best to merge/ sell company;  selling marketing analytics is only firs step..Teradata has been one of the best companies I have worked for.  The people are outstanding.  I love what I do and I hope to carry this love for financial planning and analysis to my next employment.Great history but currently transitioning to a SaaS world and struggling.  Most likely an acquisition target at this point.The project I am working on Marketing Analysis application. A great team to work with and exposure to lots of technology within the big data Marketing Analytic.If you have a decent managers in the office, things will be good, if you don't its gonna make your work life suffer, don't expect much.  There is a park near by that you can scream atthe end of your work day but its closed during the winter.  Most managers in IT seem rather level headed, but something is changing in the air.I enjoy working here at Teradata.  However, I feel that I have reached my full potential and fell there is no longer any advancement for me here.Interesting company. Gone through a lot of changes since I worked there.Great company to work for and management sets the goals and let its people perform the work.  Company provide the tools to accomplish what they ask of its people.Across the board, Teradata, its culture, its vision and values, its excellent employees ranked highest in my work experience."
745,Terracon,"Terracon is a great place for the beginners. The guidance provided by the senior management is really a plus and overall the work culture is really great here.Great place where I was able to learn about the engineering field and at the same time was able to contribute with my knowledge of computer software systems.A lot of confusion when it came to scheduling;  Right hand didn't always know what the left was doing.  I didn't learn anything that I didn't know, may be a couple tricks from some of the other field technicians.  The field techs were good, and the most helpful.  A typical work day start with you going somewhere and then turning around and having to go somewhere else (hoping you had the right equipment with you).  Just a lot of confusion.Great company! Great benefits! Highly qualified and friendly staff that became like family! I fully enjoyed working for this company! If you are great with time management, responsible, hands on, easy to work learn hands on and able to work alone than this company is great for you!Pay was low for the work assigned. A lot of late pm and early am assignments with little turnaround time. Many job assignments in one work day and not enough time allocated to do proper inspections.Take jobs for services, dispatch technicians, perform soil & concrete testing, covering customers services with technicians at the time specified by customers.This job has give me more experience in geotechnical engineering. My co- workers/ bosses are very friendly. This job takes a lot of hard work, but it is very rewarding. The hardest part of the job would be waking up at an early hour to drive to a job site in another city, or having to stay in that different city over night.Management at my office at Terracon (Atlanta-Duluth) was very good about changing the safety attitude in the company, and always emphasized the reasons and resources to do our jobs safely. Most managers were very supportive of safety, and of promoting the junior staff. There was a really big emphasis on the numbers - chargability goals and budgets were talked about at least weekly. Most junior staff was cross trained in at least two services (Phase I, NEPA, wetlands, asbestos testing, etc.) to ensure that when work was slow that you could cross to another group. Each office operates as an individual Profit-Loss center. This allows each office to be more nimble and quick to respond to the local markets and to employee needs and ideas. However, it does not provide incentive to share work across offices. It was not uncommon that if someone in our office got a job in TN or MS, that we would keep it and spend more money traveling rather than working with an office more local to the project and spending less money. This also goes back to the focus on chargability.There was a lot of flexibility to make your own hours and to work from home frequently.Salary . Work 60 plus hours a week with absolutely no extra compensation or gratitude whats so ever!! Charge you too much out of your paycheck to use their company truck. Had one for the longest time last few  years took it away with no compensations at all. Cost me naturally more in fuel and tolls wear and tear on my car for same salary. And in office between 6am and 7am. Getting home maybe by 7pm or 8. Approximately an hour drive each way. :'(:-(:O:-(Typical work day- 7 am - 530 pmRecent changes in management have made me open to other options, however I'm not unhappy with my jobMy co-workers are a good group of people and very supportingThe hardest part of the job is the lack of being able to plan personal things more than 24 hours in advance.The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with clientsMy job consists of commercial construction inspections and materials testing such as testing concrete and soil densities and reinforcing steel inspections according to blueprint and engineering specifications.Here is what we were told when terracon bought out our company, ""you are not just a number to us. Here is your employee number, that's how we know who you are."" Bonuses can equate to fake money that can only be used at there silly online store with cheap merchandise which is like pulling teeth to use. They'll give you a truck to take, which you can take to and from work, good right? Then charge you for it and call it a state law....liars. Raises are stupid. Only the top few get good raises, so you can bust your behind and do well, but if the manager has his ""friends"" working there guess who.gets.the good raises. They do not.care if you want a life outside of work. Billable time is all they care about, so, when you take an approved paid vacation, it really hurts your billable hours, and you will be fired if your billable hours for the year don't meet their expectations. This company is set.up for the top paid employees to continue to do better while the ones that work hardest, the techs, get the.most scrutiny and fired easily. Any other testing company would be better to work for.Wake up early go to construction site test concrete lots of downtime and minimal physical work. lots of days with 12 hour shifts.Terracon is a first class company. Proper initiatives are in place to be sure every employee is taken care of at every level both personally and professionally. It's an employee owned company so much care is given to its employees. The benefits are good and management truly does walk the talk.typical day on the job, you have to drink alot of water and work hard and fast to complete the days work given, its normaly hot outside, so it can get exsausting, work hard and go home and rest for tomorrows day of work.Typical run-of-the-mill geotech company devoid of excitement, ingenuity, or passion. Works most on commercial real estate development that requires very little engineering expertise.professional team of engineers and project managers, exposure to a lots of great projects, opportunity for advancement. Long work hours during summer.Every day was different. Never knew where you were going to be and what you were going to be doing next. Worked many different time shifts to me clients needsMy location meant well in their actions but this ""employee owned"" company certainly did not have the employees in mind. As an hourly employee during the summer (our busiest time) they decide instead to hire on 5 unneeded interns to take our hours away. This is not a stable job and the job itself is meticulous, robotic, boring and dull. This is a mind numbing place. Now, I have a college education so this is part of the issue but still, there is so little variation it kills me. The co-workers are nice and the management is mediocre at best, they tend to only care about salaried employees. I learned how to take concrete samples and test for quality of concrete.Terracon is a bunch of people who think they are someone, needing to always be over your head. You apply for one job and they hire you for another, promising promotion and never getting it. Lab life sucks.Good co workers and managers to work with.Good experience to learn civil drafting.No room to grow with the company.  Just stuck at the same spot."
628,Tesla Government,"Great Company to work for. They take good care of their employees. Everyday seems to go buy very fast, it's a fast paced work place. Many of people enjoy the atmosphere.First off , it is not Tesla Motors, It's Tesla Electric : Tesla Electric is a very young company in Sulphur , La. which has had it's growing pains but is coming into it's own. The work place is very friendly , yet professional, one of teaching and learning while putting out very high quality work in the residential and commercial electrical arena. I would reccomend Tesla to anyone wanting a high quality electrical finished product. Tesla Electric performs much bigger than it is.Great opportunity learning variety of skills. working here was a great experience and you get to meet different people everyday and the majority of people are all very nice, although you gain many skills and definitely have good income working there, if you want a job as well as a social life and be able to have time for outside of work activities or such especially if you are not a local to the area this would not be able to mix well together since the majority of people working here are required to work a maximum of 70 hours a week, about 12 hours a day.Great place to work with a nice balance of work and home. I worked four twelve hour shifts with three days off a week. Starting pay was $17.00 an hour with a raise every six months of about a dollar. However you are on your feet for just about your whole shift and some of the management can be hard to work with at times, but definitely a great job to be at.The best work ethics I have ever seen. Most people would push for getting things done and are not very political. Work-life balance is poor (in Body in White at least), management would push for quick return but undermine sustainability of employees. Burned out employees will only stay for a year or two max. Great learning opportunity for employees, but because of the non-sustainable attitude, most employees would not last long.Geat place to work, the people are very experienced there talents. Helps you grow into a better, more reliable person. The hardest part is being there for 12 hrs and only get a 15 minute break but you get used to it. The work was very easy when you leaned it. The pack line was the easiest to work. The assembly line was tough but when you do it a lot it comes easier.• Consistent high monthly performer within the top 4% of worldwide influenced orders among Product Specialists. Influenced over $4.6 million of annual revenue. • Assist in the launch of the Tesla Stanford location by training new Product Specialists, Owner Advisors and Store Manager.• Assigned as the liaison for group presentations and marketing campaigns regarding Tesla product knowledge• Help to develop a new way to market and sell electric vehicles to the community. A part of the first Pop-Up launch in San Francisco• Qualify inbound and outbound lead generation through dashboard KPI's and opportunity tracking within SalesforceAt tesla you had no life, and politics play a big roll. Moving up in the company you had to bend and always break rules to be considered as someone who wants to move up in the company. Living while working for tesla is like being in jail, your life, relationship life and family values they all go down. Tesla don't give a penny about your health, they love to take advantage of you to the most they can as for as money and paychecks go. And if you don't do what they say even if it's the law you be breaking then they will threat your job to get you scared. Overall tesla and there management is ugly, they don't know how to manage things well. That's why there stocks go up and down.Tesla motors is a good company. if you don't mind working 12 hour days 6 days a week. keep in mind you will have no time to do anything else, friends,family,wife,husband you will have to sacrifice a lot. if your a single person and have no significant other then this is perfect job. they pay very well and have lots of benefits.you even get stocks if you stay the full 4 years. management is good.very fast past working job with a lot of over time. Employees were very respectful, the management was excellent and everyone worked as a team.  As far as the hardest part, i would say nothing about the job was difficult. Everything was very organized and well managed. My most enjoyable part of the job was the money that was coming in from all those 12 hour shifts.Working for Tesla was an opportunity of a life time and I miss it every day. It was awesome being part of something great to help improve our environment. However I was promised a lot when i took the job, but Tesla's management never followed through with there word. I also was injured off the job and Tesla would not modify my position temporarily until I healed and was just let go.Warehouse/ manufacturing                                     My job was to assemble the spine of the battery pack and making sure all parts are in their proper places so it can move forward in the assembly line process with no defaults. Had worked in a team to get our job done in a safe and timely manner ●	production worker Keeping count of all ship outs ●	Safety first wearing all protective gear in workplace●	Battery pack assembler ●	Prepare and complete orders for delivery or pickup according to schedule ( load, pack, wrap, label, ship)5am start time meeting every morning for Electricians and Data team members. we leave about 540am to collect equipment that we will need for the days job. Then take a cart to the level job is and once we would find our pillar and IDF and Jboxes and Racks and servers working with switches labeling correctly and running CAT5 liines from the IDF up 60 feet into the ceiling and along side the beams  using ladders or scissor lifts even booms. We would run between 2 to 14 lines from one point to another before that we were installing and hanging security cameras.Work varied on a weekly basis, between  building and testing newly designed test equipment for the Tesla Powers Electric Drive Systems, Installing Test equipment, Building wiring harnesses, trouble shooting and repair of equipment.  Worked with an outstanding manager and several seasoned engineers.  Loved the challenge of developing new equipment.  Hardest part was working with new engineers just out of college with no real life experience in electronic circuitry and wiring.Tesla is a company with a great direction but is striken by poor managerial decisions.  Most of my coworkers are incredibly passionate about what they do and supporting Tesla's mission.  Tesla pushes all of its employees to strive for greatness and do more than they think they're capable of.  However, the upper-lower level management does not communicate directives well, and does not take feedback from employees.I really liked working at Tesla, the people were cool and really helped out , management was great the leads and managers actually know what they're doing and the free cereal and snacks and fountain drinks really are a plus, only thing is that my lunch breaks were only 35 minutes, i can't go out and buy something because i won't make it back on time, and terribly they're really strict on the background checks thats the reason why i got let go.This company is FAR from honest with their customers. Rude trainers who don't believe that people should be able to make emergency phone calls, and if you don't fit their fold, they'll kick you out. If you have a strength in Data Entry, but was hired as Production, which is a weaker strength, they'll fire you instead of putting you where your strengths are. That's precisely what happened to me. Extremely discriminatory regarding people who have pain syndromes. I waited 2 months for this job, forsaking other employers, despite being hired back in June, I couldn't start until August 18th, and lasted for nearly 2 weeks. Terrible company, there is no love for their employees, and no love for their customers. All they care about is image. I wish I could say more, but I'd end up breaking my NDA.Great place to work at for a while with a very fast paced and dynamic environment, good advancement, with lots of learning opportunities if you are willing to jump in and get your hands dirty figuratively and practically speaking. Management although often best in their fields is also often inexperienced managing people, sometimes lacking leadership and good management skills. It is often very demanding and not very forgiving with poor work-life balance and high expectations. Sometimes lacks processes, clear direction and constructive feedback. Resources are sometimes missing or stretched thin. It can however be very rewording and self revealing on a personal level when you do meet expectations and overcome challenges. It has good health insurance, and some small perks.Regular 8 hour shifts with optional overtime. Management not the brightest but also not the worst. Overall you are given the tasks and are expected to complete them before the days end.A typical day is doing audit, inspection and engineering trials. Learned different hand tools and mechanical tools as well.Learning the processes of building a car. Learning different parts of the car and it's function. Seeing our CEO most of the time brings a smile to my face.I learned many valuable skills about working in a production environment by spending three years at the Tesla factory. The most enjoyable part of working there was being part of a growing company, and having a chance to see some cutting edge technology."

Everyone is driven by the Mission which makes the work day easier to focus on the overall goal.  Brilliant people working towards a better future.Its a very good place to work , very good benefits  and pay. The only down side is that they have really long hours and hardly higher girls. My experience here was incrediblethe most enjoyable part was the staff. a typical work day consist of maning your post and placing parts on cars specific to the manifest instructions.Tesla Motors is by far the best place to work. Not only are you working for very luxurious vehicle company but also very technologically advance. Working for Tesla was very rewarding.Tesla is a exacly place start your carrier off pays very well and lots of overtime. If you do have alot time on your hands i recommend tesla motors for youThe management was a bit lazy and unorganized but the people that worked there were very kind. There are a lot of people who took the work for granted and gave up on the quality of work.Great company to work for, every day is a new experience, Co-workers are the best. The Hardest part of the job is you never know what is next for you."
156,Tessella,Layoffs are occurring and management has been gutted. Consider other places if possible. Very high turnover rate with over 50% of the staff gone from last year.
239,Tetra Tech,"Very enjoyable place to work with opportunity for professional growth. Full service engineering design firm with a variety interesting large and small projects.While working directly with the DPW, I interacted with the director, the arsenal general manager and all administrative and maintenance personnel.It was a challenging but exciting opportunity to identify various conservation measures to lower operating cost on the post for the U.S. Army.Worst company I have ever worked for. I have worked hard jobs and not complained about it and I have done a lot of tough hours but nothing compares to this company and the way the lie cheat and steal hours and work from you. They tell you one thing and do another. Promise you great things and never come through. Steal workers from other companies while they still work for other companies and tell you that there is no work when they give the select few they like 100's of hours a week. I wouldn't take this job if your life depended on it. I was behind on bills due to lack of work and took this job and they enjoyed seeing me struggle. They work very unethical and only look out for themselves.This is a great way getting Documention experiece. As a Task force leader working at the Portable scales I Weighted and documented All Roll off bins, End dumps, Rocket launchers hauling off debri to land Although it is only a tempory job I have enjoyed it. If i want to continue with this company i would have to travel but i have a family i would like to see on a daily basis and unfortuanatly  i could not continue working at tetra tech after this project is over.Good place with cafetria and free gym. Global projects are good opportunity to learn from. However, project managers and senior engineers are not organized, they need to communicate more effectively and have junior engineers know their responsibilties.I don't recommend working here if you have a better job opportunity.Tetra Tech is a wonderful place to work and it provides numerous opportunities to develop a wide skillset. The work and the atmosphere are both great, the only complaint is that pay, relative to other environmental companies, is low. It also seems like the payscale isn't consistent with experience, education, etc.Engineers need to communicate with each other more to have the same out come to be able to present to client or drafter. some of the dead line were ball park and were never set or communicated to designers so it was a hurry up and get it done most of the time.Nothing bad to say about Tetra Tech over 14k employees.Several projects that I was involved in were fun and not bothersome. They are very unique with several business units.Employers have flex time, and they have to have their 40 hours in by the end of the week.  The benefits are poor same with vacation/sick time.  You get 23 days a year and 7 of them are paid holidays - New Years, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Christmas.  The job security is poor, and that comes with the job considering you have to win jobs to keep your team busy.  The people working there are great and friendly, which is the upside of working there.  Most of the work is done behind the desk and on the computer.  Great help and assistance if you need it.  Sometimes there is poor communication and certain individuals aren't available when you need them and they didn't let you know that they weren't going to be there.Sit at workstation, for ongoing auto-cad work activities, and coordinating work with co-workers. Client projects duration could be one month to one year to complete. The hardest part of the project is, receiving the client requirements.I learned a lot about chain of events in a large company and how procedures effect other departments.I learned how to effectively work with various personalities.There was no typical day at work. Depending on if there was a project ramping up, the work day could be extremely hectic and fast paced.When a project was not in the immediate future, my typical day consisted of processing expense reports and reconciling various company credit cards.I love this job except for the fact that I never know if I am going to have hours or not.  At this point in my life I need consistent work and Tetra Tech is just not providing it.Working at Tetra Tech was great overall. The people there are nice and professional. Typical workday hours and environment. Opportunities to travel/be outside exist. Great pay. Free lunches weekly.-Various projects to work on and more freedom on the design and input in the projects. Learned about writing techniques and client interaction. -Work with staff with different backgrounds and experience.Waited 90 days then was given 2 days work. This company is good to work for if more hours were available sooner. Would definitely travel with them if ever offered.This was an excellent place to work. The employees were very kind, they were very flexible, and the pay was more than reasonable.Great place for advancement, Learned a lot about manufacturing and shipping. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the CEO's predjudice against bigger people.Tetra tech is an honest and fair company.  They are diverse and believe in equality opportunity employment. From my observation this is a good company to work for.My office relies heavily on government contracts. Not a bad thing but can be at times uncertain for the future.  I do love the people that I work with.Only one to advance is same nationality. Salary does not compensate for the workload and long hours of work including some holidays. Management takes all the credit while the rest do most of the tedious tasks. Unorganized and need restructuring. HR is slow in response especially lots of mistakes from payroll recently. Payroll Supervisor was a pain to deal with and very arrogant. Job descriptions are in low key compared to what is expected and given on the job. Worked on a project onsite and you are expected yesterday when you are just in time.Learned a lot from a lot of great people. Cheery atmosphere, flexible schedule, lots of opportunities to work on different topics."

517,Teva Pharmaceuticals,"Local office, not so good. The rest of the company based out of MA and out of the United States provides better management and a bitter work environment.I work from 8:30-5pm at my current position at Teva, Mon-Friday.   I have learned how to use Oracle, Image Now systems in the almost 7 years here.   I am a team player and value my job and have a strong worth ethic.    The most enjoyable part of my job is working on resolving issues that arise from internal and external customers.Teva Pharmaceuticals is a great company to work for..The benefits are great, vacation time is generous, and work/life balance is pretty solid. However, advancement opportunities are available seemingly only in specific departments.Great people, culture, compensation. The dual business model of generics and branded products has provided stability during the industries ups and downs.very quick paced environment, great people, great opportunities and great pay. They offer great benefits and compensation depending on what shift you work. Great leadership as well. The company has a bright future.Not a good place for bluecollar workers. Always under pressure to perform and always worried about losing your job. Management is too concerned about their own survival to be concerned about their direct reports. However there are quite a few nice people there, but as the saying goes, ""nice people finish last"".Very good work environment. Not sure about job everyday. Family environment.Overall very good work place. Management very good and good benefits. Co-workers very helpful.The company has great benefit for yourslef and your family. It was a little strict but it was becuase everything has to be in people ready.Teva Pharmaceuticals is a great place to work.  Good work life balance.  Accurate balance between base salary and bonus.  Management team that considers sales force when making decisions.I was appalled by the culture. Falsification of documentation was a daily occurrence. SOPs and approved process rarely followed. Compliance and patient safety was an afterthought. Hired as a ""GMP Specialist"", but quickly found out GMP was not at all a priority. Tried to address it with management and HR. Big mistake on both counts.Very good company to work for. The work load is very reasonable. Management do change usually, however it is just titles, the people stay the same. Great coworkers, the environment is not at all toxic.most enjoyable part of the job is the team is very good at being international, a global company feels much smaller due to weekly meetings.The leadership at Teva has grown ever more evil over the last few years - there really is no other word for it.  The HR department in the US is run by clowns who were fired from their previous companies.  The corporate headquarters in Israel wants to get its hands in the daily business more and more, even though they don't understand American tax, compliance, or operations.  They continue to cut headcount so that they can keep investors happy.  That's great if you're an investor, but it's terrible if you're an employee there.  You will be required to carry your iPhone everywhere and respond to emails immediately, doesn't matter if you're at a funeral or if it's Christmas you're going to suck it up if you want to keep your job.  The pay and benefits are amazing which is why most people stay there because the compensation is difficult to match.  But make no mistake, you are selling your soul and your health if you stay there.  If you get an interview, be sure to ask how many US employees have committed suicide in the last year, and how many have had heart attacks, or stress related illnesses.  Do yourself a favor and run away from that place as fast and as far as you can.it was a good company to work at and gain valuable experience in the pharmaceutical industry. The hours were good and the compensation was good.Horrible experience interviewing......manager from PA wanted to prove something and was visciously trying to degrade me during our meeting.  Asked such irrelevant questions should have reported her....this place not worth the culture.....very bad wrap.  Manager wasn't even professionally dressed.  Glad I ended the interview abruptly...lolTEVA is a top pharmaceutical company and treats their employees the way a top pharmaceutical company should.  Going to work was a delight and compensation was on par with most major pharma companies.Changed managers 4 or 5 times while I was there. No security.  Morale of the employees and many leaders at a very low. Pay is low with very little raise each year, benefits OK. Appreciation is not shown often. The work is not hard but full attention is necessary to eliminate costly mistakes, which makes it stressful.I've been with this company for about 2 1/2 years. Since the beginning I have learned a lot about pharmaceutical medications, FDA regulations, and mostly safety. This company's main concern is their employees safety. This specific plant in Utah is still growing and has the potential to grow bigger. TEVA is a huge worldwide company and is very successful being one of the top producers of generic medicine, which means job security. As the company grows there is new regulations, new rules and new processes but that comes with every growing company.Teva Pharmaceuticals is a great company with great benefits. Employees stay there for years and still walk around with a bright smile on their faces.  Interaction among everyone is encourages and appreciated.  Working at Teva has allowed me to learn the importance of being even more detailed and achievable person.I work hard daily to ensure all duties and task have been completed in a timely manner. The location is great. The people are great and the benefits are awesome. They care about their employees.No chance for advancement,cheated out of raises each year,90% of managers don't know the job and lean on employees to pull their weight.No training program whatsoever.They make you sign off on computer based Sops and barely give you a chance to read them.I ran products several years without being signed off on anything.The only time they worry about following rules and plant cleanliness is when there is company coming.Supervisors and Leads sign off stuff without even checking it and are too lazy to gown up and go in the rooms to check stuff.Wonder how the FDA would like that!There are many valid reasons for the high CNE turnover rate as I will outline below:1) Integrity/ Teva values: They love to talk about it at meetings and in communications; but in practice, integrity is sorely lacking among the program manager and others in upper management. You often see a sugary sweet persona on the outside, but underhanded and deceitful behaviors in practice. Inauthentic and robotic interactions are the norm. Integrity comes naturally to the CNEs in the program, and in general is part of the genetic make-up of true nurses.It is the management that does not practice what they preach in terms of integrity and Teva values.,2) Advancement: Many highly qualified CNEs are groomed for management positions but are then overlooked for promotions when positions become available. Long-time Teva employees with Sales and Marketing backgrounds are selected over well-qualified nurses to manage CNE teams.3) Sales people managing clinical staff: Why are managers with absolutely no healthcare or clinical experience/background allowed to observe and/or participate in patient trainings and interfere with the sacred patient/nurse dynamic?  This is out of their element and they are not qualified to participate in any way.4) Common sense is nowhere to be found. If you have a brain and like to use it, think twice before you sign on because your ideas are not appreciated or welcomed.5) Poor communication: Things change all the time but new information does not always make it to everyone who needs to know about it. Processes are not enforced uniformly."

All employees are encouraged to put forward and initiate projects to enhance the overall experience at TEVA. From my hire date till present the site is almost unrecognizable.

However, advancement opportunities are available seemingly only in specific departments.Ten hr day,  where I had to mix large bins of chemicals.

Only to satisfy immediate need and not consider the long term effects.Employees are the given the impression of been involved but its far from the truth.It is a place where the people are awesome and the environment is motivating. The days fly by at work and you get paid well. the company performs well and is in a great industry.Love the company it's amazing all around and they do everything the way it should be done and have the best management and go by there own values to keep the environment welcomignTeva is an excellent company with hard working dedicated employees.  The work days are long and fast paced, but the teamwork makes it all worth while.  The hardest part of the job was the downsizing required after each of our multiple acquisitions.I am an independent contractor and have the ability to create my own work schedule. Within this position I have had the opportunity to strengthen my interpersonal skills. I am able to in interact with different patients on a daily basis and train them on their therapy. It can be challenging to at times to enter patient's homes although, it not only has strengthened my skills as a nurse but in turn has strengthened my communications skills.Very good work environment. Not sure about job everyday. Family environment.Overall very good work place. Management very good and good benefits. Co-workers very helpful.Pay is good. Not a secure place to work if you don't want to worry about your job every two months. If you want to find out more try and work there I guess.I love my job there. Always some thing new to learn and share with my colleagues. I have learnt a great deal of knowledge. Management is pretty flexible and cooperative.Very good and nice company . I leave this company because my school i love it and they have very good management . You alway's happy to be part of the team ."
582,The Advisory Board Company,"I was only an intern at the company for little over a month and a half last summer... but I had a great experience working for such a high end company for the first time.Working retail is like a surprise party, you never know what to expect but it will be wonderful When a customer enters the store I assist them with their every need, if it be a small gift for themselves, a gift for a special occasion, or a corporate gift. Personal service is key to customer service and it pleases me to provide it!I can honestly say that the people at the Advisory Board are the smartest I've ever worked with.  They're very technically savvy and interacting with them is pleasant (especially from my position in IT).  The business processes are somewhat outdated, but we're working to change them.  I'm very bullish on the future of ABC.I've loved working here. I would recommend anyone looking for place to start their career to look here. They are very fast, and systems oriented, and also offer great training. Very selective though.Company is filled with many bright and talented individuals. Training and onboarding are rapid and do not allow for an adjustment period. Management, unfortunately, likes to micro-manage. Benefits package is robust and more than generous. ""Work/Life Balance"" is touted often, but you are judged for not making your job part of your life.Fun place to work but definitely will have some growing pains. Need to work a lot of overtime for a very minimum salary. Will learn a lot and get support that you need but it is not the best place to work.great place to work for. lots of opportunity for someone with no experience in the work place. Lots of vacation, not enough time t take them.Over the 3 years I've worked at the company it has struggled to transition from a startup to a larger organization. Lot of the fun qualities that attracted top talent have left, along with the talent. The software is facing scaling issues and lacks the flexibility needed to stay competitive in the current market.Advisory Board is a great place to grow your career. You're going to be around highly motivated, and intelligent people, who are also there to see your succeed.A sincere company that earnestly wants to be as good as it can b, but is in conflict between product and service driven priorities.Great culture with brilliant employees, everyone is incredibly hard working but can make it difficult to maintain a reasonable workload.  Salaries are quite lowGreat culture and intelligent bunch of people to work with. Great opportunities for career advancement. Great benefits and paid time off. Only con that I can think of is that the compensation is a little low for entry level jobs.Great benefits, working with smart, great people. Can work from home, lots of PTO days. Management was chaotic, and they kept incompetent people around for way too long.I did not serve directly on this board as the contract that I was working under expired prior to a meeting being held.  The board was created to assess and recommend projects for the school.Difficult for career advancement for non-consulting positions. Transparency in communication of expectations across multiple areas is lacking. Collaborative working space. Benefits include typical health benefits, but also include gym memberships, healthy life hours, and community impact hours.Great work place to start right our of college.  Everyone is super young, including management.  Which is a draw-back.  Once you're no longer interested in an entry-level position, it is extremely difficult.Great people. Bad work/life balance. Decent managers that are transparent. A lot of work but good experience if you are a new graduate entering the workforce.Working for Crimson, the Austin-based subsidiary of the Advisory board, can be pretty rewarding. The office is modern, the people are smart, and there is potential to do exciting work. However, the company struggles with product acquisitions and working on one of those teams can be a nightmare. The company also struggles with its upper level management and strategies and during my time there I witnessed a lot of wasted money and effort because of meaningless corporate politics and misguided decisions. Finally, managers and directors talked a big game when it came to creating a solution for data analytics in the healthcare space but never showed or proved that they had even the slightest clue as to actually creating a marketable product in this category.The purpose of the one advisory board  was to improve communication, access to care and collaboration with other colleagues who were nurse educators to improve the MYO programABC is a fun place to work with great benefits and trips involved. They make it sound pretty glamorous as far as advancement, chanting that in 8-12 months with internal internship experience and great performance you are for sure going to get promoted and in turn make a high a salary... don't believe it.They find an ""excuse"" to deny almost every promotion, and hand out performance plans to ever entry level employeeA day in the concierge position is never Typical! anything can happen and anyone can come off of the elevator. You have to be aware of your surroundings and always one step ahead!"

679,The Boeing Company,"Global leader in Aerospace and Aviation. World Class IT organization. Enterprise Finance Systems are state of the art. System performance and uptime is 99.9.Compensation:Salary is middle to slightly below market value. Health plan is acceptable as a single person and is wonderful for employees with a family (family partial inclusion in plan). Depending on location and type of work, advancement is either slow or nearly impossible. Culture:Relaxed and slow-paced with intermitting rushes. Company tries to modernize in technology and mentality. Minimal sexism, racism, elitism; however, noticeable ageism. Younger (1-10 yrs) sometimes viewed as severely inexperienced or incompetent, more so than justified. Management: Variable depending on position. However, a noticeable aspect about some of the managers is that they put an extensive amount of energy into pleasing upper level management; so much so that their leadership roles take a toll. Lifestyle:40-45 per week is typical in most non-management positions. Most have paid overtime.Best company wage wise.   Management does not know how to manage people. They have taken all incentives away from us. They tell us lies about a union and workers on the floor just don't care anymore.  It's just a job now.  Nothing special.We really need a union, for wages, benefits and our future to take care of our families.  All they care about is the numbers game.They are willing to bring in union buster people for months and pay them and put advertising on radio and tv to stop the union.  Then they throw a big party for the management for a job well done.   They could have given us a raise with the money they spent on the campaign to stop the union.Now management treats us very poorly. They have the edge to fire us if we don't do what they say.  Bad situation for everybody.Wish I never would have taken this job 5yrs ago.Keeping a globally distributed, non-standard infrastructure available with minimal down time takes many hands. Management either rotates or changes every few years which made career success a moving target. Co-workers tend to be close knit, even to the point of being like family, which makes departures very hard on morale. The allure of short term cost for outsourcing critical functions seems to blind managers to the loss of control, quality and reputation of the IT department. Rebuilding the IT department from the ground up may be the only way to keep it from collapsing in upon itself.The most enjoyable part of the job was greeting new people to the team, making them feel welcome and valued; the hardest part was watching them all leave, mostly involuntarily.My days at Boeing are filled from start to end with challenges. I have learned patience, time management, how to work with different types of individuals and how to focus on customer satisfaction. I find myself having such a heavy workload that I have little if no free time for family and personal growth. I enjoy seeing my team grow into a organized and proficient unit. I have had the luxury of meeting many helpful managers, HR, management support, and co-workers, and I have learned so much from them.The quantity of work is dismal. It used to be thriving but has significantly dwindled since the contract has changed hands. The management gives no consideration for it's employees' well being. They hide behind the shroud of a government contract, blaming its literature for the severe lack of fringe benefits. Pays it's employees the absolute bare minimum as mandated by the US Government.  No performance raises, ever.Boeing (IT specifically) is a good place to launch a career, but don't count on advancing even if you are walking on water. Too much bureaucracy in management will stifle your growth. On the flipside, if you are a minimum effort type of employee, Boeing IT is a great place to work. You will be compensated the same as the guy next to you pulling all your weight!I'm salaried, work in an office.I don't want to come in to work. I've been here for 10 years and I think I get treated worse every year. The managers are more interested in doing what their boss tells them then growing their people.If you suck up and find the right ""mentor"" (read executive cheerleader) you'll do great. If you have opinions and share them (I've seen people share them well and people share them poorly; all with the same results) then you are labeled a troublemaker.After 4 years in a role, I went from the minimum pay at 0.75 of market reference to 0.80 of market reference. My job duties are insulting. There are no growth opportunities to speak of.Just nod your head and back away slowlyGreat company with lots of opportunities.  Great benefits.  The most enjoyable part of the job is solving the most complex issues and opportunity to work with the brightest individuals and be part of the aerospace and defense industry that connect and protect the world. Boeing Management CEO and CIO are top notch.  Typical day at work includes working on the most complex issues in Information Technology with a great team!   Challenges are frequent layoffs, and hard to get a promotion at senior levels due to high number of senior team members.I am a young, intelligent, hard-working communication professional. I was at Boeing for almost a year, and I have been thoroughly traumatized by my experience. There are many, many corrupt, unethical, incompetent first-level managers it's astonishing. I was bullied by management and unfairly treated. I developed extreme anxiety and depression as a result. I did not feel safe at Boeing.The company is disgustingly regressive and bureaucratic. It's policies and practices are very outdated and make no sense. Boeing is not evolving. They will not last at this rate.What I have outlined is just the tip of the iceberg as I am not willing to spend any more time, thought or energy into The Boeing Company, other than the all of 5 minutes I spent crafting this review.Executive-level calendaring • Compose correspondence based on subject matter and awareness of executive's business priorities • Appropriately fields calls and requests to determine necessary action • Facilitate business conferences, team meetings and events • Track action items and distributes them based on commitments and deadlines and process travel expense reports.Worked on a 6 month contract as a Project Manager. The work was very interesting and important to making Boeing more competitive. The company and the people working for the company are very talented. My advice to senior leadership: There are too many levels of management in the organizational chart and a culture of ""consensus decision making"" which makes it difficult to implement necessary change.The company provides outstanding benefits, to include tuition assistance, paid training, health care, and a fair salary.  However, the culture of the business leadership is generally unwelcoming to new ideas to cut cost and increase profitability.  The multiple layers of management typically act as a filter, leaving most good ideas from employees on the desk of a mid-level manager somewhere, decaying before it can reach someone capable of funding the idea.Overall Boeing is a good company to work for.  They have recently hired a lot of younger people and let the more experienced employees go.  They have great benefits, opportunity to move around the Company doing different jobs.  They have a great educational benefit.I loved the work.  There was just too much of it.  The jobs are extremely stressful.  There is little work life balance.On a cost-plus USG contract, it was Boeings upper level management advising Project Managers to do construction projects incorrectly and utilize inexperienced and cheaper Project Managers who would process change orders and think this was a good thing, as these same Boeing upper level managers terminated all the older and much more experienced but more expensive Project Managers who would save the government customer time and money on these projects. The individual Project Manager salary, if reduced allowed Boeing to keep the delta.The Boeing company cares about its employees and provides great benefit and healthcare. Also, the salary is wonderful. Boeing culture is deeply strong and long lasting. I would work for this company again, if the opportunity is present itself again.I enjoyed my life when working with such an awesome company.  It came to a stand still when there was no room to advance in my field.  It is almost impossible to change fields unless you know the right people and get the right support from your direct manager.  They have to fight for you to do anything different than what you were hired to do.  And some are not sure what that is when it comes to Staff Analysts.  Yes you can have a manager that doesn't know how to manage you. They do great with the engineers but for administrative personnel they are lost.  So you have to make it your business to not get comfortable and try your best to move around the company so you can learn new skills and have longevity in your skill code or advance to another skill code.For the money that they pay, this is a very easy job to do.  With the training they give you, and the teammates around you, the work is clean, simple, and the workers are generally compensated well for their time.  That being said, there are management issues.  there are some excellent managers there, but they seem to outnumbered by mediocre or outright bad ones.  And the managers are rotated periodically among the teams, so an employee is not stuck with a given manager.  But you never know what manager you will get next.  might be good, might be someone trying to make their name and now they have a whole new team of people they don't know anything about.I was with the Boeing company for over 10 years.  It is a great place to work and grow, but it is hard to advance in certain areas or to even get employed with the company.  But once you are employed you do have access to a great deal of knowledge and training.  The downside about working for Boeing is job security.  Whenever there is a change in management there is almost always a layoff or a tightening of budget, that's just the nature of the beast.Labored, but productive depending on where you were working on the airplane.I learned that the union has a big influence on how things can be ran on the production floor.Management varies depending how long they have been in the position and if they are trying to make a war with the union.Co-workers are ok as long as they aren't pushed too hard by management. Retaliation is a big issue in this environment.No team work. You are left to sink or swim on your own. No help for team mates if you are verbal about the union in any way.Being able to work with my hands and getting some of my team mates to work together to meet requirements.Boeing has given my family a great lifestyle, and of course a great income with benefits. I personally have been evolved in programs starting building new tool for the 757 & 767. Worked 707, 727, & 757 which are not being made now. I work all commercial aircraft in Boeing great line of products. I've also work military project B2, space station, AWACS , one shop I work in built the Lunar dune buggy. Which is still on the moon. During two layoffs I had job such as white river bus driver, & manufactured home warranty repairman. I have other experience such as street maintinence in Tacoma. Auto service work for Tacoma police, & small engine repair."
193,The Boston Consulting Group,"Standard work environment to the typical office position. Nothing above or below typical standards. Nothing more to add.BCG provides endless opportunities to get involved in a multitude of different client experiences. The caliber of talent at this firm is second to none making it a great environment to learn and grow. Oftentimes, the client work can be a little tough making work/life balance out of reach sometimes. Overall, salary and benefits at the firm are great other than the vacation policy (15 days for employees that have worked less than 5 years)Accelerated learning platform with great benefits/ perks. Think of it as a highly paid MBA. Great culture, different from all other consulting firms; will definitely develop you as a person and position you to achieve your career goals.A compartmentalized and regementalized top-down environment leading to massive amounts of inefficient effort. Decorum wins over substance. Excellent benefits.Amazing company to work with. The co-workers are smart which helps you indirectly, as you are working in a very competitive environment.The HR people need to be more pro-active thoughThis is a repeat of the last survey. I do not understand why we have to continue to do this just to place our resume online. Nice benefits at this companythe pace is very rapid. I star by having breakfast at the cafeteria, we were really spoiled, having everything we may want for breakfast. it doesn' t take long though, but it delights our day.I start the day by going over my emails and my boss s ones, organize, archive some answer or dispatch some. I follow up very closely the calendar, which is an important task to do. organize meetings that may include dozens of people fro different countries with different time zones and try to find a suitable time for everyone which can be impossible sometimes, but we make it happen. I also organize marketing events starting by the invitations, the catering and also the venue. it s so rewarding when a marketing event meets big success. I had wonderful boss, hard working, serious organized, and knows exactly what he wants and on the top of that very human.I really enjoyed working at BCG.Ultimately I needed to leave because there wasn't enough room for me to advance when I was ready, but I miss working there.  The culture is amazing, and I love the people there.High impact client workVery intelligent and humble co-workersGreat emphasis on training and feedbackAwesome network of dedicated and smart peopleThe best and most supportive co workers I have ever worked with.Hardest part of the job was trying to impress my boss, easiest was everything that came naturally to me; ex. organizing, event planning, setting up lunches, contacting vendors, emails.Most enjoyable was getting to be creative in different things. Wrapping presents, thinking of ways to make the office feel like home, décor for lunches/events, etc.Overall great company, atmosphere and  lovely co-workers. I absolutely adore working here! I couldn't imagine life without BCG. Constantly learning knew things!An Excellent top 100 company to be employed for!  This company supplies its clients with superior services and attention to their financial needs.  The work environment is superior and the professionalism is exemplary.Consultants are expected of a lot. Due to the large number of MNC clients who are operating in different time zones, client meetings can often occur at inconvenient times, resulting in long hours. Overall BCG Shanghai was a great place to intern as a start to a career due to exposure to clients, the consulting industry, and knowledgable, driven coworkersExcellent Corporate Culture, expansion plans and success rate is impressive.Management is excellent, treat consultants as employeesThis company values money over everything. Integrity and empathy are not visible within the Houston office. Next years ""best companies to work for"" will illustrate the cracks within this company.A typical day for me at BCG started with hearing about any urgent issues from my coworkers and/or checking my emails for any tickets or issues. Every day was a little different, one day I might be re-imaging laptops the next I might be doing inventory for supply orders, or providing onsite support at a meeting. Day to day varied quite a bit. Having IT support in the office, when most of the office is traveling frequently, means having to balance between office and online support. For me it was great because I enjoy fast pace work and providing customer service. A great group of people both personal and professional.  Management very supportive and fair.  I enjoyed my coworkers the most, they were the best part of my day.This company is excellent. The work was very easy to accomplish. The manager is awesome. Great working environment. I was able to come in ten minutes early so I could leave ten minutes early to go to my afternoon job.I have never worked for a company like BCG before. The expectations are high which makes you always want to go above and beyond to meet and maintain those standards.We work hard and play hard. You can't beat the benefits package. There are not many places that take care of you the way that BCG does.Great company to work for, it gives a decent push at your resume. The work environment is ideal for a productive time at BCG. The learning is based on an advanced knowledge sharing between the employees, you can clearly feel that people at BCG do not work for themselves, they strive for an excellence in business that the company represents. I'd say that is what makes BCG different than any other company you can work for, it's bigger than yourself, it's contribution to the world of tomorrow.BCG offers the opportunity to work with some of the best minds on todays most challenging business problems. The firm provides an opportunity to be on the inside track of cutting edge thought leadership. Coworkers are collegial, interesting, and driven while the management organization is very flat. However, much is expected out of employees and the hours can be quite long. The learning curve and relationships formed at BCG overshadow the long hours as a great place to cut your teeth in the strategy world or if you have the stamina, to shape the business world over a longer period of time.* Great medical benefits, lack of advancement, the hardest part of the job is separating work/life* Management is not very supportive"
14,The Climate Corporation,"I love the level of talent at this company and the fact that we are solution-focused, rather than problem-dwelling... as I have too often seen in the corporate world.The Climate Corporation was a great place to work for people who love to be on the forefront. All of my co-workers in the field were wonderful to work with and get along with. It was exciting to work for a company that was innovative and changing the way modern agriculture is interpreted by the farmer."
323,The Clorox Company,"It was a fast job you had 2 move real fast and keep up. Good personality up there but they really do care about you up i liked the job.They look down on the good workers and praise the lazy workers. They believe that whatever they wanted to do was ok, didn't really care too much about how the workers feel. Didn't appreciate the hard work and dedication I put in.Load and unload trucks with forklifts, pallet jacks, or cherry pickers with Clorox products. Conducted inventory control. Managed and reviewed customer orders/requests and manually enter data of orders.Coordinated with shipper’s customer service representatives on exceptions, rush orders and order changes.It was easy money. No one on your back. laid back supervisors. Great environment clean enviornment. Really enjoyed my time there keep count of your pointsIt's an ok place to work. I moved while I was working there so the commute turned into a hassle for me. 82 miles 1 way. Not their fault.When working 4 10s a week I put up with it because I had 3 days off.Then my hours changed to 4 9s M-Th  and 4 hrs. on Friday. I tried it for about 3 months but after a while the 164 mile round trip wore on me so I put in my notice.The Clorox Company is an excellent place to work.  There is a perfect work / life balance. Good atmosphere, Safe environment, Excellent health benefits.Clorox (unlike any other company) has a positive, engaging and inspiring work environment.  You can work hard but you can also find time to play. Management encourages you to learn more and to consider advancement.  Excellent place to work but benefits are not offered to everyone.It is a traditional company with more than 100 years of history.  To advance in this company, one needs to be in the ""in group"" with the few senior managers.Keeping all safety procedures and rules enforced. Stocking and handling hazardous chemicals.  Very busy tidy work place, always new employees.The day always starts off good at Clorox. There are lots of people with different backgrounds and ages who are there to help anyone that just started the job. The thing that i loved most about this job was that they always had things for you to do. I learned that Clorox does not only ship clorox products but others as well, and that taught me once again uu cant judge a book my its cover.  At this job i also learned more about my personality as well as my future. Because the job had many people  that i got to meet and grew alone with them, I had a better understanding of what life is really about.Its a very good first job for new comers. It definitely prepared me for a warehouse workplace. The pay rate started off fair, and became excellent after a while. I liked it. My co-workers were the best.Wonderful work life balance, managers are very knowledgeable.  Work is always challenging and exciting. Co-workers are always pleasant and engaging.Unfortunately, the plant closed. I enjoyed my time working for Clorox. I learned a lot and felt like I truly contributed to the company. The pay was great and I loved the hours. I appreciated how safety conscience the plant was.It's not one of the best places to work but if you need something fast it's ag guaranteed job but the hardest part of the job is standing in the heat for that long it's a lot of drama there sothe Lee's you talk the Less you talk to people the betterClorox cares for their employees and that is shown through the people you work with. The people you work with here are irreplaceable. The culture and work environment are outstanding.Good company, a fun place to work.  A ton of visibility to upper level management.  Very friendly work environment, I would recommend.  They compensate the interns very well.I love working at Clorox and would continue if I could pursue my ideal role from my current location.   Unfortunately, such an opportunity does not exist in my current location. Next steps for me would mean continued heavy travel and / or another move for my family and me.My first job was at The Clorox Company, and they do great job of teaching you how to transition from college to a work environment. A typical day deals with a lot of meetings, phone calls, and some lab time. Most managers are strong people developers who truly want you to succeed. Coworkers are friendly and the work environment promotes collaboration allowing you to talk to anyone at any level at any time. The hardest part of the job is that when you're in a position you have to stay in that position for about 2 years before they will rotate you. Most enjoyable part of the job is how rewarding it is to see the products you've worked on in stores.Great place all co workers treated you like family. Learned so much while working there. Great benefits from helping you out with school and time off if needed.Worked as a team member. Ran machinery, assembly, and fork truck. There was only one other women on the shift that I worked at so I missed getting to talk to someone that had the same interests as I did. I had a hard time sleeping during the day because I had  sons at home at that time. The lack of sleep really got the best of me.Need to be able to work independently and with others that included diverse leadership styles to include:Extreme detailed, clear written and oral communication skills, taking ownership of a project from beginning to end, define current and future processes, work in an extremely fast pace environment, high quantity and quality of work needed"
603,The College Board,"Proctoring the SAT Test for high school students.The job is very enjoyable, But it is not a consistent year long job. The test is only given a few times per year.Go thru emails every morning, check on job orders placed previously, handled members phone calls, assisted co-workers with conference/meeting preparation. Company provided classes on microsoft, etc.. (professional development). Conferences were fun, especially in another city, but hard if a speaker was late/no-show, sometimes a session had to be cancelled at the last minute.I loved the company. Management was great. The people in the department that I worked with were great. Typical day for me would be logging into my computer and reviewing our SS. This would set a focus for the day. Next I would review emails and voicemails left by customers. I would then prioritize callbacks and the urgent cases from the SS.I've learned to face my fears and not to allow fear get in the way of success.This is a nice stable environment if you are at the point of your career where you want to take it easy and predictable. If you are young and hungry and trying to get ahead and get significant experience this is not the place for you. I would avoid non profits until I am further ahead in my career.grey cubicle kind of officegreat initiatives, slow movingI worked directly with my director in department. I worked with students who had disabilities who were seeking accommodation on college entrance exams and work with their school counselor or special education department or parents in this process as every case was different. My manager traveled a lot so he kept me in charge and I was responsible for our two vendors, ETS and Xerox, and traveled at times to train them on our systems and go over new policies and procedures and making sure they were up to bare and answer any inquires they may have. If I didn't travel, then I would train via WebEx and prepare training manuals and every two weeks or so, my manager and I work hold a conference call to keep an update on their department. After 2.5 years, my contact expired and unfortunately, I lost my job and have been unemployed since then with the exception of administrative assistant and receptionist work through various temp agency as well an Nanning for several years as I love kids, education and working in customer service as I am a people person, but with a shy personality.The College Board is an organization that cares deeply about the educational experience of students. This organization is concerned with improving academic rigor around the country and tries to be innovative in its approach to developing educational tools. A typical day consists of multiple meetings with executive level colleagues; we engage in planning different stages of a new program or product. I've learned a lot about the importance of communication and planning, structuring processes so that others can follow work plans effectively, and the importance and power of being proactive and taking initiatives.  I've enjoyed meeting academics from different disciplines and working closely with them to develop academic tools and programs.  I've also enjoyed meeting heads of educational organizations with whom we work collaboratively on developing various educational services. I'm proud of having put together a team of very talented and creative colleagues and working alongside them to develop new programs in the arts and in the global learning fields.The hardest part of the job is to develop new programs quickly and effectively, especially new programs have multiple internal and external dependencies. The most enjoyable part of the job is to work with talented and creative colleagues who care about the students and the teachers we serve. I also enjoy being innovative in my work and constantly learning new information and new skills.Since starting at the College Board I have noticed that happiness is based on your manager. Some managers are very flexible, ""family friendly"" and open minded while others are very by-the-book and firm. These inconsistencies make some departments favored by employees and set a negative tone in others.Limited development due to functional siloes in HR departmentIt was a short and great experience. I graduated in May and found this job in August. As College Board had  lag in Account receivable department. I was part of collection team and helped them in reducing Account Receivable (A/R).A great place to work.  Driven to the mission of equity and access.Great compensation and benefits with even a perk of payment for your kid's college.  Professional and dedicated to their people.I really enjoyed the people I worked with and they were very fair with me.CB is a great place to gain work experience. While although a non-profit, they pay well and offer excellent professional development opportunities.The best part of the job were the occasional perks and my co-workers.Manged team responsible for processing transactions for College Board products and services as well as registrations for professional development workshops. Learned how to navigate fine line between organization as a non-profit mission-driven institution and as a business. Management was professional, receptive to employee ideas and accommodating to reasonable employee needs and requests. Co-workers were very committed to organizations goal to connect students to college success. Hardest part of job: Aligning program policies with operational efficiencies. Most enjoyable part of job: Collaborating with co-workers/colleagues. Passionate intelligent people are abundant within the walls of the College Board.Learned an enormous amount of information regarding educational systems outside the US.  The work of the College Board expands to students who live outside the US but dream of studying at a US institution.  The College Board does thankless work to make that happen.  Good benefits and good people but the adaption of the 'Common Core' will deteriorate the future value of the companyCollege Board is a wonderful company with a great mission.The new leadership team is great. I expect a lot of good things to happen at The College Board in the next few years.As long as you do your job well it is a great place to work. The benefits are unbelievable and a lot of great coworkers!"
27,The Gap,"They were very friendly and made the work enviroment great.Working at Gap Inc is a lot fun. I like how it can relaxed one moment then in the next moment it can become competitive. The motivation from my managers to push myself and be aggressive, makes me want to do so much better.Great Company always listening and helping you and treat you with respect Confidently and proactively help resolve issues for customers and balance number of customers in a busy retail environment. Contribute to a constructive work environment by consistently treat all Gap Brans workers and shoppers with respectThe typical day at work, for my position, is fast paced. I learned how to think on my toes and to merchandise in unique ways to sell product to customers. The management team is diverse, with a specific work ethic that all follow. The hardest part of the job is to complete shipment on time. The most enjoyable part is having control of all inventory, knowing what's in and what's out for the store, and talking directly to management about all the exciting things that will happen for the company.I worked for this company at the height of its popularity and found it to be a great place to work.  I would definitely go back to work for them if I wanted to get into retail management again.It was very exciting and fun job. I learned a lot about the retail business and had the ability to apply those skills in my future jobs. Management was poor and there was a lack of communication, but your coworkers were your family and the atmosphere was usually positive.Management gives you the opportunity to grow and get involved in other areas that make up company. I've had the opportunity to do so and I have to say it pays off.good place to work great benefits, peak season are long and tiring with long days and multiple days worked without a day off. Would recommend for hourly employmentGap was a short seasonal job. I absolutely love the atmosphere because it is so lively, but the pay was very low and there was literally only 4 to 8 hour weeks.A typical day at work requires us to sell and know about the products we are selling.You have to learn about the items and know what is best for each customer. Management was organized and wanted to achieve goals as a team. Co worker, were all lovely, fun, energetic and goal oriented. The job was not that hard its just frustrating working on holidays.the people are great very fun for a first job very outgoing people, gets busy during holidays so expect to be always moving, loved where it was located because at lunch or after work you have the court yard or can go shopping in the outlet, and the discount you get is great.I love this place, I love the people. The job is so easy and fun and I enjoy working here. A typical day at work can vary from shipment to fitting room to cashier and its always different and fun. I love my coworkers most of them are very nice and fun to be around. The hardest part is dealing with messy costumers and being on my feet all day.Great place to work with the people that is around you as they help you develop skills. Be prepare to work hard and always greet the customers no matter.Gap is a great place to work. The employees are like a second family and it doesn't even feel like work. I would have stayed for a long time but I moved. Forever missing Gap.Great place to work! Love the company that I have returned to work there again.Everyone there is friendly, and the atmosphere is great. They are willing to work with me on my schedule.The location, I worked at specifically, had an amazing management team and sales associates were just as great. Fast-paced, especially during the holidays, but great environment to be in.Black Friday crazy as always, but things are always better when they are organized. Well staffed and everyone was nice and respectful, even when it got late.I worked at Gap for about a year. I gained a lot of experience in customer service and sales skills. Management was great and they worked with my high school schedule.Orderfilling is great easy and fun, fast pace good school hours for working and if you are going to school. Health insurance is great!Fast paced work for large corporation. If you like big box stores, give them a try. Hard to adjust to the crazy holiday hours.It is a stable work environment with many opportunities. A great first job for anyone new to the workforce. Lots of hours and room for internal advancement."
1,The Judge Group,"The recruiter always called me back whenever i had any questions during the time of the contractTypical day at work was very much unsatisfying.I learned that you can't trust this organization at all.Management treats you like a dog!Co workers are back stabbers.Hardest part of the job was never being thanked for all the hard work you do.Can't say I enjoyed working for this company at all!!!a lot of turn around not too much job security, hardest part of the job is to build your client data base. management lacked a bitGreat company, great people to work with. There is a ton of opportunity to earn a good living if you work hard and dedicate yourself. There is a great work life balance and a work hard play hard culture. Very good opportunity for people who want to learn how to be a recruiter and do it well. Very strong support system and grade A training program. This company will provide you with all the tools to be successful.I only worked for Judge briefly. I started in the month of January and by resigned by May. I quickly realized how much I despised this place. By February I began looking for a new job. The office I worked in was very tiny (the size of a small closet). I worked with 3 other people in this closet. The girls I worked with were very mean and extremely rude. They would talk about you the second you walked out of a room and would stop the moment you returned. They were fake nice when you would try to talk to them. I never in my life felt so alone and excluded. I made every attempt to get along with them but they simply wouldn’t have it. I was often pulled into HR to discuss my work attire. There was a strict dress code there but only for certain people. I was in trouble for wearing black suede boots and a military style jacket yet my coworker was permitted to wear a denim jacket and cowboy boots. A lot of the women there would also wear micro miniskirts where I could see more than I wanted to yet my dresses were too short according to HR cause they didn’t cover my knees. The place was very “clicky”. It was like being back in High School. You were either a popular kid or a nerd. I tried to fit in but was pushed out every time I tried. It was very hurtful. I couldn’t get out of there fast enough! And if you like to have time off from work, forget about it! This company does not allow anyone to take unpaid time off and the accrual rate of time off is a joke. Your 1st year you get 3 days! Also, the benefits are probably some of the worst I have ever seen. For a large company,  more... they have horrible health benefits. You will literally be working there for just benefits but never get to use them because the deductibles are so high.  lessLoved the position I was in and really enjoyed working with the group of people I was with.  I learned quite a bit regarding Healthcare that I hope to use in the future.  I was very disappointed when I was told that the company I was working with did not want to keep me on past my 6 month contract date after I was pretty much convinced that I would be kept on through the next contract with the same company.I would definitely recommend this company for the college graduate or anyone who is in the market of looking for a job. They look to fit you with the best job to fit your experience.Onsite management needs improvement, high turnover in leadership resulting in job security for potential growth with job siteThis office has a great work environment! Everyone is wonderful and the director is the best. It is best to be confident in what you say and be prepared to make a lot of phone calls. You must definitely enjoy talking to people to succeed here!Good communication, responsive to employee inquiries, fair pay. Managers respond to inquiries concerning, job assignments, hours of work and pay issuesGood company to work for.  I like the fact that they pay weekly.  The beginning pay process I think may need some attention, and the fact that you have to track time in the assigned company's system, and also in Judge's system is a bit cumbersome and always involves coordination, etc.good first job out of college. not a lot of room for growth though. hours are long but you can make money at this job if you work hard. its a lot of luck so you need to be resilient.no work life balance and compensation is low for the amount of stress and hours you have to put in. Every day you have to come in and work on the same jobs over and over. Recently, they decided to stop using LinkedIn and Indeed as well, making recruiters lives harder.Worked from home on Insurance company's national project.  LOVED being a telenurse.The Judge Group was wonderful to work with -  Very Responsive, Well Compensated.  Would DEFINITELY work for them again!it seems the company as a whole has an ego problemthey are not about bettering themselves as a company but more about how they can kill one anotherthey dont even have good customersThe company is focused on metrics more than anything, and if you aren't hitting your numbers consistently then you're hearing about it.  There are a lot of jobs to be worked on, but the environment sometimes isn't very fun.  There is a lot of turnover and it doesn't show much stability.  Seems like the only successful people are those who have been there for 5+ years, junior recruiters have a hard time growing.All temp no chance for permanent.No matter what the recruiter says.Some what helpful but not a team surrounds.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxLove this company, the only problem is the Medical benefits, other than that it's awesome! This is a family oriented Company.Very skilled in matching employers and employees. I was placed in a position where I could shine.  I was able to learn quickly and cover many areas of accounting process.Most of the branches are pretty ok at judge, but working for healthcare in the corporate office (conshy) is extremely stressful.  In the past year alone they have gone through two internal recruiters which you would think is a bad sign since now the managers themselves are doing the internal recruiting.  Some account managers are very high strung, and those who run the office treat the recruiters like a number.  Most recruiters have to bend/break the rules to meet quotas mainly out of fear for being yelled at.  These recruiters work extremely hard, and at least 45 hours a week not including all the work from home to keep up with the cycle.They say the pay scale is competitive, however it is pretty basic compared to other firms, honestly 32,000 (about 13 bucks an hour...) after you get your bachelors is really low.  I feel like they are taking advantage of students coming right out of college. The commission plan is ok but its very rare to make anything noticeable in commission until after six months. The promotions they run are fairly difficult to hit, one recruiter out of thirty might get a small gift for hitting a quota. As recruiters we've been yelled at, and cursed at for things that we cannot control such as a candidate taking another job, not showing for their interview despite telling us they would, etc.  Again kicking you while you are down.  Since they try to motivate by fear, most people are too scared of losing their job to report anything.  If you are recently graduated and have few other options, then get some experience there and get out.  Hardest  more... part of the job - hitting the quota.Most enjoyable part - the recruiters and recruiting managers are nice people, but they are being taken advantage of.  The Judge family and executives seem like genuine people, though you dont hear much from them.  lessI enjoy my current position at Judge Healthcare. Lots of opportunity here to grow.I really enjoy the people and it is def a work hard play hard type environment"

They look to fit you with the best job to fit your experience.Your day starts out with a conference call first thing in the morning to go over most recent job openings.  During the call, recruiters are assigned to work each of those positions.  Once jobs are assigned, the day is spent posting jobs on the company website, sending email blasts and looking through the job boards for qualified candidates.  There is another conference call in the afternoon to check on the status of job openings from the morning as well as assign new ones that have come out since.

I was promised a position, but the organization suffered massive budget cuts.Good communication, responsive to employee inquiries, fair pay.

199,"The MathWorks, Inc.","People first culture. Great orientation meetings to learn about the company. Collaborative environment. A lot of great talent.Overall, MathWorks is a good place to work.  The product has very loyal users and continues to grow and evolve.  The devotion of the customers continues to make working with MATLAB a fun place to work.  But as in all companies the company can also be directly effected by the direct manager.Great company to work for if you are a Developer Or Quality Engineer. Your performance will be reviewed in terms of what work you do otherwise it is difficult to survive.I am moving for my boyfriends new job and have to leave this amazing company because there is no location where I'm going.Warning: This company will ruin you for life. They are incredible and I highly doubt I will be able to find a company this amazing again.They are picky with who they hire so if you get an offer consider yourself lucky. CEO- amazing, managers- amazing, growth potential- amazing, benefits- amazing.Ok, I'm getting repetitive. I have worked for many large companies before and none compare. I am sad to be leaving and wish MathWorks nothing but success in the futureIt's a great company with great benefits, but lower salary than most other companies within the same industry. (This comes from many departments within the company). It's very hard to improve anything because it always goes back to ""it's the way it's always been"" situation. Managers don't notice/value the time/work hard working employees put in, which makes it very hard to move up within the company.Assisted with the creation of lesson plansLearned how to teach teenagers math and make it as enjoyable as possible. The coworkers were really involved into teaching others and helping me learn the process of teaching kids.I interned in Mathworks in Fall 2015. I learned about the MATLAB editor and compiler. Mathworks is a very cool place to work with.Even as a new intern, I was given a lot of responsibilities.Great people, great work. Lots of interesting projects going on. I enjoyed interning here. The main focus is on quality.Awesome place, awesome almost everything about it. Interesting work, great people to work with, and great benefits. Pay is more than industry average, but slightly less than inner-city Boston or Cambridge (like 10% less, since they are almost an hour outside of the city).MathWorks does everything it can to listen to the staff and make their lives easier. Happy people make for a collaborative culture and you feel like you make a difference.Awesome to be worked there.Working there gave me an immense pleasure in exploring my ideas and applying them in practical.The work culture is very serious and focused. The food is amazing. The benefits are good. Manager was a very co-operative and nice.Worked as a sales support intern, treated me extremely well.Great co-workers, friendly atmosphere, solid amount of work and opportunity.Atmosphere is fantastic.  However, not a lot of room for career growth.  Great way to gain experience.  Most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you helped make a difference for your customers.- Typical days at work involved team meetings, one-on-one meetings with team manager and reporting the progress every alternate day.- Hardest part involved researching  to develop the prototype for my project and debugging to get the desired result.- Overall, An awesome place to work with a fun-loving and high-energy team where co-workers are very supportive.Weak Middle ManagementThe hardest part of the job is managing the expectations of each level from management to end-users and coworkers.  Management micro-manages under the guise of collaboration. Had to play arbitrator between upper and middle management. Huge discrepancy between the role that was sold to me and the role that others expected. My manager explained role one way and my coworkers had completely different expectations of my role which caused enormous problems, then my manager was frequently absent and when present was largely unavailable to deal with infighting.HR is like a high school clique - unapproachable and doesn't have the time for anyone not in their crew.Recruiters will give you the rainbows and unicorns version of the company culture, but it only applies to one or two departments. Any other department is hit or miss.MathWorks has a strong corporate culture with variations for the team.  One can tell that the executives have thought through the mission/values and they actually follow that.  Most employees are very intelligent and motivated.  You need to find the group that you fit in because each one is different.  This also makes working across teams in a large projects difficult.I  learned a lot of team working skills, improved communication skills and had an hands on experience in working with cutting edge technologies.As a Master's student, Mathworks gave me a wonderful opportunity to learn and shape my career.Looking for a larger company that is a little less process oriented and more focused on gettingt the job done.The MathWorks has a good work culture and offers a lot of opportunities to demonstrate and develop your skills."
390,The NPD Group,"I have worked at NPD for less than a year. I am working in a part of the company that would be considered low skilled and less demanding when compared to other positions within the company. Right now I am very happy. In my position the environment is low stress and I am able to come in every day, get my work done, and go home. Currently my goal is to gain more computer skills in order to apply for a better position within the company. The only negative for me is I don't completely know how the company operates and what its goals are, I don't know what other people within the company do, I am not required to, but I wish they offered some more training and explanations of the company's many functions.You are expected to deliver the result no matter what. But do not expect to get any support. No one really cares about you.They can terminate you any time and in any way .High turn over rate at this company. Not worth it if you want to have career at this company.Its a great place to start your career. If you are a senior level employee then persue other options. As a senior developer i have not had any advancement of my knowledge or position. Manangers are junior and the staff is more knowledgeable.This was my first job and I was excited to start. From my interview experience, this place looked promising and a great start to a career. I was wrong. What they had me do was absolutely nothing at all similar to the job ad. I struggled. There was no training whatsoever, and the supervisor expected me to already know everything right away. Because I had no training, I created a vicious cycle where I would get projects wrong and my boss would get frustrated until I ended up feeling very inept. In essence, training is not in NPD's dictionary. They expect you to know everything right away---they threw all these acronyms at me as if I knew what they were already. On my first day, they threw a very complex project on my lap without any explanation on what it actually is, including what its acronym of a name stood for. Because of disorganized restructuring that seems to be ongoing, the work they had me do was not at all what I was trained to do, so naturally I was not good at it, which annoyed my supervisor. It made me think of a quote from the movie Office Space:  ""...it's not that I'm lazy, it's that I just don't care"" (also, I hope you like the cubicle farm, because that's what you'll get---in their headquarters, there are almost no windows whatsoever, so it's a bunch of cubicles and tiny offices that are lit by halogen lights, which is pretty depressing). There's really no incentive unless you are in dire need of a superficial ""you did it"" corporate banner on your cubicle. There's no room for growth, and many young people see this as just a gig until they find something better.  more... That is probably why there are few younger people in the office. More importantly, at least to the people around me, there's no work-life balance. People work on weekends, on their time off; they come into work earlier to work and stay late. This is all because of mismanagement an a generally inept method of work. Things keep messing up and the employees have to cover the slack of the higher-ups. There is a high turnover, which is unsurprising, as no one looks truly happy. As others mentioned, there is no room for innovation. They stick to outdated procedures that aren't that great. I should mention, however, that these experiences may differ from department to department, so I can't speak for all. Finally, I will also say that the benefits are not too shabby.  lessNice place to work, I did overnight for a period of time but overall it was a very quiet and relaxed place to start building my professional path.Autonomous work place with a good work/life balance.  It is all about the numbers and not so much about career growth and advancement.  Decent amount of red tape and politics, but manageable.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with clients and helping make an impact on their business.Its been many years since I stopped working there, but I can't imagine things have changed I was only with the company for 2 years and a few months and in that time there were multiple layoffs followed by mass hirings.  It is quite nerve racking not knowing when the next round will come or if you'll be included.  When I was hired, there were 6 other new employees in my department.  By the time I left, 3 of those 6 were already let go.  All the loss of staff means you are constantly being moved around doing things you were not originally hired for.  In my case, I was forced into a role I was completely unsuitable for (and uninterested in) thus leading to my leaving the company.   A typical workday consisted of meetings - hope you like to be in small rooms because there are small conference rooms all over the place and it seems like you just go from one room to another - better bring your power for your laptop (there were multiple instances of 4 people sharing power just to make it through the end of the meeting. I was hired through a recruiter - she described the place as a collegiate atmosphere.  This should've been my first warning.  They are constantly trying to make up for the lack of morale by forcing everyone every so often in team building exercises.  Basically there are 2 ways of looking at this - those who look at it as a great way to miss a day of work or those who look at it as a day wasted because now there is double the amount of work waiting when you come in the next day.  You're better off skipping any job postings for this placeGreat place to start a career. As you advance, you will learn less and less because the place is not motivated to change. Eventually, you will no longer have skills to compete in the marketplace and will be mired in internal politics.Great company.  Recently a lot of room for advancement due to growing company.  Good culture and great work life balance, but likely lower compensation than similar positions in other companies.NPD is a great company to work for. The hours are reasonable and workload manageable. If you enjoy analyzing data and telling stories, it is a fun company to be a part of. As with any data supplier, incomes are below that of a typical marketing position, but based on interactions with marketing departments across the industry, it is a relatively low stress field.Checking Calendars Preparing for meetingsMailProcessing ContractsUpdating ContactsFollowing-up on events for my managersBooking TravelManagement very understanding and a wonderful personCo-workers were amazing and helpful I enjoyed the flexibility and culture of the companyHardest part was the commutePeople work as a team. Great communication among all peopleNice atrium for relaxing or casual meeting.A great place to start your career. Great work environment with lots of hands on work, and great leaders to provide insight.NPD is going through a corporate transformation.  It's an exciting time to be part of the evolution and help drive change.Company has a hard time keeping up with current market. New senior management not clear about objectives and expectations. Company pulled in many directions without focusing on a clear path.I've worked there for over 18 years and now they are moving my department to Ireland.Place sucks dont do it,spend your time consulting or workingfor a large corporation. You will do all the work while othersgo play baseball and go shopping, your reward is to be part ofregular massive layoffs after your projects are done.Dont do it.I thought this was my dream job, but after working with your co workers and managers, you start to realize who is there for you and not too many people were, especially from my department. I won't recommed this job to anyone.管理层十分人性化，待遇福利非常好. 但是不同的部门会有不同的情形。在我的部门，工作量相对轻松，但是不够具有挑战性。"
618,The Tatitlek Corporation,"Great environment! Great management !   Excellent benefits! Best company i have worked for but i would like to further my careerI started this job with little to no training. I started when the company was in the process of changing policies so everything I was taught was outdated almost immediately. I had to constantly call and sometimes even stalk people to learn policies and how to use programs needed for my job. Then after a month I was let go because I was not ""learning fast enough"". I would only recommend this company to someone who plans to move to another company very quickly.Within the first week I learned about a huge group fighting within the company making it impossible to talk to one person without the other finding out and assuming you were on the others ""side"".Always looking forward to something new, and always learning new things, mangement is very good along with several of the co- workers, there is no really hard part of the job I enjoy every sigle bit of it.The duties of this position include a wide variety of tasks. Under my charge are four facilities labeled as MTUs (Marksmanship Training Units). These training units utilize training equipment called ISMTs (Indoor Simulated Marksmanship Trainers). My role is to maintain accountability of $8.7 million of government equipment, service the computer systems and weapons, perform maintenance tasks to these pieces of equipment, and troubleshoot issues in both the computers themselves, the connected equipment, and the simulated weapons systems.It was a rewarding job as we helped with training our U.S. Marines before deploying to Afghanistan."
206,The Travelers Companies,"Marketing, policy issue/verification, business developmentCoordinated efforts with other business units for productionI trained employees on computer system, handled medical only claims and made decisions whether claim was payable or denied and processed accordingly.  I later handled up to 6 week loss which involved making payments to patient, followed up on reports from doctors care and processed accordingly.  My management staff encouraged us to advance if we proved ourselves.  The hardest part of the job was handling injured patients that wanted more or thought they needed the benefits if their claim was denied.  The most enjoyable part was knowing i accomplished goals set by myself and management team and moving ahead with career.The company is up to date and ok with colored hair, tattoos, body modifications, and self expression to generate a very relaxed culture. Unfortunately, even though certain choices are ok with dress code or the ethics guidelines, there are team members, both front line service and sales and higher ups, that will judge you and formulate a very snarky opinion and not be afraid to show it. Favoritism runs rampant in the Traveler's office, and the work is monotonous. The pay, benefits, and close friends that you get from working there can be worth it.. but its ultimately if you can handle getting paid good money to work in a high school environment.Great company, well diverse group, offer inhouse training and classes, flexible hours, great vacation, good benefits, offer 401lk, job posting available, opportunity, equal treatment, good locationsThe job has good benefits. Company is full of middle management that micro manages and focuses on outcomes that benefit the company rather than individual customers. Steady presence of '2-faced' employees. Toxic corporate culture.Great opportunities for advancement for employees if mobile. Above average compensation with bonus potential. High expectations that are measurable and achievable. Work/Life balance has been a focus in recent years but still needs balance.There is NO Work/ Life Balance. They requirements and expectations are HIGH to ""Meet"" in order to stay a float and or ""Exceed"" in your job you can't have a LIFE outside of work. Although the Benefits are great, Insurance, PTO, etc. The Compensation is minimum is any! A raise is minimum and not something that would be expected every year. There is NO incentives for accounts bound/ issued, Audits exceeding goal, and or business growth at the end of the year. This was not what I was expecting as I came from Mortgage, in that field/ procession there was incentives all the time. It would push everyone to close more accounts, follow up on the customer surveys etc. Management is also ""by the book"" there is no ""Flexibility"" We are all adults working for a ""Living"" dealing with a micromanaging manager for me is defiantly an adjustment for me. I come from a manager and team that knows what needs to be done at the end of every day. If my job is being done, goals are being met or exceeded I don't feel it's necessary to pay for a ""Baby sitter"".You are well trained in your job expectations but there are many requirements you are expected to meet. If you preform well, the compensation is generous, but if your performance is average, so is your compensation. Also, there is a clear separation of powers between upper management and employees which make management intimidating and unapproachable.Understaffed for amount of work that expected. Management does not have a clue and was unresponsive to requests for changes. High amount of turnover in our department.A typical day at work consists of communication between myself and coworkers and managers. I learn everyday that there are creative and innovative solutions to solve problems. I manage a team of appraisers in efforts to coordinate their daily workloads. The hardest part of my job would be outages in the field, however this is where I get to exercise my strategic mind set. The most enjoyable part of job is know that at the end of the day I've helped our customers!You get out what you put in. Work hard, stay away from typical office drama, be present, and be vocal about your ambitions and you will succeed.  Remember, you are there to work and put your best foot forward and it will be noticed. The management is great and always have time to help.  Bonuses are good and not hard to obtain.  You're not micromanaged as you're an adult and capable of adhering to your schedule, plus your bonus is dependent on it. There is a really great family type of atmosphere here and you will become part of the group in no time!typical day at work was going thru your case load, and figuring out which formulas or programs were needed to prove/disprove numbers that people(clients , other areas in Pru) said were not correct.  Lots of computer work.- learned that anything can be figures out and that there is an answe for everything.-Management was great.-Co-workers were always there for each other.  Great Team!-I can not think of any hard part, but being part of that team was the best!Great benefits, decent corporate culture and family first. Flexible with scheduling and communication with management.Travelers is an excellent company for new in the insurance industry and seasoned veterans of the business  The company is global and offers opportunities for its employees to grow and develop within the organization.  Employees are encouraged to move within the company to grow professional and personally.  The work environment is very friendly and collaborative.Everything was ok. Learned a lot but not a career. Employees were helpful when needed help. The management seemed to be fair. It was great knowing I was able to help ppl get back on track with their lives after going catastrophes or accidents.Excellent company to work for.  Promotional opportunities are somewhat limiting.  Excellent work life balance and the culture is fantastic to be working in.Good pay job with benefits but no job security since consistently every year many different department are closing and outsourcingI interned at Travelers and it's a great company. The work culture is really amazing with great focus on work-life balance. Everyone working at Travelers takes great pride in the fact that they work there which I found very inspiring. Plenty of opportunities to grow at the firm and learn from senior leaders.No work life balance. Upper Management is defiantly the boys club. You are forced out if you don't agree with them. 90 hour work week for minimum pay. Coworkers were fantastic. When I had my own personal loss I was told I could not take time off and was put on a performance plan.In reference to working within this department, you can expect to be provided unrealistic output requirements. Being paid on a salary basis, expect to spend your nights and weekends as well as any FTO time working to meet the monthly expectations. And if you do not achieve them, you will be placed on warning. Miss them again, and the verbal warning turns to written and so on until you are terminated. There is no support for newly hired employees in the profession, but who are held to the same guidelines. There has been a large amount of mid-level management turnover as well. They're jumping off like fleas off of a dog.Avoid at all costs.good place to work, good culture, stable company, great people, work life balance also very good. opportunity for progress"
336,Theranos,"enjoyed my time with this company, typical work week. Management was great, fun co-workers. great job over all now I am on to better opportunities.I liked working for this company. I was involved in many projects and they had technology new to me. Unfortunately legal lssues made this company lay off many employees.Theranos has a start-up feel to the company and many people have to opportunity to create and engage in projects that they may have never done before. I have grown as a laboratory professional greatly from the experience Theranos has provided me.This job was a great job for entry level applicants and provided experience and advancement to my career. The upper management recognized potential and grows the people that showed drive.The environment was positive and we worked together to help each other succeed.  The typical day included performing venipuncture techniques to collect samples from guests, and preparing them for lab analysis.  The position was very enjoyable and management was very supportive.Good work culture. Nice place to work. Start up culture, very talented people highly motivate and product driven company. 9:00AM-6:30PM official work hoursWorking with Theranos had a great environment and great co-workers. I would gladly work with them again if operation in Arizona took place. I appreciated what my supervisor did as for his job incorporated. He was a great supervisor.By-far this has been the best company I have worked for. The employees here are amazing! A group of people who want to show up to work each day to provide the best experience for our guests and help in every way we can.unfortunately to secretive and lied to so many people.  Should have been a great thing for the patients who could have benefited from this fabulous thingI love the fact that my employer is an understanding one.  I go to school and they work with me on that.  I really appreciate everything they do.  Great place to work.This company is a high demand company that challenges you every day. It is a high energy culture with great people to work with and competitive benefits and pay.Sit in a room all day with nothing to do. Very low volume for patients. Favortism shown by management. No room for advancement.This is a great company with a lot of potential. But management shows favoritism towards individuals and it greatly noticed. The hours are constantly changing and over time is mandatory. You sit by yourself in a room for 8-12 hours. You are lucky to get 1 day off. Youdon't have a life while working here. On a positive note the pay is decent. You get to be part of a new and expanding company and interact with lots of different people.The company does not communicate well. There is basically no room for advancement and they hire in batches. There are no ""coworkers"" you work alone inside a room and your lucky to see 5 patients a day.  The hardest part of the job is sitting in a room for nine hours six days a week literally doing nothing productive.Very good company to work with and they provide free food breakfast, lunch and dinner.People here are very nice and creative, the working environment is also very energetic. However, the management team doesn't always have a clear goal and makes some bad decisions.Commute is too far. Should be an excellent company to grow with if their management is more professional, not too much political issues.Long shifts, six some times seven days a week. Decent pay but, no room to grow. Sit in a room alone with nothing to do, lucky to see 5 patients a day."
107,Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc,"The co-workers are interactive and ready to give an helping hand where need be. The managers are understanding and very much considerate and accommodates each an every team member. They also allow us to have flexible schedule as they don't micro manage the team. The hardest part of the job is being is when you find a mean customer.This is straight up the worst place I ever worked. Managers would insult employees right in front of other people which made for a very uncomfortable environment to work in daily. There is small select group of people and if you are not in that group they do not care about you and you will not be there long. I got text messages at home while I was trying to sleep to let me know what time to come in on a daily basis because there is no organization. Got hurt pretty bad because of faulty equipment and dangerous workplace and they refused to give me x-rays and sent me back with an injury and threatened to let me go if I didn't go back. All in all just a terrible place to work, only thing good was money.Life is dynamic and fast-paced here. One day you are laser-focused on routine technical issues with a small customer and the next you are presenting to healthcare C-Suite around initiatives that will move them forward clinically and financially. The only constant is that we aim to help make the world healthier, cleaner, and safer for our customers. The support from co-workers is tremendous and the opportunity to use your existing skills while learning new ones is great.This was my 1st time working in a warehouse the experience was great! I worked the 2nd shift I would start my day by filing it would be a slow pace when I start then I would go to the floor and greet my coworker that worked on the line. I work well with others so I did have any issues with working with them. The hardest part was making was remembering Hazard Mats UN numbers but I made sure everything was correct for all Carries.The  culture of Thermo Fisher differs from department to department, so this only pertains to the department I worked within. My department hires people early in their careers and doesn't do much for them other than give them a job. The job provides extremely little training from inexperienced workers, is run by tone deaf management who literally avoid eye contact with people working below them, and demands intense physical commitment (working 10 hour shifts on your feet moving nearly constantly) while offering very little in return. Coworkers can often be great, however, and can help you through the job if you choose to work there.The silo approach between groups and divisions impedes Thermo Fisher's ability to be successful in the long run. The HR function that drives salary, promotions is relatively ineffective.  It is a nice place to work in that people and culture is positive but there is no sense of urgency or accountability.  They don't get things done - there is no corporate strategy on where the company is headed.It is a toxic culture at this place, the work environment is extremely poor, it is a good place to stay away from. They will treat you nice when you start then after a while they will change for no reason, they will start to watch you, not trust you, try to embarrass you or blame you for things you  did not even do. It is a shame that they do this.1  days at work are hectic and stressful2 i have learned a lot about the screen printing industry 3 management has changed in a negative way.4 for the most part co workers have been nice except for a few bad apples. 5 demands have increased and teamwork is diminishing 6 when things come together to give everyone a nice quarterly bonus.Working from home no office hours. my day at work was mainly checking and relying to daily emails, planning customer visits, working on sales plans, promoting the product. Management very dynamic changing constantly. too may layers of management. Met coworkers every quarter during sale meeting in Austin Texas, US hardest part...no immediate support being away of the country with 9 hours time deference. to many management changes, most enjoyable part was meeting with customers and promoting the productA typical day we have daily meetings. Management discuss the productivity of the company day before and what's needed to be done to complete for the day. Topics are discuss about the expectation of some individuals. Each co-worker is assigned to a duty for that day. Our job is enjoyable when others do their part but the hardest part of the job is lack of communication between management. Alot of times managers are nowhere to be found when something is wrong and much cant get done when that happens. Alot of responsibility on co-workers but that's counterproductive when they don't give alot of training to people.Work days can vary from 8-10 hr days and its only two shifts. I learned all of the basic job needs to fulfill the material handler 1 role. Management team doesn't have an understanding on warehouse needs and they are very experienced when it comes to warehouse work. They only care for themselves and don't at least try to take cares of the problems employees face each day. They tend to blame the employees for any kind of reason possible. They don't Acknowledge how hard you work and how the team works. Co-workers come from either a temp agency rarely hired on. Fun cool people easy to work with. The hardest part is dealing with management and trying to have them understand certain things. The most enjoyable is the amount of teamwork you do with your co-workers.In my time there I learned how little a corporation can care about its employees. There is very little chance of internal advancement, the pay is ok to start but the raises offered do not keep up with the cost of living increases. Other than that they have no issue shipping jobs oversees, treating their customers like cash cows and ignoring any kind of work life balance.The R&D culture at the Austin Thermo Fisher site is very inclusive. The employees are welcoming and collaborative, and frequent group meetings and presentations keep everyone's work in progress, by celebrating the successes and crowd-sourcing troubleshooting ideas when needed. This was my first industry position, and I have learned a great deal about business in my time at Thermo Fisher, and I think it has made me a much stronger scientist overall.A well run company that cares genuinely about its employees, who show consistent dedication to the success of corporate goals and each other.  It provides a supportive environment with sufficient resources (internal services such as market research) and tools to enable effective job growth and achievement.Calm, slow paced work environment, great supervisors and friendly work place. Due to Thermo Fisher Scientific being such a large company, I find that the top brass don't really care about their workers. They take way too long to hire temps on permanently and don't pay enough for the work we do. I don't necessarily like the way they do things here but the environment makes up for that a bit in the sense that it's very comfortable and everyone here is friendly.it a basic customer service operation where there is very little advancement opportunities as is dominated by individuals with the most years of service vs. knowledge and preparedness, even if you have higher qualifications the next best option in their network is the person who has the most yearsI have worked at this company for over 10 years. In that time I have seen management come and go. This round of current management is just deplorable. Treating employees like they are in a prison is the only description I can come up with.  It seems that this current batch of 'upper management' is obsessed with bending the company policy only when it benefits them. I would strongly urge folks to look elsewhere if they want to be happy with their job.A typical day involved conducting productions and reviewing results as well as logging data. I learned how safely and effectively work with hazardous chemicals. The management was fairly good. I enjoyed working with co-workers. I enjoyed the science and processes. The hardest part was the lack of competitive wages especially considering the hazards of the job.Documented success in leading various technical and non-technical team membersSkilled in influencing key stakeholders at all levels (peers, senior leaders, employees), demonstrated success in building and maintaining relationships, collaborating with others across business, function, and geographical boundariesA typical day at work begins with recording one's production goal for the day. After that, solutions that will be used throughout the day will need to be prepared. The assembling of chromatography columns will then begin, as well as the packing of them with specific types of resin. After the packing, the different methods of testing start. At the end of the testing, data is interpreted and analyzed.Great benefits, growing rapidly. Employee concerns addressed actively. Opportunity to make a difference. Actively embraces diversity in workplace. Supports community through service and contributions."

I worked in the ONESOURCE Product Support as a contractor, your time there is obviously limited. Unfortunately, they have a habit of promising certain things and not following through with those promises. Management in my department was incredibly unstable, restructuring is needed. Managers are really just seeking to look good to their own bosses, everyone else is overlooked and is disposable. The job itself was great, I learned a lot and it's valuable information to carry in the future. My biggest complaint is the management consistently lying. Typical day at work is extremely structured, you come in, must be ready to go at 8am and not a second later. 30 minutes of break time for the full day, can divide it up into 15 minute breaks or smaller. I learned more about the tax process, it's information I know I can use later on. Management (read above). Coworkers are great, we're all in the mess together so they make it better to be there. Hardest part of the job is dealing with an unstable management team, the job itself is fine. I enjoyed the job greatly, learning a lot and feeling like you accomplished helping others.It's easy and you know what to expect going into work. There isn't much variety however the management team is nice and helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job is the quiet atmosphere and independent work environment. I learned more about excel with this position.Nice place to work , good work life balance . Good opportunities to learn new technologies and they have a very good management to support the latest trends.Management is pleasant, generally expects around 40 hours/week.Coworkers are pleasant and knowledgeable about the tasks at hand.Constantly learning and working with new programming paradigms.Thomson Reuters is a good company that has a lot of opportunity for growth but struggled to place the company in the correct vertical due to the type of business that we were part of.Most team members worked remotely so we had weekly conference calls to provide progress and updates on progress. We had the chance to work independently as well as collaboratively.My co-workers were the greatest--very supportive and willing to help out to meet deadlines if necessary.My boss held monthly information meetings to help us learn new skills that would enhance our job performance.Thomson Reuters is a top-ranking information services company with over 50,000 employees.  Senior Management did not hesitate to lay off as many people as they possibly could, but they never gave up on their bonuses.  Though, my working experience was great, but the phase was pretty rough.  I really enjoyed the technical aspect of the project, and don't regret the opportunity.Great company to work for, good people.  The management was great to work for.  The company provides a good workplace environment.  They provide many learning opportunities as well.TR is constantly changing management hierarchy which became a bit tedious and confusing. As with large companies of this nature, the bottom line is saved for the stockholders. Massive layoffs were expected on a bi-annual basis with very little domestic back-filling. Most of the technical development was moved to a consulting firm in India which had competing objectives with TR and made the job more difficult than it should have been."

The health care benefits are pretty expensive.It has been several years since I worked here. When I did work there, they had a very family oriented work place. My wife was going through some health issues and they were very understanding, sometimes going above and beyond what most people would do. At the time I worked there, before the implementation of obamacare, they had outstanding health, dental and vision insurance. I am not sure what it is now. I saw several people move up within the company which was a really nice change from some companies I have worked for.Good work-life balance; nice people. Good pay and benefits.  Nice and supportive culture. Management is supportive and company offers lots of opportunities for career and personal growthThe management in this organization is extremely supportive and provide you opportunities to grow and thrive in a competitive environment. This company will drive you to be self motivated and will allow you to be truly successful.Enjoyable place to work. Would like to see more stability and less change.  Micromanagement is everywhere and the next change is always just around the corner. It is hard to be effective in an environment where you are always looking over your shoulder.Good idea of work/life balance, but very understaffed, so, typically 40+ hours week with a lot of stress and pressure of deadlines. Low salary. Very nice team members. Flexible schedule with possibility of working from home. Good benefits.At times the hours could be long, and there were some layoffs, but if you put in some effort there were many opportunities to expand your skills and learn new things. Compensation could vary a lot, but the benefits package was really good.Great company to work for, good people.  The management was great to work for.  The company provides a good workplace environment.  They provide many learning opportunities as well.It has been a pleasure to work at Thomson Reuters. Benefits and pay are great. Management is outstanding. The company culture is one of a kind. I would recommend Thomson Reuters to anyone.We're a huge OLD company that was the result of 100s of acquisitions. Compared to Google, a Software Engineer wouldn't want to be here. It's not tailored for high caliber engineers who are highly paid and who's time is highly respected. Bureaucracy is all over the place. From HR, to project team level.My manager is a great person, that's the main reason I'm still here. Also, our benefits are top notch, not our perks though.The benefits are declining, the management i always changing and their is always uncertainty as to who will be in charge the next week and if you will have a job.people here is greatcompany culture is not focused on technologymanagement is reasonable, but salary is stagnantbenefit is very badIf you are looking for a company with great flexibility and work/life balance, Thomson Reuters is the place for you. Perfect place to have a fulfilling career, but also time to enjoy life.Thomson Reuters is a great company for individuals with families and children. They have great benefits with excellent personal time off /vacation time.Nice place to work at, with a great work/life balance and competitive compensation and benefits. The environment is nice with a perfect mix of old school professional and millennials.If you're into chaos and enjoy a fast-paced, frequently changing environment, then this is the place for you.There is certainly a ""Work hard, play hard"" ethic here.  Many people work a significant amount of hours, but are also compensated for their efforts in the form of recognition, bonuses, etc.Management has a clear vision and is constantly trying to tune the internal engine to perform as good as possible.Overall a good place to work.The one downside is the ""Mothership"" mentality of the folks in Eagan, MN.   Although the CEO resides in New York City, the largest percentage of employees are located in Eagan, MN.   The Eagan folks have an ""Eagan First"" mentality and staff at other locations are all expected to fall in-line with Eagan's way of doing business.Lots of cold calls. Micro-management. Emails at all times of the day. Never seen a company with so many emails from management. It seems they justify their positions through the number of emails they send out. Quotas are nearly the same in all territories whether you have Silicon Valley, Manhattan or rural Nebraska. Management views any negative feedback as complaining or whining, thus stifling objective and constructive feedback from field reps.Great company to work for as far as benefits! I truly enjoyed my time working in their tax and accounting department. They also offer a substantial amount of PTO"
58,ThousandEyes,"VP of Sales still thinks that the old way of doing business prevails in Silicon Valley. That is, calling hundreds of prospects a day, rarely using email and other methods to effectively engage leads. Little to no leadership in terms of sales process. Expectation is to close deals but without management support, this becomes impossible and VP is known to fire people who do not perform or do as he directs."
66,Thumbtack,"I have loved working for Thumbtack as a teacher. They are very helpful with details about work policies and leave a lot of room open to schedule. You as the teacher get great ability to choose what students you take in.Thumbtack has a wonderful work environment and takes care to hire only the best of the best. They really take care of their employees and makes sure that they not only enjoy the work they do but just being there at work. In almost 2 years I have never woken up thinking, ""I do not want to go to work today!"".Great company to work with. Excellent managerial staff and support system. The most enjoyable part of the job is completing an assignment to the happy client's satisfaction; a happy client is an excellent motivator.Super people.  Fun place to work.  Love the mission of the company.  Move fast and have an impact. Can have variety of tasks.The best thing about Thumbtack is how flexible your time can be. The higher ops are always approachable and it was an easy job for such a high pay. I learned to multi task and exercise punctuality, as well as become meticulous in proofreading and writing. The hard part of the  job is when the writing portal is down and deadlines still need to be met.wonderful referral company with expert support for freelancers. they give excellent support in creating an attractive profile to answering questions on what skill you have are most in demandMy work as an SEO content writer is always given importance by the company. All of the people their are fun and very supportive. The management always takes time to look for a better way to improve your performance and company. The job is quite hard but it seems its so easy because everybody is very supportive. That's why I consider it as one of the most relevant companies I have worked with.The job is quite challenging for you need to keep up with the company updates at all times.It's fun because I met a lot of people form all over the country and overseas.For working at home, I was able to spent quality times with my family.Great clients and work is awesome.Never seem like work because I enjoy writing.Work remotely with various clients, assist in crafting different materials for a variety of platformsTrumbtack is a very useful tool for an independent contractor that likes to find new customers. I have worked for many residential customers and some commercial customers since I started with Thumbtack.I am very glad that I was able to find this opportunity through thumbtack. This job has only made me become a better person with children and it is another accomplishment in my life working as a tutor. Thank you so much thumbtack for giving me this opportunity.Thumbtack cares about your success. They have tools, scripts, marketing ideas to help you to be Professional, Service orientated and alerts."
56,Ticketfly,"I would go in and prepare and ship out UPS. Then check the print que and print out anything incoming, then print a batch of tickets that consisted of one thousand orders. i learned to be a very good multi-taker, and working under very high stress conditions, thinking ahead. Trying to always keep the customer happy, as in special shipping requests. The management was a little hard to get used to but they tried to be very understanding. My co-workers were very friendly and helpful, they would go out of their way to hep. We were more like a family then co-workers. The hardest part of the job was making sure the customers were the most satisfied they could be while maintaining company policies. I would have to say the most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of knowing that i was doing my very best and making the customer happy and the comradery  of the other employees.Ticketfly is a music tech company that is reforming the concert going experience. They love live music and encourage all of their employees to attend as many shows as possible. The culture is music oriented, social and caters to everyone's talents. Since Ticketfly is still a start up company, things are constantly changing as management figures out the best ways to help clients achieve high ticket sales and provide great service to customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is being among the awesome people who work there. I respect all of my coworkers and don't mind going out of my way to help when I can.Had couple of excellent managers that guided me and empowered me to create successful teams, where my leadership and management skills got polished.They will grow and be more successful, my only recommendation will be management training for all their managers."
80,Tile,"I would get to interact with employees and customers would get to strategize for the high theft areas of the store would have to watch cash registers to make sure there is no theft.Learned a lot about setting tile.  My boss was a good teacher however, there was not much room for growth.  I was an apprentice for a little over two years and didn't advance any further than that,i felt as though i was being kept an apprentice because it was to hard for my boss to train a new one.Well currently I am a student at Portland Community College studying Medical Assisting. I haven't gotten into the program as of yet because I am still taking my general classes to get into the program.A typical day at work includes answering phones, making sure paperwork is accurate and filed properly. I've learned how to use MS Excel,and MS Office. The company is very small, the management consist of one person. He's very organized and well grounded, knows what he wants in life and strives to reach his goals.There is only one other person in the office with me, and a few men working with the boss.I think the hardest part of the job is that there's just not enough business during the day that by the lunch time, there's literally nothing else to do. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I actually have a job, and the fact that I'm developing a different type of skill rather than just customer service.operating forklift moving pallets of material, matching material coming in to what suppose to be there and making sure it get annotated. learned a lot about the logistics part and how important logistics is in the world.the hardest part of the job is working in a cold warehouse with no heat in the winter and no A/C in the summer. Working condition.Overall this job was good to learn a bit of everything. Management, inventory, warehouse, sales.I really enjoyed my time at Tile, marble and Granite works. My co-workers and i got along great."

368,Toshiba Medical Research Institute USA,"Continuous workflow solving technical related issues within the retail point of sale environment.Establishing and maintaining prosperous relationships with end-users and customers.I worked for Toshiba International, not Toshiba Medical.With that said, It used to be a great place to work. Great camaraderie, had great relationships with superiors as well as peers. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case.Horrible, short-sighted decisions have been made and many good people are now affected due to a massive layoff. During my last year, I saw no long-term plan or vision for future growth. They are in complete panic mode.I feel sorry for former colleagues who are still employed there.-	Organized and assisted in the creation of company spreadsheets. -	Provided assistance for many A/R and invoice processing requests.-	Assisted with procuring sales tax exemption certificates.-	Reviewed and corrected various transactions.-	Fulfilled basic department support tasks including, filing, maintenance of all A/R files/labels, and other department tasks as required and requested.Great for day to day operations, planning and supply chain execution for this $100 million international manufacturing business unit.  They focus on purchasing, category management, inventory control, forecasting, personnel, information technology and international manufacturing processes.Start-up seems to be going well and making right decisions concerning system upgrades (transitions and changes from prior company ownership).  Focus on improving bottom-line and consolidations to achieve that is occurring.People are friendly and good to work with, and environment is pleasant.  The most difficult task was getting additional responsibilities to offset an ever automated job set.I did have opportunities to learn new duties in Treasury, but never was required to complete them due to other supplemental hiring that in my mind was not needed.I did not work for Toshiba MedicalThis is a review of Toshiba International Corporation in Houston Texas.We often received comments that the office had a family feel. We had many long term employees and we all worked well together.During my 31 years in Toshiba was a exciting work every day as well as challenge where we have to use all company resources to solve problems. Also, trainings in different aspect were provided for the company in order to have a excellent team work.receiving parts / shipping / enjoyed meeting all the different delivery drivers/ / learned computer receiving /  enjoyed  coworkers / certain management / just doing my job  the best that I could.Overall, Toshiba is a good company to work with. It is daily routine manufacture operations that the employees need to deal with. The co-workers are friendly. The management is quite employee-friendly.After working in a larger corporate environment, working at Toshiba was difficult due to the minimum amount of resources available. They try to do more with less but it's hard to compete with the big boys that way.Last couple years it seemed you had to worry about layoffs.  Uncomfortable.  Benefits are good.  Pay was good.  Presently going through a huge change.  With the lawsuits, fines and cutbacks.designed electrical and wiring diagrams to customers spec. learned many skills and had a great relationship with many employeesToshiba is a good company to work for in the medical device field.  An industry leader in CT technology XRay MRI and ultrasound.  I would recommend the companyMost jobs are dead end, management is short sighted. Japanese culture corrupt.Most employees are there long time, so they just show up for work to collect a paycheck as it it were a government job, very few care about what they do or their customers.Having worked at Toshiba an excess of twenty-four years, I can still say in all honesty it is the best job I've ever had! I find it great to be on the forefront of technology, working for an OEM manufacturer. A typical day involves a variety projects, so you never get bored. Co-workers may need a bit of nudging to meet a deadline, but then everyone has their own schedule. This perhaps was one of the hardest things to learn, when confronted by a tight deadline.In the end, knowing the material I've helped to produce is being seen and read by millions on the website, and then used to make purchasing decisions---this is very satisfying.Toshiba offers a wide range of semiconductors and storage products, making us a single-source option for a number of solutions and customers. It is fun and nice to work there. You will learn a lot from 9:00 to 6:00. You will have company party every month.visit diarie new client  potencial   commmmitments analisis productstrainning certification in product new, quote monthly,compensacion.An environment for people willing to deal with strong office politics.

152,Transcriptic,I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Transcriptic. I developed a great perspective on the culture of start-up companies. The work/life balance was managed well by the company and social activities were coordinated to encourage comradery among employees. The working environment was fast paced but validated by supervisor feedback and company meetings.
416,Transunion,"Work and fun is balanced. Higher management sometimes not much considerate. Nice office space and location. There are lot of opportunities to switch teams as per your aspiration.I was an Intern at TransUnion and only worked their for 10 weeks.  My experience was very good and I enjoyed everyone I worked with and company was very good and professional.I'm not a good person to ask as my job is being phased out.  We had a great team that is not appreciated by the current executives.TransUnion was originally formed in 1968 as a holding company for the railroad leasing organization, Union Tank Car Company. The following year, it acquired the Credit Bureau of Cook County, which possessed and maintained 3.6 million card files.[2] In 1981, a Chicago-based holding company The Marmon Group acquired TransUnion for approximately $688 million.[4][5] Almost thirty years later, in 2010,Loved my hours from 5:00 am to 1:30pm. Able to assist different queues.  Learing how to operate different systems. Liked that I was able to work well with my supervisors. Having monthly team meetings about new enhancement to system and being recongnized on a job well done.  Enjoyed working and being with everyone at the company.Regardless of an associates position you can be assured their day is busy.  Whether your analyzing data, preparing customer decks/presentations, following up on opps, prospecting, pipeline management.  TU support teams are busy assisting new clients through the on-boarding process as well as supporting existing customers.  TU believes in celebrating associates success through out the year.  Eligible associates have the opportunity to travel internationally for a year end celebration.TU is an advocate for giving back to the community.  TU is a great company to work.lack of management involvement with their subordinates. Expectations were unclear which resulted in a stressful relationship.People who work at TU, particularly in Chicago, tend to stay at TU forever- 10, 20, even 30 years. Rather than creating a team of people who are great at their roles, this has bred a corporate culture of complacency and mediocrity. There is little urgency in the work that people do and few incentives to be great at it. People work their 40 hour weeks and go home, regardless of pressing issues, crushing backlogs, and client commitments.Great place to work with amazing teammates and challenging work!A company that focuses on being an information company for good!The international marketing team was intelligent and wonderful to work with. Extreme attention to detail and excellent interpersonal skills are a must-have to flourish and enjoy this job and the environment.In TransUnion I learn Custumer Services, Public Relations, Logistics, And Financial activities.My co-workers were so nicer and very intelligent.The hardest thing was to learn how to speak in from of a lot of people because I was very shy. Working for TransUnion was very interesting and productiveA professional but casual environment. Management have always been helpful rather than simply demanding. Friendly relations with co-workers. Variety of technologies to work with.Good location, next to Union Station.  Nice office environment.  Good people.  Management is mixed.  Need to stay on top of technology and contribute.his was a never ending job, you always had something to do because we had millions of customers to service. It was a very good job that gave you many experiences. The job was always offering new things to help make your job easierwell run institution with many opportunities for staff advancements, great deal of perks to utilize as well, caring coworkersCompany is ever trying to play catchup to the competition. Their products are not cutting edge any longer and now lack stability. The lack of focus on quality products and a push for sales versus satisfaction within the management team has been narrow-minded and will most likely come back to haunt them in the near future. The expectations of employees is unrealistic and management tends to not stand employees when they know their products and vision are the issues.  The company is very competitive with pay and the  benefits are outstandingCulture could improve and it starts with senior management. a typical day consist of showing up between 7 and 9 and sitting at a desk for majority of the shift responding to emails and conducting meetings or conference calls. All of this work can keep you very busy because each account manager has hundreds of accounts with different issues rising each dayNo two days are identical while working at Transunion. While your overall responsibilities will remain the same, the initial situation/issue as well as the path you take to find the solution will always be unique. This makes for an interesting work day.If you are looking for room for advancement, this is not the company. Senior management would be better off with robots. It is a do as I say and not as I do environment. There is a high turnover from management down. This is not a fun environment to work in. The truly sad part is the pay is very good but not worth the back biting.TransUnion is a large privately held company, it is a fast paced environment. Multiplatform integrated systems ensure a complex environment. A typical day would include:Planning, or Post Mortem(Lessons Learned) meetings as well as conference calls with rotating quarterbacking.Data retrieval for reporting then Report distribution based on data needs.Ticketing systems for upcoming code updates as well as current system problems requiring attention.Interfacing other business units for upcoming work in the pipeline.Analysis of systems and promote best practices for more efficient processing.Enjoyed many of my co-workersHardest part of the job, Repeating oneself. Emails you work hard on that aren't read you have to state again and again.Most enjoyable part, Learning as Steven Covey would put it ""Sharpening the Saw"".Fundamentally, for a company to ultimately succeed, the work environment needs to encourage new ideas and input. Transunion / TLO's  corporate culture discouraged individual thought and contributions."

211,TripAdvisor,"reat benefits - free HMO, on site fitness classes and paid yoga classes. Free in office snacks and drinks, breakfast catered each Friday.his place is run like a frat house - you're either in, or out. Extremely unprofessional management who run the company like a private and inappropriate club.TripAdvisor is a great company with amazing perks and benefits for employees.  People can move up quickly within the organization if they are smart and ambitious.  However, some people get promoted too rapidly up the organization.  They may be great at their jobs but do not have any people management skills.  Overall I think TripAdvisor is a great place to work if you have the right supportive manager.Promises. Promises. Promises.   Promised me everything when I started .  It was great for the first few months!   We moved to a beautiful new building , lot's of perks/benefits... with not so many kind people. Respect level is low. The only employees that are seeing any type of financial gain are senior level management and senior level engineers.   You will  NEVER meet your goals.  They are unobtainable. The yearly review process is ridiculous. No pay raises.   The turnaround is huge.  A revolving door.  HR is useless.  They are so disorganized and uneducated on policies and procedures.  If I needed an answer to a question, no one had it, or they had the wrong answer. Wouldn't pick up phones.  It was quite frustrating. The Vacation rentals president was nasty and rude. As for the free lunches.. attractive but not worth the pain and suffering to work there. They do have a bar on site. These perks do   attract the younger culture.Great company to get experience but there is little opportunity to grow. They have great benefits, great lunch options and snacks. The company is growing and with comes typical growing pains.TripAdvisor is a great place to work. Smart people work there but less arrogance which makes the work environment easy to work in. All of the benefits also makes it worth while, but beware sometimes can be a bit overwhelming in terms on working a lot.The culture is very collaborative. Colleagues are nice and helpful. Working hours are flexible. Hold you job accountable and get jobs done.good sight , my only problem with the sight is when a customer gives a company a bad review they can dispute it and have it removed it does not give a true evaluation of the restaurantIf you are into the culture of fast paced for the sake of fast-paced, then this is the place for you, and if you are an engineer you are in a good place, but unfortunately, the positives of this company do not extend to the administrative positions, where the Human Resources department is hostile, ineffective and joyless, and that extends outward. Benefits and compensation were great, but not worth the bad feeling you leave each day with.I was so entitled to my cubicle. My job was eliminating duplicates which was a job that could excel could do in three minutes.I did not find anything challenging or to prove my skills at all at this job.In general, I agree with one of the prior reviewers, whose ""Cons"" for TripAdvisor read: ""Unfocused and immature management, a highly enefficient [sic] workplace with minimal room for career advancement.""However, I don't agree with everything this person said - there's a lot more to it than that.Let's start with the negatives (bear in mind, this is based on my own experiences as well as those of others - but is not necessarily universal):1- Much of the middle management (including Directors) was promoted from within. This sounds good - why is it bad? Because they are high-performing, type A folks promoted for their individual contributions and tenure, NOT for their managerial skills and potential. This means that a key layer of management is, as the other person put it, ""unfocused and immature."" This leads to micro-management, squabbles, and general dissatisfaction - as well as inefficient hiring practices. Speaking of...2- The hiring process is terrible. Communication - which should be good, since there's a dedicated, internal recruiter between the candidate and the hiring manager - is often slow and tough come by, and there can be long lags in the process for no good reason. The recruiters are hit-or-miss - many are fantastic, but the better they are, the more likely they are to be saddled with far more positions than they should have to handle.3- Part of the hiring issue is that candidates interviewing for individual contributor roles are often interviewing for 2-3 roles at a time - contributor, senior contributor, and even associate (junior) contributor at the  more... same position - without being told. So if someone comes in to interview for a Senior Engineer role, but doesn't have the experience, they could be offered an Engineer position - but they didn't know that was an option until they received the offer. This is ""sand-bagging"" at its worst, and some hiring managers are more guilty of it than others, but the fact that it's allowed at all is unfortunate.4- Career advancement of direct reports doesn't seem to be at all interesting to the middle management layer. There's a general attitude of ""Show me you want to move up, show me you deserve to move up, then convince me WHY you should move up... and I'll consider it"" among the managers and directors, rather than them acting as allies and advocates and helping their team members advance. This could be because the company doesn't want people moving up the ladder too quickly, but it causes good people to leave the company too early if they're at all ambitious. Now for the good (and there's a lot):1- The people (individual contributors) are fantastic. I've never worked with a more intelligent, enjoyable group that loves to solve problems.2- The pay is competitive-plus.3- The benefits are extraordinary. From the fitness/gym/sports reimbursement to the travel benefit to free lunches five days a week in a brand-new, catered facility, it's clear that the company wants to make their employees happy... at least with superficial things.4- Chance to work on exciting products. 5- Equity in a billion-dollar (revenue) company.6- (and this is a huge one) Exciting brand with a great reputation among other companies, especially in the Boston area. If you succeed at Trip, other companies know that you can do the work they ask of you, and will come calling. So 2 years of Trip on your resume will get you plenty of interviews for a one-level bump at a number of other firms.I enjoy working for TripAdvisor, and recommend it to friends. It's not for everyone, and the cons can be dealbreakers for some people, but it's a good place to work with diverse, friendly coworkers, good pay, and a fun overall experience.  lessCompany provides great salary, fun work environment along with health benefits. They focus on keeping you happy by catering lunch 2-3x week snacks, coffee etc. Amazing place to be part of .The best thing about TripAdvisor is the people who work there. Everyone is incredibly smart and always pushing the company forward in new ways. My understanding of the industry grew incredibly during my time there. Surrounding yourself by smart people is always a great benefit. Free lunch everyday isn't bad either, especially if it's restaurant quality! Management has high expectations and people usually start packing up around 5:30.I love writing and photographing the reviews I deliver.  I have focused on Hotel's, restaurants, and things to do.  TripAdvisor is based on individuals who write about their experience that forms a consortium for a particular place.  Being a chef myself, and customer focused, I always will meet the manager, and get a brief story of what I am writing about to personalize it.  This is a passion of mine and am a Top Contributor of TripAdvisor with many badges and followers who read my reviews. I would love to incorporate my experience in the food, hospitality and travel that I have years of experience doing.On the good side, people are quite diverse and interesting, but management is extraordinarily immature and unfocused, with their products reflecting this mood: this is the mega-mammoth of travel services, and it just about sums it up - big, grotesquely uncultured and massively inefficient.Imagine having 10+ years of experience but reporting directly to someone who has half that... and has never shipped a new product before he/she joined the firm. Your days feel empty, scrambled and uneventful, and you are being micromanaged (that's what people do when they perceive you as a threat or when your product management role is downplayed to the level of a technical project manager, whereas your contribution to the product's roadmap is limited to writing technical documentation). Chances of career advancement? Zero to none.Shame on me - I should have known better: when you have shipped roughly 5 times more marketable products than your hiring manager, your career is going nowhere... and sadly, no one cares that the department is managed poorly.Ironically, if you do get hired into an environment like this and are good at what you do, you *will* be perceived as a threat unless you are good at playing dumb. Combine this with the fact that many of their developers are overseas and you will have to collaborate by getting on the phone at 4am or 9pm a couple of times every week, and this will not sit well with you unless you are a workaholic willing to work for a 10+ year old company that iterates products like there is no tomorrow but offers you zero equity in return for your  more... hard work.  That said, I am quite unexcited about working for TripAdvisor or for any of its subsidiaries (e.g., Viator) again in the future, even if my pay is much higher.  lessExciting opportunities working at a fun, lively HQ with ""speed wins"" mentality"

Management has high expectations and people usually start packing up around 5:30.In general, I agree with one of the prior reviewers, whose ""Cons"" for TripAdvisor read: ""Unfocused and immature management, a highly enefficient [sic] workplace with minimal room for career advancement.""However, I don't agree with everything this person said - there's a lot more to it than that.Let's start with the negatives (bear in mind, this is based on my own experiences as well as those of others - but is not necessarily universal):1- Much of the middle management (including Directors) was promoted from within. This sounds good - why is it bad? Because they are high-performing, type A folks promoted for their individual contributions and tenure, NOT for their managerial skills and potential. This means that a key layer of management is, as the other person put it, ""unfocused and immature."" This leads to micro-management, squabbles, and general dissatisfaction - as well as inefficient hiring practices. Speaking of...2- The hiring process is terrible. Communication - which should be good, since there's a dedicated, internal recruiter between the candidate and the hiring manager - is often slow and tough come by, and there can be long lags in the process for no good reason. The recruiters are hit-or-miss - many are fantastic, but the better they are, the more likely they are to be saddled with far more positions than they should have to handle.3- Part of the hiring issue is that candidates interviewing for individual contributor roles are often interviewing for 2-3 roles at a time - contributor, senior contributor, and even associate (junior) contributor at the  more... same position - without being told. So if someone comes in to interview for a Senior Engineer role, but doesn't have the experience, they could be offered an Engineer position - but they didn't know that was an option until they received the offer. This is ""sand-bagging"" at its worst, and some hiring managers are more guilty of it than others, but the fact that it's allowed at all is unfortunate.4- Career advancement of direct reports doesn't seem to be at all interesting to the middle management layer. There's a general attitude of ""Show me you want to move up, show me you deserve to move up, then convince me WHY you should move up... and I'll consider it"" among the managers and directors, rather than them acting as allies and advocates and helping their team members advance. This could be because the company doesn't want people moving up the ladder too quickly, but it causes good people to leave the company too early if they're at all ambitious. Now for the good (and there's a lot):1- The people (individual contributors) are fantastic. I've never worked with a more intelligent, enjoyable group that loves to solve problems.2- The pay is competitive-plus.3- The benefits are extraordinary. From the fitness/gym/sports reimbursement to the travel benefit to free lunches five days a week in a brand-new, catered facility, it's clear that the company wants to make their employees happy... at least with superficial things.4- Chance to work on exciting products. 5- Equity in a billion-dollar (revenue) company.6- (and this is a huge one) Exciting brand with a great reputation among other companies, especially in the Boston area. If you succeed at Trip, other companies know that you can do the work they ask of you, and will come calling. So 2 years of Trip on your resume will get you plenty of interviews for a one-level bump at a number of other firms.I enjoy working for TripAdvisor, and recommend it to friends. It's not for everyone, and the cons can be dealbreakers for some people, but it's a good place to work with diverse, friendly coworkers, good pay, and a fun overall experience.  lessI love writing and photographing the reviews I deliver.  I have focused on Hotel's, restaurants, and things to do.  TripAdvisor is based on individuals who write about their experience that forms a consortium for a particular place.  Being a chef myself, and customer focused, I always will meet the manager, and get a brief story of what I am writing about to personalize it.  This is a passion of mine and am a Top Contributor of TripAdvisor with many badges and followers who read my reviews. I would love to incorporate my experience in the food, hospitality and travel that I have years of experience doing.On the good side, people are quite diverse and interesting, but management is extraordinarily immature and unfocused, with their products reflecting this mood: this is the mega-mammoth of travel services, and it just about sums it up - big, grotesquely uncultured and massively inefficient.Imagine having 10+ years of experience but reporting directly to someone who has half that... and has never shipped a new product before he/she joined the firm. Your days feel empty, scrambled and uneventful, and you are being micromanaged (that's what people do when they perceive you as a threat or when your product management role is downplayed to the level of a technical project manager, whereas your contribution to the product's roadmap is limited to writing technical documentation). Chances of career advancement? Zero to none.Shame on me - I should have known better: when you have shipped roughly 5 times more marketable products than your hiring manager, your career is going nowhere... and sadly, no one cares that the department is managed poorly.Ironically, if you do get hired into an environment like this and are good at what you do, you *will* be perceived as a threat unless you are good at playing dumb. Combine this with the fact that many of their developers are overseas and you will have to collaborate by getting on the phone at 4am or 9pm a couple of times every week, and this will not sit well with you unless you are a workaholic willing to work for a 10+ year old company that iterates products like there is no tomorrow but offers you zero equity in return for your  more... hard work.  That said, I am quite unexcited about working for TripAdvisor or for any of its subsidiaries (e.g., Viator) again in the future, even if my pay is much higher.  lessExciting opportunities working at a fun, lively HQ with ""speed wins"" mentalityIf you are into the culture of fast paced for the sake of fast-paced, then this is the place for you, and if you are an engineer you are in a good place, but unfortunately, the positives of this company do not extend to the administrative positions, where the Human Resources department is hostile, ineffective and joyless, and that extends outward. Benefits and compensation were great, but not worth the bad feeling you leave each day with.Company provides great salary, fun work environment along with health benefits. They focus on keeping you happy by catering lunch 2-3x week snacks, coffee etc. Amazing place to be part of ."
539,Troy Corporation,"If you want to be treated like you are nothing then try to work for Troy. If you become sick and you are unable to report to work just one day then you most like will be fire right away.It was an excellent job  I was an analytical chemist.  GC-MS,  LC-MS,  HPLC,  GC,  wet chemistry  FT-IRThe company makes biocides and fungicides for the personal care industry.  I learned a lot about surfactants.Troy overall is a very challenging place to work. There is no work life balance at all. Your career will go no where here. There is no advancement at all at this privately held company.I have been a recruiter here for 8 months and I am treated with respect and given the flexibility I need.Sadly Troy has no consideration nor appreciation of it's employees. If one can put up with daily humilliations and back talk from an under qualified manager and/or lazy co-workers, while few work hard to keep dept running some just keep browsing their texts or internet. If one does not care being scream to in front of others and be threated lower than trash then this is the place for you. The many hard working employees still within receive not appreciation nor even a pat on the back for work well done. There is not room for growth or to go up the ladder (unless?) as one is told when interview, benefits are increase every year, health insurance is completely un-affordable. Help is non-existing so there is not point in bringing up your complains or concerns on the contrary they will pick a shovel to make it 7 feet under instead of 6.I saw how an employee of more than a decade was put down on daily basis by new management, written down,made fun of and literally the whole company knew about it, this employee was exemplary, hard working and dedicated, knew the company in and out literally, gave Troy 1000% if this person could, yet at the end sadly was shown the door.I did not work there long, only for the summer as a clerk. The whole day consisted of filing papers and writing up deposit slips.The employees and my co-workers were great people. They will feel sorry for you after you have been hired and find out how bad it really is. It is the management that needs to be replaced. Not all management is bad, but my director was counterproductive, conduct unbecoming of a manager. My director and his sidekick manager did not want to work with you, was always against you...Always second guessing me..the lying, sneaking, I was always getting written up for stupid reasons...The most enjoyable part was leaving...What I learned from working there was that my other managers and directors were not as bad as I thought. In retrospect, I actually learned from my past managers and directors especially from their constructive criticism...Stay far away as possible!!! If do need a job, work there and keep searching...it will take you no longer than a month to figure it out how hostile it is."
567,Truth Initiative,"Truth Initiative is a very fun and easy place to work. It is very very fast pace and can be stressful, but when all is said and done we feel rewarded in the end."
243,Tufts Medical Center,"I enjoy working there. The enviroment is good and my co-wokers are easy to get along with. We all help each other out all the time. The one main downside is there is a lot of down time. With my specific job, I don't have a lot of contact with the patients unless I am helping one of the nurses or the patient is going into the Operating Room for a procedure.On a typical day, my job requires allot of focus and attention to detail. Leaning to work with and understanding fee schedules has been a great learning experience. Our management is fairly descent and compromised of very intelligent people who are faced with many challenges. My coworkers are great and easy to get along with. The hardest part of being and underpayments specialist, is getting the claims to pay additional reimbursement, keeping up with the high volume of claims needing an appeal and following up with the insurance to ensure an appeal has been received and sent for review.Fun work place with supportive management, focused on building a great product and a great culture. Strong leadership.my coworkers are like busy bees we are all constantly working on something. from the minute the office opens at 6am to 6pm at night. analyzing claims and their payment history for departments and working closer to reduce the amount of denials.if you enjoy the downtown setting, you will enjoy this work culture. great people. good working hours. great location and drive.The management sucks but co-workers were lovely . I had a good boss who taught me a lot and very great colleagues. They have good benefits for post docs but i hated that we had to sign in when we got to work but no one cared that we always worked overtime .They pay very little money, but want to work you like a slave. It's not worth working there if you can get hired In Another hospital.This hospital has been a pleasure to work at. From the top hospital executives, leadership, day to day staff and ancillary personnel, this hospital cares about its patients and staff.Very professional staff, helpful, courteous, and knowledgeable. The care that is given is to every patient it outstanding. Patient centered care is the number one priority throughout the entire clinic, from the front desk staff to their visit with the MD/NPs.Learned more than I thought possible during my time in this lab. Right from the start the PI wanted to challenge me since he knew I was being challenged with my difficult major as a biomedical engineer. Provided me with very important projects that I had to take complete responsibility for completing with the best of my ability. Very supportive lab members that were always willing to provide assistance and even let me watch them perform their daily lab tasks so that I could learn about the many skills and steps that are required for research and drug development.i work with kids so i deal with alot of smiling people even in the  adult areas. The pay is slightly low but decent. The turnover rate is very high due to managers that dont treat their employees with upmost respect. As a starter job it would be great.I love my job.   The doctors that I work for are amazing.  My job is coming to an end, so I need to find new employment. I never would have left this job!Tufts is a fast paced hospital and not minute is wasted there.   My coworkers made it all possible.The hardest part of my job was to get everything done (especially all the managerial things).The best part was the patients, in various states of illness, I was able at times to alleviate their stress, fear and anxiety.I loved my work at Tufts, even though it was tough.I have no complaints about my job.  the experience that I am receiving will be very beneficial to me in my endeavors.  I enjoy the staff and I truly enjoy each patients that I see each is so differentI left Tufts for 10 years to try different areas of nursing. I maintained relationships with several of my coworkers. The hospital is a true ""community/family"" environment. People are kind and caring, they rally together to help each personally and professionally. I continue to learn new procedures and advancements regularly. It's very rewarding to see patients stop by to say hello on their follow up visits when they're feeling better.The most difficult part of the job is watching some patients/families come to terms with terminal diagnosis. It's emotionally draining watching people suffer when they're in denial.A typical day at work at Tufts is that I arrive at 6:00am not due in till 7am but like to uncover all the rooms and make sure things are adequately stocked for the day and ready to roll as soon as patients check in!.  Tufts is an extremely busy practice in cornea, retina,plastics and glaucoma and we all work well together keeping the flow as smooth as possible and helping each other when needed.   The most enjoyable aspect of my job is with the patients, making sure they feel safe and questions are answered.  The hardest part of the job is leaving!Tufts Medical Center is a highly respected hospital and they didn't get that reputation for nothing, the staff here are great people to work with and there is plenty of room for advancement. Currently being in school to get my Associates in Medical Information Technology, Tufts offers many opportunities for me to learn different aspects of the medical field.A typical day at Tufts Medical Center in the Internal Medicine residency training program starts off at 7 AM with inpatient rounds. As a resident, I am the main doctor in charge of running all matters regarding patient care. I am supervised in my decisions by the attending physician, however the autonomy given to residents to run our teams is amazing here. I learnt to practice evidenced based medicine independently during  my time here. Since rotations are divided by sub-specialty of Internal Medicine, I learnt to practice medicine under physicians from several different backgrounds. My co-workers are very hardworking and self motivated, and the ancillary staff in our hospital is very supportive. The hardest part of the job is having a balance between work and life, however this improves with practice and by learning essential time management skills (which I have). Because I feel I have excellent communication skills, the easiest part of the job for me is talking to patients and their families.Teaching hospital with many interesting people to meet.  Good central location in Boston.  Near South Station.  I have enjoyed the many interesting people I have met.Staff was very knowledgeable and easy to work with. Very helpful. Grew my professional skillset during my time here, and really learned a lot about myself.- I come in work and take orders from the coworkers - I learned not to work there for a while- Managers are always watching you, very demanding- Coworkers were always watching me, report to manager bad rumors, they don't like Temps- The hardest part of the job was the commute, salary, and the treatment they gave me- The most enjoyable part of the job was none"
499,Tumblr,"Tumblr has recently announced that they will start paying bloggers, however this is to come in the future. For now you need to seek third party businesses in order to monetize your site. Depending on your traffic, it is good passive income.Tumblr was honestly an amazing place to start working because it set the standards high for all my future work environments. My managers were supportive and effective and my coworkers were friendly. The company fostered a really open work environment were people were encouraged to mingle with other departments and understand how other people's work affected them. I think the free food and casual atmosphere helped people take breaks and socialize when they needed to and to get more work done without burning out.Most importantly, my job taught me how tech and social media companies work and how intellectual property laws affect them. It was a fascinating look into the way site policies were informed and reformed as well.Great culture and growing company. Fun place to work and think on your feet. Have the ability to make an impact on the company and bottom line.I joined Tumblr blogging web site in 2012, to share and contribute my love of the hit cable series, The Walking Dead.  The site is nicely outlined and formatted for experienced bloggers and writers to compose stories, fiction, media footage, quotes, and photos.  Many bloggers have thousands of followers, others have several hundred. Presently, Tumblr is the only media blog site I know of that is solely dedicated to Entertainment.  It also is a terrific avenue for newbies to practice and perfect their writing, designing, and blogging skills.Tumblr has trained me for this social media frenzy of a world we live in and has taught me the essentials. Trend-forecasting and fashion history research played a major part as well."
132,Turn,"Turn service was a great place to work for. I really learned a lot about stepping up and being a leader at Turn. The line of service that Turn provides is considered dangerous but there safety guidelines are superior I've only heard of a few minor accidents in my 8 yrs there.Great, smart passionate people. Most of them are work a-holics. Still trying to find its proper culture. Lots of growth potential. In it's 2nd act.Clean rooms lobby. take trash out . Customer serviceManagement is great there. Great benefits Great pay Meet different cultures Friendly peoplegreat place to work. business is very slow at this time. This is why I'm looking for other job opportunities. I have learned a lot in this type of business though.This is a company with a grate potential. They are going through some difficulties but seems like with a good management and grate vision they will overcome all their issues.grate people and fun place to workFast Pace Meeting different cultures Greet food Everyone gets along Hardest part of the job is rude customers.

728,Turner Broadcasting,"Turner is a challenging work environment.  The pace is fast, and constantly changing.   I am able to adapt, and get my job done all the time, with 100% success rate.  I am the top performer in my group.knowledge and planning work and communicate with Co-worker such as safety and job including responsibility. No horse playing. Respect others. Learn from others. Follow the rules and regulations. There is no specific hard jobs for me, I just work with others by communicating and by thinking and planning ahead before work . The most enjoyable part of job is to work with others as a team.Very nice place to work. Not working directly for Turner, as I'm contracting.They invested a lot in the Techwood campus in Midtown.Fun environment and creative place. Benefits are good and people are friendly. Highly recommend this company for those who are looking for a great career in cable television entertainment. Location is central in the city of Atlanta and easy access to highways and public transportation. Competitive company in the industry, top network ratings.Turner services company is a great place to work if you need to make money, and have experience in A/C repair. For people who think about applying though, need to expect to learn to do thing's different ways. Some of his ways are very different than most places, but they are more effective and safe.Balanced work life and great atmosphere.Flexible hours and management is very professional.Overall it is a pleasure to work for this firm.Was a maintenance electrician with them, the project manager I worked for was VERY unpleasant and had even worse leadership abilities, jobsite was miserable and the company didn't seem to care about the workers at allGreat company but recent changes and layoffs have effected morale and output. New management as well not as committed as long term management that has leftOverall Turner was a wonderful place to work, friendly people, excellent benefits, excellent pay,  room for advancement in some cases, Overall wonderful place to work.Great company once the organizational changes are complete.  However, they've replaced a large amount of IT staff with offshore employees.  Overall, my experience with management was pretty good.Turner is an excellent company to work for.  I have been working for Turner for the past 15 years and would recommend the company to anyone who is looking for employment.And management of sales...it is an family owned place. I enjoyed the people i worked with and people i served..i came to work on time every dayFollowed Agile methodology, had meetings scrum meetings everyday. Good team work and very friendly environment. Good platform to learn many new things. Discussing with team members and improvising things is most enjoyable.They do not have benefits, 401-K. All the employees I talked to said they are over worked and underpaid and that Turner does not appreciate them.Turner was a great company to work for in the late '90's until 2005 when I left. Great Management, great Company perks , benefits took great care of employees!Definitely didn't expect this as it unfolded. Management does everything to discourage you from changing departments. You have a better chance of raising the Titanic with tweezers. Most of the co-workers are as phoney as a three dollar bill. There are some talented people and some are generally good people. However, even they fall victim to the alphas of various clicks. They are conniving, lazy and extremely underhanded. I'm not sure how some got hired and furthermore astonished that they maintain their job. Which leads me to this. Beware of management moles. I would guess that's how a few of them still are able to loiter masquerading as workers. These incompetent, useless ones will despise you once you show drive, talent and unwavering confidence in spite of their efforts to maintain a hostile work environment. The directors are actually the most miserable of all. Constant nitpicking to those who aren't their chosen ones. Do yourself a huge favor and move on. Lastly, there is zero work life balance.Well in construction we all have our good days and bad ones.And with the technology we have today we are always learning something new. Just always remember to put your safety first on each task you start.Turner is a great place to work. You can definitely move up in the company. Paid holidays, great Insurance, and Friendly work environment. I would go back in a heartbeat.Excellent place to work. Turner simply needs to put forth a more concentrated efort towards implementing  more diversity via the oranization's hiring process and overall talent acquisition; especially within the company's ""sports"" department in it's Century City Office.Spent a long (Too long) in the Technology department.  The management was confusing in the decision making.  Spent money on pointless projects and then never had money for training.  Most new skills came from new hires and then got stale sitting in a cube.  Middle management seemed to enjoy misery of subordinates.  To the point of running out on the tab for department lunches!  OK so now it's all gone, new company with very little staff left.Pipe fitter, do daily progress reports,time sheets, issue work schedule, and read blueprints. Very reliable worker. Never missed work"
53,Twilio Inc.,"Great people, great leadership, and a great overall direction, I love it. Twilio's products are well loved and the people working there are ready to help out all the time.Great place to work, lot's of flexibility and growth potential. Although quite large (500+), Twilio still has a lot of the start-up charm and feel. -Fully stocked kitchen.-Catered lunches (4 days a week).-Work/life balance and flexibility.Exciting company to work at with products that employees and developers alike believe in. Even though the company is experiencing growth, it retains a startup culture and the opportunity for employees to grow into new roles and/or new teams. I love my team and coming into work every day."
65,Twitch,"It provides an easy to use and utilize platform for an individual to provide quality entertainment. Allowing for viewers to form communities around different broadcsters.Twitch doesn't directly employ me yet, however they do allow me to stream every day and use paypal to run my own stream and accept donations from my viewers. Other than that i primarily stream video games that are RPG based.It's a very good side job but I can't commit all my time to it. Hardest part of the job is to gain a following. Most enjoyable part is that I get paid for something I like to do.A typical day at works includes me playing online games at home and streaming it to hundreds of viewers a day. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to interact with all my viewers. I set my own schedule, and it is a really flexible job at the moment.Twitch.tv is a great place for people passionate about gaming to share their experience and expertise with an engaged audience."
514,"Two Sigma Investments, LLC","Unfortunately, I am not willing to provide a detailed review of my experience at this point.

370,"Tyson Foods, Inc.","Long hours, but pay is good and I had nothing but respect for my upper management, who weren't afraid to work those same long hours and then some. Some of the green hat managers weren't that good, but they eventually get weeded out. The blue hats were mostly good managers and the plant manager, production manager and 99% of upper management onsite were great people. Advancement is certainly there if you want it. A few employees there were pretty shady people, but in a plant that size that's to be expected. There were a lot of great employees as well.it was an hard job but i like the pay and hours and working on second shift it can help you get to where you want to be i like to meet new people and learn new things at tyson you learn a lot of different jobsGood paying jobFast pacedGood hours Good benefitsGood managementHard workHelpful to workersMany advancements opportunitiesNice managerFunGreat Benefitsthe people are wonderful there the pay is great the managment is good. everybody is hard working and its a clean n friendly environmentI started work there 5 years and supervisors don't listen to employee they make up ways to fire you and you have to be able to deal with gossip and ignore it, the best thing to do to stay along time is don't socialize with the employees but listen to them when it comes to your safetyI enjoyed my time working for Tyson Foods, New London, WI plant. I found that the maintenance department was very clickish and when management of the plant was faced with a difficult personnel challenge, their answer was to eliminate the problem.I enjoyed my time working at Tyson Foods. It's a good productive business. It gives you the chance to learn different things, and I also gives you the chance to be a good productive worker.Tyson Foods was a fun and fast paced place to work. I enjoyed  knowing that my work meant something. There are a lot of different cultures that work at Tyson.  It was fun learning about all of them.  For the most part, the management team was awesome.  But, there are always those few that make things difficult.  The hardest part of the job was being able to stand on your feet for long periods of time.  The first couple of weeks are a little difficult, but once you are able to get past those. It is a breeze.  The best part of the job, was the health insurance.  It was not too expensive. Plus, there are many options available.They hype it up so big as how great it is then once your in they change all the rules. nothing is ran as they say during orientation. they even go as far as to say you own your job that you bid on then even though your doing your job if you make someone else fix their error to continue your job turning out right they have a problem. quantity not quality.Love the people I worke with at my site but hate dealing with management and their tactic on things they know nothing about. Alot of micromanagement!!The job itself was easy but it didn't pay enough. It was dead end job where I would be living pay check to pay check. The job did have a lot of benefits such as good health and dental insurance.Tyson was a fun workplace, and the hours worked for my family. They had holiday meals which were nice for the employees and the work was not very difficult.  The people were fun to work with.Very interesting place you learned a lot I just don't like the long hours you couldn't leave until the jobr or  order was done for that shift. Highway package and shipped chickens to places like Boston Market and K.F.C.A typical day for me consisted of cleaning, climbing, and inspecting.  I learned a lot about handling chemicals, and factory operations.  The managements was very helpful and friendly.  My co-workers worked hard and as team to get the job done. The hardest part of the job was wearing all the equipment and climbing in to weird places. The best part of the job was the feeling of the was the feeling of transforming the building every time we came to clean.learned leader ship skills, how to operator heat presses, blenders, ovens, Fuji film packaging equipment, flatbread sheeter, data recording on sp charts. co-workers are mostly friendly and very productive. management is normally really involved with helping keep production and if members are in need of help. the hardest part is the 7 days a week. most enjoyable was the ability to learn new things and work your way up in the companyPlenty of work to do and to be done and at least 40hrs a week. Some team leaders and supervisors can and will seek to make good workers jobs harder than necessary. you only get about 2 breaks throughout a 8-10 hour work period and only a 20 minute lunch...included within the 2 breaksTyson works with you to find a good job that you can perform well and gives you opportunity to rise in the pay scale quickly. The environment if good for employees and the managment is excellent.Great  people to work with. Management  is cool too the work is easy too.  washing machines off with a pressure hose and chemicals the negative is you work everything night they pay is not bad but it ain't greatgood for job advancement manager's are good and understanding good safety practices,employees generally are helpful ,benefits are good especially for spouse and children.The pay rate is amazing here and seeing that they have their own store for fresh meat to buy is a plus. The people are helpful and don't make you feel stupid when you do something wrong.A good place to work. My job wasn't hard I had very little supervision.  The hardest part of my job was sometime the heat in my work area. I enjoyed not having to work on a production line all day."
725,UCB,"Was Fortunate to grow from Collector to Supervisor, hire 80% of own staff, and developed them. Once had a new Manager my development increased, was always able to improve training programbecause that was one of my strong points.Typical Day was balanced between my Collectors, Clients, and fellow Supervisors along with other Corportate needs, however the priorties were the collectors and the clients.Doesnt keep their word about raises after 90 days, only the collectors that have been there 10 years or better are really the ones that gets incoming calls. And makes real money for a bonus check. I hate the fact the pay schedule is set days of each month.not a bad company if looking for a job.  If looking for a career, look elsewhere.  District managers are good senior management needs a self check.If you're looking for a place where your efforts are appreciated and your results are rewarded - skip this place. It it is simply not a place to build a career. It is a good place to work when you're in between jobs or if you're not the primary income of the household. Don't expect to be appreciated much, and make sure you only take this job if you have the flexibility to quit at the drop of a dime.great atmosphere, wonderful coworkers, wonderful management, great incentives, lunches were good. great feedback dailyThe culture at UCB is very positive with several avenues to advance your career. The training was extensive and very thorough. The management team was well trained and came along side the reps with a coaching and uplifting attitude. The co-workers all worked together as team players and we were able to have a lot of fun and get work done as well. The hardest part of the job was more industry wide not related to the company. It was seeing the physicians and getting in the offices with new policies of no lunches and only so many reps on certain days, etc.Co-workers are helpfulChallenging positionCan be stressfulPay is based on bonuses Monday through FridayNot a lot of training providedLearn mostly on your ownAlways busy, making phone calls or receiving phone calls. Convincing people to pay off their debt and even play with numbers a bit. Supervisors are always there to help and prepare you for different scenarios that you may come across of. Hardest part is finding the consumer and actually getting them to stay on the phone with you and not hang up.UCB is pharma company that has drugs for the central nervous system, GI and rheumatoid arthritis.Offer a pretty good retirement plan and other benefits.The people are fun.UCB offers education reimbursement.Too many people in management positions that don't know what they are doing.  Some haven't ever managed people before and their teams are used as experiments for them to become one with no formal training and transition.  Management should really truly value their team by their action and not giving lip service that doesn't add up.  You stay too long the place will drain you of all of your true intelligence because it seems like if you are clueless you are better off there than being an intelligent person.  If you value your job and work hard you are stuck in your position, but if you don't do anything and just look busy you will be great and set up for success!!What i enjoy most is the people at this company.  Everyone is very friendly and a great group to work with.Each day in the office im able to learn new things and build new relationshipsI enjoyed very much working for UCB for the last one year.I feel valued and got tons of support from management and my peers. I can truly say that I enjoy everyone who works here and that it is an environment in which I want to come to work every day and I'm proud to say I work here.""The fact the we all work towards the same goals truly fulfill meThis job was moved to a different state. I had mainly negative experiences working here, which helped me get motivated to change career paths.UCB is very demanding.  They are about collecting debt for their clients and making their goals for the month.  Management isn't the greatest, but they will get the job done.  Co-workers are nice but it's a job not a place to make friends.  The hardest part of the job is making the monthly goal when consumers don't want to pay their debt.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when you collect a lot and know that your in bonus.Ucb has opportunities to grow, but at slower pace being that there are so many vets in position. The company give those that are just getting out of school a chance for employment. Ucb offers insurance and incentives for all employees.easy place to work - caring management and excellent healthcare.Management is poor and the work ethics are low. Not a job I would recommend unless you need to something to get you on your feet.Billing to various insurance carriers. too many people in one room with half cubicles hard to concentrate because of noise volume.Making Outbound calls to customers into how to correct there debt situation.Advising customers on how they can settle their debt without making their finances being affected.making sure the sales have the right product and material to see the doctor sells the medicine the company offer them.its ok company to work for.hours are just enough.the hardest part of the job is getting clients on the phone"
114,UCSF,"Good research resource and environment for health science. But research facilities are not organized and centered. It seems that excellent research product come from individual scientist capability and fund.Typical day at work depends from the lab you are in. Learned a lot of life experience, got clear with research in California in general. Management, again, depends from the lab. Hardest part of the job is to publish, again depends from your PI plans. Enjoyable part must be free scheduling of your day.Great place to work if you are looking to gain some professional experience.Management needs to improve considerably in the areas of communication, education, and use of new technologies.Independent yet collaborative workplace; great work-life balance; great benefits; Learned various skills and enhanced my abilities through challenging and exciting day to day duties.UCSF has the best benefits in Northern California, Union, and job security. However the management is most often poor, although organized, and no job advancement unless you are in good with the right people- the who you know type of deal.This job was written poorly and was determined to be too much for one person especially considering the title and compensation.I got a good training in UCSF. Thereare lots of seminar from academy and inudctry, give well-known scientific environment . Also, it's a good place to balance work and life.Excellent team work and opportunities for career advancement.  Fiscal year end has been the busiest time of the year but we managed to closed the accounts in a timely manner.I came from Europe to do my postdoc at UCSF. I found it challenging but very interesting at the same time. People, generally, are very open minded. However, as a high profile institution, expectations are high. Throughout my time at UCSF I had great pleasure to work here and to meet people with highest professional skills.I made also good friends and established a connection to other people around the world.UCSF is a great environment to learn and start out a career. Jobs are entry-level however room to grow and expand is almost non-existence if you are not part of the medical team.working with providers regarding note compliance. completing missing information regarding providers notes for billing/trending reports/must meet lag daysNice place to work. Management very inefficient.I was very good at customer service and had a lot of wonderful remarks from patrons to the hospital.I administered the Capital Asset Inventory for the company. I enjoyed working with all the department Asset Custodians. I enjoyed being in full command of the Equipment Audit function. There was nothing difficult about this job as my qualifications perfectly match the accoing maturity required to handle all accounting hurdles.UCSF is a great company to work for. They have all sorts of jobs and employ a ton of people from all backgrounds and cultures.Arrive before Chief, print out all Branch staff daily calendars, schedule meetings and conference rooms, review and/or revise documents for approval, enter status of all documents into database, help Chief stay on track, prioritize meeting requests, coordinate assignments with Division, Director's, and State Secretary's staff, advise Programs clerical support on preparation of certain items, contact IT when needed, assist Branch staff with desktop issues if possible, prepare Purchase Requisitions for supplies and equipment when necessary, process invoices, rotate supplies and inventory, compile next day or weekly meeting agendas and/or presentations. While working in California Department of Public Health (CDPH) I learned the importance getting monies and information out to the public in a timely manner. I worked with a great team of dedicated public servants who were all passionate about their duties to aid society.The hardest part was when budget cuts would come and the Chief would work 24/7 trying to prevent cutting benefits to our staff and the public. The most enjoyable moments were when the Branch Chief would somehow make it all come together and we would meet our assigned objectives from higher ups.A great experienced to be able to handle and managed the grants in our department with different faculty members and researchers.Supportive and fun staff who enjoy team building and working together to offer solutions and assistance. Management is supportive and provides expert guidance.I loved my time at UCSF and am hoping to get another job with them. Working in a learning center with some of the most talented people I have ever met is wonderful.My day at work was always busy.I increased my medical knowledge and skills.Management the first 10 years was perfect, the communication was open and appreciated.  My last few years with UCSF I experienced managers that did not leave their office,had a shut door policy and did not want input or opinions. Decisions were made and not communicated. I hope they work this out and know we all work better together as a team.My typical day at work consists of reviewing open tickets, following up with customers and scheduling my day to utilize my time to provide maximum efficiency in resolving tickets. Through my time at ITFS, I have obtained a vast amount of experience and knowledge in the field of Information technology (these details can be discussed in person). Management has changed 3 times during my employment which made it difficult to excel in my position, but did not affect my ability to perform. The hardest part of the job is coming across issues that require extensive amounts of time and effort to resolve as oppose to known issues that can be fixed on the spot. The ""most"" enjoyable part of the job for me was the opportunity to meet so many  people.Throughout my career, I have met over 3,000 people and have made so many friends.UCSF is really a nice place to work as a postdoc, benefits are good, and scientific collaborations are awesome here.UCSF truly operates in its core values of pride, respect, integrity, diversity and excellence. It is a great place to work."
146,UCSF Medical Center,"Nurses are overworked. Needs updating. Hospital seems to be lacking funds to update facilities.Good place to work and obtain experience in specialties/fields.Great benefits, union benefits. Con no encouragement/chance for educational advancementFast paced, extremely busy work environment.  Great co-workers and friendly staff.  Great benefits package.  UCSF encourages growth and provides additional training when identified.As the second largest employer in the City, UCSF is made up of a diverse group of people. Many of my colleagues were a joy to work with, despite the fact that there was an almost unanimous feeling of being over-worked. The organization seems unnecessarily top heavy, with many layers of management, and I rarely felt supported by my superiors, either when I needed direction or when I felt overburdened by the number and variety of job requests.As a teaching institution, it is interesting to see many new developments implemented at the facility each day which keeps the employees on their toes with enhancing their knowledge. The management practices servant leadership, however, is often unsuccessful with carrying out such measures due to union contracts.  Co workers are great with collaboration of ideas and patient care techniques during difficult assignments.  The hardest part of the job is portraying efficiency at bedside while juggling a heavy assignment during short staffing.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that one gets to gain valuable knowledge every day via new patient care interventions and research conducted and published by the facility.This is a great place to work if you are looking for stability or have a family.  It is not a great place to work if you are needing to be challenge or need to be stimulated beyond your daily duties.  Opportunity for growth is very hard, you really have to go outside of your department in order to grow.I worked hard at my job for many years, Advancing at a great pace. We had a unique work environment, and we all got along quite well.i learned a bit of mainframe computing, I learned billing, collecting, NIH money and private funds processing.  I even negotiated some accounts with vendors. I learned even more medical terminology than I ever thought possible,The hardest part of the job was political, and why I left to go to graduate school. The head of our lab retired, and the management was never the same.I loved working at UC. It is a great place to work if you find your niche.UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland provides exceptional primary and sub-specialty care as well as access to cutting edge clinical research to a diverse patient population.There is great flexibility and buy-in from the clinical staff to conduct innovative clinical trials here due in large part to the fact that CHO is at heart a small hospital. The downside is that the bureaucracy is not  designed to support the research effort so roadblocks to hiring and financial management are frustrating.Working at the UCSF Campus was an amazing experience. It is a research hospital and they offer millions or opportunities to learn new skills and growth opportunities. San Francisco is a very diverse city and working at UCSF you are given the opportunity to learn about other cultures and their life practices. Management was well organized and informative. The hardest part of the job was being on-hand and witnessing Code Blue patients and their families.The  most enjoyable part of the job was learning and experiencing implementation of new methods, medications, and practices.The money is consistent, the people work hard at this outfit. The managers that I have worked for are really good, and they are very knowledgeable about procedures at hospital protocols* An overall great medical center to work for* Employees are great but not alwayscompensated for their effort* A great retirment plan* Has a lot of classes on line or in personEveryone in the departments extended their knowledge, thorough in the details of all assignments, very busy departments, heavy data entry, specimen cataloging, and filing.Overall, a great environment to spend 8hrs of your day.  Also, you got to have a strong stomach...you are surrounded by ""specimens""...sliced brains and other body parts.  Some of the research you do involves very graphic pictures of medical condition, it can be shocker.Excellent teaching hospital with a homey atmosphere for the children. Every employee takes pride in working at CHO, and professionals working together to take care of these special patients. Friendly co-workers make this teamwork gratifying. Very low turnover rate of employees, which tells you what a good place this is to work. Excellent benefits. The physical plant is old and there is a shortage of space, though work has begun on building a new hospital.There is no such thing as a typical day; every patient is different. Healthy mix of outpatients and inpatients. I have learned to improve my skills courtesy of my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the pediatric patients; it is fun seeing children all day, and fulfilling to help them through what can be a difficult experience. The hardest part of the job is dealing with moribund patients and witnessing the pain of patient's parents.just your typical work food place, serving, preparing, cleaning your station when sold out or done for the day, handling customers orders and modified orders. very fast pace during peak hours,  but management picks on you if you are young. other employees give you a hard time for the same reason.U.C.S.F. Pediatrics Benioff Hospital was the most enjoyable and rewarding place I have ever worked.  Very busy environment but organized with happy co workers/employees.  Everyone, from different professions, work together.  I was a happy employee because of the benefits, compensation, and the appreciation shown by management.Everyone I encountered was kind and loved their work. Staff are all supportive of each other and myself. The work was good and rewarding, and I enjoyed my time there. I learned many skills from juggling multiple projects at once, to valuable life skills, and many office skills that I hope to be able to utilize in a future job.UCSF gave me and opportunity to learn and grown within my family as well as within the world.I was given a chance to lean with ucsf and was able to take life by the bootstraps, I absolutely loved my time with ucsf, I would love to stay but san Francisco and the high rents are more of the issue.Working here is great, however, management needs to learn how to treat their employees better. The job is not easy, but it is rewarding. I enjoy helping patients.UCSF Medical Center is an exceptional place to work with good benefits. I work with Executives and Management that are very supportive and make work enjoyable.typical day is very simple.learned how to clean baby bed and clean pumps.management is very kind hearted.enjoyable part of the job is seeing the babies.This was a contract position to train staff in the use of new software.  Since it was in IT, the pay was extremely good, although as a contract employee, you aren't eligible for benefits.  My co-workers were probably 1/2 and 1/2 regarding a sense of professionalism and giving the best and most accurate information possible in the most professional manner possible.  There were both contract people on the project and UCSF employees.  The hardest thing was probably dealing with last minute changes and expectation that we weren't just flexible, but could indeed make the impossible happen."
265,UL,"Each day I visit a factory that could be of any type of industry and conduct a social compliance audit, where I tour the plant to assess the safety of the workplace, talk privately with the employees to gauge their experience, training and treatment by supervisors, and review of EHS programs as well as HR practices.I usually worked solo but occasionally partnered with another auditor from the team.  Our team is very supportive of each other and always helping each other in communication as we audit.I learned how different products are made, the OSHA regulations for health and safety, EPA regulations, and most of all, how to delegate different task items to different managers throughout the day and work with different types of people of different cultures across the country and Canada.  The most enjoyable job for me, at the same time, is working with people all day, getting to know people of different cultures and languages, and helping people learn things they didn't know and how to improve their facilities.The hardest part of the job is not being home as much, and not having a constant schedule, as I receive my travel schedule only a week in advance for each week.  It is also hard to do several audits within a week when there is residual work in the evenings to complete between audits, while having travel between audits in addition.  It is a challenge to balance work life and personal life.This company is undergoing so much change and trying to find its identity. This company has no direction at this time. They have no concern for their employees or customers. The turnover rate is extremely high and the moral is very low.This company and its management team makes many promises but doesn't keep them. I had many made to me about bonuses - pay increases - training, etc and not one was kept. As a matter of fact - I was scheduled for training and they pulled it from me but gave it to someone else who was the managers pet. And the managers show favoritism. It is not about if you can do the job and do it well - it is about if you fit their mold personality wise. You cannot and are not allowed to be your own unique self but you must conform to what they think you should be. They do not promote training, professional growth, advancement from within or anything that improves you as an employee and individual. The managers have their favorites and those favorites get all the special treatment. I highly recommend staying away from - especially the Franklin, TN location office."
288,Umpqua Bank,"Fun company, great people to work with. They are turning towards a big bank model. Great benefits and compensation but those things are changing. Every location is differentFriendly, cheerful, but rather rude when getting to know a new client.  Lots of turnover in employees.  Mediocre management, some training.Great financial experience. The position helps an individual learn all things banking, report development and financial. There is always room for growth for those looking for it.We work hard and help the community, that is what Umpqua Bank is all about. From handing out Ice Cream at our local schools to painting a woman shelter, Umpqua a fully dedicated to it's community and employees.Very fun place to work. Good life work balance. Works with people's life and schedule chanhes. Very competitive pay. Positive people including managers and Co workersEvery job has its down side however, it's important to find the positives for a happy work life. At Umpqua I have found the good, made a few wonderful friends, and been awarded freedom to venture out for personal growthh in the company. This company has a low turnover rate and is on Forbes best companies to work for list (impressove for a bank). Overall, I have been happy with my work life here at Umpqua.More than adequate training, coaching and opportunity to make more money by referrals, shadow credit and overall satisfaction with customers.Over the phone Customer ServiceOn line help and researchBusiness online bankingCommercial Credit card assistanceDebit card and disputes researchUmpqua Bank is a great company to work for. They have a diverse and inclusive work culture with a strong commitment to the people in our communities.Umpqua believe in promoting from within and encourage it's employee to look for new opportunities within the company.I was employed with Umpqua through Elwood Staffing Agency for  four months. A typical work day started with getting a prioritized list of loans that needed Loan Estimates and Closing Disclosures executed that day. I learned how to generate  Loan Estimates and Closing Disclosures for home buyers. Following lending guidelines our duty was to insure loan terms,taxes and general fees are calculated correctly.The management team had daily meetings to insure we followed lending guidelines  to the letter.The daily management support was lacking due to pending layoffs. My Co-workers were very supportive and helpful. The Hardest part of the Job was watching the restructuring of departments and  veterans being laid off while your trying to obtain a permanent position. The best part of the job was completion of the disclosure on time which meant a home had been purchased or a refinance was complete.I really enjoyed this job. I didn't like the banking part. The regulation of banking is not fun, but the job itself, and the company is pretty great. They have a HUGE help desk, so you never feel alone, or uninformed. The turnover is quite high, however; which makes it very hard to focus, and get on trackA wonderful place to work.  Very light and professional atmosphere.  All employees are hard working and happy.  I am very happy to have experienced Umpqua Bank.Umpqua Bank was a nice place to work.   I enjoyed working with the staff. I did work  from a remote site that made it a little difficult in communicating with processing and the new TRID program.Due to department consolidation the Bank has re-structured it's operations in the Mountlake Terrace area. Otherwise, a great place to work~Great place to work, management welcomed input on how to improve processes and the whole office helped to get the job done.Umpqua bank is a great place to work. I was a contract employee and was always treated as an equal. I had hoped to be a FTE but the budget did not allow it at this time.I loved working at the bank.  This was a great position to interact with many different types of people and situations.  The support staff was amazing and very much a team!  Loved problem solving and helping customers and families make the right decisions for themselves financially.A typical day at work consists of working with several loan officers on loans.  Pipelines can be upwards to 50 loans and closing 2/3 of the pipeline on a monthly basis is expected.Hardest part of the job is trying to get it all done as quickly as possible. Never seems to be enough time in the day.Underwriters and Closing department great to work with.  Everyone has a Team attitude.Management needs some polishing.  Feeling under valued is common amongst the regions processors.Pay and benefits are very competitive.Don't work in the IT group, they don't believe in nor follow the rest of the company culture. However, no matter where you work, it's about who you know. The entire company is about who you know and who likes you. People do mean well and try very hard to help the community as a whole, that is rewarded.This company has a lot of potential; however, it lacks positive leadership and organization to bring it all together.  Office politics, favoritism,  negative reinforcement and poor management tend to overshadow the positive aspects of working at this place.  There is no formal training and little encouragement to advance within the company.  Some of the coworkers are combative but most are nice to work with.the department that I work in there is no positive reinforcement at all  and they won’t help the employees move around with in the bank"
543,Unilever,"I love working for Unilever . I was enjoyed making ice cream and work with good co-workers work as team and make job much easy. I was very sad when we got laid off from job and the plant shut-down.The culture is great and the company does fun things for their employees. The management and HR are horrible though. You are never working hard enough or doing enough for anyone there.  They like 22yo's and like to groom them so managers are 26 and have zero management or life experience. They are all about the metrics not having a happy work/life balance.Unilever is a great place to work if you like being part of a global corporation. The company has great benefits for salaried employees, and encourages personal development.fun fun fun place to work.  Lots of challenges, if I had a question, someone was always there to assist.  Great place to work.I wished I had stayed living in NJ, I would have loved to retire from this company.Scope of roles have great depth and breath. Colleagues & Work Environment are positive natureGood Products and Innovation pipelineGreat Diverse CultureToo much to accommodate within a small amount of time, pushing one to either work consistently during off-work hours or fall behind.Lack of appreciation for work done stemming from a fundamental lack of understanding of effort involved in accomplishing tasks.Cleaning offices the hardest part of the job climbing three flights of stairs 8 to 10 times a day. the most rewarding part of the job was meeting new people.I liked working for the time I'm workingGood Person's And I learned a lot for My supervisorsThe Good Crew and Support the staffI've worked at Unilever JC for 17 years.  It was a good place to work up until the last 4 years.  New management & HR sucked the happiness from lower managemt & production.  Poor raises like 1%, or none at all.  Health insurance is at an all time high, making it difficult to takie family members to Dr.  Point system : 8 in one year, getting point for being one minute late.  Even if your in a car accident.  Better be on time if the roads are ice covered, no lea way at all.  4 years ago, they would work with you on issues such as these.  Running lines under staffed is almost an everyday thing.  Making it a risk to work safely.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this job to my worst enemy.My name is peter pan and this site requires a test. So I will type a long winded sentence talking about how things could always be better. I was happy getting a job with unilever then depressed by how silly things can get.I have no complaints working with Unilever It has been a pleasure to work for this staffing company. Manpower has open plenty of doors for me making sure I get sufficient pay, a good working experience and have made me feel valuable as a worker.I really dont disapprove of Unilever, but I dont really recommend it. The turnover rate is outstanding. The people are okay, but the wear and tear this job puts on your body is unbearable. Great experience though.It was a union job so all the eeoc laws were enforced. Nothing is perfect, but this was not far from it.Safety meetings were regular. Seniority was used to before skills but this meant an opportunity for advancement was offered but not given. If the person failed that tests, the next level of seniority was then given a chance.The human resources department is horrible.  They never have an answer to a question.  The job itself didn't seem too difficult but the employees made it so.  They weren't welcoming of direct hires and would love to always sit back and watch you fail.  I left due to medical reasons and was let go.  In some way I've never been so happy to be fired from a job!I enjoyed working at Unilever.  Beautiful campus and a diverse population of employees.   I was lucky to have a manager that encouraged and supported me in my work.Work day goes by very fast with keeping equipment running and performing maintenance on equipment. Very positive work environment and extremely clean facility.Challenging opportunities in the field of foodservice and retail production. Always changing to keep pace with markets.  Wide spectrum packaging and formulation processes.Even though i work 3rd shift, everyone still comes in with a positive ready to work attitude. Mostly every Unilever employee is willing to help in their own way.Unilever was my first job. I began in Q.C. since there were no openings in R&D. However, the learning form my Q.C. experience helped me more effectively commercialize products that I developed as member of R&D group. I had the opportunity to work on consumer products related to both skin and hair. For my advancement, I was given the opportunity to take a substantial number of professional courses, which helped me advance my career. This additional knowledge also benefitted the company, because I was able to develop more advanced and innovative products, which met/ exceeded consumer needs and expectations.I would recommend for anyone who wants to be part of a large global organization.  To advance beyond manager level the competition is strong and you really need to be flexible on location.  Need to be ready to stay 3-5 yrs and move on.  Proud to work for a company which invests in our society.I was hired here just 6 months ago being told that the work schedule was a 12 hour day with 3 days on & 4 off one week & then 4 days on & 3 off the next. Occasional overtime would be posted to cover vacations & such as needed. This was an outright lie. Yes we do work 12 hours, may be forced to a 16 hour shift with almost no notice & you get 1 day off on a long week & 2 non consecutive days off on the short week. I work anywhere between 60 & 80 hours each week. This has taken a severe toll on my family life & health. The work itself isn't too bad but the hours & no set time off make it impossible to do anything but go to work."
399,United Airlines,"Handled a wide variety of situations while in continuous contact with the public. Worked independently or as part of a team without supervision. It was a pleasure going to work.Travel is exciting at first but the pay is so low you cant live or enjoy layovers if you are new. Company is top heavy-Too many over paid managers who need to justify their existence and the Senior Flight Attendants run the Union that creates rules to serve only them because they are rightfully angry their pension was taken in the bankruptcy after they agreed to a pay cut to save the company on the condition they would keep their pension. the company was supposed to return the pension money when they made any profit but the top heavy management would vote themselves raises keeping the money for themselves. The new hires have taken the brunt of this in pay, scheduling, and union protection.I love working for United. My boss is very approachable and my entire team is devoted to our performance not only as developing individuals, but as a holistic team on behalf of the entire company. We all help each other out when we have questions about new tools/processes, and enjoy celebrating and milestones with food and happy hours. The most challenging part of the job is leaving at the end of each day. My position requires me to take very time-sensitive actions, which frequently necessitates me to stay late to address new/unexpected requests.It's a good JOB (mind how I didn't say career) to have if you'd like to be more involved with the aviation industry. I was able to work with good people and see some pretty incredible things. The compensation, however, is almost sub-livable at the start, and the job requires relocation unless you're lucky enough to be based out of your home city. Do more research before applyingGet to work @7:45am, morning meeting on objectives & goals, first call @9am, last call is usually@ 5:30pm unless your on duty then u could get a call as late as 10pm, i learned alot about residential split system diagnosis and repairs, the hardest part was being in 150 degree attics for hours, the most enjoyable part was my coWorkers & the camaraderie that you build. If your 18-21 and don't have any true responsibilities this is perfect for you. But if u have a family depending on your income look elsewhere bc if the AHS (American Home Sheild) calls dry up, be prepared to sit at home not making a dime all day..Highly stressful hostile environment on a very consistent basis.Management is nowhere to be found when needed. Extremely unorganized. A typical day at work includes angry passengers screaming at you for following procedures and little to no support from management. Very low paying. Free flight benefits, but you cant afford to take time off to go anywhere! perfect for someone young with NO bills.Come in on time or early.Never pass an employee with out saying hello.Knowing everyone by first name.Check out the status of the operation, and go where the operation need me the most.Enjoy working with and supporting the employees with there personal problems or company difficulties.The biggest asset to any company is the employees, if they enjoy coming to work and are happy with their jobs, the customer will be happy with their service.A great company to work for with very good health benefits.  Safety minded when working around aircraft and around the airport environment.  Team work is encouraged to minimize in a changing weather and physical surroundings.  Nice to meet people from all walks of life and can be challenging at times to make sure flights are on time.  Must be able to work when service is needed 24/7 and safety not at risk. Must meet physical requirements, example equipment break down or short on staffing.The airline has struggled since the merger, there remains dissension within the ranks and upward mobility is stymied at present. There continues to be significant changes in the company and future job leveling happening.Always exciting days. lots of people to serve and please. I loved interacting with our guests and making sure they felt welcome' I learned a lot about world cultures and customs. immediate adaptability to those cultures is important to maintain good customer service standards.The hardest part was trying to maintain an objective mind, due to the terrorist threat, but still giving excellent customer service.United is a great place to work with friendly and interactive co workers across departments.  The flight benefits are a great reward for the hard work, but make the job worth it.  Management can be a challenge depending on the department, but for the most part it is a company of hard workers who are dedicated to delivering excellent customer service.Balance and multi-tasking is a daily must to run the operation of a major airline company. There are constant and continuous change and it requires quick thinking and adaptability skills to make key decisions.I love working at ORD, it's fast paced and I enjoy working with a lot of the passengers. But management and some of the veterans are extremely rude to not only us their co-workers but the passengers as well, and not very helpful to new agents like myself. Also the things you sit in a class for three and a half weeks to learn basically go right out the window once you are placed on the floor because everyone has a different way of doing things. So if you think your going to ask for help and it's done the way you were trained....forget about it. You end up being more confused than when you started out. Not to mention there is no job flexibility especially during you 90 day probation period. See there's a point system and I started with 4 points and they go like a snap of the finger. I got sick and had to go to the ER and got a point, I was told that it was an unexcused absence even with doctors orders to stay home that day. My daughter had surgery and had to go back to see her surgeon and I was told that that was an unexcused absence. So if you want to keep your job come to work half dead and pray your kids or close family doesn't get ill because your job to them comes first and everything else second.a job that is fast paced and always evolving with the culture around it with many opportunities to move around. Always a chance for advancement as well as great benefitsGood job. okay benefits. good flight benefits. good pay, but in the most expensive locations. good chance for advancement. good coworkers. great learning experienceUnited Airlines motto ""Work hard Play Hard"".  Working for United Airlines has a lot of perks especially the benefits of flying.  Working in two departments of United Airlines has made me meet allot of great people and understand the airlines better.I applied for a part time position there for the benefits.  Well I was scheduled for 6 and 1/2 hours during the middle of the day.  and they have called mandatory overtime for 4 hours several times.  I have never heard of a part time job where you work 40 hours a week.  Expectations of the job were not set correctly.i enjoy this company and love the industry.  I enjoy the staff.  I gained vast knowledge of Aircraft and enjoyed the challenging role.   Fast paced and enjoyed my position.I gave my heart and soul to the Frontline Workers. The Frontline Workers is the glue to United Airlines Operations. The Men and Women works so hard for their Beloved Company.Being a Ramp Agent lead was great. You are basiclly the voice of the managers, you kind of still have the same authority as a manager just not as muchh responsibilities and paper work. Great benefits, not a great job if you were in school. They care nothing about your outside life.I miss working there..People were great. the benefits were fair..Seeing the world was easy if you had the time and money to go..I just had to move to Oregon to be near ill family members"
202,United Technologies Corp,"When we were selling product, there were several challenging projects to work on that made each day a satisfying experience.  Today, this company has extensive business issues with no viable product offerings and no new products on the horizon.   The original workplace culture placed a large emphasis on empowering the employee, but that culture has deteriorated significantly since being acquired by UTC.UTC had great pay and very good benefits. Management and organization was in constant re-org after re-org over which was stressful.Besides what you hear in the news about Carrier and 1500 production positions being off-shored. This is a well established company in the community and is continuing to grow.Salary is good.  However, health benefits are THE WORST I've seen.  Borderline illegal.  Management is inefficient and is more focused on multiple international meetings rather than getting anything accomplished.  This is definitely not a place for someone in the Software world.  Be warned.I can't give a good review. I mostly worked in a different building than most of my co-workers. But the time I did spend with them was a very professional experience.UTC is a gigantic corporation.  Being so large, there would appear to be ample opportunity for career advancement within and outside of its various business units.  However, there appears to be favoritism at work, especially when considering UTC has grown as large as it has by buying other smaller corporations.  Depending on where you started in the business, your career might be limited if you were a part of one of those acquired business units (see Goodrich).I worked in the manufacture and technology department building circuit boards and working the AOI machine.  We made circuit boards for a lot of technology systems.Worked on assembly line, also was a lead person, learned all the jobs on the line to assist the workers who would fall behind or be absent.This is a good company to work for with steady work and great employees to work with.  Like any company it has its ups and downs  but overall I would give it a positive rating for sure.The work environment was good with an emphasis on safety procedures and safe guards on equipment. I learned many manufacturing skills and what it takes to succeed. The plant employees are very friendly and helpful. The management however is not very helpful when it comes to advancement opportunities.A typical day for me is to come in, check which machinery or equipment have maintenance checks due. I perform those as a first priority given there are no technical difficulties with the machines on the production lines. When a machine goes down and isn't running that is my first priority is troubleshooting and repair. I order and submit requests for any spare parts that are needed for approval. I also complete side projects assigned to me such as researching equipment models to develop operator PM's or adjusting work spaces to make room for new equipment, etc. The hardest part of my day would be the amount of work that can drop on me all at once. It is only myself and one other technician that covers the shift so if either of us is out and multiple issues come up at once, we can become overwhelmed fairly quickly. For me, the most enjoyable part would have to be all of the nice coworkers and people I have met. Also, I feel accomplished when I repair electronics and get them up and running smoothly.Great place to work.  Everyone is very friendly and helpful.  I was offered many opportunities to do work outside of my role and take on extra projects.Working as a contractor is a good foot in the door. Although there is minimum opportunity for employment directly through the company, the environment is great and the people are very helpful.I have learned a lot about Excel and PowerPoint as we work extensively on both of them. Though some processes need overhauling.I had an exceptional career with United Technologies.  I traveled and had experiences only one could dream of.  I was laid off in December of 2008.  I understand  being a Financial Analyst why they laid off 7,500 salaried employees.  Many had 25+ years.  They could hire younger people pay them have the wage I was making and save the company a considerable amount of money.  It's been a challenge finding suitable employment in this field.  Unfortunately, I understand this happens with many individuals after working at UTC.Most employees are extremely unhappy with the culture, but stay due to financial obligations. Management does not keep employees informed on changes in the organization.I finished my degrees  thru the UTC scholar program, worked  26 years, laid off  after most work got outsourced away from our group UIThe company suffers from severe nepotism and unfortunately hires supervisors who do not really understand the aspects of their area of responsibility. Apparently quality procedures are not mandatory but merely a suggestion to some. Management is overly obsessed with charts and graphs that do not reflect actual workflow. The mindset is severely ""pro production"" and supervision will try to find ways to side step quality processes to meet master schedule.This was  wonderful company to work for and the job responsibilities were challenging.    I enjoyed all of the projects - senior management conferences, developing and help design in conjunction with an outside contractor floor plans, product displays, exhibitry and graphics within corporate specifications for our trade show booth.Recently United Technologies has become infamous in the news.  It is planning on sending its last American factory to Mexico.  More on this later; I should describe my time at work first.After my freshman year of college, I got a summer job doing factory work for a relative's employer (will not specify which relative, to help maintain anonymity).  Despite the overtime, which included five weekends and normal two-hour extensions on days, I think it was worthwhile getting this experience.  We learned of each overtime at the end of the previous workday's shift.  The overtime was given because the company had a lot of orders to fill.  The company had a policy of having us work no more than two weekends in a row.I liked the assembly line and part preparation tasks, though others might think otherwise, because I could work pretty quickly at those tasks.The hardest part of my was easily the mandated overtime.  Being a recent hire, having low seniority made me one of the first to be selected for overtime.Coworkers were a bit vulgar for my tastes, but then again, they were working for twelve to fourteen dollars an hour, and my tastes are more traditional than among the general population.Ultimately, this was a fair enough first taste of work.  That was three years ago, however, and the company has changed a little since then.The highest level of leadership seems to be made of nothing but, as my relative calls them, ""bean counters.""  The transition of factories out of the United States was predominantly to reduce federal taxes, not, as many people think, to save  more... money on salaries.  The taxes far exceed the salaries.  My relative, as an engineer, enjoyed being able to work right next to the assembly line, where boards could be tried out fairly quickly and engineers could work out any problems more directly.  Apparently United Technologies has had management problems for some years now, with the executives unwilling to spend money to upgrade the facilities, but this scenario takes the cake.If I were rating the company based on my past experiences, I would give somewhat higher ratings.  As it is, I rate the company based more on how my relative feels.  lessTypically day to day I work monitoring and supporting with issues reported by customers, suppliers and customer service. I learned EDIHQ perfectly and JDE. Co-workers helped a lot. The hardest part of job is we got an issue with JDE server side, for that I worked day and night to resolve the issue. Mapping and attending team meeting is the most enjoyable part."

Management was constantly changing which I feel did not help the business at all. The business has had no failures for 45 years in space, which I attribute to the actual workers not the management.

Some direct work employees are great, some had very opinionated of contract employees as dead beats and emphasized it several times.Most enjoyable part was to  correct and complete all the manufacturing process revisions 4 months earlier than what was forecasted. Documented assembly processes that weren't corrected for 4 years.Salary is good.  However, health benefits are THE WORST I've seen.  Borderline illegal.

Over the last few years, the company has taken the focus off employee growth and  training. It is a decent place for young people to get a start, but it is not a company to stay with for the long term.

157,UnitedHealth Group,"Work with a great team and manager. Love working autonomously, but can get lonely. Compensation is ok. Do not make near the median income for the metro area I live in.  Health benefits are not great .The job is virtual/work from home and I have found it a good place to work.  However, since it is work from home, they are strict about you always being at your computer unless you're on a break.I have been working at UHG for some time. The work environment is excellent.  It is a big company and not all departments have the same culture. The salary and benefits leave you wanting.The pay is minimal. The over time is manadatry.The company is very large. Over last 5 years the company has gone to a work at home platform. Very hard to find a manager unless you are being corrected.Would love to work for them again but of course under new management. Loved what I did. Loved all my previous supervisors, team lead and managers.It is an ok place to work.  There is nothing spectacular to say, you log on the computer, you work, you go to lunch, you log back in, you work some more, you log out and go home. You come back the next day and you do the same thing. The end.no cell phones on the floor you have to lock away your purses and cell phones in a locker and you can not use paper at all on the call center floor. it is like you are in jail. however it pays the bills.Answer anywhere from 60-80 inbound calls on a daily basis assisting health care providers for claims, pre-certification, and benefits.Most enjoyable part of my job is learning something new each day.Good culture of people, the training for the position was really bad.  Did not cover anything that we actually do; so not prepared once we got started.  Very punitive in nature regarding these issues.  Employee accumulates ""defects"" for items they were not trained on; they call it a ""coaching opportunity"".Fun eventful work days. They gave free food for lunch of your from any stand in the stadium. great team work. i learned a lot i didn't know about basebal.lDuring my current project, I've met with many employees from many different backgrounds. Everyone I met was great to work with and passionate about the work they do.UHC Oldsmar is all about your call numbers not about its' employees.Management at best is very young with no experience. It's a good old boy network and if they like you your are not written up with below standard numbers or the days you miss don't count toward your attendance.

I had a great support system and excellent work/family balance. I had a family illness and was able to work through all my crises.Could be a great place too work.  Not a clear focus on the marketplace direction. Hard to accomplish goals with monthly management changes.  good coworkers.  Ability to work from home, which limited the amount of commute time.seems difficult at first but as you start to understand it becomes easier. great place for advancement if you can make it thru the first year.the job itself is a great career, it is a fantastic feeling knowing i made a difference in someones life.  I enjoy helping families in need and doing everything i can to solve their issue.Worked as a Hadoop developer in United Health Group for nearly 2 years as a fulltime employee in offshore Hyderabad, India location.

63,Unity,"I come into my office check emails and check with the pastor to see if there is anything extra she needs me to do for her that day. I make the powerpoint for the upcoming week and print out any checks needed to pay bills. I answer phone and transfer calls. I make copies of flyers and make new flyers that are needed for the upcoming church service. I enjoy my job here. The garden in the courtyard is a  wonderful place to eat lunch and reflect on my day. The pastor is so encouraging and I just love working for her. I dont believe there is a hard part to my job.Use to love going to work.  My coworkers were my second family.  A typical day at work is answering phones and processing a little mail.  Was great at multi-tasking.It was a Fun day for all the Seniors, I learnt that just because you in your 9o's or even in your 100's that doesn't mean you cant drive, work out and have a little fun too.my co-workers and I al had a different section in what we had to do and we all had fun doing it. The hardest part when I first started was answering the phones and putting it through to the person they wanted to speak to, But I must say now I am GREAT at it. The most enjoyable part is now answering the phones and looking at all the seniors talk to each other and playing uno and etc.My department includes hard working team players. We worked well together to get the job done. I appreciate all their hard work.I work as a bilingual customer care representative. I answer phone calls in both languages and reply to Spanish email from customers. I process the regular mail and handle subscriptions of our magazine, books, etc. There are 30-35 people in my department and we all work independently. The hardest part of my job is every other month we receive many phone calls (our magazines delivers once every other month) to order magazines. The most enjoyable part of my job is the friendly environment.It was an event we signed up for during school to do chair massages in the park. it was fun but difficult as the day was long and hot. but they didnt mind me cutting out for 30 minutes or so to rest and eat, enjoying the events at the park before getting back to give more massages.no day is the same with it's ups and downs, this type of work definitely requires alot of patience working with people of all ages that need our help with their daily bathing cares. I work with a great team of professionals that communicate and work well with each other. The most difficult part of this profession is dealing with death. I have learned not to be afraid of death, but to remember it as the start of another journey in life and the rewards of this profession is seeing a smile, a touch on the hand and knowing you made someones day better.The Unity Group uses local golf courses and golf tournaments to unite families and people in the local community. We are typically planning tournaments, searching for sponsorships for tournaments, recruiting members into our one stop golf discount plan. I am co-owner and CEO with the majority share in the company. The hardest part is getting a ""start up business"" rolling in this economy. The goal of this company is noble in nature, and is meant to create unity between people that might not otherwise meetA typical day at work would consist of daily shift duties and checking in with the previous shift to make note of any changes that could have been made for meds or any diet changes. I have learned to be patient with every resident and to take a step in their shoes and understand where they are coming from. Our management at Unity Group was excellent, always fair, understanding and fulfilled their duties well. The hardest part of my job, was dealing with extreme behaviors. The most enjoyable part of my job was developing relationships with the residents, you'll find out that they all have something special about each and every one of them. You can find them to be quite the comedians and givers themselves.I felt like during my time at Unity House it was clear to me that people were there for the betterment of the clients. We worked hard to provide the best care for our clients. Unity House does great work for the community and especially the clients they serve.I worked as a volunteer at Unity of Jacksonville. Initially I started working with the toddlers. I actually never saw myself working with children until this experience. It was most rewarding because the work help me to find the true passion fulfilling my purpose.The Experience with the youth was fun and rewarding. I was a volunteer but I treated the position and the youth as they were my own. Facility has changed in leadership since early 2002 but the team at unity worked lovingly together.I loved working here. But didn't like the staff I was working with. Always going against me and trying to get me into trouble for stuff I didn't do.Lovely place to be creative and independent and task and goal skill builder.Love doing my job. Management and co workers were great. The hardest part of my job was listening to grieving callers.This job will allow for the day to go by rapidly and keep you physically active."
42,Unity Technologies,"Great culture overall. Casual. Fun. Collaborative. Open communication. Intelligent. Forward Thinking. Innovative. Pushing the limits of engineering the in the the gaming spaceGreat place to work, with fun and friendly people.  I did notice that communication from the top down, as well as from team to team seems to get lost.The last company I worked at had a very old school state of mind. Slacks, cubicles, closed door policy, no happy hour, zero team bonding, etc. It is such a relief to be at Unity where I have the opportunities to grow, try new things and really expand my horizons. I've been here for almost 3 months and the responsibilities I have been given are amazing. I'm learning things here I would have had to beg for the opportunity to try at my last job.Excited to be apart of this journey and see where we as a company arrive!This place is going downhill culture wise. There seem to be layoffs every 3 months, they are slowly removing all of the perks, and the culture is becoming more stringent and less fun. Overall a typical workday is not that stressful but the exciting innovating times seem to be a thing of the past."
331,Universities Space Research Association,"Was able to work with experts from around the country in order to develop new materials for heat shields used during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere.

Everyone was nice and friendly and worked with you.You meet the best people working for USRA at NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center. The company and clients are interesting and easy to work with; the work is challenging and rewarding. I hated to leave, but contractors live with the knowledge that money is not always available."
405,University of Chicago,"There are many opportunities at UCM!  The organization strives to provide excellent patient care and to be at the FOREFRONT OF MEDICINE.  Everyone is kind and a pleasure to work with.The University of Chicago is an environment that is constantly changing.. The workload is fast and may change within a moments notice. There is always something that need immediate attention.This is what I like about Working for the University of Chicago.  My focus is manly customer service and my customers are the President of the school, faculty, staff and students. However the downfall of the position that I hold as Facility Coordinator is that I can only hire students to work in the department and they don't usually have any work experience so they lack the skill set needed.A typical day at The University of Chicago starts off with a very peaceful and pleasant environment that allowed me to flow right into the work day. I learned from my colleagues in  the Metabolism program to pay close attention to details and to always go over any unclear instructions. I was very pleased with the relationship my co-workers and I established and that was we always worked in our solution as team players. The most challenging part of my job was working with heads of departments and programs but being the level headed and diplomatic individual I am this only grew my people skills. The most enjoyable part of my job was all of my staff that I worked for did not limit me and allowed me to manage and coordinate the committee with out hesitation trusting my work ethic and judgment.The University is very large and decentralized. Thus, many employees transfer between departments. The University focuses first on faculty, then on students. Often, general staff don't receive a lot of attention.Nice company to work for. Very please to be a part of the growth of the company. I would recommend working for this company.Loved working here, only temporary though. Very hard to become employed here. Usually employee were post grad of U of C.They try to accommodate what they could for their employees, including shuttles for the parking areas. The work environment was professional, and they did what they can to ensure HIPAA standards were maintained.I clean the washrooms in the hospital and make sure that soap and tissue is stocked and available for the patients. I vacuum, wash windows in the lobby and also make sure it is presentable. My co-workers are the best we help each other any way we can the true meaning of team work makes the dream work. The hardest part of the job is keeping it clean with all the traffic in and out of the facility. The enjoyable part of the job is the nice people I meet on a daily basis while doing my job.This University is filled with the most brilliant minds and driven people I have ever met. I am incredibly impressed with everyone I meet and work with.I did my graduate work at the University of Chicago. The programs there are very competitive and prepared me well for my future career as a research scientist. I loved the city and miss it still.Workday: Check emails and notes from the day before and get to work.  Everyday is differentLearned:  the journey people take through the course of medical schoolManagement:  Good people  Co-workers:  Great people to work with  Hardest part: Nothing was too hardMost enjoyable: Working in the summerI learned the basics of providing director clinical care to a very diverse population of patients.I also learned about ""office politics.""My tenure at the University of Chicago, helped me determine the direction I wanted my professional career as a RN to proceed.I spent two weeks at the University of Chicago shadowing a graduate student in the Genetics Lab. I observed multiple different lab procedures and then performed them myself. Overall, I learned a lot from this experience and it was quite enjoyable.The University of Chicago is great place to work. They understand the importance of work to life balance, and my annual salary matched the cost of living in the area. There are many opportunities for advancement.Getting right to work, completing my daily tasks and working a  team player. Making sure my work is completed and correct, before leaving for the day.The University is a beautiful campus with great academic minds, good services, and wonderful amenities.  I would highly recommend working here if you have the chance.We are a self-sufficient clinical area. We strive on patient satisfaction/engagement and have an open door policy. The hardest part of my job is prioritizing exams that need to be done. the most enjoyable part of my job is participating in building the moral with my teammates and Leaders.Hard working and fun,get along with co-workers and management. Very knowledgeable of what needs to get done and room for growth.Beautiful campus, including the Gothic architecture, tulips in the spring, and green space. . + Rigorous academics taught by excellent faculty, some of whom are Nobel Prize winners. The university is with no doubt an outstanding educational  & professional work institution. If you want to come to this ""brainy"" university just to study and do nothing else, I'd highly encourage you to do so. The university is great, the professors are great, and the administration is also great as well  the employers.Processes in place to achieve goals. Some ethical issues with leadership may have been addressed by now. Dependable and knowledgeable staff. Tendency to seek professional guidance in the form of consultants when necessary. Showing dedication towards positive change.I really enjoyed working here, the work culture and the technologies they were using were really interesting.I got good scope to learn here and also implement what I have already learned.Most of their applications were on .NET."

Everything that is needed to be procudutve is avaiblne.  However, there is no work life balance.  The benefits are great, but due to the demands of a management role you’re fully able to appreciate all the benefits that are offered.Employment has  unfavorable attendance policy for nursing that the union is trying to reject. Promotes higher education. Short staffing on floors. There is a disconnect between management and floor nursing, like most hospitals.A very fast paced and sometimes chaotic atmosphere. This is a place to learn new concepts and get hands on work with some of the newest technology.Great place to work for. A typical day at work is blood collection for patient who are ill.  Processing lab specimens and testing blood specimens.  providing customer service by answering questions to  health care staff both inpatient and out patient regarding blood collection and testing.This was a great place to work. Great training programs, lots of workshops and in-service. Tuition reimbursement was a wonderful touch not to mention internships was a great advancement. The uniform cleaning bonus was a great benefitEnjoyed learning  the backside of how diagnosis are found..  Doctors willing to teach employees. Good work environment for employees,. Hardest part leavingBest part helping othersU of C is a place to learn and grow within the system. They tend to take care of their people and encourage them to move up within the system. This is a great place to work.I liked working there very much ,a typical work day was busy meeting deadlines but not extreme.I love the atmosphere of the whole place.I think if you get in the right department ,its a really great place to grow.Great with patient health care and employees benefits are great and so is your co-workers. Parking is expensive for patient and employees.Hired in as a Temp position, billing office, in Darien. Clean place to work. Lots of work, always busy. Everyone works together as a team.A typical day at the University of Chicago is never a typical day! Its always interesting and eventful! I must say that's what makes my  work day. Assisting patients with coordinating appointments and post appointment procedures. I work with a great group of co-workers that really focus on the patient experience. We work together cohesively to ensure that the patients have the best experience possible. Our team definitely tries to make sure that we take special care of our patients. Working here at the University can make you feel like you have a second family, whether it be with the patients or your co-workers. The hardest part of this job is to see the extremely sick children suffer through their illnesses and the toll that it takes on the families. Here we make sure that our patients are as comfortable as possible while they are in our care. I enjoy being apart of that patient experience thatFast paced and sometimes overwhelming, the University is truly at the 'Forefront of Medicine."" I have the pleasure of working with some of the most highly respected group of peers who really value what their work and contributions mean to the many patients and families that walk through our doors daily. I love being able to make a positive diffrence in someone's life at such a vulnerable timethis was my first job. I was happy and excited about starting and see how it feel to work but i learn how to make a prefect sandwich and greeting with the people as i make they food.No one in this field cares about the well being of the employees it's all about money and once your no longer in with their company and try to get back they look at you as a total stranger..Very professional laid back culture encourages professional development and self initiative. Management is very attuned to employee sentiment.Very diverse work place and there is a lot of room for growth. The University is a very large place and always ahead of current medical practices.Difficult job to learn with many variables. No opportunity for lunch. Management very strict and not forthcoming.  Best part of job was interactions with outside facilities physicians and nurses.  Co-workers were nice.Caring to patients needs, surrounding staff members, staff and non- staff members.  Gives quality care at all.  Teaches staff to continue to do better, assists by giving tools such as seminars and classes to  staff to reach goals to make the best team."

Easy work life balance, one in which you can feel free to pursue your passions!I had the pleasure of working for one of the most respected professors in my department. He had my best interests at heart, and is truly a genuine person. The work was always challenging and interesting, and I have him to thank for a lot of my successes thereafter.The University of Washington has a problem with micromanaging. we would have the manager, front supervisor, back supervisor and lab supervisor under one roof at one time. We were a new clinic at the time so not much to do.Incredible work is done at the University of Washington, in so many different ways. In the health sciences alone, people are looking for cures for cancer and other healthcare issues, trying to solve public health problems, environmental issues, and diseases, It can be an intense place to work, but it can also be a lot of fun. It's people are the best.UW is a great place to work. Great life/work balance, great benefits. nice and beautiful Seattle area.UW has strong scientific records, great place for medicine, EE and CS. However, if you want to learn chemistry or Materials Science, you'd better think other places.Great place to work if you need a foot in the door or if you are close to retiring. I like the flexibility of my position and that I feel comfortable going to my supervisor for questions.Most enjoyable part is learning and overcome the challenges through confidence and positiveness. I liked solving problem there. Environment is very good here.Overall it's great. My only qualm is that I've been talked to about full time for almost a year now and it's never happened. Other than that it has been great.Nice and friendly environment to work in, it was a job that you could work at your own pace. Coworkers are helpful when i need help. It was a job where you mainly work independently, which is great work experience. Hardest part of the job was transporting heavy or large quantity of orders around campus with only a hand truck. Due to construction work I had to take detours on unbalanced terrain making it hard to deliver. Enjoyable part of the was seeing people so happy to receive their orders.Well organized and Team player, 10+ years of custodial experience of hotel, hospital and school maintenance, and following safety regulations and working with teams to achieve institutional efficiency goals. Fast learner, work quick, self motivated.Good communication and some computer skills. I am a dedicated worker with a strong ethic. Excellent and co worker is very friendly. I'm doing my job well and followed the rules and my obligation.Worst work experience in 30 years ... horrible, nasty, mean, hostile boss.  Mgmt unclear on the concept of how to build and keep a functioning team.I really enjoyed my time at UW. I was able to flourish during my time there and really appreciate everyone I had to chance to work with.I am a formal facilities employee who's job it was to put band aids on buildings with failing systems. Management does not have any respect for trades people because most of them do not have a clue about what we do, that should make you understand the condition of the buildings. Last month there was an article in the paper that told about a Billion Dollars worth of deferred maintenance at the UW, I wouldn't be surprised if it is more. I was hired into a job that did not have any licensing requirements yet during my probationary period I was signed up for a certification class. The UW did pay for the class but is too cheap to pay for you to use any extra certificates or to pay for you to keep them so if you are one of the lucky ones who ""gets"" to have a certification the UW wants in the end you will actually be making less than your uncertified fellow employees.University of Washington is renowned for its advancements of research, technology, and innovation. However, what it lacks in is a solid cohort of a support network, particularly in STEM-related areas.University offers an excellent Work/Life balance which is difficult to find in today's work force.  I would recommend the University to anyone looking for a job.Enjoyed working with students and faculty alongwith the curriculum that was provided. Challenging and rewarding at the same time.Poor management that have never done lower level clinic support jobs telling you how to do your lower level clinic support job. If I hear the word data one more time my head might pop. They expect more and more from us as they eliminate positions or just don't fill vacancies. Seems the toxic employees outnumber dedicated ones. I've never seen/heard so much backstabbing and lies from grown people. If you don't participate you're marked as aloof. Pass on this place if you want to go to work and contribute to good patient care unless you'll have your own office and can lock the door or you just want good benes.Great opportunity to learn about different types of things related to my field. Gives key job skills as well as an insight into different areas of industry you could pursue.I'd like to work in a place where I could grow to my fullest potential. A fun, productive workplace. University of Washington really care about me s as well as your advancement in the future. The office has a very good balance of work with great opportunities to learn and to grow.Was great working in Seattle at a premier healthcare facility.  Got to work with several homeless shelters and meet many diverse people.  Management style was easy to work with, benefits needed to be increased along with compensationWork schedules could be better organized. Class assignments were given at the last minute, and changes to class locations was confusing. Management seemed threatened by the experienced consultant staff. This prevented the establishment of a collaborative working relationship."
94,Upstart,"This company is UpStart Systems, LLC.This is a company I founded to provide direct services to senior government and commercial clients.Quota is achievable Great work environment Great place to work if you are a fresh graduate looking for a job Great exposure if you are looking into the operations side of a startupGreat work environment. Upstart has the most talented and the most hardest working individuals. Upstart's goal is to get their borrowers financially fit, and the team members are dedicated to this very task."
659,US Pharmacopeia,"This company is wonderful with amazing health benefits and 401K! USP treats their employees like Gold!  I highly recommend working here!• Maintained and monitored a weekly ordering system of Reference Standards “bulk” material for the technicians to obtain predetermined desired weight.• Created and maintained spreadsheet of filled vials and prepared Reference Standards for storage.• Recorded pertinent data for Reference Standards information regarding the number of vials, weight and precautionary statements.• Assisted in preparing labels for vials, participate in the Quality Control testing to verify correct packaging and labeling and monitors inventory for Reference Standards packaging and suppliers.USP is very receptive to new changes and any suggestions for improvements. They also operate in multiple countries. Great business model and work culture.Lot of flexibility is given in task assignments and work delivery."
106,Us tech Solutions,"Great Staff. Enjoyable workplace. Aggressive Consulting Recruitment Co.Couldn't handle visa paper work for STEM OPT and made me loose my job and ruin my whole career.One of the reasons given was they don't want USCIS to come and check on them, but didn't give a proper explanation and just said that they won't sign the papers at all (All the other recruiting companies have signed the papers of their respective employees).Even after knowing that the whole situation was time sensitive, they didn't bother doing anything on time and after talking to lawyers about the things that they need to fill in the form, they ended up giving back a blank form, which they expected to submit it to USCIS.I have worked in this company for more then 2 Years .. it was a awesome place to work, the management is really very supportive . the work culture is very  good.*  Posting Lockboxes on a Daily Basic ;*  Posting Payments on Accounts and reviewing for errors and overpayment on a daily basic.I am not sure when job hunting became a telemarketing type thing but that is what this company does. They called me 10 times a day and sent me emails constantly for positions. 1st off, I do not work for someone I cannot understand. I also do not work for a company outside the US but uses a NJ phone number. That SCREAMS problems to me. I told them to take me off their list for over a year and they kept calling. I finally got nasty with them and told them I would report them to the gov't. They stated, and I quote, ""You put your phone number out on Monster so we can call all we want. If you do not want us to call, then do not put your phone number out on job sites. We are in India, you cannot do anything about it."" Talk about angry! I went off on her and explained if I got one more call or email from their unprofessional and nasty company I would hire an attorney and make sure I went after them for everything I could, as well as send information to the gov't to research them for terrorist activity since they felt they were above the law of other countries. So far, I have not received another call or email but it has only been a month. Even telling them I had a job did not stop they from calling by the way. I complained to Monster and Careerbuilder about this company and took my information off their website. Horrible in America you can be treated this way and can't trust to find a job on websites that state they are professional. Lesson learned.this is nothing but a body shop for Indians, They do not live up to their contracts.  Must be a cultural thing.  Sued the client and got paid right away .  Caveat Emptor!This temporary agency is actually located in India. They have a New Jersey phone number, but you are transferred to people in India. I went for 4 weeks without getting paid. It took the human resource department through my site, St. Joseph Hospital, to get me in touch with someone in the U.S. to get my pay.That being said, I got to work for St. Joseph for the first time. It was such an incredible journey. I loved the work load, the people, and the patients.The lady from Human Resources helped me get my permanent position in the float pool. It was the best experience!I enjoyed working for New york Life. The management was always clear and concise. I enjoyed the steady workflow as well. The work environment was not hostile.  each dept worked as a Team to get their job objectives completed .US Tech is the most worst company to work for. From the very start of my contract I had nothing but difficulty with US tech solutions. They are very unorganized and lack basic communication skills with their employees. You have to track them down to talk with them and they make you feel like you need to do there work for them. I would never recommend them to any oneWorked at another site for employment.My contact person was great."
737,Valeant Pharmaceuticals,"Great place to work if your getting your feet wet in this industry, good pay starting out nice breaks and good people who aim to help prolong the life of another no better feeling.Great place to work and good bonuses but job security can change fast.  Things were going great and then some changes with our specialty pharmacy and stock price was affected.  Then came the layoffs!!I really do love the team which I get to work with, however I know many others are NOT happy.  Issues with management and available resources - we all wear many hats!I find Valeant Pharma increases my productivity by allowing analyses much more quickly and thoroughly than I previously was able to do. I think you have put together a great tool. It is clear that you have a great understanding of how to conduct company/therapeutic area analyses and have included that knowledge in Valeant Pharma.Productive Work, Balance Work, good co-worker, You learn a little of everything, a job not so strong, in a typical work day, it works well.terrible company to work for. They don't care about employees at all. they only care about buying and destroying companies while making money. they are also raising the drug prices out of control and firing employees from left to right and they hire contractors to avoid paying benefits.Great work-place environment.  Never was micro-managed and your opinion really matters.  Co-workers were great to work with and were always there if you needed help.  Fast paced job and had to be on your toes all the time.despite the news valeant was an amazing place to work. i had the best supervisor and amazing team. it was fast paced and i learned alotNo leadership whatsoever. Decentralized and fragmented at best. Lots of insecurity with no cooperation. Employees simply what to survive.A very fast paced environment very performance driven. Acquisition was the company's method of growth. I learn't to make do with as little as possible. decisions are made on the fly.valeant provides a great work life balance and compensates its employees accordingly. Typical day is like any other pharmaceutical rep. management is not very goodTwice Valeant has purchased smaller companies I've worked for and TWICE they ran those products into the ground.  Valeant has horrible management from the top to the bottom.  And all they care about is their bottom line!! $$$$ Don't take a job with Valeant and if they buy your company-----RUN!!!My performance helped make my time at Valeant valuable and rewarding. They pay for performance!The Hardest part of the job was dealing with upper management decision making. My co-workers were excellent as we worked very well together. My most enjoyable part of this job was working the my doctors and being a value to each and every office i called on.A good company to work for and has good benefits. It would be nice for a company of it's size to have the compassion for their employee's as the mom and pop companies do. Sad to say they don't.Get paid well but the company is going through a lot of changes. Large territories. Good coworkers. Employee stock purchase program generous if you get in at the right timethe culture at Valeant is not what I like at a place of work. Valeant doesn't care about employees or patients. They raised the price of drugs to unbelievable prices that no one can afford.Poor CommunicationVery little IT support.Slow response time or no response to call list updates.Purely profit driven company.Prepare to be 3 people to one person for work load, under staffedDifferent main frame systems management needs a Do overWater cooler co-workers/heavy office gossipThe hardest part was not having enough hours in a day and no overtime offered to consultants.The most enjoyable part was building relationships with the customers.Some Managers and Supervisors are very unprofessional. Work ethics sucks and childlike behavior. Department is unorganized and level of knowledge is minimum.Excellent job, goals clearly defined, production schedules and workload clearly defined.The Quality system is dynamic as well as the work ethic.Very clean and orderly manufacturing and solution prep areas.Company makes fast decisions.  Horrible internal and external communication.  Pay much better than most pharma companies."
594,Varen Technologies,Varen Technologies is a great company. They really take care of their employees. You feel more like family than employee/employer. The management team strives for a perfect work/life balance for all employees. Varen gives each employee an opportunity to learn and advance their career. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with peers who have similar backgrounds and work ethics.Varen Technologies is one of many contractors providing workers to government clients.  Varen cares about its employees and provides good benefits.Great place to work. Management was excellent. Benefits and compensation are competitive.Contract funding was pulled after 6 months.Management was fair and worked hard to be successful.Program managers treated us well.
457,VDart Inc,"VDart is an awesome place to work. People are very helpful, prompt, supportive and professional. My recruitment and on boarding was quite quick and seamless.They gave me an excellent opportunity and I have been hired by the client fulltime. I have referred my friend and he has been working with VDart for the last few weeks, they gave me a referral fee as well without asking :)This was one of the worst experiences ever. They are in India and you really cannot understand them. I had to send and resend my paperwork I don't know how many times. It's like it got lost in some black hole and it's personal information (which is a little scary.) There insurance is ridiculously expensive.  There management team is very young but my issue with them is they had no idea what you were doing on a day-to-day basis.  They were not trained for what we did. They came from other projects and were constantly stressed out. There was no consistency.The Best Company I have ever worked. Good work ethics and friendly environment.Well Qualified and experienced Staff.It was an immense pleasure to work with Vdart Inc.Fun and exciting company. You get to be involved in a lot of things you wouldn't experience in a large company. Get more knowledge on different skills as this organization spends more money on making the employee be cross skilled as well. Has good number of clients and well established technical expertise to kick-start your career. Leads are very cooperative and lots of opportunity to make money.This is the worst agency i ever worked for. They don't appreciate the business and it's not that easy to get paid. I have to fight for my money every month.VDart is an awesome place to work - great people, great technology, great challenges, great package and perks. Professional growth is encouraged. There's not a sense of clock-watching or micromanagement in the organization. You are trusted to perform. The culture encourages you to work above and beyond, and can help folks progress their careers. Smart, hardworking people, good managers, training is available, benefits are very good, work is interesting, culture is pretty goodThe company has a good management team. In the initial stages I had a few problems but the company took a great effort and initiative in solving them. They respond to emails in time. Some  people in the company lack communication which the company needs to overcome. Overall I suggest its a great company to work with.This is an excellent place to work with and it is still going great. They have an excellent team in India that were extremely nice and helpful. There were endless opportunities and an excellent environment over there. Everything was great except for one small thing: communication skills. Now, obviously since they worked in India, the employees over there could not speak perfect English, but it was not only that, they would sometimes not email me on time and not explain why. It was the only bad thing that i experienced, but it was still a great experience and i would definitely work with them again.These people say they are in Georgia, but their workers are in India.  They barely understand English.  And here's the big thing.  They lose your paperwork on purpose so they won't have to pay you!  That is beyond stupid!  I've literally been waiting for my first paycheck for three months all because they keep claiming: ""We don't have your paperwork.""  Despite the fact that they give me the address that I put on the envelope, somehow it still gets lost in the mail.After promising a rate, they went back on it and offered a lower rate. Their attitude sounds unprofessional. They call at inappropriate times. They do not provide their real names and go around using fake names.Everything started off so good....nice people, great pay, even benefit coverage for consultant at a reasonable amount.The problem: no pay day!  I have adjusted my lifestyle to a once a month payday and now you tell me that youre sorry about this oversight?  This is not acceptable! I have been a contractor for over 20 years and this has ""never"" happened.  Even worse...there is no one locally to help resolve, only the guy overseas who never resolves anything...constant swirl and fake promises.  Management needs to really, really get this together as this type of behavior lacks integrity and breeds total mistrust.The recruiter scheduled a fake interview apparently as a joke.  I waited for a response as to why the client never showed up for the interview and never heard from vDart.  Very professional !!!VDart is a great company to work for. I never had to call the company for any issues while working as a contractor for 6 months. With their good efforts I was also able to get a full time opportunity in the company I worked as a contractor. Thank you VDart.Been with VDart for over 5 years now, incredible learning experience so far, fun place to work, creativity at its best, provides adequate growth opportunities. Strong mentoring program delivered by industry leaders in which employees get to participate. Uses latest tools for employee engagement.I have worked with this company as a contractor almost for 3 Years till now. Very good management and the employers pay in time. They answered all my calls with patience and helped me during my immigration . I am very glad to work with them.I have been calling these folks for days after being told I was supposed to begin my assignment on July 1, 2014.  I put in a notice for this job.  I cannot get anyone to return my call...not even the second party client (HCL America).  I am supposed to start working through HCL America and TIAA-CREF since the three interviews I had produced a job offer but no one will return my calls.  Do I start tomorrow and if so...where?  Hey, this is affecting my livelihood.  This isn't India..this is the US and we have laws against this type of action, don't we?Got to learn a new tool and new technology.Working environment was friendly.This is the worse contracting agency I've worked for.  After contracting for the last 9 yrs, I have to say this particular contract is a mistake. They say they have an office in Atlanta, but they never want to talk on the phone.  They always ask for an email but do not respond to the email.  You end up calling them back.  45 days to get your paycheck?  That's not an industry standard.  Want it earlier?  Sure.  They'll work with you for a price.  1.5% of your pay to get it 30 days after invoice (which is actually the standard), and 3% if you want it two (2) weeks after invoicing.  But they will not guarantee you'll get it on time, even though you are paying them to get it to you on time.They will push you to do corp to corp.  No support structure.  Their only interest in you is that they get a paycheck from you.  They have no idea what's taking place on-sight.  When you explain it to them, they ask for an email but never respond.  I've turned in my notice and I'm moving on.  Take my advice, don't make the mistake like I did and take a job with this company.Prior to the contracting job, VDart handled the paperwork and was able to clearly and professionally answer all my questions.  During the contracting job, VDart answered completely any questions or concerns.  The first payment was missing, but it was quickly resolved.  Future payments onwards were on time with advance email communication that payment was issued.  Overall a positive experience.  Would work with VDart again in the future.Great pay..provide you the required documentation on time...good marketing  team...i dint had a any issue with themFor the year and a half I worked through VDart I have to say that it was a positive experience. Everytime I had an issue with the customer, my VDart rep worked hard and fast to resolve the issue. Most of the time this involved going to bat for me to get me more money. By the time I left my ending rate was 20% higher than my starting. I've never had a company get me raises without even asking for it."
772,Veolia,"good company to work for, takes care of employees well. work is fun but also easy-going. get to meet some cool people. always learning new things.On a typical day-to-day basis, I was faced with being able to tolerate all types of attitudes and personalities because of the various types of disabilities that each individual person may have possessed.  This division of the Transportation industry afforded more of an opportunity to understand what is truly meant by door-to-door service as opposed to a particular set route that the professional bus operators have and this position gave an opportunity to learn more about how to get around Baltimore.Regular day at work, pre-trip my bus making sure it's safe for on the road driving and for my passengers SAFETY FIRST!!!!!!!!!. As the day goes on it is a great day when I have safely drove passengers across the city of Greensboro.Picking up garbage on route and transporting materials to disposal site. Also i assist the helper with lifting materials up to 75 lbs.This is a safety driven work place.  Some days were very busy and long hours and other days were not as busy and 8 hour days.  This was decided depending on the customers request.training intense but overall with good work ethic and hard work, good place to work.    Hired for day shift.  A shift change occurred.  I suppose when hiring individuals, these could be addressed as a possibility of occurring during employment.The communication between upper management and the first line employees is very poor. More proper training is needed, especially when it is in reference to dealing with irate customers. Employees shouldn't be rushed out of training until all necessary information has been presented.The job depends greatly on the yard a driver is based out of. No one yard is ever the same.  Some yards in the state of Wisconsin do more industrial cleaning and hazmat jobs. The yard I am based out of, is mainly hauling waste and by products for our customers. It can be and is often hectic and poorly planned. The strong lack of communication from dispatchers, and the customers is almost non-existent. Its a guess and go situation half of the time. It is based off of a mon-fri schedule, but some contracts run 7 days a week irregardless. That means youre getting at least a 34 hour reset over the weekend, and thats it.The hours add up fast, and there is serious money to be made, but there's little to no free time to enjoy the extra money. 70 hour weeks are common here. It may be a local job, but you have no more free time than you would otr. The equipment is rough. All well used equipment. Other yards definitely see better equipment then others. Everything comes in used, and is well abused with constant starting and stopping, idling, etc. Yet, it is barely maintained or ran until repaired. The organization is last second in maintenance as well. Never had I drove for someone, who told someone to run oos equipment, but fix minor things and get after them about it like its our fault.The pay program is also out of date. Once a 90 day probation period is up, you get paid by the load. If theres downtime, or non billable work, you still get hourly, but being paid by the load encourages speeding, shortcuts, and lack of progessive driving.They tell the less than or the bare minimum  more... on what your job is, and half of the time, thats not even what happens. When you get hired, they tell you one thing, and it changes ince you actually start working. They need to make some serious changes here.  lessOk company to work for management, is ok coworkers are awesome,  work is fun there's nothing more to say about the companyVeolia was a good company to work for when they were Yellow Van service . But since they become more of a corporate environment . They don't care about the older drivers whom have been there for 13 plus years. All they care about is montoring the dash cam and looking for reasons to fire drivers.I enjoy working there, a lot of hands on offered and showed how to do something, great place to move up, management is respectful and easy to get along with.Highly reactive to meet customer needs. Systems are generally followed, but their is room for improvement. Decisions are made at the highest level of the organization. There is no delegation.There was no career path in terms of advancement. A typical workday is a 12 hour shift inside petrochemical refineries, chemical refineries, power plants, and industrial plants. I learned a lot about safety, health and environmental, project management including planning and scheduling. Management was inconsistent, and my co-workers were manageable. The hardest part of the job is working in the elements for longer periods of time. The most enjoyable part of the job is completing scheduled projects ahead of schedule.I began with Crown Solutions and a short time after we were acquired by Veolia N.A.. The work was exciting onsite but the headaches of running large projects, heavy travel and senior management that could get their act together by the time I left pushed me to go out on my own.The Rialto Water Project, has some of the best people brought on to make this project a positive project. The hardest part of the project is to get all parties involved on the same pageMy impression of Veolia is that they couldn't care less about individual employees.  They just need enough bodies to complete projects and keep making a profit.  Lately the equipment has not been maintained very well which makes each job harder than it needs to be,Great company to work for with great benefits. Learned a lot about power plants, refineries and various other industries. Working for this company also entailed extensive travel to various locations but this provided a way to network with other employees and customers.It's a good company,for some. For other's your success in the company is solely based on who you know and not your work performance.Upper management is pretty out of touch with workings of field guys. You will work a ton of variable hours throughout the week so any balance between work and home is difficult to maintain.Informative and helpful superiors, good work environment. Numerous opportunities to grow. Conveniently located therefor easy to travel to work. While handling numerous flammable, reactive and oxidizers as well as being a labor intensive job, I always felt safe. Participated in weekly safety calls to ensure safety in the workplace.unload truck and operator a forklift and making sure that the material go where need to and make sure everyone had their so they do their job"
169,Veracyte,"Management has no idea whats going on. Everyone is very clicky. If you know nothing about the industry and will settle for less then u are worth. Work here. Most new hires have never worked in the industry and have added no value to the companyThe typical work day is very repetitive, but as mentioned its for a good purpose. If you are applying at the Laboratory be careful because there is a lot of micromanagement and favoritism. Best of luck."
227,Vericel,"reviewing batch records daily, in charge of release of final product, metrology, training, making schedules, in charge of training, making labelsGreat experience and accomplishment.

Very nice peoples working in there.-Attend scheduled surgical cases for product. -Ensure hospitals have necessary supplies for all cases. -Educate surgical staff, office staff, materials management, and assist with insurance policy details and authorizations. -I enjoy consulting surgeons on appropriate patient types and discussing the best plan of action for our patient.

269,Verisk Analytics,"I am an employee of this company and have been for a very long time.  Over the last five years the place has been through a tremendous shake up and as a result are basically going nowhere.   You have the old teams holding the place together and the new teams are essentially run by whoever can use the right buzz words. Lots of empty suits there.Good place to work. Management effort to anticipate needs requires Sr. Mgmt support.   People work hard and are professional although understaffed.Work life at Verisk Analytics is interesting , it has a very good work culture and environment. I have learned many things after joining Verisk Analytics technically,economically and operationally. Hardest part is to get to the place in traffic and i enjoy everyday in the work.Great place to work with exceptional management.  Flexible schedule since you make your own appointments.  Supportive company culture.Since beginning, I was so excited to work in such a good company with a lot of growth opportunity. The first months of being in Verisk spent participating in series of trainings as expected. I was so fresh and inspired to apply my knowledge and learn new things in this new work environment. However, as we moved forward and time past, I started getting less and less passionate and it became more like a dreaming instead of planning. My manager was too busy to have a good conversation and communication.A lot of overlapping and super chaotic. It is not a streamlined organization and far having processes and functionality in place. A lot of cutting corners and the company will not spend to have proper support of teams.it was amazing place to work and it has good work culture and fun loving place.there is alot to learn and my co workers were so supportive.old mentality, cant get buy in to get anything done, yet they expect changes. not good management culture, with below average management skillsLoved working there and hope to do so in the future. The people were fantastic and extremely helpful in laying some ground work for my careerProductive and pleasant company to work for. Each employee brings to the table, something different to offer the company. Management is very supportive and helpful in all aspects. This is a big and growing company, but there's lots of room to thrive as an individual.The management is very nice and they will work with you if any family issues arise. Compensation is good; some positions, too good. There is a large learning curve due to the nature of the business.You are based out of your home and receive orders of companies that have been selected for inspection. The job requires knowledge of the insurance industry which is very extensive. All the regulations, compliance codes, and safety restrictions need to be known. If you miss something in your inspections there could be serious consequences such as monetary losses for the insurance companies or even worse injury or death of people. Management says that they are always available for questions as are other employees, and for the most part this is true. However, many times no one is available to help you and it is up to you to figure it out. This can lead to wasted time to make sure you are following ISO/Verisk rules and the customers rules as well. A typical day with this job depends on if you are in the field performing inspections or at home writing up reports. The field days are the best by far because you see many things that most people will not get to see and meet lots of people. You learn a lot about different industries and how business flows with these companies. The hardest part of the job is getting appointments for inspections. Management says to get all of your inspections into 1 to 2 days, but this difficult to do as these companies are available at the time you give. When you call most people don't want to talk to you because they think you are selling them insurance.If you are a strong self starter, are knowledgeable about the insurance industry, and can handle a very fast paced high stress job you would be fine in this position. There is VERY little chance  more... for promotions and moving up. The benefits are very good and you get a nice 401k and stock options.  lessA good company to work for, just the Compensation could be a lot better. Friendly staff, good training and the location is pretty good.Some reorg recently due to company structure and acquisitions, but company is heading in the right direction. Constant innovation and opportunities to move within the company. Salary could be better.Very high turnover because they hardly promote from within. Tendency for company to hire higher-level analysts rather than promote from within.Very relaxed environment with little to no stress but you get what you don't get paid for.Verisk Analytics was a good place for me to obtain working experience and an understanding of working in the corporate culture.Good employment opportunity.  Worked at ISO/Verisk for 17 years.  Employees are helpful.  Politics are minimal.  A vast selection of technologies to learn/master.  Somewhat flexible hours.Verisk Analytics was an amazing place to intern while I was in college. They taught me valuable skills and lessons that I use everyday in the workplace. The management was extremely welcoming and knowledgable.Verisk has a very good vision within IT and is willing to do what it takes to get to that state.They are willing to give you any job related training you seek.Great company and nice place to work.  The people that you work with really make this place enjoyable.Typical day at work attend meetings,  Delegate tasks to team and assist with outages. Plan for future growth and direction of Datacenter  Operations.  Encourage the team to do better and take on more responsibility."
20,Verizon,"Constant tracking of percent to goals to ensure you hit your quotas. Fluctuating targets and metrics skew commission month to month. Fantastic benefits.Everyday at Verizon the job is a puzzle to figure out how best to serve the customer. Employees who are wholly committed to customer service in every aspect of their work life will persevere and do well. Verizon expects employees to be knowledgeable of and work towards marketing all of its products, all of the time. Sales are a huge part of the Verizon effort and all employees are expected to participate.I was so happy and pleased to work for such a prominent company as Verizon Wireless. The staff and co-workers were the best people I had ever met. I didn't mind going to work everyday because we had a pleasant, cohesive work environment. Everyone helped one another, which is the way it should be anyway. Their benefits were so right on time for employees-health benefits, tuition and promotions just to name a few good attributes. You just couldn't ask for a better work place.Verizon business in Highlands Ranch Colorado is not a fun place to work.  like going to work in a prison, the management all had delusions of granduer and were not very helpful.  They don't tell you this but, this segment used to be the Failed company MCI, your sitting around all day on the phone trying to sell IT.  The job would not be bad but management only cares for themselves and had inner circles that they would funnel leads to, their old colleagues from other firms.  It was actually comical how they acted and the culture was very low class and NOT conducive to career development and growthA typical day at work is fast paced , I've learned patience , and how to better people skills. My co workers  are awesome , and we work as a team and help each other  out . Not all management were always on the same page and it became some what unorganized at times . The hardest part was learning how to deal with escalated  customers . The most enjoyable art  were the people here and  incentives  to show appreciation for the employees.While working at Verizon, I used and learned multiple different sales techniques and each day was different. It was a very challenging work environment, due to the wide range of customer and accounts that I touched each day. As a solutions specialist, I was to analyze each account for possible savings and up-sells. Verizon prides themselves on customer satisfaction and we were to make each customer feel comfortable and valued, while making sure to meet all their needs. I enjoyed helping customers and pushing myself to meet the monthly requirements.To be plain and to the point . The turnover rate at this location is extremely Hugh. 1st clue- when you're outfought in for a panel interview , you are interviewed by the director of this call center. , 2nd clue Warch the facial clues and expression of the people that work on the call center floor. ( Morale is awful) The Director is smug and insulting (deliberate ). Especially when you have more call center experience then he. Not worth the money offered.Hourly and commission. Great benefits. Hours are your typical retail hours. Very numbers driven. Your managers make or break your job experience. Sales reps have too many responsibilities. You are also tech troubleshooting, customer service, we even have to handle inventory now. It can be very overwhelming and quota can be difficult to achieve with more unrelated responsibilities are stacking on.I answered customer calls regarding billing& account information, as well as cell plans and cell phone offerings.I learned Verizons' proprietary computer program, and also how to deal respectfully with customers.My co-workers were always willing to lend a hand or make suggestions about how the call could have gone better.The hardest part of my job was explaining why some customers cell reception was poor in mountainous areas.The best part of the job was talking to people from all over the states.Basically I talk to people all day about technology. As with any retail job you see all walks of life, some more difficult than others and some have no idea how to work their phone at all. Coworkers are great and fun to talk to between customers, management is very lax as long as sales goals are being hit. Pay is great for retail and it's allowed me to better my financial situation immensely.Challenging workplace with a steep learning curve, but a very exhilarating job.  Management was outstanding and co-workers on my team were second to none- with highest integrity.  Hardest part of the job was leaving it at work and the most enjoyable part of the job was enjoying my co-workers and my customers.  The relationships built with the customers over the years and helping them was the thrill I looked forward to each year.My current position is being moved to another location but the option to transfer is there with 10K in compensation to make the transition. You won't find compensation like this available at any other call center position. Job security is great and the management will work with you. unlike other call center jobs their centers are not revolving doors.This company treated us very well, including generous compensation and amazing benefits.  This is a company where the ""open-door"" policy is actually carried out and almost any person you meet is actually going to live out the company's credo.  Every supervisor/manager I ever talked to listen to me, treated me with respect and dignity, and was truly invested in my success and happiness as a person.  I am only leaving because my center is closing, but even with that they have given us 5 month notice, help with our resumes, job placement programs, and a guaranteed job with the company if we are willing to locate and a generous severance package.Lots of training and ongoing help through supervisor meetings, sales incentives, bonuses, opportunities for advancement. Very professional and supportive environment. Very clean. I enjoyed being able to help customers through professional and courteous interaction and listening skills. My work at Verizon was very enjoyable. Fun meetings. Great team to work with. Great benefits and cell phone discounts for employees.Typical day at work was taking calls most of the day. I learned that it can be very stressful in a call center. I also learned how to talk to people and react to certain situations. Learned deescalation techniques. Management wanted you to be successful. Co-workers were interesting to say the least. The hardest part of the job was dealing with intolerant customers with no common sense and making them happy. The most enjoyable part was the pay checks.I really enjoy it this particular company unfortunately at the time I have been there over a year and was still a contract worker and needed stability as an individual and that's the only reason why I chose to leave that company to be hired in as a full employee elsewhere.I remained neutral with all the constant daily changes and the nit picking from upper management. At first things would really get to me and I would take everything literally and personally and then I just became numb to it all.  Reported to work like a robot, did my job as best I could, Collected a paycheck at the end of the pay period, paid bills and the cycle repeated for a year.I really enjoyed the concept of this job, taking phone calls and having conversations with people to resolve their issues but they place their entire value of their employees on randomly generated surveys that for some reason seem to favor the few bad calls you'll get per day. Once you get a few negative surveys and your approval rating drops below 90% the management expects you to recover quickly or you may as well have a countdown on your head till terminationWhile working at Verizon Wireless, I was continually impressed with the continual training and options for career growth. I had no problem moving in whichever direction I wanted my career to go, especially due to the willingness of managers to assist and guide. It was also easy to work for an industry leading company in the wireless telecommunications field as the products and services are best in class.The actual job was very interesting and I was able to learn a lot from by experience.  My supervisor was very encouraged with my professionalism and ability to grasp the techniques needed to perform my job well.Great paying job if you work hard. The environment was very unprofessional and you had to rely on your own resources to be good at your job. management wasn't always there for you, they would encourage manipulation as a means to sale."
443,Verizon Wireless,"Constant tracking of percent to goals to ensure you hit your quotas. Fluctuating targets and metrics skew commission month to month. Fantastic benefits.Verizon is an employer of high standards. Employees must be committed to attaining and maintaining these standards, and are well compensated for it.There was amazing people and management that made working at Verizon a fun and enjoyable place to be.  The job was fast paced, and excellence driven but was very rewarding.They brainwash you that they are not a bureaucracy, but that's exactly who they are!  If you dont become buddy buddy with your managers, you get no where!  Not a good company to work for,Work life balance is a weakness with the company. Not much room for growth. A lot of managers are inadequate when it comes to helping the reps become better.talking to customer and selling products to them. I learned how to talk to a customer the right way.

Not worth the money offered.Up to the business decision to sell Verizon Business  West I thought Verizon was the best company to possibly work  for. I will continue to look for opportunities to once again be employed by Verizon. If you ever get a chance to work for Verizon DO NOT HESITATE.Great benefits competitive pay . Great work environment!. Room for advancement.Constant change great employee discountsThis job can be very difficult to do if you want to have a life outside of it. There will be alot of times where you will have to stay past the time you have to leave no matter what.I worked with some of the best people who shared my work ethics. We were family oriented, looking out for one another. Help was always just a matter of asking. It was pure enjoyment coming to work everyday.The company is decent overall but does not protect their employees rights as well as I would like in a place of business. Overall they provided great products.The problem is no matter what this will always be a sales job. The cellphone industry is hurting badly while at the same time your goals increase. Your schedule will always fluctuate. Unless you are the top dog than your job is never safe. If you are a manager than you will really be putting in all the work.independent environment that allows employees to be self sufficient. however, management is very knowledgeable and always willing to help. The benefit are also great especially for new parents.Environment in the stores can be very fun and productive.  However, there are strict goals set which can lead to a stressful environment.  When working in retail it is very hard to have a solid work life balance.The Hardest Part was working just for comission.Manager is the most amazing person in the world. A typical day our office would be making about 30 to 40 sales.Responsibilities included producing revenue through sales and service, handling outstanding customer service, opening/closing the store, inventory checks, stocking, and understanding the products. Consistently generated the most revenue per employee for the store each month while attending evening college classes.While being an Uber Partner and driving commuters around the DC Metropolitan Area, this job has given me the opportunity to meet people of all ethnicity and disabilities. One challenges on the job shows how diverse the world is. I must adapt and be able to communicate with a variety of people when it comes to getting them to there destination.  Another example would be me working as a Lead Sales Associate for Finish Line. At times on the job I would have to remain patient while attending costumers needs. Each Customer should be treated with respect until they are satisfied. I consume products of all sorts, so as a consumer I try to use that advantage to sell merchandise and treat the consumer as a equal individual.The most enjoyable part of both jobs was gaining experience and confidence in retail, management, and communication over the years while I use for future endeavorsYou are micromanaged from day one. The culture is not bad , if someone looking over your shoulder at all time do not bother you. I enjoyed working there.Verizon offers competitive pay and benefits, and provides an ever changing work environment with lots of opportunity for advancement. The quotas can be challenging, and the expectations unrealistic, but lower management was usually someone who recently was in the same position, so they were always willing to help and team sell. The hours are normal retail hours, which mean you are drained dry during holiday season, or at any special release (iPhone release for example). Customers are terrible and demanding, and there isn't much in place where employees can defend themselves from harassment or unfair treatment by customers.Overall, the job is pretty good and the pay is higher than similar positions, but if you don't like working weekends, holidays and never having a set schedule, look somewhere else."
799,Vertex Pharmaceuticals,"The company has the best benefits for employees. However, there's a lot of room for improvement in management. Without good management, there isn't growth for employees.This is a great company with smart, hard-working people. The company has never evolved a development plan or path for motivated employees, advancement is often about self-promotion.Great company culture, great people, everyday is a new day very dynamic and awesome. I like the working environment and people who are always willing you help out whenever.Very innovative and encouraging group to work with.Learned alot in terms of bringing productivity.Mentored junior level canditates on ETL  technical skills.It all depends on what department or team you are with, but I had wonderful time working there.  Interned at marketing department for a few month and everyone was nice and they are all more than willing to help you out.  Vertex really does value your work/life balance and I really felt like I was treated as a valuable asset to the company.Vertex pharmaceuticals has a very welcoming and warm environment. A typical day for me involves many interactions with clients and customers, dealing with on-your-toes situations, working on promotions for our service, organizing BEOs, managing my catering team and making sure our operation runs smoothly and effectively. I have learned many management and communications skills, organizational tactics, and overall business processes and etiquette. My managers are great teachers who set examples for the rest of our staff to follow. A lot of what I have learned is because of their endless efforts to teach me something new every day. Other than my managers, the rest of my co-workers help to create a fun yet productive environment. Usually, the hardest part of my day isn't a single task, but working at a minimum, 11 hour days. This can be tiresome, at times, although necessary. On the contrary, the best part of my job is getting to build relations with our clients on a daily basis.Great BenefitsInnovative companySmart peopleNice placeI have learned a lot working at this place. Good coworkersGood peopleexcellent company to work for, great atmosphere, locality is key.  there is a lot of immature people and who have to be in a group to be happy..I was on a temp to hire assignment there that did not work out.  Vertex treated their temps just as they treated their full time employees, which was really great.  A lot of great perks were offered (fitness center being one of them) that I took advantage of even though I was a temp worker.  I was very interested in becomming a full time employee.Vertex had two drugs approved during my 7 years there and the stock went from $22 when I started to $143 at one point in 2015. Vertex has fantastic benefits and I met and worked with a lot of wonderful people.Working at Vertex has been a great experience! The people are all there for the same reason, to help patients with cystic fibrosis and they do every day! I've learned so much, not only from my managers but from my co-workers. Everyone is helpful should you ask questions about what they do or how your position fits into the bigger scheme of the company.Worked as a contract staff and it was difficult to mingle with the full time staff. Offices moved to Boston from Cambridge making the commute harder.Vertex is a great company to work for. A fast pace environment The atmospher is greatThis was a great place to work. Unfortunately I was finished with my contract here.I would not recommend working for Vertex, have been with the organization for over two years and just gets worse, not better- Management is all talk. Do NOT recommend working within the procurement and sourcing group.very busy in and out procedure rooms supporting researchers. I have learned that communication, pay close attention to instructions giving is very important. I worked with very open minded individuals where we shared and trained each other on different procedures and techniques to continue with good training. the hardest part is when researchers and scientist schedules last minute things. I get to have close communications with my co-workers, work closely and learn from each other.Atmosphere was very good, co workers very well liked as well as Management.  Amex is a very good company long term to work for.Company makes business decisions suddenly, without regard for long-term outlook or their reputation. They pay well but don't promote appropriately.  People are given new titles that don't accurately reflect their job duties, essentially demoting them with no consideration how this will affect their resumes. They pay lip service to ""job/life balance"" but treat people as disposable. Not a happy place to work.colleagues appreciated hard-working contributers. Vertex rewarded team for efforts, while keeping patients needs top of mind.  was well respected by healthcare providers, worked with highly competent colleaguesVertex Pharmaceuticals is a very unstable company, where there is some sort of reorganization several times a year. You may not be performing the work that you were hired to do. They boast about a flexible work schedule; however, they do not practice this. Everything is in favor of upper management (training, time off, work from home, etc.). Overall Vertex does not practice what they preach.job is great but constant layoffs, firings and fear of job security."
222,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc","Great place to work, fast paced, and quick learning . productive environmentI enjoy my work with Vertex and have been the Treatment Educator for the NJ region for over 2 years now and love it!  The company keeps a very high standard for all employees and maintain the focus on the patients.  The science is flawless and the people are genuine. I am having a wonderful experience.I was provided the opportunity to build a global risk management and executive protection organization from the ground up. I worked with many exceptional people who provided support and allowed the organization to grow.Come into work, fire up the computer, check email and then organize your work for the day starting with what has the highest priority or the quickest deadline.Management and co-workers are very enjoyable to work for and to work with. ""We Wins"" is a true statement."
385,VHA Inc,"The company has a relaxed atmosphere and culture. The company ensured that as an employee the workplace was enjoyable. The managers were willing to help you when necessary and so did my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was balancing all that needed to be done in the workday. The most enjoyable part of the job was the work environment and when I needed help everyone was willing to help.Wonderful Company! Unfortunately I was layed off.  They cared about their employees and paid for training.   The benefits were good.  The people I worked with were fun and motivated.My typical work day consist of helping Veterans or their families with orders or tracking of medication or helping them make appointments , what I've learned from my job here is you get out  what you put in , the way you treat others is how you would like to be treated kindness goes a long way, my co workers are supportive, the hardest part of my job is when I  get a call that someone has just passed away, the enjoyable part is listening to the older Vets storiesThe Marine Corp Shaped my future and was able to change my life for the better. Because of the Marine Corp I have been afforded opportunities I never thought I Would have.High termination rate (Sales especially), If they ""think"" you were gossiping- you are terminated, ethnocentrism, CULTURE = management mind games, paranoia, very unhealthy environment. Psychological hazing in their Boot Camp. Be aware.A typical is visiting store owners,manager and or sales reps.  With the owners we will discuss the state of their business IE: month over month numbers 2nd month replenishment. How they can grow their business or work together to solve any issues they may have.With the Manager we talk about employees, how to help them increase sales how to train and even set up training events for the store. With the sales team we role paly sales scenarios we talk about how to engage with the customers and work on increasing their individual sales.My management team is great they are supportive and are always available when needed.I've learned is how to listen and answer questions and how to get my stores to see outcomes with out giving them the solutions.The hardest part of the job is leaving the company.  the most enjoyable part if the job is working with the stores and knowing that if I have a question or an issue that I have an outstanding team beside me.place that you look forward to going to work,Culture is well balanced of professional and hardworking fun environment.This company was extremely beneficial to me, and I hope I was for them. Truly an honor, and I recommend it to others looking to truly make an impact on others.Some companies are not interested in you and some are.  VHA is one of those that are, they want you to be the best at what you do and want to be sure you are their for your dealers.  I agree with this except for if one does not understand the process 100% by a certain time he or she is not a right fit.  I do not agree with that part, they may BE a right fit, it just they may need a bit more time to get to that point.  VHA a has a great atmosphere about it and my management team was outstanding. I have learned much since being with VHA.I was on the road visiting retail wireless stores and meeting with dealers. There was not much of a work life balance as I was constantly on the roadA good place to grow in experience. There was a lot benefits and opportunities to move up. They could work on HR though.Excellent company to work with, great to their employees.  I felt that working with them over this past time has been a great learning experience.A typical day at work is swamped from the beginning of the day until the end. Management has preference for certain employees, not treated equally. Majority of coworkers are fun, outgoing, helpful and supportive.The hardest part of the job was the micromanagement; constantly under a microscope and being told what to do even during our lunch and breaks. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the employees, the training provided by the company and camaraderie."
465,Viacom,"Viacom has the greatest employees.  I was blessed with the greatest co-workers.  We all worked together, helped each other, and always taught each other new technologies each week.  We supported each other goals and accomplishments..  The people make it a great place to work.During my time a Viacom there were pros and cons .My experience at Viacom with my co-workers was very positive. The work environment was great, the projects I worked on were very exciting and challenging. My team pushed me to really grow professionally. Management typically has a difficult time making decisions on just about everything. Expect little value on work/life balance.If management put more into their employees they would have better retention. A single ticket here or there does not make up for time lost while in the office.The benefits were good but the salaries are usually lower.  Great place to start your career in media but you must be willing to work very long hours and be flexible with constantly changing priorities.  I loved working at BET, many cool people and a fun working environment.  The people were extremely nice and I enjoyed going to work.  Always areas for growth and the managers were always helpful.  Very talent group of people, dedicated to creative work.  I learned so much and would do it again in a heartbeat! I think one of the best companies to work for to learn and grow.Viacom is a dynamic company with so many brands that appeal to different generations of people. Get work life balance, relaxed work culture and open door policy. The people here are great! However, they do not pay their entry level employees well at all. Competitors are openly paying employees of the same role at least $10-15k more and sometimes even more. It can be disheartening that a company this large and successful focuses so much on compensating the big whigs, but then forget about the work horses that are keeping the company a float.The culture of the company is great but the senior C-level management is extremely oblivious to the issues the employees have.  Also, if you prove yourself and get promoted internally, you get screwed over with compensation.  They pay more if you leave the company and come back instead of rewarding you for being a loyal employee.Large company with a lot of room for advancement, I personally did not work with the company culture. I enjoyed my coworkers, but had a frustrating time working as a permalance employee.It used to be a great place to work but the creative culture has changed and lost some of its appeal lately. The benefits are still great but the salaries are usually lower.Working at Viacom used to be super fun but there has been so much restructuring over the last 2 years and there is a huge lack of communication and proper management.Great place to start your career in media.  Must be willing to work very long hours and be flexible with constantly changing priorities.This is a great company to work for however the pay is always less that what it should be for the position. It is very hard for employees to move up as the managing positions are usually hired from outside of the company.Check emails, check the queue, data entry, amend records, setup orders for pickups.I have learned how to write emails and improve customer service management is a little flaky a lot of nepotism and bad ethics as far as moving up within the department/company. My co-workers are friendly and nice and fun to talk and work with. There is really nothing difficult or challenging about this job anyone can do this job. The enjoyable part about this job is when my shift ends.I truly enjoyed working at Viacom...  Great culture that allows their employees to be innovative and successful.  Viacom offers great work and personal environment.The glitz and glamour of Viacom's shows and markets are fun and energizing, and there can be some fun perquisites, but at senior management levels it is serious business.Difficult to navigate internal politics if direct upper management not at same location. Frequent recent layoffs lead to no sense of job security.Working at Viacom was a fun experience.  I interned for my whole senior year a Comedy Central and Logo.  There were no entry level opportunities when I graduated college.  I worked with some great supervisors that cared about teaching the ins and outs of the business.Organization is filled with lots of great talented people, but overall most brands could stand to overhaul and improve their senior management. See the recent article about the culture shift at Google....I love working here - such cool work environment. People are extremely nice and I crave to come to work everyday. Sky is the limit to growth and your managers are always helpful to help you grow. I think one of the best companies to work for to learn and growMy time at Viacom was great. I would recommend it if you're looking to beef up your resume. The staff was great as well as the culture of the company.You can still get a free cup of coffee if you're ok with not having Starbucks.  Most people work here for years.  Some people grow while some stay in the same roles for years.  This place is what you make it but it's not as fun as it used to be I hear.the most enjoyable part of this job is being creative. i love the dynamic of my core team. however, we're poorly managed and poorly compensated for what we do. no space to grow.Great dedication to creative work. Great environment. Loved my time working with MTV2 Team! I learned so much as an intern here and would do it again in a heartbeat! I hope I get to freelance here sometime soon."
190,ViaSat,"People were friendly, the view was nice, nothing extremely exciting. Felt like a typical medium-large company. A really good place for long term, steady employment.A typical day is jumping into phone queues that are each stacked 10 calls deep waiting, because of some change that R&D made overnight without telling anybody about it.  I learned that if you try to care about every angry person calling in, you will be destroyed from the inside out by stress.  The management needs to be completely replaced.  They make up rules about performance without sharing them with the employees, ignoring written policy, and don't tell you that you have been breaking said rule until you have broken it enough times for them to have cause to fire you.  It was probably because I was making a lot more than the new people they had started hiring, and they are trying to weed out the older generation of employees so they don't have to pay as much.  Coworkers are great for the most part.  The hardest part of the job was the stress and anxiety that was brought on by just walking into the building.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the friends that I made over the 2 years I worked here.22 mile per day bike ride every day, every year.Able to work at my own, accelerated pace without restriction.Very stable product line.There's a great lack of coordination of projects, technology and strategies between divisions.  Each does its own & is very close hold about sharing.Good company. Had been contracting with ViaSat Inc in Carlsbad from Nov 2013 to till date.Would refer others to work here.Will be the leader for inflight wi-fi in the next 5 years. Culture is great in Carlsbad but needs work in the Denver office. Good people work there and they have great benefits.Very laid back but productive companyThe benefits are outstandingA lot of opportunities for employmentThe chance to work on groundbreaking technologies.Terrific company. Appreciate the ability I was given to learn and advance. I would recommend ViaSat to anyone in the industry.This was not for Viasat as a whole, this was for a Sub-Contractor company out of Alabama. They where extremely un-professional, paid in a different way every time and we had to request a list of what we had been paid for. The product I can still stand behind, it is a very good service that is fast and reliable as long as it's installed correctly. The company as a whole, I never had any issues with. Just this one sub-contractor (Bama PC Comm in association with Perfect 10) was very hard to deal with, and I suspect they are running a scheme against their installers.I was only an intern for a summer and it was my first job. But everyone was very polite, friendly, and understanding. I can't comment much more on the company culture other than perhaps it was a bit...boring? The salary and benefits were excellent though.Viasat had a great work culture, room for advancement in department as well as lateral advancement possibilities.  Great bennefits and diverse groups to work with.Great product lines.The people at ViaSat were extremely friendly and worked very hard at their jobs.  Great benefits and compensation.  Good work environment.I feel happy to work here.Good support from collegues.I feel good working with this company.I enjoy working life with this company.Its a nice time to work here.ViaSat is an excellent place to work for self-starters and people who can think creatively. Anything is possible at ViaSat, which can be difficult for people who definite rules.Layoff common without reason. Upper Manager does not know what is doing.  Layoff common. Do not give good directions. They have too many meetings.I tell you, hopeless grief is passionless;That only men incredulous of despair,Half-taught in anguish, through the midnight airBeat upward to God’s throne in loud accessOf shrieking and reproach. Full desertness,In souls as countries, lieth silent-bareUnder the blanching, vertical eye-glareOf the absolute heavens. Deep-hearted man, expressGrief for thy dead in silence like to death —Most like a monumental statue setIn everlasting watch and moveless woeTill itself crumble to the dust beneath.Touch it; the marble eyelids are not wet:If it could weep, it could arise and go.Able to set work hours as long as you worked 8 hours.  You had to be self-sufficient, which I really enjoyed.  I learned to build multiple cable assemblies.  I learned the Viasat ways and their procedures.  The management had an open door policy.  My co-workers were great to work with.  They were willing to help whenever needed.  Always open to suggestions,  worked great as a team.  The hardest part of my job was managing my time with all the work I had.  The most enjoyable part of the job at Viasat  was the work and the people that I was associated with.Awesome place to work, the culture is amazing.  The work you do is innovative and fun.  very exciting place to work, always working with changing technology.I had a great time interning for this company. They offered challenging yet manageable tasks. I was assigned to a group of interns that matched my skills and experience. The work environment was very friendly and they offered many benefits such as a nearby gym, volleyball courts, and cafeteria.Unfortunately, I have been having difficulty re-contacting any previous connections.Enjoyed the working there because of the co-workers, the facilities and the culture. The opportunities for advancement seemed limited.It is a very nice work place to work, people are very friendly, no free lunch but has some snacks supplied for overnight engineers"
455,Vice,"Em um dia típico de trabalho havia muita correria e muitas coisas urgentes a serem realizadas tudo ao mesmo tempo, mais aprendi a ser organizada, paciente, educada e compreensiva, bem como realizar tarefas que antes nem sabia que existia, como por exemplo organização numérica para cada bem móvel da empresa. Os gerentes eram todos compreensivos e dispostos a ensinarem tudo que sabem aos demais. A parte mais difícil do trabalho era exigir as notas ficais das empresas terceirizadas no prazo devido, a parte mais agradável era quando estava tudo organizado e te dava uma sensação de dever cumprido."
678,Virginia Mason,"Satellites offer a flexible culture. Seattle location is connected to the Virginia Mason Hospital. This requires clinics adhere to hospital standards making it a somewhat oppressive work environment.Most of the drs are behind, but typical for everyday. Front desk is great. MAs are all wonderful and hard working. Management lacks. always switching schedule's, isn't qualified for what they do, unorganized, and all over the place. Doesn't know what a MA does on a day to day bases. more worried about numbers and how they lookthen the MA's that run the clinic. Patients were kind and great full for the hard working MA'sWork days as an operational leader here were hard and long, but most importantly, rewarding.  Learning opportunities were always available, and they have a population of support for each other and the community.Management was poor. Not a organized environment.Expectations and communication poor. I found the Drs to be somewhat pressed for time.Loved working there. The atmosphere was friendly and welcoming. I learned so much about the pancreas working there. Best place for an EGD.I enjoyed getting involved in Toastmasters (covered by the hospital), was a part of the Green Team, and started the Staff Support Networking Group.  I learned a lot about scheduling meetings that involved executives with very busy schedules; learned about various technology (tele video and lite projector).  I always prepared myself for the unexpected which I enjoyed a lot.  My workers were very supportive and I developed many close friends during my time there.  I learned to pay attention to my director's calendars so I could maximize my support for them.I look forward to my day and my work. It is challenging and the MD's I work for are just as nice and I keep a smile on my face. I normally work on complex scheduling in the morning unless there are other mandatory items that need my attention. I prefer to work with people and have fun as well. I look forward to change that is coming with my current job. I also would prefer to work for one department instead of being split up into two.I learn something new everyday as I came from a banking background. The Hospital setting is very educational and I enjoy all my peers and management.I enjoy helping with events and I admire my manager.While going through financial struggles with layoffs,  the managers still get bonuses while working 8 hour days. Excellent doctors leaving the organization or being worked to death along with their nurses and assistants.Japanese business ""masters"" flown-in to observe but nothing improves,.No one cares how far the real workers need to commute, education and experience are not appreciated unless the manager has a crush on you.Our voices not heard, even if it's an issue with patient safety. Very fake  quality place that's out of compliance and never gets inspected.Most enjoyable part of job is working with patients and serving them.  Applying and removing casts.  Getting to know patients and having great conversations with patients.The best company I've ever worked for and I will highly recommend anyone to work for this company. Great benefits and awesome work culture. Excellent company when it comes to team work.During my 19 years at Virginia Mason Medical Center, I enjoyed working there very much. The work was challenging and rewarding, and I made many friends in my department and outside of my department. My job was eliminated due to a reduction in workforce,  brought about when a long-standing alliance with Group Health hospital ended.I am currently still working there, and my final date there will be in February 2016. After that, I will be actively searching for new employment.The most enjoyable park of my work in helping patients, taking care of them, making them happy and see the smile on their faces when they leave me.Individual responsibility for one's own productivity; excellent opportunity for self-direction with limited supervision. Great learning environment at a self-paced level.Hospital and Clinic are just side by side.  Doctors and Nurses have good Personal contacts with patients.  They really take care of you.Level 15 (general surgery) is a new unit that just opened in Feb 2015. This is an amazing floor to work on as the nurse manager, assistant managers, nurses, and PCTs are all extremely friendly, fun, young, outgoing, and great at their jobs! Typical day is 12.5 hours, with 1 15 min break, 1 45 min lunch, and another 15 min break. You learn as much as you want to, as the nurses love to teach you things like show you how to put catheters, IVs, etc. in the patients. As a PCT at VM, you are given much more responsibility than many other hospitals and workplaces. You get to remove catheters, IVs, and other fun and exciting things :)If it was not for the money they hand out for their doctors this company would fold. Poor management. They only listen to their employees when it benefits them.this a great place to work, if you like a challenging work environment.This place is a very fast pace work not time to stop.My work days usually go by pretty quick because we are always so busy.  I usually end up doing anywhere from three to five different jobs throughout the day because I cover other staff lunches.I am happy that I get to meet such a diverse group of people on a daily basis whether that be patients or employees from other departments.I learn a lot from the many different patients that come through the clinic, as well as the employees I work with.  If it had not been for this job I would not know how to interact with so many different cultures and personalities, and that makes everything I do have real meaning,The staff I work with are all very helpful and friendly, and we all treat each other like family.  When we get new staff, we all pitch in to make sure that they are comfortable and welcome, which is wonderful.Our management team is accommodating and is always asking if staff members have suggestions on how to make things flow smoother.  We have rapid improvement workshops where the staff will have the chance to try out any suggested changes to see just how functional they are and if they are better than the old process.The hardest part of the job for me would be loosing so many people I have come to know and care about.  I value each patient that comes into the clinic and that makes it much harder when I find out they have passed on.  I think I mourn their loss as though they were family, which makes my job very tough at times.The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the peace I have with what I do.  Each day I get to help dozens of people in some way  more... or other, and that makes my life have meaning which is what we all are looking for most.  lessVMMC is a wonderful place to work.  They recognize hard work and you get recognized for it.  There are plenty of chances for advancement and that's what I admired most about working for VMMC.A typical day at work would be transporting patients to and from appointments and various other locations through out the hospital. I learned a lot about time management. My corkers were a great team also fun to work with. The hardest part of the job would be getting incorporative patients to their appointment. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with doctors in meeting new patients.Lots of phone work, surgery scheduling. Working with wonderful physicians. Most of my co-workers were good team players. The hardest part was having to be very multi-tasked.  Most enjoyable was caring for patients needs and feeling very fulfilled."
79,Visa,"Small office of five employees, hardly feels like work. Too small for long term employment.I loved my job and my co workers, but the way management conducts themselves leaves a lot to be desired.The hardest part of my job was balancing what our customers wanted with what our management wanted us to tell them and then not backing us up when we told them.Visa has decent benefits and perks.Good place to work Good co-workersEnjoyable work and stressful at timesManagement is good and supportiveGood opportunity for growth Learned new technologies in web systems engineeringExcellent work environment, good people and great work/life balance.A company that respect you as employee and with a defined mission.Very stable and good position companyGreat work environment, great culture and incredible benefits, Days at visa are very rewarding, they provide a great atmosphere for expansion and productivity,Excellent place to work. very supportive people and very good management group.employee benefits also very good. career growth also very good as always more opportunities to explore on different tasks.Decent pay but staff are not valued as employees.  Very rigid in their thinking and not open to new ideas.  So much expertise in the company but not allowed to tap into it.  So afraid to make a decision.Visa is a very nice work environment to work for. I encourage everyone who is looking for an advancement to visa. Please join visa. Hard workers always get a promotion.Great learning opportunity for beginners but horrible work culture .Sr. management is quite political in nature.This is not a technology company and overall there are no processes and less supportive management.If you believe in saying yes to your boss , no matter what, then you can survive hereVisa is a very stable company, good benefits and compensation package. Knowledgeable management, good and friendly co-workers. 7 by 24 production support was the hardest part of the job-Good flexible time.-Very good co-workers -Great training-Fun environment to work for-The first couple of weeks of the month was the the most active since we had to collect rent money and made calls to every single tent.Worked with: Go Payment, Turbo Tax. ADP, ADP Aline, Payroll Card, Gift Card, HCCA, and Visa Fraud Prevention Service-Assisted customers by answering their concerns-Reported lost/stolen cards, balanced inquiries, and also disputed of transactions not authorized by the current card holder. -Kept company calls and information confidential-Provided a safe environment for any card or account information pertaining to the customer. Dealt with Visa Fraud Prevention Services and verified transactions that would come into question and in need of further verification by the card holder.Its a Very nice Environment to work with .... I thoroughly enjoyed working in visa .... Every day is a new day with a lot of hard-work , and learning new things ...•	Entail quality calls assuring best professionalism and proficiency while meeting goals and requirements.•	Protect and comply with sensitive information and company's key controls to assure maximum data confidentiality.•	Addressed and resolved customer complaints empathetically and professionally.•	Provided direct support for full life-cycle recruiting process.My teams maintained and executed CICS/COBOL  applications to validate changes to primarily Debit, Clearing and Settlement, and VISA's Integrated Billing System.I enjoyed my time at Visa.  I found there was room for growth, much to learn, and great co-workers.  Because of the nature of the payments industry (heavily regulated), the environment truly challenges you to be agile, persistent, and effective.Awesome place to work, Safe environment, friendly atmosphere. Great benefits, leadership is top notch great direction with a open door policy. the most enjoyable part of my job was helping customer achieve their dreams by allowing them to establish their online business with the ability to accept credit cards and become profitable businesses.The workforce is being replaced with cheaper labor.  Benefits have been diminishing over the years and pay is not competitive.  Slow to adopt new technology.Lots of improvement with Management needs to happen here other than that the  staff and people are great to work with in the control and badging departmentVery productive and fun workplace. Management is excellent and plenty of oppurtunities for advancement. Excellent benefits. Nice perks. Work location convenient.Nice working environment and good people to work with. The company is working on latest technology and very flexible for working hours. Multiple networking events hosted by the company to grow your network within the company. Overall fun place"
510,Visiting Nurse Service of New York,"driving from visit to visit. if you don't like driving around and dealing with the public this will not be for you. you. wont have a set area, you could be driving all over the borough.Educational environment. I have learned so much working here and have grown alot. I enjoyed working as a Public Health Nurse.They made me an incorrect offer and told me to trust them as they couldn't get it in writing for a couple days. So I put notice in at my current position and then they rescinded the offer the next day because I accepted an offer that was incorrect. I guess I wouldn't want to work there if that's how they are anyways.Got a lot to learn. Very fast paced environment. Proper work life balance. Great location and great benefits. Great communication channels between cross functional teams.VNSNY used to be a great place to work-But inow there is a hostile working environment ,no management support, poor problem solving skills from managers.I have been a Public Health nurse for 20 plus years and still enjoy seeing patients at home but this agency had made it more difficult for us to casemanage safely and efficiently . The nurses and rehab group that i worked with are awesome !I have worked for this company for more than a decade, it was a wonderful company but sadly at this time the current management, especially in Westchester and the Bronx is HORRIBLE, it has sunken to the depths of a DRACONIAN ERA where backstabbing and witch-hunts of the dedicated staff that has been there for 10-25 years is under attack. Especially the Westchester management team, the 2 managers here are basically incompetent and they want to micro-manage the nurses to prove they are doing their jobs, but honestly they are destroying the efficiency of the nurses and they are horrible managers, sadly they used to be nurses in the organization and have lost perspective.  The salary and benefits are excellent, but if you want to be worked to death for money that is a personal question.  The Manhattan division is still run OK - but there is not the opportunity to make the money that there used to be in the company.  There is UFT UNION representation for the nurses and they do a wonderful job, but it is definitely an exhausting place to work these days.  The benefits through the UFT union are wonderful, full paid medical/dental for the entire family just for union dues, no employee contributions. And a pension managed by the UFT fund.VNS was okay to work for at first. The workload was always heavy but we made the best of it. In the last 3 years, however management has shifted their focus to be more harrassing than usual and the big stick mentality is constant. Your cases keep increasing and you cannot even get to see patients on schedule. They care more about numbers, spending millions on ridiculous dashboards while laying off essential staff and downsizing a 3 floor office space down to a 4 room corner box. This company does not care about their patients and less so the workers. Most managers have resigned so you work without supervision. You cannot even reach them via phone. Move along if you wish to provide safe patient care and maintain your sanity or integrity. This is not a good place to work.This job sounded wonderful but when it came down to it, it was pushy people that if they didn't like your work this when you were not in their churchI was layed off more than 2 years ago and still miss the work life balance. I would work there again at the first chance i get.The employees were rude I was offered a work study assignment from my school to work here. I would walk into the office and there would be no work available I would have to ask around if there something to do to make the day go by quicker.Field work three times a week in the office for 2 days a week. I learned to be a caseworker by fieldwork training being out in the field. Management staff was very concern about sending employees to classes so they can continue to exceed in their position, Co workers worked as a team so we can assist members who needed homecare services. The hardest part was convincing elderly members when it came to documents needed for healthcare but over all they come around and are please with the services VNS has provided.VNSNY is a great place to work. The benefits are awesome and my colleagues are wonderful. The hours are comfortable too.Company does not value and invest in its employees.  Management let great talent walk out the door.  Many talented individuals were forced to leave. People that are there are not recognized and developed.  No opportunity for growth due to politics.  Very political organization.  Not based on what you do but who you know.Love the patient care and day to day dealings with patients. don't care for the numerous managers, lack of communication to staff. great co-workers!I loved my job.Never called out sick, never late. I look forward to every night going on duty.  Always signed on an hour early to see how the flow was going and check all emails before starting. Sometimes back flow from evening was a little hectic but then slowed down.  Learned to listen carefully to what patients did  not say to clue me in to their problem.  Management as per my clinical instructor was very good. Received good advise. My co workers were the best.  Assisting with Hospice calls and translating  spanish calls for the Manager on duty was stressfull,  or pt that were lonely and just wanted someone to speak to at night, which I would stay on the phone and speak to them.  Most enjoyable when pt was so sad and at end of conversation would tell me I made their day brighter, I would keep their phone and call them few days later to check up on them.  I spoke to my coordinator about the need to call our clients to check up on them, which we implemented.  Worst day of my life when I retired.. My Dad was very sick I had to be there for him, he died 11/15.  Now I am looking forward to giving to my clients what I learned caring for him and my step mom.  My understanding for the  care  patients with dementia and progressive alzheimers need  is very difficult. Want to give back for all I have learned, patience, love for nursing them back to an acceptable way of life with dignity, making sure no one hurts them emotional or bodily.lots of transition, good for someone who likes to work in the field and likes the change.A lot of employees left due to the increase in the caseloads but not in pay.There are no annual bonuses any more.Caseloads increased from around 25 to 40/50 and moreProductive and supportive hospice team with excellent management, time consuming travel however, interesting and self-fulfilling during patient and family encounter. Provides great learning experience.I met wonderful people who work/worked for VNSNY. I also learned and was taught how to be a good administrative assistant by the head of VNS Choice. Best boss I ever had. What was wrong with VNSNY is that there was no loyalty to me or anyone else at VNSNY. There never is any loyalty and that is a shame. Especially those of us who worked so hard for so many years. The management from the top has changed and it's not the same place it used to be. It was a pleasure working there from 2001 when I started and then around 2007 it started to change. It's gone down hill from there. Massive lay offs and a lack of loyalty to it's employees. It used to be a wonderful place. There old logo was ""We Bring the Caring Home"". I miss that...Big company lots of challenges. No  structure. will like to work where there is more structure. Company has good benefitsDoes very good with payroll and any other task ask to do.Does great job with AR.Always takes on other task to help other.Fills in when other are on vacation.3 days a week out in the field making home visits to assist members with documents needed for Medicaid Applications and bringing Medicaid application down to 34th street  Medicaid office to be process timely  and 2 days a week in the office reviewing and assisting members over the phone regarding what documents are needed for scheduled pick up date.  I learned how to travel within the Borough  of the Bronx NY.  Management was fair with caseload and willing to send you to classes for training to keep you educated & updated with the different changes within Medicaid guidelines. Co-works were team players and family oriented. The hardest part of the job is not knowing if you were safe going into member's homes. Most enjoyable was working in the Borough  that you lived in it felt like you were giving  back to your community."
240,Vistaprint,"Vistaprint is a great place to work. There are a lot of perks that come with working there. Free food trucks, sabbaticals, lots of time off, and a good work environment.If you are straight out of college, and want to spend all of your time at work, this is the place for you! Company has amazing benefits, but be willing to put in the time. Lexington location is easy to find, however, traffic - not so good.Very fun work place, family oriented and helps you to be a well rounded individual. Management is encouraging, wonderful colleagues we learn from each other each day.Great work place I have had extensive training in providing high customer service, email proficiency, digital marketing and website designs. We currently have a strong management team that offers support in their specified area.If you work in Marketing or Engineering, you'll love working at Vistaprint.  A fun, young and casual vibe.  People are really transparent with projects, expectations and eager to collaborate.  Very ""work hard, play hard"" mentality.  Great company overall!It is fun to work for a high growth company which leads to broadening and challenging opportunities.  Challenge is to keep the growth coming.There have been big struggles with turnover and constant changes in organization and structure.However, the majority of the people are really intelligent and a pleasure to work with.I worked at Vistaprint for one semester as graduate intern for the Learning and Development department. Here is a list of some of my achievements:• Supported strategic and tactical efforts in the design and development of learning solutionsfor the Learning and Development department.• Conducted needs assessment for the company’s Emerging Managers Development trainingprogram.• Collaborated with Human Resources in the design of learning solutions for high potentialemployees.• Created, designed, and facilitated Conversational Spanish lessons for Vistaprint staff.Vistaprint was the best experience I've ever had in IT.  I was well managed, and truly felt they cared for their employees.A typical day at work you punch in to start your shift. Ensure you have all the apps that you will need to do your job open, Check your email to get information on upcoming changes new alerts etc. Be ready to provided world class customer service to business people who works hard to ensure their businesses are successful.Sure it seems great environment at first with free snacks/coffee, occasional free food truck lunches (Lexington) and an impressive compensation package/bonus. But after the honeymoon is over, you quickly realize that everyone is in it for themselves, work/life balance doesn't exist (most employees work at night) and support from managers is fleeting. If you enjoy backbiting, gossip and unprofessional behavior, then this is the right environment for you. If not, do yourself a favor and stay away from this toxic workplace. You'll either be fired or quit within a year.The environment is attractive, but there's a great deal of work to get done.  Pressure to work late too.good work environment, but priorities and strategic goals are a moving target.Vistaprint is filled with nearly all talented, motivated people - wonderful to be around.  Each day is busy and different from the next.Vistaprint is a great place to work. The company emphasizes professional growth as well as personal growth, offering its employee both skills training and yoga classes. The company works hard to keeps it’s employee happy with food truck days and a community feeling. Everyone that works at Vistaprint seems to work hard to achieve professional growth and team work is highly welcomed.I went to Vistaprint with high hopes. I left a wonderful company and a great position for slightly higher pay here and I've regretted it terribly. Having worked here over a year, I have found it to be a very cut-throat workplace with no regard for employees' personal lives. I have been enrolled in a Masters program and have had to take two semesters off because the workload at Vistprint is relentless. It is expected that employees regularly work their full day and then jump back on the computer at night to show they are putting in the extra effort. But, the extra effort is invasive of my personal life. Its infuriating contstantly having senior managers requesting information on Saturdays and Sundays. Working here is a new form of anxiety that I have never experienced before, nor will I again. Luckily, I am getting ready to leave. Talking with former employees of Vistaprint - I can hardly wait for the sigh of relief they've noted when giving notice!Good growth Company, but Finance is a sweat shop with lack of decision making and poor leadership. In general the people are pretty good, but no one stays. Turnover is extremely high, part of the reason so many jobs are open. Plenty of room to negotiate salary and bonus, the Company will overpay. They are liberal with sign on bonuses but don't expect to be rewarded once you are in the door. Despite the claims, bonuses don't exceed 100%, so don't believe the hype that you have significant upside.Finance is a reporting function only, there is zero strategic partnership. Expect to work a significant number of hours just trying to get the basics done. Good opportunity to come in for a year or two and then jump ship for something bigger.Free lunches are nice along with free drinks, but I'd rather have a meaningful job and work normal hours than to get a couple of perks, work 80 hours and have a mind numbing job.Great culture - Management values employee base. Talented base of Technical employees. Hardest part of the job, although I didn't mind it, was the off-hours activities supporting an e-commerce site- friendly working environment- productive and smart team-members- warm company culture- hardworking individuals"
329,"VMware, Inc.","A great experience as a recruiter to work with a very smart teamThe mos enjoyable part of the job was the people, the company cares a lot of their employees. I enjoyed interning at VMware also because of the great project planning experience I acquired through my internship.Very beautiful work environment, great cafeterias, happy people. Tides shifting due to Dell/ EMC merger causing big budget cuts and business re-structuring.A growing company with a lot of talent employees.A rapid growth company.Glad to share the adventure with the rest of the employees.Great team work.It's a life, work balance company.Most talent leaves due to the chaos of the environment due to poor management. Great coworkers great company and leading edge technology otherwiseTypical day starts with scrum call with offshore team members, followup any action items. Attend status meetings with release teams, work with team members on various project efforts related to testing, automation, and working with the other segments of the scrum.awesome benefits and incredible career launching pad for young professionals. A ton of product information to learn but self-paced video and online training program makes it's easy to keep up.Good team work.Management was nice.Due to diversity in culture the company hosted different festivals of different culture which was fun.spacious workplace and good parking spotstoo large of an org for them to focus on smaller groups. innovation lacks . A lot of buyouts and merges and aquisitions .Work culture is good but not appreciated for work that you do .I am looking for a challenging and interesting position in a growing environment.Working in the company should be fun and use my skill and experienceCheck numerous incoming emails, schedule daily work and prioritize accordingly, meet with supervisor, attend meetings to take notes, publish notes according to manager's needs; highlight action items with time commitments, answer calls, filing, work on projects outstanding, schedule meetings for the managers, check manager's emails and print out as needed, create project files for follow-up.What I learned was to be self-motivated and independent worker according to the needs of management and projects. Keep ongoing priorities log for reporting purposes. A highly multi-tiered management structure with a moving organization according to business changes and needs. It was necessary to have great co-worker communication and participation skills at all times. The most difficult part of this job was the amount of walking to be done between buildings while the business changed and grew rapidly. There were over eight other offices spread out on several city blocks until the campus was consolidated. We used golf carts and bicycles to make the time more convenient into one large campus. It was necessary to attend all meetings and obtain instructions and information from your manager. There were company-wide software tools to learn, that didn't always parallel or match standard industry practice but mostly useful to the company. We produced many PowerPoint organization charts for the continuous change and growth especially at meetings large or small.I worked diligently to meet and resolve employee issues with the Travel & Expense process so that reimbursements took place timely  more... for both employee and for accounting. There was a huge backlog of expenses that employees refused to use the existing system, until I was able to provide a usable training program that refined the process. I gave class training and worked one-on-one until the backlog was resolved, Afterwards I was assigned to a different  department within the company.I really enjoyed the company philosophy to grow and train their employees with higher level education or seminars. The employees were given many perks such as onsite organic snacks and drinks, local exercise classes and gym, to name a few. I felt the company valued their employees and supported them especially with invited family celebrations throughout the year. Product launches and celebrations were the norm and happened frequently to keep company morale high and focused. Families were recognized as important part of the employee's life such as during pregnancy or needed time off, a sufficient program for Family Leave was instituted.  lessGood place to start career. It has good reputation, relatively high salary and good intern programs. I wish I could work with it after graduate.Great people, smart ideas, good cultural foundation, but clumsy acquisition and new strategy implementation makes cross functional organizational operations unsteady.Each day at VMW brings with it new challenges which motivates a person to continuously improve and grow from a career perspective. There are multiple opportunities provided for those who would like to expand their skill sets through programs set up specifically targeted for self development.Work life balance is a challenge, however the people that I work with makes it that much more enjoyable.VMware is a great company as a full time permanent employee.  If you are contract employee you are treated as such.  You do not receive the same benefits as a full time employee but are expected to perform and follow all the same requirements as a full time employee.VMware was incredibly flexible and very strong in terms of benefits. Well respected technology and a comprehensive solution suite.Really good company to work for.  Micromanagement is a problem in some groups (like everywhere).  Executive management is great, but Sr. and middle management not so hot.I can take up any job as challenging .I will complete all the work on time .Once i give them commitment .It Will be done before the deadline based on the commitmentThe environment is GREAT and the people are great. There are a lot of project to challenge one and I learned a lot from the projects. The training culture of the company is GREAT as well.There is no typical day as we refine and change business plan according to new market developments, emerging competitive threats and technology required for execution.  At any given time, I could be forecasting market growth, understanding target markets to understating how the technology works and how we can use it to our advantage.  Thinking of the possible is an every day thing -- while trying to develop the financials and models that make it successful -  business models, sensitivity analysis, financial analysis, international expansion plans,etc. Most enjoyable part of work is seeing the strategy turn into execution and finally, delivery of resultsVMware is hands down the best company I have had the opportunity to work for in the 20+ years I have spent in HR and Recruiting. The top reason being that this company really believes in working smarter than harder and the flexibility you are trusted with to do your job in the best way you know how make you feel valued from day one."
586,Vox Media,"A wonderful workplace environment. Everyday is a new challenge, in a sense. My experience has forced me to become more diligent and resourceful with my time. The onus is entirely on you to get better. I learn from the people I work with because they, too, are writers. Which is maybe the hardest part of the job: finding the time to read everything. And I read more than anything else I do! I also enjoy working from home quite a bit, easily the best part of the job.I've only worked for Vox Media for a short time on a part-time basis as a news desk writer for SB Nation, but I like what I've seen from the company. They are clearly on the cutting edge of new technologies and innovations in the field. My work consists of writing news stories in four hour shifts. At time the work can be tedious, but it also provides me opportunities to be creative.A typical day included myself and my studio manager, creating lighting set ups for the first show and prepping our control room to capture it. During the run of the show I would get a list of tasks from my executive producer for the day. They would include anything from trouble-shooting new equipment, going on a run to meet one of our freelance editors, or even cleaning up our storage space. Our management was good, they were fair, understanding, and only pushy when they needed to be. My co-workers were all similar to me in age and we generally had a good deal of fun while working together. Hardest part of my job would be after lunch when I normally broke down both studios alone since my manager had to be in meetings with the higher ups. The most enjoyable part was just working in the studio, listening to music and telling funny stories from the night before.it's a great place to work! each day is a new adventure. Projects are great, people are great for the most part. Vox is a growing company with skys the limit opportunities."
35,W2O Group,"With a client-minded flexible schedule, you are largely free to do your own work and be responsible for your deliverables. A typical day for me is different because I work in IT. I get to see the troubles that people face each day and learn from each experience and that's a unique perspective that most people don't benefit from.The hardest part of the job has been an inability to align my department's goals with the company's goals because that information either isn't communicated or not communicated well enough.The most enjoyable part of my job is the flexibility to try new technologies and coerce people into beta testing for others in the company!I enjoy working at W2O for almost seven years now.  I have great account team and finance co-workers to work with.It has been an okay place to work. A lot of turn over, which is typical for a PR Firm.Private company so finance rules are a bit loose, which is sometimes hard to deal with.So many changes since I started. Hard to follow or feel part of the group."
43,Wal-Mart,"Great and friendly management. The pharmacy is a great atmosphere to work in and competent support personnel is provided on a daily basis. Competitive salary.I worked putting New Fabric away in the morning as well as carts that were left from the night before.  All day long waiting on customers and helping customers get what they need to help with their problems and accompise  what they want as the end result. I would help put freight away as well. When new modes came down i would help if not set new modes until the last of my working there then they had a mod team that did them at night.  I always took the old patterns in our file cabinet out and put in the new ones that came in.Walmart was attempting to implement a new inventory management system for stocking and back stocking. Unfortunately, the hand-held devices were outdated and malfunctioned often. Additionally, there was not enough space in the back room for proper and safe storage of products.I like working at Wal Mart because they do not laid off. I dislike  Working at Wal Mart because it's open year round and it is closed only Christmas. This is a retail store which involve working all the time. Everyone must work as team in order to complete a job. The hardest part of the job is working Management and customers. Worker are required to please both customers and Management. The most enjoyable part of the job is employer discount and worker can transfer from one state to another.A day at Walmart consisted of breaking down the newly deliverd product and restocking shelves making sure they stayed stocked throughout the day while at the same time helping coustomers.Walmart had a very interactive managment team that was always willing to show how things are done or help you out if things where running behind. My co-workers at Walmart where my life line, we worked together like a well oiled machine to get through the day.The hardest part about working at Walmart was the fluctuating schedule while the best part of the job was interacting with the coustomersThe managers rarely communicated with the supervisors which made it hard for them to communicate with employees. The managers assumed that the supervisors were mind readers when it came to certain task. Most managers didn't help with checkout when the store would be really busy. They would pull employees from other departments of the store which then put those departments behind with getting their own work done.. check email for recalls/ shipments for the day/ call ins.check sales reports from the day before.check status of stores condition.follow up with department manager to follow up on work load for the day.. morning meeting with store staff to go over previous day sales, report due and associates on anniversaries and birthdays..The most enjoyable part of the day is knowing that you turned a profit from the previous day and your hard work was well worth it..As a People Greeter, in Conroe, Texas, and Anchorage, Alaska, I enjoyed meeting the people and assisting them, by answering questions they might have.  In Anchorage, I was also, a People Greeter, but transferred to Automotive, and Hardware as a clerk in those departments.  Excellent work ethic, and attendance.Report to work 15 minutes early, check duties, learned new concept and how to utilize new data listed on the wire (information system), Check with management to see if any additional duties need to be completed, work as a team with co-workers to complete all tasks assigned, the hardest part of my job is keeping the area straight after customers leave a mess, the most enjoyable part of my job is assisting, satisfying and making customers happy.Meet the target set by the company, provide good after sales service, Look into the complaints made by the customers as they help in improving the overall product, researching and survey customer satisfaction, Give ideas regarding offers to boost sales, maintain accurate records for sales which help in deriving the right figures, give feedback to higher management about the product.At Walmart we had a lot of worker and for the most part everyone got along and tried to make our days at work as easy as possible. i learned how to drive an electric pallet jack, how to work with other people. the hardest part of this job is when someone is not present, someone else has to cover the shift which means double work but other than that it wasn't really hard. i enjoyed the workers and the times we had.*Upper management lacks respect when speaking to other salaried management employees and hourly associates. *Company wants ""more for less."" (requiring salaried employees to work more than 15+ hours per/shift)*The hardest part of this job is assigning tasks to a shift that is always short-staffed, and dealing with disgruntle employees.* Motivating the associates and seeing their end results is the most enjoyable part of my job.The work conditions are deplorable when your hours are not being cut. Upper management is of no support and the things corporate sends down clearly looks good on paper written by a bunch of people who have CLEARLY never done the job. There is a sign that hangs in every Walmart for all employees to see that states the employees are on the front lines so they're whom should be listened to. Most employees understand it's just for decoration.People who work terribly are treated better than people who work hard, and if you work hard and bend your back for your managers they will continue to add more and more work and ask for more and more favors and will not consider you, your health or your personal life if something occurs. They don't treat you as humans beings. You're an accessory to them, a slave that gets paid (not nearly enough) to do everything for them.My time at Wal-Mart was something of an experience. My co-workers were more interested in trying to find ways to trick the system into letting them pay $5 for a new game that just came out rather than actually doing their job. Also management has this ability to completely ignore your school schedule and have you scheduled to come in to work 10 minutes after your class across campus from your dorm let out and would get mad about me being late. They didn't understand the fact that school came before work to me so I left.At Walmart a typical day would be me cleaning the toy department and getting it cleaned up for the next few customers. I have learned how to provide correct customer service and provide good advice and further information for my customers. My managers that worked for walmart, could have handled their jobs better then how they did. But I must say that my job was cool. My co-workers were amazing , they were easy to work with and they were very funny, the hardest part of my job was dealing with angry customers. But the most enjoyable part was getting to work around such amazing people.I loved working here most days. I was let go due to unfortunate events that got int the way. Sadly, there is some unfair treatment from certain salaried managers. Some of them will treat you poorly if you can't be with them or do them favors, if understood properly. I noticed I was frequently getting spoken to or getting in trouble shortly after refusing someone. Just watch out for that. Aside from this issue, the pay is eh. But you'll love who you work with. They make it easy for every day to be a good day.Can be a fair place to work if you are attending school. They try to be flexible with employees if they have children by allowing you to work day or night. The work is not hard work for the most part, but it can be very busy work. Most of the management are pretty fair with employees. The co-workers tend to be friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job is having to stock a double truck of merchandise in a short amount of time. The most enjoyable part of the job is receiving bonuses.This position keeps me very busy and allows me to get to know a lot of people and work with others.  Although I do really like this job, I don't see it as an end all beat all position as it doesn't provide me with many challenges except for that of having to find a way to get all things done with a limited amount of resources.Going in to this job can make your day a better day if your day isn't going to well you'll get to interact with others,having good co-workers can really be fun also having someone to talk to someone you may learn to trust and in companies such as this one we was more like a family.The hardest part of the job for me was when an associate would call out so therefor i would have to go harder to keep my department looking good.What i loved the most about the good was when our customers are satisfiedA day at Walmart consisted of breaking down the newly delivered product and restocking shelves making sure they stayed stocked throughout the day while at the same time helping customers. Walmart had a very interactive management team that was always willing to show how things are done or help you out if things where running behind. My co-workers at Walmart were easy to talk to and we worked together like a well oiled machine to get through the day.The hardest part about working at Walmart was the fluctuating schedule while the best part of the job was interacting with the customers."
702,Washington State,"The people are friendly and happy generally. Fun place to be. I work here as a freelance artist because it gives me a new look at business and companies that most do not get to see.I was to inspect the property, secure all entries and determine any damage. After this I was to place bids and repair damage to the home.Helping communities and individuals can be a very satisfying opportunity. Having the public questioning the value of government work is a constant stressor, as is the frequent uncertainty of each budget cycle.  Currently there is a focus on Lean management principles and responsible accountable practices which is a good trend.  People are very knowledgeable on a wide variety of things and there are opportunities to do project work to gain more experiences.Moving product in and out of warehouse, my co-workers were fun people to work with, some days were very fast paced, but at the end of the day I enjoyed it.The job was boring. The old saying that state workers take a 2 hour 1 hour lunch is pretty much true. It is hard to really get anything done due to all the red tape.As a trainer for Washington State I had the opportunity to set my own hours and develop my classes centered around my interests. I met a lot of people that enriched my life and helped me grow personally and professionally.Washington is a go and go state, always improving itself in some way or another.  Life is what you make it but this state helps improve it.It is a privilege to work for the WSDA. The work culture is serious about safety and keeping the department compliant with all safety standards.What a great bunch of people doing really interesting work.  I'm glad I had the opportunity to work there.  I learned a lot and am glad for the opportunity doing this kind of project.At this position I was able to utilize my talent in Sales and Marketing. I worked as a 1099 independent contractor for a major brokerage. I was responsible for developing and maintaining client relationships through marketing and referrals. I had to keep up to date on all the properties in my market and at what price point properties were selling. I used my negotiation skills to benefit my clients during each transaction. It was essential to follow each and every transaction through to final close. I kept up with my data base to grow my business. I enjoyed every aspect of this career.My day to day included making sure my client was happy and hopeful. I monitored overall health and medications and daily activities 24 hours a day at times. I worked alone most of the day and very long hours but at the end of the day it needed to be done and was worth it. The best part about doing this job is knowing my mom is being taken care of by someone i trust and know. Taking care of a cancer patient was the most difficult thing i have done to date but proud of how well i was told i did..Long days, great learning experience with many issues and interesting people. Learned a great deal about passing new and amending existing law...learned to be aware of unintended consequences of both. Built many valued and lasting relationships.I had a lot of fun working with company and the staff that I worked with it was sad to see the store close it was a big experience for meAs a property manager of twelve years in over 6 markets, I am eager to contribute my abilities and experience to a well established and progressive company.  Given my extensive experience in all phases of property management and my eye for financials, I believe I can help a company to achieve its mission and goals as a leader in the property management field.Through my career I have had the opportunity to work in a variety of markets with vastly different demographics.  I have established myself as an aggressive sales agent with a 90% closing rate, an effective manager managing large number of employees, and an expert at compliance and HUD housing projects.Opened and closed store when scheduled. Checked band deposit from previous night. Set up tills, re-counted safe, unlocked doors, turned on lights, Ready to begin day. Pulled bottles forward, faced all merchandise, filled empty spaces, greeted customers, assisted when needed. Supervised other clerks, and gave them duties to complete by the end of their shifts.I enjoy a fun and challenging job where the solution to problems are not always evident, yet the time frame for delivering the project does not change. The environment frequently requires unique approaches to project solutions.Noble mission.  The agency mission statement is ""Serving Those Who Served"", and they serve the veteran population.While working for Long Enterprises, LLC provided me with a myriadof experience from security monitoring through all the layers of running a business and record keeping.  I also wrote many reports onthe status security at many locations and countries.  We did not have a traditional work day and many times worked seven days a week.  I enjoy talking to people at work and always got along very well with co-workers and clients.The most important part of my consulting was meeting new peopleand seeing different parts of the world.I worked from my home and made my work schedule to my needs each week. I also traveled around the state everyday and met a lot of great people.There  were only 4 employes at the store  - you were required to work your shift - only 1 day off at a time with 2 days in a work week. This was my only problem with this position. I enjoyed working with the customers.Thoroughly enjoyed working for the State of WA. I was given an ample amount of autonomy with my daily duties. There is an abundance of opportunities to both educational and job advancement. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and clients. I would love the opportunity to work for the state again."
177,Wayfair LLC,"This was a very fun company at the beginning of my employment, however due to company growth and corporate driven decisions it lost everything that made it once cool.  It is no longer about the people that work there, it is about the performance and the idiotic metrics that they wish to track and pursue.  The management is headed steadily downhill.Great place to work for anyone who likes a call-center environment. Mgmt means well and sincerely tries to assist the salespeople in meeting their goals, but the overall corporate future is very uncertain and so mgmt is forced to deal with and adapt to new major business challenges all the time. Mgmt also tries to keep morale strong with positive employee interactions and perks. Best compensation pkg I've ever heard of for call-center work.If you are an IT professionals I would highly discourage applying here. Manager is clueless and the work environment is horrible. You know that one IT Guy; everyone hates because he is an ahole? Now, imagine him as your manager micromanaging you and HR on his side. ""My way or the Highway"" Management Style. Your suggestions and professional experience will not apply to someone who is always right.I love my new job at Wayfair, especially the culture and work environment. It is a call center and comes with those inherent drawbacks (long hours sitting staring at a computer, can be noisy, etc.) but there are all kinds of incentives, activities, contests, awards, and rewards. Starting pay for CSR is more than I was making after three years at another call center. I love my coworkers, and we make it fun every day. After just a few months, I've have opportunities to do other jobs, and there is a ton of potential for advancement if you're up for it. And if that's not enough... FREE SNACKS!if u r on visa dont join. bad work life balance. only fixing bugs no feature development. management doesnt care about you. they will get rid of you in 3 months or 6 months if u r not exceptional. its a place where fun goes to die. they have a program called labs. that they hire college grads and get rid within 3 months. if you are experienced developer and hired on visa you are left with no employer after 3 months. dont join unless you are exceedingly confident you can perform. if you are on visa donot join. after 4 hours of interview they still evaluate you till 6 months and will fire you any moment. constant change in your department will make you very nervousfree beer and snacks do not make up for unsatisfying and unrewarding work. super siloed work environment, no privacy, open space, abysmal and non existent management. young immature employees with bad attitudes. PTO depends on seniority, average health benefits. 4% match. good life and work balance, lots of company parties and outings, job in it self is unrewarding and super narrow scope.Offered a variety of flexible shift schedules to meet the needs of all employees. A very fast paced environment with heavy incoming call flow. Monthly one on one reviews with supervisor. Constant potential to move up in the company. Very friendly atmosphere with a nice group of diverse co workers.Laid back work environment. Although alot of downtime waiting on trucks to be loaded and other employees were allowed to stand around and talk and laugh while others worked. Hardest part of job was to have to ask for a team lift every time you had a box too heavy 180 lbs or higher which was often. That's the only reason I left the job. Loved it other than the daily heavy lifting.Great benefits and compensation and initially culturally it was great but it changed within a few months of being hired become more corporate and gray.Wayfair was an amazing place to work with fabulous training and awesome people. There is a relaxed environment with supervisors and employees that truly care about the customers and company!Great culture. Not all management great, but mine was excellent. Diverse culture. They don't care about about religion, race, tattoos, piercings, nor orientation. As long as you do the job well, that's what they care about. free coffee and snacks. Unorganized teams. Too demanding in some departments.Fantastic experience with one of the largest growing E-Commerce companies in the world. My co-workers were extremely talentated and helped me grow professionally on a daily basis. I learned how to develop long term business deals and strategies with corporate 500 companies, how to use CRM systems such as Sugar and Salesforce, write code using SQL, and to think outside the box on a daily basis.The money was great, but what an employee had to go through to achieve the level I did is a hard task. I left being One of their Best in Sales. No write ups, no warnings. With this in mind, We could NOT resolve minor very minor issue(s).this company was fun to work for bosses would bring snacks and had prize raffles around the holidays everybody worked hard and together the get the work done sometimes when we finished early if you wanted to leave they would you they tried to make work fun so that you would work and have a good time doing it.Great place to learn about the ins and out of the e commerce business. They have great trainings available for you and encourage you to learn everything you can. Every day things are changing. You have to be ready to head in a different direction on any given day.The Bangor location is full of fun!  Everyone is so happy; it is a happy and upbeat work environment; the managers are phenomenal; the application and interview process was smooth and quick; this is the best company in Bangor, Maine!Wayfair is an amazing place to work and a very fun advirment. There is always something happening and it will keep you on your toes. Working at wayfair will always be a great memory.Worst company in Boston, underpaid, bro culture, disorganized management. They need to focus in hiring quality employees and investing in them and not just hiring for headcount. Would not recomentdWayfair is a fun and interesting place to work, but it has a start-up feel and things change drastically on a daily basis.  They are not profitable and recently had to lay off many employees in the B2B sales department.Not bad, no advancement. Terrible pay.The benefits are good, the atmosphere is relaxed and is easy to operate in regards to the rules. It is a very clicky atmosphere and only the cool kids are able to advance.It is one of the most fun work place ever. It is a great place to work and has awesome benefits. Anyone looking for a cherry picker job, I highly recommend Wayfair."
37,WCG,"Less travel needed as the work can be done on phone and via WebEx or teleconference.  Good company to work for overall.

The hardest part of the job is maintaining a reasonable work life balance. The most enjoyable part of the job has to be the great people that I get to work alongside every day.Nice Company, however, it is dependant upon the success and network of Sprint Inc. The M2M is still being developed, but is not truly ready to sustain the growth of subsdiary companies."
209,Welch's,"The company has a great culture and provides for a good work-life balance.  I am used to working in a fast-paced environment and find that a ""sense of urgency"" is lacking in the Company.Company forces overtime all the time there is no family life when you work for them. All they care about is the almighty dollar.Left a decent job with steady house to work at Welch's Northeast. As part of my job offer i was told i'do me bounced between 2nd and 3rd shift, I would also be learning a ""skilled labor"" job that paid $6 more an hr. I was also informed that they did not force you to work double. What they failed to mention was that being bounced around was day-to-day not week-to-week. Their schedule department has no idea what they are doingoing and there is no rhyme or reason to what they are doing. They don't release a schedule until the day before and will often change it several times  through out the day. Was scheduled for 2 doubles within the first 6 days I was there and they also failed to schedule in the skilled labor job they promised. When I tried to speak to hr about all these issues they simply enter responded with ""I'll accept your resignation.""It wasn't a bad place to work or anything. management and workers were friendly.  I just worked on the line keeping it running on my end.  Only worked there for three months till I went to Grand Valley State University.The company was a good place to work ,but it closed down during the hard economic times. I learned a great deal of technical experience while i worked there .Welch's is one of the best companies I've ever worked for 18 years, all the way at the top with management to my former co-workers. It was more like family. We ALL pulled together to make the company run like a well oiled machine. I've learned a lot. They will be missed!A typical day at work involved working together as a team, which we did very well.  The camaraderie was very nice.  This helped me learn how to function with a diverse work force.  The hardest part of this job was the fact that the line was very fast-paced, and it was sometimes difficult to keep pace.  However, this also fueled my determination to do the best I could in keeping up; it became a daily goal for me to be better than the day before.If management had a clue of what it takes to do our jobs, this could be a great place to work. It is a slave master mentality now. With very little knowledge in management. But most dangerously they think they know what they are doing. Some people are permitted to get away with not doing their jobs, while others are highly scrutinized. In many ways it seems like upper management is trying to destroy the company.  Very sad.I miss the job it is a good place to work I got good training their and typical day; get turnover from previous shift,carryover work etc, assign jobs for technicians, monitor production lines, optimize performance. Monitor support utilities-waste treatment, refigeration plant for bulk storage. steam supply etc. Learned; skills in dealing with subordinates, peers, higher management.Management;High performance, fast paced, focusedco-workers;great group of people, dedicatedHardest part of job; 50-80hr/wk normalMost enjoyable; developing subordinates skills, solving challanging issuesCoworkers were very helpful and worked together as a family cause they considered themselves as one. The job was easy and fun while the money earn was a lot then use to. The time of shift having to work was nice and never overwhelming surprisingly giving the fact I had no days off for a start month.Was nice to work with the people. learned new things everyday. Management wasn't very good.Strat plan initiated by CEO and COO had head count reductions and 90% closing of plant as way to increase grower proceeds over 3 years. The result was releasing good people at the corp and plant level, however not one upper mangement position at the plant level was let go! They are a prominant part of the issues that have plaqued the company (Plant) for years. Still a lot of good people there wondering how long it will be before they shut the plant down and have all product co-packed.A day at work was typically started in a shift meeting where we were informed of what was happening for our shift. Not always was the information correct but once we went to our work areas our coworkers were able to tell us what was happening with better detail and accuracy. The work environment felt like at times combative with the attitude that management was better than all the other people. While they tried to make us feel as though out opinions mattered it was obvious to us that it was a show. The company overall was a good company for the most part to work for. We had good pay and benefits but the overtime was never addressed satisfactorily and more times than not so many people with families did not get much notice or consideration when it came to overtime. What made the job tolerable was the family like group of people that I worked with. We all watched each others kids grow, we helped each other with tough family issues and laughed and cried together. I miss that the most."
760,WEST Inc.,"So much flexibility because you can schedule your own hours and choose what project you want to work onLong hours but several breaks, very clean place to work, pay was good, and clean environment.I love this job this job is the life, your basically on your basically on your own and there plenty of opportunity of making more money!Learned a lot. When customers called in and I enjoyed being able to help our customers"
463,WeWork,"I worked at this company for almost a year, and although it was a wonderful opportunity for meeting cool entrepreneurs and networking, that was one of the ONLY pros. You work incredibly long hours (10-12 per day), and because people can be fired at will, they can also quit at will, so there was so much turnover that upper management never knew what to do. It seemed that decisions were made at whim, and new useless policies were implemented out of nowhere. Towards the end of my time there, there was such a huge push on sales that we were having to work weekend events to create more leads, and never received any overtime compensation other than free beer and food. Free food is nice, but work/life balance is better. No one on my team ever took a full hour for lunch, and eventually we started to feel guilty when we actually did. You have to plan and work weekly events, as well. Additionally, the pay is the same across the board, regardless of what city you live in, so kind of ridiculous to compare the San Francisco employees to the Texas employees. All in all, I would recommend this company if you just graduated and need experience, or are used to long hours and really love networking. But prepare to be disposable, and make a back-up plan.WeWork has amazing potential and if run properly has the ability to be a really great place to work. Until there are some serious changes in management I would not recommend someone to consider working at WeWork. The company refers to management style as ""fixing the plane while it is in the air.""working for wework is great. they have a fun vibe and twice a year you get to go on a company trip. the hours can be very long and you have to work some days after hours but other than that it is a grate place.The whole building was full of positive energy.Always get received with a good morning.fast pace work at times. all my coworkers great people supportive,work as a team.Everybody I have come in contact with has been supportive, welcoming, and encouraging. There is a fantastic sense of community here. You become a part of something huge and join a family. Everybody works extremely hard here. We all believe in providing the best member experience and that doesn't happen without hard work! WeWork is doing some amazing things and it's an amazing experience to be a part of! HR is extremely helpful and employees are treated with the utmost respect. You will get out of this job as much as you put into it!This was one of my favorite jobs I have been with! From the atmosphere, teamwork, and relationships you build, this company had it all! I loved working with everyone and learned so much from those I worked under. It not only helped me to grow as an employee but it helped me to grow as a person.On paper this looks like a great company but it is under paid for what the employee do and can't live off of the wage they pay its employeesWework was a good place to work at. Everyday I was greeted kindly by the people who's offices I had to collect trash from. The environment was great, and it was a job close to home to.the members were very rude someday and then there were days when they were friendly and comical. i learned a lot of cleaning habits.Great people but a chaotic and unpredictable environment. Little organization within departments and expected hours were 9-8:30 or 9. If you're looking for a decent work/life balance, do not consider a job here.Each day there are tasks that must be completed within a deadline such as building walk-through, follow up emails for visitor that have toured the office space, sales calls with market, team meetings among ourselves, and other member support related duties.Typically, I am the primary point person for all sales development in our building and also take most of the tours that are scheduled daily for the facility.Daily collaboration with multiple teams such as maintenance, IT, security, and cleaning staff as it relates operations, day-to-day supplies, and support tickets from members.Members are exclusively small business owners, startups, their staff, and our community management team.  These are people that I have development friendly connections with over the months and would speak highly of all.  WeWork provides the facility but the folks here create a truly enriching community experience that is beyond compare to a typical office space.Generally a good experience however there is very little opportunity for advancement from the property level. The corporate environment is very insular and doesn't provide much recognition to property managers for their efforts. I would recommend for someone right out of college but wouldn't suggest for a mid career individual. Also, high turnover and very little recognition from senior management.When i was working at Wework, i saw that it was very important that our customers had to have a clean environment and for to accomplish this, it important that we had a strong and responsible team. I made sure that all three building had all of there proper employees."
47,"Williams-Sonoma, Inc.","Day to day there is a lot to do and not enough time to do it. Most stores are short staffed because we have high expectations of who we want to hire. This job has taught me a lot and I know have a much better business acumen and a better understanding of the business overall. Management can be great some days and really tough the next. Criticism is not always constructive. My coworkers are actually quite great, we are a tight-knit group of friends at this point. Hardest part about my job is the hours worked. Most enjoyable part about my job is making a store beautiful and succeeding through my people.The training portion on this job was adequate at best.  The job itself is pretty easy, until it is not.  Meaning, as long as the customers questions are something  you know.... things are good.  However, the minute you need any assistance from a team lead, supervisor, etc...  things go downhill pretty quickly.  As you can imagine, when working at home, when you do need assistance it is pretty important.  I would be very hesitant in recommending any of my friends to apply for a job with Williams-Sonoma.  The employees, including team leads and supervisors, are all very nice.  There's just a lack of support when it is truly needed.During my typical workday, I am responsible to go through emails to make sure there are any updates on system issues the night before, credits cards not being able to process, orders not being filled because of a glitch in the system. Also any emails pertaining to any website issues. After the emails I begin to take calls from the associate and answer any questions they may have for the customer. I will also take calls from the associate if the customer has escalated.  Later in the afternoon I will go through the my emails answer any question the customer has sent me and and check my voicemail and do call backs.Williams Sonoma in Memphis/Olive Branch is a very difficult company to work for.  They are in the middle of changing upper management and the new regime is very young and inexperienced.  They are leading by threats and intimidation and always seeking to blame someone lower on any issues.  The moral is very low.  Williams Sonoma volume is 20% - 30% down in 2016, which will likely create more negativity in the coming year.A typical day at work is opening the building for the employees and ensuring that all systems are properly working for a productive day at work.  I have learned to resolve customer and employee concerns.  In management, I have learned all aspects of managing supervisors and associates.  There is nothing hard about the job when you give 110% of effort in completing all tasks and willing to learn other duties.  I truly enjoy working with the people while establishing a trustworthy relationship as this enhances their willingness to perform at a high level.Very high-stress job.  Emails come in non-stop - expect 200+ emails per day.  Very poor processes from top to bottom. Employees are not empowered at all - approvals are needed for nearly everything and if you don't have the proper approvals the process stops - even if it is an emergency.  Co-workers are great but executives either have no idea of how bad things are or don't care. Terrible corporate culture that produces high anxiety, resulting in very high turnover. The best part of the job was my co-workers.A typical at work, we load the delivery truck on Monday morning and we leave the same day to start making deliveries to customers and to the stores.I learned to resolve issues with customers, organize the available time to make all the deliveries on time, and assemble all types of home furniture.The hardest part of the job is to leave home all week and only spend the weekends with my family.I enjoy working under minimal supervision.Cheap labor don't be fooled!!!!! They advertise for management position but when you go in for the interview it's minimum wage and they offer seasonal because they want you to prove yourself! And probably lay you off after Christmas I can't believe they pay so little! I also went to pottery barn then realized this is owned by William Sonoma so I ran fast lolTraining is a month long, They don't teach you anything in that course except how to use the system. The trainer is very sarcastic and rude. The customers that call are rude and always upset about little things. I was a work from home agent and could never get in touch with management or a lead when I needed one for help. The pay is great for a Work from home agent, but you put up with a lot of Stuff so it is deserved. No insurance.I love working for them, they are good for seasonal positions , and the hours are excellent hours. Also they have great employee discounts, and depending on which store you work in your bound to meet famous people.Every morning if your early before your shift starts, you can enjoy your time in the break room, Clock in and turn on your assigned computer, and read email and depending the email you receive from preparing an order or put away orders that has been processed/   What i learn is that i learn to email back to sender and reply back properly and answer phone calls, and put away items to there designated location, The management is well organize and my co workers are exciting,fun, tons of energy, well mannered polite, respectful understanding,   The hardest is none and I enjoy the most is that twice a year theirs an event that the company challenges other company's for good cost and also the company has this outlet that the company sells item for  very low price.I would take call for customers wanting to place an order, or need help with and existing order. I learned so much at William-Sonoma on how to work two systems at a time. My co-workers were very nice everyone ones was there to help each other. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.If you like to take complaints then by all means work at Williams-Sonoma.  You will work from home and take very few orders but lots and lots of complaints.  The management is very hard to reach if you have a problem and I found simply calling another work at home agent the best solution for any problem.  Asking for days off is like requesting a pot of gold be delivered to your door.  It was a very bad experience and I am glad I do not work for them anymore.  Their computer is also antiquated and hard to work.Theirs a daily routine everyday. Very friendly environment .  people care about their job and very easy training. It is very useful. Everyone is willing to help to get the job done. Working there you will be happy to attend work everyday.Great place to work a lot of responsibility and fun while doing so .the furniture is very well made so you expect the delivery to be the same . Just not that much down time at home w friends and familytypical day consisted of impossible goals to reach,, unbearable work conditions, and mismanagement. co workers were typically ok, but mainly a younger class of employees. Hardest part was attempting to follow the directives of more than one person, and the extreme heat.I really enjoyed my time with this company. They really put quality products and customer service first. I had the opportunity work part as a manager in college which served as great experience later on.Overall - enjoyable place to work.Unrealistic expectations for floor set - expected to be completed during business hours.Upper management just cut a lot of store management jobs due to poor business performance.A typical day at work is smooth sailing, fun and  productive. Coworkers are very down to earth and everyday you learn something new from one of the managers. The hardest part of the job is being able to have thorough knowledge of all merchandise and services. Most enjoyable part of the job is gaining experience and learning about things and having access to a lot of people with great knowledge.I came in as a Full Service Associate, (C.S.R.) and in just 2 short months I was at the Command Center. Williams-Sonoma gave me the opportunity to learn new skills that include:-Troubleshooting our Work-From-Home Associates with their computer issues.-Reading 'Real Time' call volume.-Updating Associates schedules-Approving and Declining time off or overtime.-Sending hourly reports to Management.All these skills I did not have before I was hired at Williams-Sonoma.Experience at the store level is entirely based on the GM.  District Managers change to much to actually be able to accomplish anything.  People First atmosphere is not reflected in store level pay."
554,Wiser,"Great co-workers throughout the company.  Great job culture and work/life balance.  Opportunities available to work in multiple areas of the company.Great place to increase your product knowledge and expand your tech skills. Upper management needs to be reorganized in order for this company to really be successful.work hours are flexible, so you can come in anytime before 9 and leave anytime after 3, Learned alot working in different carto, Feature data and urban data products, many different tools learned in Arcmap, some training was avalible for learing new skills in GIS and also commputer programming. Management overall is pretty good except for a few internal issues of not giving enough information to the extractors on some project problems. Co- workers have been great and are easy to get along with. Hardest part of the job I would say would be starting new projects not done yet by the comapny also making sure you are on top of security issues and keeping ISO compliance. The best part of the job is learing new and faster ways of getting a particular project done, and gaining new skill sets from that, and being in a more relaxed environment makes to the job easier and less stressful.A typical day at wiser starts by going to my office and works on different CAD drawings.I learned how to collect data and maintain productivity for various activities in a project also building up reports progress of project.Management was really good i didn't got any conflicts while i was working at co12 hour rotating shift. You work off site and never see your company. The perks are great, stock options, pay, web based tools. The recent change to its primary health care plan is a bit harsh, more of a single payer HSA than any form of Insurance I’ve heard of. Loved the job but company had no positions open other than shift work.Let my clearance expire and didn't handle issues they should have addressed in a professional manner whatsoever."
401,Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company,"In my four years there, I had a great experience.  I loved my co workers and my managers.  Wrigely's is a great company with great benefits.Wrigley offered several opportunities to progress your competence in the field you worked in. Attended pack expo to further my knowledge of the industry.  It was well worth it.Everyone worked together and help each out out with issues that may have come up in your daily work flow.it was a very busy day from the moment you walked in the door.never a dull moment...Only now more than a decade after resigning to pursue other endeavors do I fully realize how great of a place the Wm Wrigley Jr Company really was.  I always enjoyed coming to work at their near immaculate, landmark facilities.  Our management continually made improvements which always kept our goals new and challenging.  Wrigley continually reinvested in their employees and the company never faced true economic problems during my 12 years there.  It was a great environment filled with great people. They were coworkers but many are now friends whom maintain regular contact.  In fact there are very few people who worked there for any length of time who are not contact through at least a friend of a friend.  It was always easy to work hard for a place that always provided so much.  Unfortunately Wrigley was sold, but I feel blessed that I had the opportunity to work there.best company I ever worked for!!!!  I have learned so much from this company that I can carry with me when I relocate to my new career and companyI really loved working for this company. It was a fun environment, employee appreciation was a big thing here. Benefits and salaries were outstanding. A lot of perk (lunch outing paid for by the company, free candy and gum). However one bad manager or director from outside can ruin all of that. Wrigley is really good about removing these folks but sometimes it takes too long for them to get rid of the sour apple.goals that can not be achieved. No life work balance. Very negative work environment.Great environment with great employees.  Mars has changed the culture but not in a bad way.On a daily basis I operate and trouble shoot the machinery. I believe that a person can learn something everyday. When I get to work I pull the order sheet and tell the team what we are running for the day and how much, where it is ship to or if it is staying in the factory. The hardest part of the job is repeating instructions over and over to the same person every day. The most enjoyable part is I love a challenge and everyday I am faced with a new challenge.Able to work in different environments in all of the buffalo region. It was part time work but worked great for me raising children. It was a great company to work for. I would still be their today if it wasn't for them down sizing."
10,Workday Inc.,"I've worked for other software giants, and no one compares to Workday! Their comp and onboarding for sales rep is like nothing I've ever seen. The benefits dept is also making huge strides in the family leave policy for 2017. Can't say enough great things about Workday!!Workday provides a great work/life balance and the opportunity to grow your skill set.  I enjoyed working with a diverse group of individuals and look forward to new opportunities.Hiring spree has resulted in the standards falling especially for the way middle level managers have been hired.  Many of the junior level managers to mid-level managers do not deserve to be managers in the company.  This is fast becoming another Oracle.Workday is the first technology company that I worked for that allows me to use the technology daily and it is the exact same software we sell to prospects.I was recruited by Workday and ended up relocating to Pleasanton from the east coast.  I had hoped Workday a place where i could stay for quite a while but ultimately this was not a good fit for me.  As an SME with over 20 years experience in my industry I was very anxious to develop and delivery best of breed functionality into my product area.  Although the developers, qa and documentation people were great, I found to be the middle and upper management inflexible and stuck in their old ""ERP"" ways given most or previous Peoplesoft or Oracle employees.  If you have background from a best of breed solution and want to work for Workday make sure you get a demo of the product before accepting a position at Workday.Workday places it's employees first in all core values. from that fundamental discipline all other values fall into place and a superior product is developed.If you didn't work around the clock. You didn't get respect. New management that has been coming in has no respect. The culture was dead when I got terminated. However people acted as if nothing had changed. New management loved people who made spread sheets, but didn't care or turned a blind eye to those who really did work.I was terminated for being late when I was never given a warning. And in-fact some of the late was work related from being on call. I got sick of trying to make my manager happy when he was doing noting but lieing to me, so I accepted the termination with little resistance.Don't get me wrong. There is some good things still at workday. But don't expect the great place to work as solid gold. Managers ask you to lie to please CEO and management on the public best place to work surveys. I always told the truth. It was a good place for me, till about a year ago.Its all about the money because they went public.Working at Workday was complete go to market strategy for a subsection of prospects. This required multiple marketing strategies and specific communication cadences to help deliver the Workday message.Here is a CEO that is a billionaire and starts another technology company because he does it for the love and his ""passion"" for technology! I call him the ""Picasso"" of technology and the culture here is reflective of his love to this work. How many leaders can you say that about?Typical day read all emails and handle all priorities. Daily check of all kitchens and copy areas. Handle all service request and complete in a timely manner. I have learned how to time manage my workload and prioritize. I really liked my job there was no negative as far as workday. The toughest part of my job was my manager. I truly believe that upper management should not hiring family members within the same department.Great company to work for.  Customer Success is the key!  Good eye on the product. Long hours and they treat their employees well.Big ideas but no knowledge how to achieve them. Management is dated and clueless how to update their aging software. Want innovation but have no experience on the process to create innovative products. Be prepared to be blamed for their lack of knowledge. Have your resume ready for your next job interview.Great place to work but be ready to work more hours than there are in a day.Co-workers and management are all of high-caliberMake sure to get as much feedback from managementKnow who you have to impressFun and Fast moving environment with great leadershioJust know that yours and anyone's job is on the line everydayGreat top management, and bottom hard working level engineers. The middle management are full of politic. It has turn the company into political power house. The company double and nearly triple in size in less than a year and half, and created huge gap and confusion from top to bottom.I love working for Workday, unfortunately, my project is ending so I have to leave.  I love Workday for the following reasons:They like to use cutting edge technologyThey are completely professionalThey change around everyone's jobs every 6 months or so which keeps people happy.I had high hopes of success here, but it was not a good fit for me. I don't know why, but the overall energy is better for a young, just-out-of-school herd of eager folks, I think.On-boarding is the “mechanism through which new employees acquire the necessary knowledge, skills, and behaviors to become effective organizational members”Helps your ""new hires"" make the transition to becoming:• productive• well-adjusted• and a happy contributing members of your company/teamPost (Corporate) ""lift off orientation on-boarding"" ranked low on the list of hiring priorities – poorly designed and even more poorly executed if there was one in place.No on-boarding at multiple organizational levels post (Corporate) ""lift off orientation"" – spent a great deal of time operating blind.• On-boarding at ""Location Level"" was nonexistent. i.e., Next steps? Working From Home? Go to Local Office? Contact Info? Office supplies?• On-boarding at ""Departmental Level"" was sporadic at best. Very California ""centric"".• On-boarding at ""Team/Job Level"" – No real interaction or introductions if you were not in the California offices. No ‘Go-to Person’ as a contact/mentor. Experienced very little peer/colleague camaraderie. ""everyone out for themselves"" or ""got my own problems"" or ""no time"".• On-boarding at ""Individual Level"" was nonexistent. Travel Policy? Expenses? Emergency Contact List? Appropriate Contact Protocol? Department Manager failed to make expectations clear.- how would individual performance be assessed?- bonus and promotion criteria/opportunities?- clear and written “objectives” that stated accountable and measurable ROI were non-existent.- generalized discussions on “time to productivity” was all over the map depending on conversation  more... and WHO you were speaking with.- never presented with documentation as reference, guidance, expectations or accountability.Terrible, Terrible, Terrible!  lessVery happy customer base that helps with referrals.  A challenge is to find companies that will replace all of their existing HCM applications, and getting them to justify a premium."
508,WSP,"Advancement for administrative staff is not possible on the local level.  Great opportunities for engineers.  Benefits are good.  PTO is good.This is a great company to work within. They have frequent training sessions, team building events, and encourage growth and advancement.  Employees that work here normally stay for several years and if they do happen to change companies, quite a few have returned back. The Consultant Engineering industry itself is probably the hardest part, just because it can have up and down waves of work.Moves at a steady pace. Improved on my excel skills and still working on it. Not much of phone activity. Co-workers are easy to get along with. And it it's easily accessable to public transportation.Customer service is the most enjoyable part of the job.The hardest part of the job is running out of time day end.My co-workers were team members.Management was always there to help.I learned on-boarding and off-boarding, ticket management, and asset management.A typical day at work was a day not planned anything could happen and all fires are cared for.Most things are close to equivalent to other similar places to work in the area, including salary, benefits, and project diversity.I loved the people and enjoyed working there.The individuals that work there are extremely smart, driven and hard working.Enjoyable experience with WSP Qatar.Great engineering team to work with.Stockhom was the area and we had a lot of different jobs to do and learned a lot."
264,WuXi AppTec,"This place is great for entry level experience and no room for growth. Management is set in their ways and expect to advance only if you're Chinese or know someone in management personally. Nepotism is high within the companyWuXi AppTec is a great stepping stone job to get relevant work experience. There is a chance for advancement if you show interest and take the steps to get there. Overall it's a good company from my experience.Management has no education and no clue of daily activity, They hire friends with no experience and no clue of daily operations. You are hired for a position and then expected to work out of class. They dont respect your personal life. carry company phone with no pay while not at work and expect you to come in at all hours and call you at all times of day. and then they argue with you about call in pay. Take computer home for free with no pay for utilizing your private time. Biggest revolving door i have ever seen.Being payed hourly any time you take company property home you should be paid for your time spent after hours.People out of management are good to work with, But they are treated like puppets also with no respect.Work there is busy and can be overwhelming at times.There is great business growth but there is a lack of strong business foundation to support that growth. Co-workers are generally supportive but the employees are siloed with little business continuity between departments. Managers are not unified.  The hardest part of the job is working with other departments and pulling people in the same direction to accomplish a goal.The most enjoyable part of the job is using cutting edge science to solve some of the worst diseases. Salary and benefits are below the standards of other competitive Biotech and Pharmaceutical Companies.Work quality does not consistently achieve the standards expected.Management does not know how to communicate and does not respond to employee concerns, besides the fact that they do not follow policy by punishing employees for taking their designated breaks. Besides that, your eight hour a day shifts generally turn into twelve plus hour shifts, because you are not allowed to leave until everything is done.Always too much work and never enough people so overtime is expected.  Training is a bare minimum. Compliance is non existent so the place may be shut down after the next inspection. Management doesn't care as long as stuff gets done probably because people are getting paid off.Some days are hectic, some are relaxing; depending on the workload. I personally was working on many project simultaneously so my schedule was pretty busy. The workload is given to you is depended on your qualification and how you handle it. Overall it was fun time.It started out a fun place to work. As we became busier, turn around time became the focus. If we surpassed our goal, the got harder to reach. Management picks their favorites, if you are not one of them, sayonara. You've just become a tech with a bullseye on your back. High turnaround facility. I saw countless numbers of people quit or walked out. The benefits are fantastic and the pay is competitive. I loved the work. I miss the work, the benefits, and the pay. I wasn't a fan of the management. MANAGEMENT can MAKE or BREAK a great company. Phenomenal hard working people left because of management.WuXi is a growing company with many opportunities to learn new skills and get experience if you are willing to put in hard work.However they do tend to work people harder than you would typically see at big pharma, this is a good and a bad thing, while your experience and skills benefit, your work life balance can suffer.I worked as an Associate Sterility Laboratory Technician. The work isn't difficult it can just be cumbersome due to the extreme high turnover. I was there for a little over 6 months, and by the time I was left I was one of the most senior people. Management picks their favorites. The manager while I was there didn't care to make real improvements in the lab. Everyone is overworked and underpaid. They seem to understand and be quite ok with the fact that the people they hire don't stay long.The  technicians are fun to work with and they are good about following IACUC guidelines for animal care. However, they are very good about stringing contract employees along with ""open ended"" contracts providing no benefits and no job security.There is plenty of things to learn in different areas of the building and is located in the Twin Cities. There is a very thorough training program.For the money I made there I was happy but there was no management for my position, and the interpersonal relationships between employees was toxic. I tried to be a beacon of positive light and energy and as a result I was slandered by a coworker, which caused them to end my contract and not hire me on full time, even though I was promised on more than one occasion that I would be hired on full time. The job put too much responsibility on the staff and as a result we often had to stay longer than eight hours to do our jobs, and we did not take our paid breaks because we were too busy.  10-12 hour days were common for Animal Care staff. I was a tried and true team player who would come early, stay late and always stop what I was doing to help my coworkers, and as a result one of them went to my bosses boss and lied about me. When they fired me I called the whistle-blowers and after THREE WEEKS of waiting for a response the operator told me ""This line is for employees only, do NOT call here again."" I was not given a chance to solve any ""issues"" that had arisen, although I don't see how I caused any problems and I have wracked my brain over it. I was thrown out like a soiled diaper, not given a chance to explain. Before all this happened I told my boss that the person who later slandered me actually pulled me into the empty locker room and yelled at me until I broke down crying. Because she found out I talked to him, she decided to lie about me until I was fired. I did everything I could to show this person that I was her friend but all it got me was an inability to pay my bills.  more... I would tell people NOT to work for this company unless you enjoy working for a place where your boss is allowed to do nothing but check their facebook and ignore their crew. Working here has broken my heart and spirit.  lessA good place to learn many aspects of the pharmaceutical world from asking for batch records and documentation to manufacturing cancer cellular therapies. I was looking to get back into the pharmaceutical realm of science when I applied to this company and have learned a great deal since I have started. They are going through a large growth phase right now and have a hard time retaining employees due to a heavy workload with low pay for the industry (I took a pay cut to come here to get back into the pharmaceutical industry). Due to the large growth they are experiencing growing pains.All in all they are a good company, my experience has been extremely positive but I am ready to move on and find employment with more responsibility and regularity.I work in the Microbial Solutions division of WuXi AppTec and in a typical day, I run sterility cycles on medical devices and perform cleaning efficacy testing. I have learned much about the medical industry and microbial growth.The management at this company is poor, in my honest opinion and there is obvious favoritism show towards certain employees within my department by the department supervisor. This causes friction to build between co-workers and unfair treatment.The hardest part of the job is filing out paper work and the documentation, but the most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that, ultimately, you are saving lives.Great place to start, but not good enough to retire from. Suffers growing pains and revolving door of management and staff. Could treat employees better.A typical work day at alorica would be answering phones and enrolling people in there health , dental and visison benefits.Contract position because they did not have 2014 budget to hire full time.  Very tough communications, expectations.ok if you don't have plans after school.. Uncle sam is the way to goManagement has no plan for direction or growth other than own individual financial gainMy time at WuXi Apptec was brief (6 months) but I believe I had seen the worst it could offer. My department of 10 techs was turned over in that time, except for 2 testing techs. In other words, in a 6 month period, 8 of 10 people either left or were let go. This was due to poor management and lack of training/progression at work. Also factor in some manager's decisions to do things that enter a legal gray area, such as demanding unpaid overtime from contract techs. The only thing that made working here bearable were the other techs and some of the managers."
622,"Wyle Laboratories, Inc.","Great work environment and great for entry level IT. Not a lot of room for advancement unless you move over to the contract side. Several recent acquisitions.excellent place to work. worked there from Feb 2012 to Jul 2016.They treat the ex military very well there. Apply if you enjoy contract type work for Naval aircraft.Wyle Laboratories as a research group in acoustic no longer exists.  The company is out of business it was sold to a bunch of thieves that destroyed a great R&D group dedicated to acoustics.Wyle Labs is a hard working, get stuff done kind of contracting business. The department I worked in was fundamental and encouraging to see that places do shine in what they do!Wyle is overall a good company.  It's a typical contracting company.  With that being said, you're always dispensable.  The pay is so-so.Great Employer, Good benefits, Had fun working there. Had a great boss who made the job. All kinds of different products and testing.A typical day began with analyzing working aids and schedules to determine IT project deliverables due. This included managing and creating contracted IT deliverable reports due weekly, monthly, and quarterly; standard operating procedures (SOPs); and metrics. Overall, these documents numbered nearly 200 separate items which routinely needed editorial and formatting assistance. The position required coordination with other team members in person or through email communication. Company management was kept informed of progress and risk levels associated with late submission of documents/data from team members.To meet 508 compliance for documentation, Microsoft Word's Accessibility feature was studied and implemented.Strict organizational methodologies were necessary to ensure documentation successes for the customer.Unfortunately, I didn't feel like a part of a team. Management were sometimes unprofessional and non communication caused a delay with productivity.Very similar to my military experience. I served in the Marines with many of the people that I worked with at Wyle. Very flexible with military deployments and monthly military reserve requirements.Always trying to give their employees opportunities for growth and training. Paid very well and the culture was so much fun. I enjoyed coming to work each dayI was a part of a start-up operation and learned a lot about private industry following many years as a civil servant.  My skill set carried directly over from my govt service to this position and allowed me to be an asset to the management team.No direction and business process is non-existent. They do not provide work for you when your contract is up. Typical work day is not consistent and changes on an hourly basis.A typical day involved review of standardized documentation, so that didn't interest me anymore after awhile. I learned a lot about technology, which was great. Being a communications major, that wasn't something I was familiar with. Hardest part of the job was the management due to entire team being newly formed; however, it was good we were all hired around the same time. Most of my co-workers were the same age as me, so we made it a fun environment and socialized outside of work.Solid company to work for. Very professional work environment.  Flexible work hours. Weak benefits package.Enjoyed working on a new adventure for Wylie with  the Air Force.Lots of competitionMgrs hired friends and kept them safeNo training Co workers were not helpful at all to new hiresThe hardest part of the job was sharing an office with a disgruntled employeeThe best part of the job was the job itself and the Mgr before she retiredThe new Mgr took care of her ownLong days,coworkers were get to work with.Firing a 7 stage rocket held down by 4 inch diameter cables was awesome.Some folks with no HR, Supervisory Skills incharge, stressful supervisors, things going on against ethics- employee relations, etc rampant.  Supervisors engaged in coveringeach others backs.  Unprofessional.  HR not professional.   Alot of whether you were in the "" clicks"" or not.    Very unlike the larger companies who have an HR Departmentnot mingling and socializing outside work.In three years this company went from growth and multiple contracts to one contract from a customer whom they ignored. They followed that up with poor performance on the contract. On its way down.Some of the people are great and there are many interesting projects to become a part of.A typical day consisted of supporting manufacturing with test issues, improving existing test programs and writing new test programs.  This Wyle facility consisted of the merger of two companies and I learned that obtaining cooperation between the employees was no easy task.  Since I was new and my co-workers consisted of a blend of two companies, I was viewed as an outsider.  The hardest part of the job was getting employees to cooperate with one another.  Slowly, the employees began to work together, as a result of my efforts."
302,Xad,"A typical day would entail morning conversation over breakfast before work, then a hard working rest of the day. On break, we are served lunch. There is a different menu every day which contributes to the theme of variety in the office. Co-workers are down to earth, intelligent and driven individuals who work together to produce great results.hard work, low payvery common problem in this work place especially in finance and accounting fieldmanagement very strictfood is plentiful to make you work latecommute is difficult in this areaother positions out there are betterGreat company to work at, but will hire and fire employees very quickly if they are not meeting goals or a Cultural fit. Normal business hours of 9-5:30/6I wish I could say more about this company however there is nothing I could say that can describe my experience other than waste of time. Horrible VP of sales. He's so arrogant he doesn't even realize opportunities that slip through the crack because he thinks he's so smart. What a poser."
613,xentity corporation,"Great culture, benefits, and organizational setup! Professionally run, and great team! Easy contracting processes in place to manage your contracted time, work performance, assignments, and payment stubs."
666,Xerox,"Organization that values diversity but can be very slow and bureaucratic when it comes to making decisions. I worked with many good people during my career by continual downsizing has had impact on work environment.They treat you horrible and don't care what you have to say. They never see what good you are doing at your job, only what you're not doing. I couldn't work there anymore.I loved speaking with the various different people every day and the ability to help them. I loved the fast paced environment and co workers.  The hardest part was the mental fatigue of 4, 12 hour days.   LolAssisting customers with their technical support issuesLearning how to utilize the multiple computer screens daily Management team was okMy co workers were all over the place most of the timeHardest part was not being able to give the customer everything they wantThe employers were great created a very comfortable work environment, several incentive programs, and holidays were always fun, very casual, laid back place to work!I worked for Sprint under Xerox. Horrible, horrible horrible. They do not care about employees. Will fire you at the drop of a dime( highest turnover rate). When I resigned( was not fired), 2 months later they were closing the site. Didn't surprise me one bit.A typical work day is good. I learned how to give customers the satisfaction if they are irritated.My co-workers are helpful we all help each other and try too direct each other in the best direction.There really isn't a hard part on my job everything that I do, I try my best to make no mistake. If I make a mistake I learn from it and not dwell on it. Make sure it doesn't happen again.The most enjoyable part is De-escalating the caller on the other line.Xerox is a great place to work there are plenty of opportunities and advancement in the company . Definitely is a great place and has great balance between job and home lifeManagement is mismanaged, high turn overrate. High pace environment. But turn over rate is so high easy chance for advancement. Low pay rates for the amount of work that is asked of you.long hour that did not pay well enough for the amount of pressure that was put on me. the training did no adequately teach me how to perform well.Training is a pressurized joke and not complete.Will be thrown into cold water early stating ""need"" of people on the floor ... it's a ruse they do to everyone.Will not work with your scheduling needs and put pressure on your personal/family life for company purposes.Is willing to risk employee health & safety on the bad winter weather days in order to stay open!!!What enjoyed most was the flexibility in you schedule.  I was afforded the opportunity to work from home 2 days a week (Monday & Friday's, selected by the Director).I worked there for a year and a half very poor management You can ask a supervisor a question and they never know the answer. Stressful and drama environment all upper management talk about each other and complain about eacother to employees about work not getting done. They expect you to never ever  be a minute late ( like we can controle weather, highway crashes etc.) and never miss even if family emergencies.I would go in call center be sure all updates needed were posted and received calls to assist with Humana.  It was a different job culture for me I do not prefer working in call center environment.Let this be your last option/choice for a job. This job will leave you with no life, over worked and under paid. Management dont care about issues that may arrive in you life. You need to be at work when you are suppose to be there no matter what.Overall, Xerox is not a bad place to work. One of the biggest benefits is that you can work from home, saving a great deal of money on commuting, among other things. You also get paid-training, and get to be a part of a team generally filled with interesting individuals from all over the United States. Work is fast-paced, and there is never a dull moment.However, there are some glaring problems that stick out like a sore thumb:- Disconnect with management. From the upper management, down to our supervisors, down to our advisors, there is a terrible disconnect. Misinformation gets strewn around constantly, and at times it seems like our upper management team has no idea what actually goes on or how to fix certain problems (such as attendance).- Poor compensation. Base pay is excellent, starting around $10/hr, and you can qualify for RBC (results-based compensation). However, maintaining any significant level of RBC is nearly impossible, and how it works is not very apparent. Additionally, there are no raises for tenured employees. You could be there for 5 years, and still be making your starting pay.- Lack of opportunities for advancement. If you're looking for a place where you can grow as an individual, this may be the right job for you. But if you're looking for the opportunity to move up into a leadership position, this is not an excellent place to be. Lower performers tend to be promoted before the highest-performing employees, and its possible to have a top performer that's been there for 2 years still stuck in an advisor role while someone who has been  more... there for 3 months advances and moves up.  lessxerox has really good incentives and bonuses but if you have kids i wouldn't recommend it, the schedules are trash, the supervisors are lazy and the policies they have in place are a little to drastic. in training we were told the schedules go by attendance but that was a lie , i was there every day on time and still got a trashy schedule. i hated it there, and the distance i had to drive to get there was absolutely not worth it. if you do not have kids and your young i do suggest you apply because the money is the only thing good about the company, everything else,  i could honestly pass on.Company itself offers decent benefits. Hired us at a certain time as to not offer us holiday pay it was all a strategy they planned to hire tech support reps for the iPhone 7 release.I get to travel to different Xerox clients and work in a variety of industries at the client locations. I have also had permanent on site assignments.Attendance policy needs to be changed. Also needs to give further review to staffing as they are giving people days off for OT but not seeing shortagexerox is a great place to work. i enjoy everything about it from the actual facility itself. its beautiful not a uptight everybody stressed out environment like you would typically see in an corporate setting. even down to the management the supervisors and instructors are phenomenal."
667,Xerox Corporation,"Organization that values diversity but can be very slow and bureaucratic when it comes to making decisions. I worked with many good people during my career by continual downsizing has had impact on work environment.Most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with the people I support and fixing technical issues they have.Worst parts...Labor reductions at the lowest levels while upper management continues to create new management positions to alleviate their workload.  Tight spending controls.Outdated and out-of-service IT infrastructure.  Understaffed with few advancement opportunities.Underpaid by Xerox standards, grossly underpaid by State averages.Expensive/poor healthcareGood management, but a rather limited traditional work culture.  Business oriented, segmented work place.  The culture appeared fragmented.  Some areas/ divisions were singularly focused on narrow tasked based, goal oriented accomplishments, while others areas offered a more open environment. This was probably due to the old business genesis of the copier business.  However Xerox is known for their technical inventions.  They were the original creator of the window based graphical operating system made famous by apple and Micorsoft.  They invented the ""mouse"", as well as modern computer networking.  They are also know for having started more startups by former employee's than any other business.  Good people with unimaginative management.When I say 12 dollars, I mean it. That's all you will make. Unless you make friends with someone in management, then you can get some side deals where they add hours to your check. There is no advancement and no raises. It's almost impossible to get fired so everyone works (or doesn't work) as much as they want. People show up whenever they feel like it and everyone else has to suffer.If you are one of the few that believes in pulling your own weight, management will take advantage of you, and you will be pulling everyone else's weight too.You will be promised the moon and given nothing.Nepotism Trump's merit.It was the worst 10 months ever. I was mad everyday and it raised my blood pressure. I didnt enjoy working there. The management is a joke and turn around rate is outrageous. If they stop feeding the new hires pizza and donuts everyweek to cover up lies and deception that this place was a good place to work, maybe just maybe they could keep their other employees happy. Stop worrying about my starbucks cup on my desk and pay me more for the under appreciated work i am doing instead of worrying about petty things. Run a functional business and not this horrendous storm you call a business opportunity.A typical workday / call flow was moderate, I learned a lot about payroll and benefits. Management could have been a bit better about being knowledgeable and the co workers were great and helpful. The hardest part of the job was when the call flow increased and i still had other admin duties to attend. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers and co workers. There was no room for advancement; the were no raises or bonuses; management was not very knowledgeable; the attendance policy was not great; benefits could have been a lot better, and training was not good at all. Everything that you learn you had to learn on your own or through co workers.Xerox is a great place to work. They provide many benefits to enrich the work lives of employees. Company training is plentiful so that career advancement is possible. Expectations are set to allow employees to work toward specific goals and objectives. Performance issues are dealt with in a way that allow a struggling employee the change to correct the problem and management offers assistance. Pay is fair, employees are rewarded if the expectations are met or exceeded. Benefits are very good. A very professional and fair work environment.The work day is steady with filling customer orders, fixing paper jams, and stocking supplies. If you are a good worker who does above and beyond for customers, they will show more appreciation than my coworkers. I was an employee with Xerox a year and about to get a pay raise when they fired me for no reason. I learned later I got hired so a managers friend could work there. For this I can't recommend this company to anyone looking for job security or an advancement in their career.Xerox will hire anyone and they usually let the good ones walk. They do not give raises for any reason. They promise advancement in the company, yet can't make up their mind on what they are going to do. I've seen people go through training to get higher in the company and that training completely come to a halt. We get promised bonuses and commissions but never receive them. Management is usually of hiding in a bathroom or their vehicle or the break room and sometimes even in the back of the empty cubicles playing in their phones, of which aren't even allowed the floor. The stress caused by the company is far worse than that of what customers for Verizon could ever put us through.Xerox has a well rounded management staff and offers a level compensation package. While also proving to be an equal opportunity employer allowing employees to interview and relocate to other positions in the company.However the ability to receive raises in regards to knowledge and experience obtained is a short shot at best.Very poor management. Employees not accredited for their work. Harassing work environment. Overall, the job itself was enjoyable and interesting on a day to day basis, but management made the position not enjoyable at all. Management only focused on the negative portion of the job. Very little praise and/or credit was given to any employeeWorked there for 4 years for decent wage, other than that its one of the worst companies you can work for. The management is unprofessional and are incompetent. They have favorites and those can get away with anything. The rest are treated like dirt. They also seem to hire all the bottom feeders that no one else would hire, not even Walmart. Stay away if you can.Every morning we will do quality control on all bank levies. Once it hit 10 am, we will then start our deposits for all the banks. we send our checks electronically as an image cash letter to nine banks. when this is completed, we will then work on all reject checks and return it back to remitter. At the end of each day we will reconcile and balance into an excel spread sheet.I have worked for this company on two occasions and my expectation was higher the second time around. The company has a high attrition rate due to job dissatisfaction and low compensation.A typical day at work is very stressful because there are client and employee needs which requires undivided attention, so it make the work day extensive.I have learned about time management and had the best attendance rate for my team, which went unrecognized.The hardest part of the job is keeping everyone happy at the same time and the most enjoyable part of the job was training and coaching a great team to exceed expectations.Xerox values the contributions of it's employees. The listen and have good compensation; both monetary and nonmonetary.  The management team is great to work with on all levels.  The team atmosphere keeps everyone dedicated to their jobs and contributes to a very pleasant, yet stressful at times, environment.I came from a company that compensated their employees well. When I came here, I was shocked at the salary. After all, Xerox is a well known global company. I'm trying to give constructive criticism. I don't see how people or families survive on the salary. The pool time needs to be revamped. People need ample time off, come back to work & feel good about it. I hope someone from the company takes a look at pool time. I really enjoyed meeting & working with the people. My co-workers are great & helpful. Everyone is nice, including Management. If Xerox is going to make changes, they have to pay their employees and revamp their benefit package. Why should someone wait a whole year to get matched by the 401K Plan? I hope this helps!I've been working at the company from 2011 till 2016.  The upper management at Xerox seems interested in doing their best to sustain the workforce and came out with a Call Center of the Future model which included getting rid of desk phones and replacing them with Avaya software and improving the break room as well as installing large flat screen TV's on the call center floor.The best part of the job is building friendships with those you work with and being able to positively impact the lives of thousands of clients.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with an extremely high call volume during certain times of the year.  It is no fun getting back to back calls with no breaks in between calls and just being over-worked in general.If you are a high school graduate looking for your first job this is a good job for you. It has decent benefits and the pay is one dollar above Taco Bell. However, management is very unprofessional. It is extremely hard to promote. Its almost like being in high school again. The job demands are great and it can be frustrating being so worked with so little pay. No holidays off. I even had to work Christmas day without holiday pay. With over 500 employees one is easily recycled until the next individual comes along. Good for a first job, but definitely not a career.Very layed back easy work. Management has their days. Poor communication skills, and employee courtesy. Most employees are in their very early 20's and have a lack of work ethic. Hardest part of the job would probably be when the machine is not working correctly. They do not have many incentives. NO raises or any kind of employee appreciation except pizza delivered maybe once a month.It was chaotic, high turn over and most of management looked through you or at worse at you as a number not a person. High stress environment and don't expect them to remember who you are. When I left the company they screwed up on either A. sending the message along or B. Mistook me with another employee, as they had me marked down as having left 3 days after I actually quit. When I went for unemployment and the unemployment group called them, they DID mix me up with another employee and got my benefits denied as a result.The only good thing at the company was the pay was above average and the health insurance was good and not expensive.The DVP that I reported to as well as our RVP were to great leaders whom I learned a lot from because the kept feeding an employee who wanted to do more.   I managed business in 5 call centers, 4 US, 1 in Canada.  I also managed a global work force management team. I was reasonable for the budget creation and P&L of my client portfolio.  The only reason I left was at the time I had two young children at home and I was missing too much of their lives.  It was one of the toughest decisions I have had to make in my call center career."

335,Yahoo,"The most enjoyable part of the job was writing popular content.  Writing for the site allowed me to practice my writing skills.Lot of talented people and lot of fun loving environment.One of the early pioneer for open source community. Lot of new innovation and passion in the environmentThey try and pretend they are different, but it's just like working in any other call center environment.  It's all about how short your calls are, how many you take, and how well you can stick to a script.  The benefits are great, if you have to be stuck doing call center work.State of the art facilityco-workers are very helpfulteam environmentability to continue/further your careernegative: job was very redundant (not enough stimulation)Started off as a dream job but slowly (over the course of 3 years) turned south with layoffs and incompetent middle management who seemed less concerned with core Yahoo goals and beliefs.dealing with invoices and budget issues plus handling vendors and contracts, people attitude at Yahoo that I worked with on issues. lots of companies to deal with because Yahoo purchase 28 companies in one year with no process in place.Don't do it. Money is good. Team worker is terrible unless you like working for a dictator. One of the worst supervisor in industry. C Whitney. Turn over tells it all.Full of high energy and amazing team members. Fast paced environment. My managers were great. I still keep in touch with them.I've worked at Yahoo for my entire professional career.  I've seen the company grow from a fun start-up to a full fledged company.  Yahoo has worked to be a leader in the industry; however, there were many years where Yahoo did not provide a clear strategy externally.  This same lack of focus was evident internally as well, which impacted overall morale.The people at Yahoo are amazing, and the atmosphere is one of collaboration and involvement.  Yahoo does a great job in ensuring inclusiveness of all people, and the overall awareness of social issues and the world is encouraging.I get a media pass at San Diego Charger games and report over live radio what is and has happened in the game. I have learned how be a more productive speaker and getting to the exact key points of what is going in the game as I only have 1 minute to describe everything. getting everything summarized in a minute is the hardest part.Good Place to Work, great culture, waning market share.Focus on collaboration and team environment.Lots of perks, such as beer, offsites, games, etc.A little tense right now due to business conditions and the macro environment.Yahoo! has it all, great people great technology and projects to work on. The benefits are also awesome and they have a good work life balance. The free food is excellent, lots of choices, healthy and tasty.Yahoo! is a great company to work for.Great benefits and perks, the culture is awesome, and there's always lots to do.I would recommend this company to everyone!Amazing place to work if you don't mind a lottery style management system. The coworkers and work place was amazing, at least when I worked there, but hey lay offs and cut backs can diminish a place. I felt challenged on the job and successes were meaningful as you helped to turn businesses successful.Changing metrics turned it from an interesting place to work into a grindhouse.Metrics changed months after I was hired.The highest paid ""non-essential"" staff was let go.Help to support Yahoo customers via chat and email support only. We were doing phone support but that has been downsized.I worked as a contractor at Yahoo, and only for the amopunt of time that Yahoo limits for contractors. Because of my technical background I also got involved in creating pages for mobile search.Yahoo interviewed me for full-time employment because of my high productivity/output, it did not go through, however, because of the proximity in time to the lay-off in 2016 for which the people interviewing had no knowledge was going to happen.Work/Life balance leans much more on the Work side. Nearly everyone you work with is passionate about what they do and are supportive of each other. The people are what make the environment enjoyable.Typical day: Constant flow of requests for various design either pre-sales or post-sales that SHOULD have a one week turn around due date but have to be done in a day. Two at the most. A typical workload would be about 5 projects at the same time. Dealing with sales and tech AND the big client.management: All the designers are managers. Always begin a project with a kick off call; including the necessary team from other properties and verticals. From beginning til deliverable or launch date.hardest part: short deadlines or if the client isn't being fast in their responses and excess number of changes.enjoyable part: getting it done without a hitchWas a fantastic workplace for the first 3 years. The last year has been very depressing and seeing half the company get laid off was very disheartening. All so board members could take home a fatter paycheck.When I joined the company, there were great people, a ton of industry leading technology, and a sense of camaraderie as we tried to turn around an industry icon.Unfortunately, Yahoo never figured out its ""one thing"".  The one constant at the company was no product was ever finished.  Yahoo had a ""ship and forget"" mentality, and across all of the CEOs I worked for that never changed.Despite all of this, I really enjoyed my experience there.  It was a fantastic training ground for learning how to execute in challenging and dysfunctional environments.  Those product leaders who could work well with others, fight without ego, and drive towards a common goal were able to deliver despite everything else going on.Few other places offer the scale, impact and global reach of the products we worked on.  However, the past year has shown a significant, and fatal, decline in leadership, culture, and opportunity.Workplace with lot of opportunities to work on systems of large scale spanning several key areas. I had a chance to work with several intellectuals at this organization"
40,Yelp,"Too much time is spent attending to incidents or working around incidents from other teams. Many managers are new/first-time managers and lack the necessary skills to be effective at their jobs while others are handi-capped by the company's culture of super hands off management. Morale is generally poor-whatevs.Great company that sells a great product, but there's not many interesting positions to move up from entry-level.  Extensive sales training, and excellent benefits.Each day consists of a high volume of cold calls and emails sent out to SMB owners. Management varied, with some managers just one year out of the account executive role. Issues with that were panic when things weren't going well.Yelp is a great company. Employees are treated well with a fully stocked kitchen for breakfast and lunch, great health benefits, and great people. The pay is definitely on the lower side. The most negative aspect was the job itself. The day to day is strictly cold calling businesses to sell the advertising program. It can be very monotonous. Also many of the business owners are busy and do not want to speak to you. It's a hard job to find enjoyment in.I spent almost 2 years at Yelp. It's a rollercoaster. Full of great colleagues, awesome mentors, and a challenging job (but once you get the hang of it you'll pitch-on-the-fly and feel like a boss).You are responsible for the full sales cycle. From introduction to close. You will have difficult conversations about selling them Yelp ads with SMB prospects. It's challenging, but what you will also have a team, an organization, readily available for you to learn and execute with.I owe everything I know about my profession to this opportunity I got here.Thanks Yelp! :)Yelp is pretty cool.I would recommend it to someone if there was a job opening they were into.Great free snacks. Not so great compared to other companies in the area, but definitely above average. Beer! I've never liked hanging out at an office after hours before. I do that somewhat regularly here.Flexible Hours with the option to work from home when necessary.Sweet health benefits and they're pretty generous with stock even for us lowly user ops workers.Average good-ish time off/sick timeOverall company good about providing important updatesUnfortunately none of this is enough to make up for the crushing boredom that eventually sets in with moderating content. They tell you straight up when you start not to really expect this to go anywhere. It's kinda sad since we have a lot of talented, intelligent people on the team wasting their smarts. I can feel myself getting dumber from all the terrible punctuation and block paragraphs that I have to read all day long. Go on though, do it a year or two and then move along. It's a great job as one of your first out of college. You don't have to wear real clothes or show up at a specific time and that's all real real nice.""Fun"" environment for the most part. Though in our particular department there is a lot of forced fun that really gets irritating for a cynic like me. It's kinda silly since they actually advertise the position as being for introverts. It's a little tone deaf. Like the time they had us spin some Harry Potter sorting hat for assigned seats at lunch. Yep... actual adults arranged that forced  more... mingling situation with a group full of introverts. They also recently instituted music on Friday afternoons and it is the worst. There are a lot of management things that make the job really stressful. But I think I mostly just get petty and mad because I am so so bored. You'll have fun for a while doing this job probably. But it really does show you a bad side of humanity. There are some awful opinions that I was not used to coming across. That can be tough. But it's nothing awful like if you were moderating beheadings content for that popular video upload website.  less70+ outbound cold calls daily to SMB's in a assigned territory. Setting 15-20 minute appointments with clients to discuss and pitch the Yelp platform. These BO's already have Yelp pages that most likely have traffic to that listing. Pitch and close the prospects. Get to quota, make some decent cash. However, you must follow the process and be a quick learner. It's easy to fall into habits and not grind it out. Stand up. Take each call with a clean slate, but don't be afraid to mess up and quickly try out a new method again.  Yelp can be a great place for a couple years, but it's a daily grind and not for the weak minded.Great company to work for with a startup culture. Interacted with my peer on a daily basis to create a strategy to bring in sales for the online food ordering application.Similar to plenty of other reviews I have read, tons of kids fresh out of college who have no idea that there ARE better options out there. They lure you in with all the free food and music and games and stuff but dont tell you about the cold calling and if you dont hit these metrics on the head then you will be shown the door. Managers may ""act"" like they care about you or your home life but at the end of the day you are just a number. training structure is way out of order. They throw you to the wolves the second week on the job and then give you information in a training 2-3 weeks later that would have increased your odds of getting a appointment/sale. Lots of tasks to accomplish on a daily basis but not enough time to complete them all and then you are hit with the no excuses card when you are not pulling your weight. On the flip side, fantastic place to work, free food all day, game rooms and music, lots of stuff nearby.Great for younger kids with no responsibilities!!One of my favorite parts about my work day is that each day is unpredictable. I never know who I am going to talk to and as a result, I get to learn about so many unique and interesting businesses, people and meet a lot of entrepreneurs that educate me, too.The best perk is definitely the people and culture… and I suppose our brand new office with shuffleboard, ping pong and Rock Band. But truly, I get to work side by side with amazing, talented people every day.Yelp is a fun place to work with a youthful environment.  Through a combination of hard work and getting a good territory you have an opportunity to be very successful.No one likes cold-calling, but that's what you're going to be doing every day. Yes, you get the freedom to churn the whole sales process from open calling to closing, but managing that while handling objections is a tough sell. Co-workers are friendly, and management could be held to another standard. Hard to differentiate managers as friend or micromanaging sticklers, because people move up quick in this job. It can be very emotionally draining and dry, so mentality is everything in this job.I am given tools to be my own boss and impact my own small business. I am also able to change businesses in a positive light. Every work day was an extremely exciting opportunity.I used Yelp and the opportunities they had to further my experience in an office setting. Although the floor was noisy, we got a lot of work done!This company is laid back and very little stress as far as the Eat24 department goes. I mean super laid back...people were drinking on they're shift, smoking pot on lunch and a fist fight erupted one day. The floor managers show favoritism to the people in they're clique. If your looking for a career this is not the place to advance. If your fresh out of high school and just looking to pay your phone bill and money to blow on random stuff this place is your ideal job. The pay is minimum wage. In my personal experience it was not a company that I could advance in because there were no core values set by the employer and no advancement opportunities to further my career within the company. It does though have fully stocked kitches with every drink and snack you can imagine and the 7th floor has baristas that serve several different beverages for free along with fully stocked kitchen to make your own sandwiches. Very beautiful building in the financial/shopping district.I remembered being excited for the chance to find a job at ""Yelp"" in the heart of downtown San Francisco. Boy did I delude myself, Firstly this company (Yelp EAT24) feels so separate from Yelp its insane. I receive questions about Yelp that I have no idea how to answer since its a separate entity. Secondly I work in a glorified call center, it might have a fancy title and ""cool benefits"" like beer on tap, and free snacks, but all I do daily is apologize to people and tell them their food is on the way. Plus I work nights so they ""perks"" don't apply to me as I never have the chance to get beer. It so sad that someone with a college degree and three majors cannot find a better job and that HR cannot find a better fit for me. Lastly, and the most disheartening part is I was told it would be about a year to transfer to Yelp proper. Are you serious??? I have to take a year of working from 3 PM to 11:30 PM while simultaneously giving up my nights and weekends for a little over minimum wage. I applaud anyone that has lasted in this position because I feel myself dying a little more inside every time I clock in to start working.I applied to intern at Yelp and they ruined my summer. They kept me waiting for two whopping months and now it really made me mad. They have no respect towards low income students who are trying to support a family. The people who are in charge of HR need to be clear and not act childish when picking who should get an intern position. Good thing is that their office is laid back and happy.The fun atmosphere with music, ping pong and common chatting with other employees has made Yelps culture fun. The managers are super hands on in trying to help out to ensure the growth of each employee.start at 730 get yelled at by manager. Start cold calling, anytime you get up you get yelled at by manager to get back on phone. Make to many calls get yelled at again, make to little yelled at. Micromanaged and were put on kid teams (my team name was the queen bees).This is my first sale job and overall experience has been positive.You will go into training and be expected to learn and implement feedback. With each month that goes by the expectations will go up. It will seem fun in the beginning with the games, free coffee, open cafeteria, and a keg for after hours but it gets old and you just want to go home and relax. You will dial 70 + call a day and be expected to hit 2.50 hours talk time. The job can be high stress at times and if you close a deal directors, managers, and other people will cheer your wins. At times if your not closing it can feel disappointing and you feel forgotten and question if this is the job for you. Going into this job you have to have a thick skin, implement feedback, work hard, adjust to things that might not go your way because this is sales.Typical day is about 9-10 hours with an hour lunch break. If you want to be successful you have to put some extra time into the job. Managers are great and the sales curriculum is top notch. Honestly love the company, but cold calling 65+ times a day can become taxing."

Good thing is that their office is laid back and happy.Simply put, I love working at Yelp. The training is unparalleled, and the people are amazing. There are several upper level sales opportunities that have clear paths to get to. Unlike many other sales positions, it is unclear how to get promoted, however it seems as though all managers' goals are to get their reps promoted.The recipe to success at this company is simple: work hard, be the obvious choice, and be a team player.  The hardest part of this job is the work itself, however Yelp is quite clear about what our average level of work is. Cold-calling is never easy, especially when dealing with small business owners, however there are several tools at our fingertips to improve our sales acumen. As long as your goal (as a sales rep) is to genuinely help a small business, there is no reason why you wouldn't succeed. All in all, would highly recommend. This is one of the few companies that allows college grads to develop a lifelong career with some hard work and dedication to the role.Great company to work for with a startup culture.

However, the culture of the company and those you work with are great! Really great place for people in their twenties but not a long term career path for many. Free food all day was nice. They pay for your gym membership and great health care benefits.Very fun culture, they hire well! Would not suggest taking a sales position at Yelp if you have extensive sales experience. You will be paid the same as someone with limited sales experience.Great company that sells a great product, but there's not many interesting positions to move up from entry-level.  Extensive sales training, and excellent benefits.Yelp is a great company to work for during your first year out of college, but beyond that I wouldn't recommend investing in a company that doesn't necessarily invest enough in their own employees.Yelp is pretty cool.I would recommend it to someone if there was a job opening they were into.Great free snacks. Not so great compared to other companies in the area, but definitely above average. Beer! I've never liked hanging out at an office after hours before. I do that somewhat regularly here.Flexible Hours with the option to work from home when necessary.Sweet health benefits and they're pretty generous with stock even for us lowly user ops workers.Average good-ish time off/sick timeOverall company good about providing important updatesUnfortunately none of this is enough to make up for the crushing boredom that eventually sets in with moderating content. They tell you straight up when you start not to really expect this to go anywhere. It's kinda sad since we have a lot of talented, intelligent people on the team wasting their smarts. I can feel myself getting dumber from all the terrible punctuation and block paragraphs that I have to read all day long. Go on though, do it a year or two and then move along. It's a great job as one of your first out of college. You don't have to wear real clothes or show up at a specific time and that's all real real nice.""Fun"" environment for the most part. Though in our particular department there is a lot of forced fun that really gets irritating for a cynic like me. It's kinda silly since they actually advertise the position as being for introverts. It's a little tone deaf. Like the time they had us spin some Harry Potter sorting hat for assigned seats at lunch. Yep... actual adults arranged that forced  more... mingling situation with a group full of introverts. They also recently instituted music on Friday afternoons and it is the worst. There are a lot of management things that make the job really stressful. But I think I mostly just get petty and mad because I am so so bored. You'll have fun for a while doing this job probably. But it really does show you a bad side of humanity. There are some awful opinions that I was not used to coming across. That can be tough. But it's nothing awful like if you were moderating beheadings content for that popular video upload website.  lessYelp is a great company and I am lucky to have experience working at Yelp. The account executive role in sales is very competitive. You make a high number of sales calls per day, trying to sell advertising packages to small, local businesses. You must be able to consult and engage with, educate, and successfully sell Yelp advertising to business owners, who may be unwilling to speak to you on the phone or reply any emails or voicemails. You must know how to quickly think on your feet, and recommend products quickly to suit client needs by handling the different objections that they will throw at you. Good for working towards goals, talking to people all day long, and if you have a passion for small local businesses.This is my first sale job and overall experience has been positive.You will go into training and be expected to learn and implement feedback. With each month that goes by the expectations will go up. It will seem fun in the beginning with the games, free coffee, open cafeteria, and a keg for after hours but it gets old and you just want to go home and relax. You will dial 70 + call a day and be expected to hit 2.50 hours talk time. The job can be high stress at times and if you close a deal directors, managers, and other people will cheer your wins. At times if your not closing it can feel disappointing and you feel forgotten and question if this is the job for you. Going into this job you have to have a thick skin, implement feedback, work hard, adjust to things that might not go your way because this is sales.Yelp is great for entry level professionals who wants to learn sales and account management.  They have an awesome training program.  However, the competitiveness and frat mentality may not be for everyone.No one likes cold-calling, but that's what you're going to be doing every day. Yes, you get the freedom to churn the whole sales process from open calling to closing, but managing that while handling objections is a tough sell. Co-workers are friendly, and management could be held to another standard. Hard to differentiate managers as friend or micromanaging sticklers, because people move up quick in this job. It can be very emotionally draining and dry, so mentality is everything in this job.Similar to plenty of other reviews I have read, tons of kids fresh out of college who have no idea that there ARE better options out there. They lure you in with all the free food and music and games and stuff but dont tell you about the cold calling and if you dont hit these metrics on the head then you will be shown the door. Managers may ""act"" like they care about you or your home life but at the end of the day you are just a number. training structure is way out of order. They throw you to the wolves the second week on the job and then give you information in a training 2-3 weeks later that would have increased your odds of getting a appointment/sale. Lots of tasks to accomplish on a daily basis but not enough time to complete them all and then you are hit with the no excuses card when you are not pulling your weight. On the flip side, fantastic place to work, free food all day, game rooms and music, lots of stuff nearby.Great for younger kids with no responsibilities!!The culture at Yelp is great. Lots of perks in the office and usually everyone is cool. But managers tend to breathe down your neck and instead of working with you to get better they just tell you that you better work harder. There is no acknowledging that bad days happen - instead it's 100% you for not working hard enough.One of my favorite parts about my work day is that each day is unpredictable. I never know who I am going to talk to and as a result, I get to learn about so many unique and interesting businesses, people and meet a lot of entrepreneurs that educate me, too.The best perk is definitely the people and culture… and I suppose our brand new office with shuffleboard, ping pong and Rock Band. But truly, I get to work side by side with amazing, talented people every day.I spent almost 2 years at Yelp. It's a rollercoaster. Full of great colleagues, awesome mentors, and a challenging job (but once you get the hang of it you'll pitch-on-the-fly and feel like a boss).You are responsible for the full sales cycle. From introduction to close. You will have difficult conversations about selling them Yelp ads with SMB prospects. It's challenging, but what you will also have a team, an organization, readily available for you to learn and execute with.I owe everything I know about my profession to this opportunity I got here.Thanks Yelp! :)"
167,Yoh,"Working in a team setting with great people. Where everyone is there to help when there is a hard deadline to meet. I enjoy speaking with and helping clients from across the country while learning new skills to improve productivity.Great company that placed me with GF to work for. Challenging and rewarding! Learned so much in a year and the role really kept me challenged. HR dept. was supportive and overall a great team to work with. Would recommend this company to work for. Overall great culture and values!I had the best recruiter and they pay well. What you see is what you get with them! I just wish they had more opportunities in my area! They are professional but down to earth.Had a great experience with Yoh and would definitely work with Yoh in the future.  There are established and have good relations with the facilities the assist.Great company, terrible clients, no control over MSP. I enjoyed working virtua/remote, not all roles are this way. The major concern was the quality of our clientsA fulfilling day at work that involves challenges & accomplishments; learning from co-workers and being a team player, with a management look up to. The most enjoyable part of the day is the entire day. I learned something new every day and had a strong sense of purpose.•	Performed ELISA technique by using plates coated with contaminant proteins in toxoid preparation in order to indicate if the antibodies to contaminants were responsible for the discrepancy •	Maintained impeccable standards in chemical inventories, safely disposing of waste and accurately calibrating laboratory equipmentDuring my time with Yoh services I was able to learn the proper procedures and methods of a pc deployment project and I was also able to learn basic pc troubleshooting skills.Extensive Corporate Organizational Transition Process to provide an accurate response. The Management Team was also undergoing a major transition process which filtered to the new employees. The communication from the Executive Team to the team members was lacking and much to be desired.I was a Recruiter at Yoh for a little over 3 years.  During my tenure the company had difficulties paying contractors on time, answering contractor questions, or generally running back office operations.  There is little advancement opportunities.  It is nearly impossible to make the Incentive Trip for producers.  Yoh is unable to recruit good talent and after 3 years I know why.they have allowed me to work with benefits. It's nice to have an Human resources, information technology, payroll and all other administrative type of people/representatives available and with separate and individually listed easy to find phone nos.this job was exactly what I was hoping it was going to be, I loved this job. we were working on prototypes and conducting experimentsA typical contract company, poor management, lack of integrity, long work hours, and no raises for one whole year or Per Diem when other contract companies were providing it.They supply good income and a steady employment. If you have an issue they will help you. They also provide good benefits such as medical benefits.Good place to work. Management responds to contact with the employee. Diverse employment market. Easy to communicate with. I liked working for them.YOH is the only contract company that has ever allowed job security including benefits and vacation time.  I would highly recommend.This temporary opportunity came at a good time. It was an absolutely wonderful job which I enjoyed. There were no benefits due to the temporary nature but otherwise, I would highly recommend this company to anyone looking for a high quality job.The HR department constantly requested and then finally SENT my Social Security Number in plain text over the internet.I cannot imagine a company not knowing better then this. Have they never even seen a TV commercial?Just imagine, people from this company setting up computers for clients?As a contracting company, Yoh made the process simple and easy to navigate. The on-boarding process was flawless, and their management staff was pleasant to work with.Staffing recruiters are professional and helpful, responding via email to questions and concerns in good time. Allows for the option of a flexible work schedule.Good pay. Does not offer health insurance. Don't get aid time off until you have been there 1 year. They do offer a pretty good 401"
97,YuMe,"Great work-life balance, intelligent leaders, good learning environment, and room for advancement. Although the company is IPO'd they still act like a small company with room growth and experimenting outside current role.Exciting and evolving industry. Work environment is productive and collaborative and there are interesting and challenging problems to solve.Community Development serving the overall quality of life for all. "
556,Zachary Piper LLC,"They were an amazing management team and would assist with any issues or concerns I had while I was a consultant with them. I would have preferred at times they were more proactive, I found out information from the firm I was consulting for sometimes."
67,ZestFinance,"Can't find a better startup in fintech space, started by ex Google CIO Douglas Merrill, everything you'd expect and moreSelf paced, little to no micro managing, close group, flexible schedules, great compensation, excellent benefits."
46,Zillow,"Zillow is a great place to call home. I worked for two years for this company as they kept buying the companies I was working for.Great culture and would encourage anyone to apply.Benefits are amazing, but there is not a lot of room to grow. Management does not try and help your personal growth and development.A Non-Sales Viewpoint:ZIllow has a great culture and is full of amazing and intelligent people.  If you want to work in a tech job with great work/life balance, amazing  benefits, while surrounded by smart people, you should work at Zillow.Hardest Part:  The technical challenges.  I think this should be the hardest part, because you aren't learning anything otherwise.Most Enjoyable:  Free lunches, co-workers, solving challenging problems.ps- The CEO is awesome, everyone loves him!!If you like competitive enviornments, sell or be fired, this company is for you. Jump in, and be ready for a cut-throat, dog eat dog world. The CEO is awesome!Amazing company to work for. Great hours with a fantastic work/ life balance. The people are amazing, everyone is friendly and actually happy to be at work.Trulia/Zillow was an amazing startup, with a great culture at first.As Zillow bought it and changed the dynamic, the culture started to resemble a corporate entity more.Many employees unhappy and made for a non positive atmosphere.  The benefits were by far the best of any company I have worked for.The job exposes you to a great company and bright co-workers and management. I do feel it is a bit of a treadmill type job. It's an open floor environment with heavy sales pressure. Its long days.It teaches and requires strong work ethic and thick skin.Job does have a high turn over and Zillow is OK with that because they are looking for the top 10% in sales. Any day could be your last. No big sense of job security.However, I do like the cheering and support from co-workers and the ability to learn from talented co-workers.This a perfect job for out of college but not necessarily a good long term job in inside sales. Burnout without a year.Pushes you to your daily limit. It's telemarketing and a stepping stone for something better.This is not the place for negative nellys or worry warts! If you are proned to doubt and fear, SALES in general is not a good fit.So There are some annoyingly competitive and negative ppl that work or have worked at zillow but they never last.The high turn over is due to the fact that at zillow you are given a lot of free and fun stuff but alot of work is required of you. If you have bad energy and hate to work hard this is not the job for you. The cream of the crop reps and management are awesome. Genuinely good ppl. Benefits are the best I have ever had and I have had GREAT benefits before. Also I love the entreprenuerial atmosphere and how you get paid large commission checks and bonuses for helping Agents make lots of money. I love getting calls from clients who follow protocol and cash big checks from zillow.Looking for a good career? Love Sales? Zillow is the a great option.Zillow is a great environment and company to work for. The CEO is always involved making it more personable and excited to work.Excellent work environment & culture.  Benefits are amazing with a fantastic management staff.  Your income is based on your abilities to operate your own business.Zillow is a company with an amazing culture that really knows how to reward and create incentive for its employees. Management is very good at what they do and help push you to new limits. The nature of inside sales however is very tough to say the least and incredibly challenging every day.If this is absolutely your last option take it.  Terrible managment, training and culture.  You'll see plenty of cool aid drinkers who review Zillow but frankly don't know any better. Do yourself a favor and keep looking.Move fast, make a lot of calls, culture is good, talented managment team,No strategic planningNo directionNo collaborationDiscouraged from seeking guidancesalary average, nice office, fun people.show me how many character is enough for me to be able to hit continue button. is this enough???great company but management and Hr are lack some professionilism. 80-100 cold calls dailyniche product, your only selling to real estate agents great trainingparty atmosphere, loudA typical day consists of at least 200 minutes of talk time and/or at least 200 dials to prospective Real Estate agents. Employees are encouraged to work 10-12 hours a day and stay until they either hit talk time or book deals to get to their quota. The training program is really full of information about real estate, salesforce, the Zillow Way, Realtors, etc. It is quite intense. The management is very performance focused, but (some) do what they can to help the employees succeed. The hardest part of the job is keeping high energy and a focused/good attitude dial after dial, especially when (and this is most often the case) the previous realtor just hung up on you. The best part of the job is seeing your agents have great success with the program.Zillow is a place where you are surrounded by intelligent motivated people and a great environment to come to work every day.  Zillow does not just pay lip service to the importance of culture and the management is continually looking for better ways to serve it's employees.  The best part of coming to work every day was knowing that I was selling something that would make a difference in the business of my customers and Zillow allowed me to run my business within the business.-Made a significant amount of calls to obtain new business-Over worked/ Under-paid-Management was not helpful in key situationsThe interview process with this company is really suspect in my opinion.  I come from a serious Real Estate Advertising background,  and this is what Zillow claims to do as a business,  but did not get a serious look.  Actually could have delivered large accounts to them with my expertise,  but just had the general human resources interview (which was the only good part about this company) and then a stock ""people more qualified"" rejection notice.  I do not know anyone more qualified then me for the sales position.  Stay away from this place."
789,Zoetis,"Everyone is very welcoming and nice. However the departments don't exactly get along very well. Great learning environment and management is extremely nice and helpful.I highly recommend the internship program at Zoetis.The engineers you work with over the summer are heavily involved in the recruitment process which is really nice. They are willing to work with non-traditional engineering backgrounds, as they did in my case.Many of the engineers/designers/scientists that work here are willing to set aside their time to talk about their projects and share their expertise. I was heavily involved in 2 - 3 projects over the 3 month I was here.Organized chaos.  Not well run by management and company cannot deliver certain goods in a timely manner that meets the clients needs.I was to maintain a fully operational unit, reaching all my production rates. Keep hourly checks on my product and machines while maintaining a clean unit.Becoming a Zoetis colleague was very beneficial for me. I learned a lot more skills that helped me expand my knowledge and opportunities.I had a great manager and very nice team of the department.Time is very flexible; everybody treated as a responsible adult.No micromanagement.Nice work environment.Company is constantly buy some other businesses so everybody's position is not very stable; nobody knows what will happens next.It was Challenging It was More learningIt was Good to have big teamWe had good time, share.We were give good facilities which cannot be compared with other companiesPoorly managed team where training and advancement require a person to suck up to the supervisor. Highly stressful and lots of favoritism shown. Back stabbing environment.Very good place to work.  Nice and friendly staff, and plenty of advancement opportunities.  Month meetings really kept everyone updated and on point.  I wouldn't change anything about this company.Excellent culture and environment, great place to work and grow with the company.  Largest Animal Health company which has its benefits and downside.As a contingent worker, you will hate this place. They offer nothing of benefit. They will dangle a golden carrot in front of you and yank it away as soon as you think progress in your career is being made. Chances of getting hired in as a temp are slim to none. Good luck.This could have been a good company but inept management --all imports from Pfizer---has led it to become a seemingly inevitable takeover target.  The culture has been decimated after the recent 20% cut in the workforce.  Not a good place to work!Looking for a new opprotunity as lay offs are occurring again for the millionth time  it's an unstable place to be currentlyNice and Very helpful people.Management is great-very understanding and open to ideas.Positive environment to grow.Pay is good too.this is a good place to work but there is little chance of advancing in the company.  As of right now they only hire temps. good clean facility.Directing the movement of data across multiple systems and small project management. Validation of DEA licensing for fraud and accurate data information before submission of shipping pharmaceuticals to office.Majority of the co-workers are very kind but there is a significant amount that love to ruin other's days. The people that are above you can do no wrong and you are always at fault.Not enough space, lazy workers that complain all day as opposed to working while others actually work. But they are nice and the supervisors are very understanding and supportive of the team.Processing and packaging pharmaceuticals for livestock and Veterinarians with outdated equipment. Safety is not a concern from my experience, rarely saw management (beginning of the day and maybe the end of the day) 12 hour shifts 6am to 6pm. Co workers had no sense of safety in the area we were assigned to. The hardest part at times was performing maintenance on the regularly failing mill operations Leaving for the day was the most enjoyable part of the day.They are passionate about providing the best product to their customers and truly engender a team mentality.  This is a very good company to work for.Zoetis is a very family friendly workplace.  As long as you get your work done, management is very flexible with colleagues' schedule and supportive of colleagues having a good life outside of the office."

Also you should be prepared for no clear direction from management, and ineffective training/tools to do the job.  Every decision made is for the company to save money at expense of employees, Job responsibilities are piled on with ineffective compensation. Very little in terms of recognition. Policies not clearly defined.   PTO accrues but if you are let go it isn't paid out.  Hides behind being a ""start-up"" business.  Management lacks clear direction. Management is also very corporate in their attitude towards employees and severely lacks emotional intelligence.  If you enjoy being very nervous and uneasy while you work, then this is the place for you.Fun Place With Good Benefits. If You Like Computers, You Will Like This Job. Not A Lot Of Chance To Advance.

As an emerging leader in the e-commerce industry, they valued innovation and taking risks.  As a supervisor in the studio, I learned a lot about maximizing creative talent in a corporate environment.  The hardest part of the job was also the funnest part of the job: a very fast-paced environment that kept me on my toes for 2 years.  I would recommend this as a place to work for anyone looking to build their creative portfolio.nice warehouse,  mostly nice peoplethe pay was fair, and work was fair, for the pay except maybe during just a couple days in the holidays when they over rush you and quotas got to be to highI arrive at work about 30 minutes before I clock in, to prepare for the day.  I was always taught to be early and prepare for the day. After clocking in I check the board in my assigned department and see where I am working for that particular day.  I am knowledgeable in all areas of the warehouse, so I go where I am needed.  I train new employees, to go and research items from vendors who send us items that need to be verified, ex. match the picture, and are what they say they are.Everyone at Zulily was very pleasant and willing to help. Everyone worked together as a team to resolve any unsolved answers or concerns. As a International Support Specialist, I assist international  customers with placing, tracking, returning or canceling orders. The goal is to do whatever makes its right for the customer, allowing flexible resolutions.The company is good in general but one can easily observe poor management and coordination. In most cases they are task oriented with little or no concern for the general safety and choices of the workers.Fun place to work but it takes alot out of a person. They take care of the employees and it's a very fun job if you can handle it. Peak will be fun. Good company.I have a chance to help customers all over the world. I have learned an appreciation for retail, sales, postal service and working hard as a team. The hardest part of the job was which of the many offers to give. The most enjoyable part was knowing that I could help and think outside of the box to give the customer great service.Receiving, picking/packing, and shipping. zulily is a retailer obsessed with bringing moms special finds every day—all at incredible prices. zulily is fast-paced, data-driven and down to earth company with unique and challenging tech problems to solveI see Zulily like a baby Amazon.Because it is a baby Amazon for babies, kids, and moms. But now its becoming more and more a bit of everything anyway, I say its good to start off because they will hire almost anyone but also fire almost anyone too. If you work hard you will get far, and if you do poor than you won't have much luck. This was my first warehouse job and I got to know all the stations and all functions really got to know how well a warehouse really works. Management was a problem, there was lack of communication and we would in trouble for things one manager told us to do while the other manager didn't want us to do that certain task. It was odd sometimes but overall a warehouse is a warehouse. And I made good money.zulily is a growing company with strong leadership truly focused on doing what is right for the customers and employees.

391,Zurich Insurance,"I had to play ""catch-up"" for a new branch of Zurich North America:  Environmental Insurance.  The team I had been assigned to (via Spherion) had relocated from Atlanta to establish the Boston branch.  I used my skills from previous assignments to reconcile their database of applicants for insurance.Its an alright place to work. Benefits are good and pay is ok. If you have any insurance experience it will be pretty boring. Days are mundane and not very stimulating. Management is helpful but you shouldnt need them much except on unusual claims. Advancement is possible but you have to wait a year to apply and have manager approval. Easiest job ive had and i cant wait to move to a different position or change companies. Apply to be an underwriter or adjuster first if you can, otherwise youll be stuck for a year when you're qualified for a better position. A lot of people have been there for a while which is cool for them but it's just a place im passing through.I was excited about working at Zurich however quickly I became concerned about job retention. The person who had been in my new position for 4 years prior to my hiring had not performed well. High dollar claims had come in for years which was certainly due, at least in part, due to this person's low job performance. Sure enough, after only 2 years with the company, the claims were so high that I lost my job as part of the 8,000 massive layoff in 3/2016. In addition, it was problematic to me that long term managers who were neglectful of watching the bottom line were all retained while those of us who were high level performers were all let go.Don't fall into the trap at Zurich. It was once a profitable company but they have years and years to go before they can re-establish their once respectable reputation.The position and culture is fantastic until you realize that not all employees are created equal.  I witnessed multiple employees fired for no reason, even with superb performance.  No questions asked.  Terrible for security and advancement, you begin to worry about your position almost daily regardless of how well you perform.  Work environment is hostile and management is corrupt with power, doing what they please without any over-site from the executive team, and when any ""issues"" come to light the management is protected.Large insurance company, several offices around the US, global presence therefore has the pros of a large company and follows work life balance as industry norm.I enjoyed my time with Zurich.  It was a wonderful company to work for and I truly enjoyed working with all the people on the job.  I worked very hard supporting two attorneys handling Workers' Compensation matters.  Zurich truly cared about its employees.  The company provided good benefits and did all they could to make sure the employees were happy.  I truly enjoyed going into work every day because the people I worked with became like family.The salary is lacking and the health benefits are terrible and there is not a lot of room for advancement unless you want to move out of state. Over all I enjoyed my experience and learned a lot about the insurance industry.I worked with a highly qualified and diverse group of co-workers. The management of the company was highly qualified and had a significant work ethic. The company was highly thought of in the insurance industry worldwide. It was employee focussed and had significant benefits. A number of employees worked there for their full careers.Met and worked with a lot of hard working, talented, and smart people.  Above average salary, but if you are not in your seat, you are not working.  Management does not have the trust of the employees.  Managers say one thing and do another.  No trust, no guidance, and a very ""take care of yourself"" mentality when it comes to upper management.  They do not have the best interest of their employees in mind.  Great people to work with, not so much to work for.  Go thru layoffs every 3 to 4 years, so beware!A nice place to work. Typical day is research and administration; Presenting reports to other departments. Departments that work together on a daily basis do not have common goals, which can be problematic.Good company, culture, friendly environment, decent work-life balance, good benefits, competitive pay, knowledgeable leaders, values diversity, positioning for profitable growthHandle all casualty claims start to finish. Take in new claims review Coverage in detail to make sure no issues. If Issues attempt to resolve or issue reservation of rights or denial if needed.  If coverage is resolved then go into investigations speak with Insured and all parties on insured side who have knowledge of the claim get full description.  Call claimant and any witnesses.  If claimant is representatives call them. review any unusual issues with management or refer to SIU. I work independently.  I evaluate and resolve cases to conclusion with in authority limits and keep the insured informed of the claim. I assist co-workers and mentor younger ones in how to approach certain aspects. I handle all types of litigation.  I have good rapport with my Defense counsel and Plaintiff counsel. The most enjoyable part of my job when I resolve aged pending cases or I am able to obtain a Defense verdict on cases we agree to take through to trial/Due to the current management of expenses, yet initiative for profitable growth, we have seen out resources become a bit stretched, although we are doing the best we can with the current environment. The push for reduction of expenses is not a trait specific to my company or even my industry, in 2016 we have seen a push for expense reduction like no other.Corporate environment with global consideration for less fortunate and environment.  Upper management excellent but goals change from year to year causing confusion and redundancy.My job skills weren't being used for the experience I have. I was hired with the promise that Zurich would be taking on new clients in large industries such as Paper Mills, Oil and Gas industries and Co Gin plants. Never happened. great co workers willing to help one another out.The company itself is very stable, offers many potential opportunities, and generous compensation. Senior management in my region was very supportive of career development. However, team managers, who you deal with on a much regular basis, absolutely leave much to be desired - problems with lack of interest, excessive case loads, ignoring submitted closings, and internally promoted managers not recognizing that they are now a member of management and acting accordingly versus acting like they were still a front line employee.Also, despite senior managements support of career development, actually being able to branch out into other areas of the company are limited by preferential treatment and arbitrary hiring policies (ie: not being able to switch roles within a year of receiving a title bump).End of the day, it's another job in claims, nothing more.I really enjoyed working for Zurich.  I was treated with respect and always in a timely manor with professionalism.  I really enjoyed working with Dawn Kondratowicz.  She is an awesome insurance adjuster.  She was very helpful and a pleasure to work for.Typical day was doing search for new claims, contacting insured, documenting file and preparing file for next course of action.  Manager was awesome, my team was awesome and I am grateful to Zurich for this training me and promoting me while the business was here in Maryland.Lots of phone calls, ongoing diary and settlement resolution. Best part of job was co-workers. Hardest part of the job was having to review every file with a manager. It was difficult to move up in the company. Looking to move into a higher level position with more exposure was difficultMy company was purchased by Zurich (Farmers Insurance division) so I was not directly hired into it. Overall they managed the call center as any corporation does.Zurich is a very professional and diverse organization. I greatly enjoyed working with various insured's and handling claims fortheir properties. I was recognized many times for my professionalism and abilities and resolving claims."
